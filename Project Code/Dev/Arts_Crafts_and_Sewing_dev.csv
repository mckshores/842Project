"I love the patterns in this book, like having 2 size blocks to choose from and the directions are very easy to read and understand.  I've made 6 blocks so far and very happy with the way they turn out",5.0
Very nice book,5.0
This was what I expected..and more! This book is chock full of ideas as well as patterns- wonderful!,5.0
"Gift for my quilting wife, who absolutely loves it.",5.0
"This book is well worth the money!  The sampler on the cover shows most of the block patterns but there are more.  The possibilities of quilts, table runners, placemats, wall hangings, and potholders are endless as there are so many patterns to choose from.  Lori Holt shows many of those ideas so if you have trouble w/ your imagination, no problem!  This is probably already my favorite quilt investment.",5.0
This book is one of the best quilting books I have ever purchased. It has so many different quilt blocks. Tons of ideas for quilts. You can make a quilt with all different blocks or make a quilt with one particular block. I am very very happy with this book.,5.0
"Screaming with delight!  Based on the cover I thought this would be a sampler quilt (which it is), but it is so much more.  The blocks are available in two sizes...there are other farm quilts in here and a lot of them.  If you are a fan of samplers this is for you.  Want chickens, chicks, tractors, kitchen bowls, cups and more...again this book is for you!",5.0
Great patterns!  Can't wait to get started!,5.0

"Great quilt book.  It has all the blocks in it that are on the front cover.  I'm a farm girl, and this is perfect for me to make a country quilt.",5.0
Love the quilts in this book! I am a beginner quilter and love that there are small projects also. Have made a couple of the potholders and plan to try many more of the other patterns. This is a beautiful book with easy to follow directions.,5.0
I love this pattern book.,5.0
Love the book!,5.0
if you like country quilt this is the book for you,5.0
"I love the style, format and colors for the patterns in this book. I love that each block can be made in a 6"" or 12"" size. The patterns for using the made up blocks are ones I will actually make. I hate getting a book and not liking most of the patterns...this one is 100% LOVE... The spiral format is nice for being able to open to a page and leave it open. After going thru the book, I looked up the author on you tube, Love her simple ways without fancy sewing equipment. Using vintage irons, and graph paper for making new patterns. Great tutorial on making simple boards for your patchwork squares on the go, auditioning fabrics and keeping your pieces in order to bring to the sewing machine. I feel like I found a new cyber friend! I recommend this book and I am a city girl...who is country at heart.",5.0
Love it!,5.0
"Very clearly written, easy to follow directions. Nice color photos, lots of arrangements. Love this book and highly recommend it!",5.0
This book has fantastic directions and is full of inspiration for a huge variety of ways to use the blocks. I predict it will keep me engaged for some time!,5.0
"Fantastic book! Instructions, and many layout ideas",5.0
A VERY amazing quilting book. Love all the patterns doing a sew along with a ladies group extremely pleased with it.,5.0
Such good instructions and pictures great book,5.0
Looks like fun. Can't wait to get started.,5.0
I love this book! Wonderful photos and direction. And I love all the alternate projects in the back. The only thing I wish is if she would have given the total yardage needed for shashing and background for the sampler quilt.,5.0
This is going to be used for my next strip quilt. Can't wait to get started.,5.0
Already made 8 blocks! Great directions; very cute blocks; All pieces fit together as expected;,5.0
"Too little time; too many quilts to make
Great book.  Buy it.  We can always say we are going to do all the blocks.",5.0
"A quilter can't have too many books.. I swore I'd never buy more until I saw this one. Love the fact she has blocks in two sizes and I have to admit, it was the adorable chicken block that sold me. Love the spiral binding. Just fun to look through. Very clear directions, even for this quilter who is marginally ""directionally challenged"". It's got table runners too. fantastic book.",5.0
Can't wait to start on the quilt. Nice spiral bound book!,5.0
Fun patterns. Easy to understand directions. I would not recommend for beginners as some blocks require many pieces and could be a challenge.  Super fun quilts will be made from this book. I love that the blocks come in two sizes as well.,5.0
"Wonderful book! Haven't made anything yet, but pictures and instructions seem great! Collecting fabric...",5.0
"I am new to quilting. Just started in May, 2015. I got a little ambitious and thought I'd try my hand at following the quilt along with Lori Holt through this book. I gotta say, I had a ball making every block in this book, with the exception of 2 of them I haven't made yet. I made the 6 inch blocks, and even for a newbie, they weren't very complicated thanks to the awesome instructions and visuals! It's been 6 months since I started quilting and I gained lots of experience by doing the blocks in this book!  You will not regret purchasing Farm Girl Vintage!!",5.0
"I love traditional and modern quilts and I feel like this book does a great job of combining the two with some new, fun quilt patterns. The directions are easy to follow and clear. As a new quilter I even started out with a harder quilt block (the farmhouse) but was able to successfully construct it. The patterns included in this book make me so happy! I'm inspired to create every time I open it!",5.0
"I love it, yet haven't been able to use it yet, but am so looking forward to making my own version - so many ideas!",5.0
"This is a gift, she picked it out, so it will be perfect.",5.0
Love this book,5.0
"Love the book . A new quilter can easily make a beautiful quilt using this book. Excellent use of fabric. Wil become a favorite of many quilters.
Great book!",5.0
"Our quilt group is going through this book, making each block.  Some of the blocks are very traditional and some are done oddly (the simple star for example.  Who thought up that method of making flying geese?  It works, but it's weird)  My favorites are the chicken blocks and tractors.  There are so many blocks that this book is useful for most traditional quilters. One thing that is great is that most blocks are given in both 6 inch and 12 inch, and the six inch are shown used on barn sides, with the patterns for the barns.  The blocks are shown down in bright colors.  I went for more textured looking fabrics: feather fabrics on the chickens and roof fabric for the roof of the house and barn, and the blocks still look great.",5.0
Love this book.,5.0
Beautiful quilting book with easy to understand instructions. Is one of my favorites as it captures the beloved sights and memories of the life of a farmgirl.,5.0
This is perfect!,5.0
"If  you are a quilter this book is a ""must have."" Worth every penny!!!",5.0
There are enough blocks and projects in this book that you could work for ages and still not be finished with all the possibilities!  Lori Holt is so creative and her quilt blocks are so fun that I don't see this ever becoming boring.  This is a wonderful book.,5.0

"I love this book, and have made a couple blocks from it.  Interesting to read through the book.  I plan on doing a wall hanging from 30's fabric, once I complete the other priorities I am working on.",5.0
"This book is so inspirational. I cannot wait to make all the blocks. I have 3 done so far and many more to come.  A wonderful online community to follow as well, with different ways people mix their fabrics to accomplish the blocks.  Very detailed instructions, pictures, and measurements.  The extra projects are cute as well. LOVE Lori's books.",5.0

Made a small quilt in short order.  Was able to use only my scraps except for the backing.  Lots of variety.,5.0

Love the book.  Did a retreat with the author.  Very easy to understand for a beginner. (which I am,5.0
Lori does it again. Great book.,5.0
"The directions in this book are VERY clear.  There are cutting instructions for 2 sizes of each block.  There are examples of how to combine them into quilts, but the possibilities are endless.  Wonderful photography. I can see possibilities for a modern quilt as well as vintage style quilt.  I am very glad I added this book to my library.",5.0
Love this book! Lots and lots of easy to follow patterns. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who quilts!,5.0
This is a very beautiful and well planned book.  The pages are all bright and beautiful with pictures and instructions.  I love all the ideas for making different kind of quilts using the blocks in addition to the sampler on the front cover.  The spiral binding allows the book to lay flat for when you want to make the blocks.  Lori's story about being raised on a farm is very inspiring.,5.0
"One of the best values in quilt books that I have purchased to date.  The forward in charming, the patterns and instructions are very clear and easy to follow. I also love the variety of projects Lori lists in the back of the book.  The spiral binding is a dream! I would definitely recommend this book.",5.0
Beautiful book...,5.0
"Love the book , lots of quilts possible !",5.0
"Wow!  just WOW!  You will want to do EVERY project in this book.  And there are a TON.  Possibilities endless.  Her instructions are very clear and very generous.  Often times patterns and books just give you the minimal amount of information.  I appreciate all the different combinations for making an endless list of quilts and projects.  SOOOOO worth the money.  If I had to choose just ONE book of my bazillion to keep, this would be the one.  Great for beginners, experienced, busy, not so busy, everyone!  My quilting IQ just went up  a bit after having gone through this book today!

side note:  I wish it were a hard cover spiral binding...I was a little let down that it was just a thin cardboard style cover over the spiral.",5.0
So many cute ideas!  Can't wait to get busy!!,5.0
I absolutely love this book.  The block difficulties vary from quick and easy to takes some time but doable and they are all worth it.  I can't wait to dive in and start my own doing.  Quilt block combination ideas are given to get the more novice quilter started but really they all will work together with the right fabric choices.  Thank You Lori!,5.0
Great Book!!!!!!!,5.0
Prompt delivery of the product exactly as described = happy customer! Thank you!,5.0
"All of the blocks in this quilt are fun and fairly easy to make.  I love using the 30's reproductions as Lori Holt did.  The stories about the blocks and the extra projects in the book make it well worth the price.  Having lived on a farm for many years, these quilt blocks are reminiscent of those years. A spiral binding on a quilt pattern book is fabulous as the book lies flat while you are following a pattern.",5.0
I love this book!  It has so many fun patterns...you just want to try them all.  I love the photography and the instructions are written very well.  I love how the book lays open flat because of the spiral back. Lori Holt's patterns are just very fun!,5.0

Great book shipped right on time thank you,5.0
Love it!!,5.0
I love the patterns in this book and all the different ideas she suggests as well. Takes you through each block step by step with illustrations and even which direction to press the seams.,5.0
This book is probably the most versatile quilting book that I own and I'm so glad that I bit the bullet and decided to buy it at full price.  There' a myriad of projects to be made from these blocks and that makes it totally worth the price!,5.0
"What a fun book!  The patterns are really cute---2 sizes, 6 inch and 12.  Good cutting directions, so even the Kindle version would be useable.  I like the ""hard copy,"" though, with it's spiral binding.  So many quilt possibilities here, I can't decide where to start:  the 12 inch barns with 6 inch quilt blocks in them, or a sampler quilt with all the blocks or a block of stars?  (I love stars!) ...or ???  So many choices, but a delighted dilemma.",5.0
"Love it, can't wait to make it.",5.0
"Wonderful book, can't wait to get started using the patterns.",5.0

I love this find. I have kept one for my other children and they have stopped making them the way they did when they were younger.  I'm excited each time I open it to add to my daughters future memory book.  So well put together.  Would make a great gift for a first time Mom as this is simply not something people think about until the memories are long forgotten.,5.0
A absolutely love this. I am planning on keeping track of my daughters school years and this is exactly what I was looking for. I love the folders to save her best artwork and school papers.,5.0
This school book is so adorable and so girly! My daughter was so excited when we got it. She has so much fun filling out the little questions and adding pictures and special school work to it. It will be a fun project for the 2 of us for years to come,5.0

"I bought this memory book for my younger daughter as my oldest had one and I couldn't find the same book.  I found this book on Amazon reasonably priced for what you get!  The pages are really cute and girly.  There is a page for preschool all the way through 12th grade, with room for pictures and ample pockets for memories or samples of work.",5.0

"Love it! All 3 of my boys have there's so when I was looking for my daughter's last year, I was disappointed. No fundraiser had one, no stores. A different seller had one posted for $997!?!? I checked again once school started and found this one. She was thrilled when it arrived! It's preschool thru 12th grade, the pages open as pockets to store papers and projects. Guided questions for her to fill out but also blank areas for her to draw or write.",5.0
This is awesome my girls both have one and love it. My 19 year old is jealous that she does not have one.,5.0
"I have the baby book version of this as well and I love it! It's a very compact way to organize photos, keepsakes, and milestones! And, nice-sized pockets hold extra photos and papers.",5.0

Love this! Cute and practical for organizing your keepsakes.,5.0
"These books are great.  The size was perfect, so plenty of items will fit throughout the years.  The amount of space is greater for the younger years and less for the older years, which is also fitting.  Very pleased!",5.0
beautiful book,5.0
"Was looking for a book/binder to write memories/attach photos for my daughters school years, just like I had when I was a kid. This is one perfectly girlie, well made, and even glittery on the front, with wonderful decorations throughout, questions for the little ones to answer to keep all those adorable thoughts and dreams written in one place! Will be ordered another one for my youngest daughter!",5.0
Both my daughter I in-laws loved this as a birthday gift.  Granddaughters are 5 and 7.,5.0
Very happy with the quality and details put into this book.  :),5.0
"This memory book is very nice and extremely thick. It is spiral bound, and the covers are strong. Every page is a pocket, which makes storing more than one or two pieces of artwork much easier. There are several pages for each grade until high school. The pictures in the book are girly but not over the top. It is large enough to fit a normal piece of paper into the folder without folding which was a big part of why I chose this one. I also like that it has pages for preschool, which is fun to keep artwork from that age. Overall, for the price, I was extremely impressed with this book, it will definitely make it through our daughters school years and keep everything organized!",5.0

I love the fact it has several pages for pre-k.  I also love on the cover you can add pictures of each year.  Extremely happy customer.  Recommend this book to everyone with my eyes closed.",5.0
this is perfect for anyone with a little girl! I am using the intro page to glue on her preschool pictures as well! LOVE IT! Also- mine didn't have any pictures of children in it- I saw that mentioned in one review. Just cartoon animals and hearts.,5.0
"Great memory album for school work.  Plenty of space provided for storing small art work, pictures, report cards and spaces to provide information on likes and dislikes each year.",5.0
"Loved it, very cute!!",5.0
Exactly what I was looking for. There is even a spot for the class pictures! There are four pages for each grade up to 8th grade and one page per grade in high school. My daughter won't start school for another 3 years but I bought the red one for my son and was so happy with it I couldn't risk them not having anymore when that time comes!,5.0
Wonderful quality book for keeping all of your schoolyears in order,5.0

Very cute. Super girly. Lots of pages to put pictures and pockets for awards and artwork.,5.0
I love this book. It is adorable. Maybe not ideal for once your daughter is in middle school and high school because it is very pink and little girlie looking. Every page is pocketed so you can put things in for storage. I bought one for each of my girls.,5.0
Great way to keep up with my daughters school stuff,5.0
A gift for my granddaughter and she loved it!,5.0

The book is just beauiful & my granddaughter is going to love it. Pink is her favorite color and this book is a pretty pink!!,5.0
Gave to my 9 yr old granddaughter who will be in 4th grade to start saving info.  She loved it and can put memories in it while she remembers kinder thru 3rd. Would recommend. Great gift.,5.0
This book is even prettier in person than it looks here. The price is well worth it and my great granddaughter loved it!,5.0
"Bought this for my 5 year old great niece for school year keepsakes, she immediately went through looking at the pages and asking what each said. She is excited about filling it up as she grows!",5.0
Lovely!! Can't wait to fill it with memories. Lots of pockets for the younger years. Looks sturdy but very pretty.,5.0

"This is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted some way to keep track of special items and pictures for my girls during school. I also liked that this included several pages for Preschool, instead of just starting at Kindergarten. Very nicely made.",5.0
"great book, very cute and my daughter loves it. thank you. yeah! ok, see ya later alligator. bye bye bye",5.0
"Love this memory keeper.  I have the previous version for my older child and this one seems much more practical.  Same amount of pockets, just better memory prompts as you might call them for each grade.  Love all the pockets for memories and mementos.",5.0
"I bought 2 of these for my girls. I love them.

First, another reader noted that this memory book was not good for children of color because it was filled with pics of all caucasian looking children. Either the manufacturer changed the illustrations in the book or the reviewer was confused. The edition I have has NO pics of children or any living thing except a few scattered cute illustrations of cats.

Based on the photo slots on the cover you may think this book goes from K to 12, but the first few pages, to my delight, are dedicated to pre-K.

Every grade from pre-K to 7th grade has 2 pages (which is 2 pockets for papers/artwork) and 1 page to attach a pic/paper/etc.

Grades 8/9 and 10/11 get 1 page each which forms a pocket for those grades to share. Grade 12 gets 2 pages and its own pocket.

It's pink, girly, has plenty of pockets and space/fill-ins for information and I'm very pleased with this purchase.

I also posted some pics.",5.0
"this is just what i needed for my niece, she loves it. this is the second one i bought. great gift idea!",5.0
"I couldn't decide between this and a similar one in aqua, so I bought both.  This one is the ""Deluxe"" but I couldn't see a lot of difference.  However, I did think this was the cuter of the 2 for my girly-girl.  I love that you can put pictures in the cover, that the pockets hold a lot of stuff for each grade, and that the book is meant for the kids to contribute to, even at a young age (mine is in 1st grade).  Anyway, I love it, my daughter loves it, and we are having so much fun filling it out!",5.0
I love love love this book and will be getting another when my youngest daughter starts preschool!  I immediately started filling out pages and my oldest is only in 3yr old preschool!  I love the pockets in EVERY page!,5.0
I had a school years memory book growing up and I still like looking at it.  It was no where near as beautiful and fun as this one.  very complete - LOVE it!!,5.0
"Love this book.  Lots of room for stuff and very cute.  My 6 yr old loves it and there is space for pics,  artwork, her writing, etc.  Good purchase.",5.0
Just like the description. My daughter loves it! Would have been nice to have 2 pages each for the later years though.,5.0
"Great product, highly recommend. Great price and I got it on time. I love the pockets it has and a spot to write and place pictures from pre-k to 12th grade. I already filled out and added for pre-k and I look forward to pulling it out every year to fill it out.",5.0
"This was the first book I bought about quilts and I found the patterns really easy to make.
You can finish a wonderful quilt for baby in just a few hours.  It shows you how to cut and sew them, step by step, all the  materials you will need are listed in the fist pages, explains many things  about fabrics and color combinations for perfect results.
I made quilts  for my little queens, my dogs, and they LOVE sleeping there!",5.0
"If you need a great baby shower gift in a hurry, this is the book for you.  These quilts are quick, cute and easy.  Attractive novelty fabric is a must and the patterns are not brand new, but they are fun.  This is a great  book for your quilting library.",5.0
Great collection of easy and quick quilts to make for baby.,5.0
Some cute quilts in there,5.0
"Can't wait to get started making the quilts in this book, one down.....",5.0

"I bought this book when I first started quilting about 2000.  It was my ""go to"" book for a long time. I have made the quilts in this book over and over for dozens of people.  The patterns are very simple and good for beginning quilters.",5.0
I like to help my friends get started on their first quilt endeavors and this has become the favorite book to go to. I have several quilt  books however this always seems to be the book they choose for their first quilt. It has quite a few pretty patterns with a few fabric choices for each one. There is a list of supplies and fabrics needed at the beginning of each pattern and the instructions are easy to follow as well.,5.0
"I love this baby quilt book.  I have used it for years; so much I lost/misplace my 1st and bought a 2nd.

My favorite gift to give somebody expecting is a quilt to go with their nursery, this book handles every aspect of simple easy to be made tops in a day!  I have made from cutting to quilting and binding one of these in just 10 hours.  And the response to the person receiving is the best feeling in itself!

You will not be sorry if you are a beginner and just getting the hang of sewing the instrucstions are very detailed and explained very clearly.  I would consider myself an exper sewer and still enjoy it.  I make my own patterns and create a lot of quilts that way but this is easy peasy!

Enjoy!",5.0

"This book is not just for baby quilts----it provides an excellent view of how changing colors affects design.  I bought this book after seening it at a friend's, because its color photos provide incentives and a great source of previewing how to mix colors on one design to get very different and wonderful results.  Highly recommend.",5.0
"Easy instructions for cute, fast and easy quilts.  Great for a beginner or someone who has been quilting a while.  I would recommend this product.",5.0
"I love this book!  I haven't made anything from it yet, but I'm working up to it, by reading and perusing this book and others.  The quilts seem easy enough for a beginner, yet very interesting.  I love the fact that each quilt has two color options: bright or pastel.  I can't wait to get started!  I recommend this author and this book.",5.0
My wife used this book to make so many quilts it finally fell apart.  Great easy to use patterns she uses again and again.,5.0
"It is a nice book ... I don't make very many baby quilts ... but the few I do, I like this book because it is very simple.",5.0
"The quilts in here are beautiful. They are also pretty simple to make. The patterns can be done quickly and I'm a beginner quilter. Like other people mentioned, the pictures are very helpful in selecting fabric and they're big and glossy so it's easy to see what the quilt will turn out like. This is by far the best of the Quilts for Baby books that Ursula has published. I can't wait till she puts out another one.",5.0
I found that this collection of baby quilts offers the best options for simple quick quilts. I have always returned to this book everytime I make a baby quilt even though I have others to reference.,5.0
Book came on time and in good condition.  I'd buy from this seller again.,5.0
"I borrowed this book from the library twice in a row, and am finally buying one for myself.  Most of my books only get used once or twice, but I've made 5 of the projects from this book and don't see an end in sight.  Awesome presentation (fun to read and browse through) and good value (very versatile).",5.0
I love this book and have already made a baby quilt from it.  The instructions were great and easy to follow and the project did not take a long time.,5.0
"One of my most used quilting  books. I have made many of  the quilts and all the patterns were easy to follow. A first time quilter will find this book extremely helpful but all quilters will enjoy making these quick, easy quilts because they are perfect for baby quilts, beautiful as gifts and easy to enlarge.",5.0

"I got this as a gift for my daughter's baby shower and was so excited to use it. The directions say it's for infant to 12 year olds. That's a lie. My 14 month old lasted for 2 seconds with her hand in the goop before it was all over her legs, clothes and kitchen counter. I don't know of any child under 4 who can keep his/her hands perfectly still for a full minute. Do not waste your money on this!",1.0
"I think that in trying to make this kit cheaply, the manufacturer has made it almost impossible to get a good finished product.  I'm a teacher, and I'm familiar with doing crafts with kids.  It's taken three tries for me to get this thing done with a very patient and willing 6-year-old. Right not I'm waiting with baited breath to see whether or not the plaster came out too thin.  Extremely frustrating!!!",1.0
I purchased this mold kit in the store. I followed the directions and the gel set up before I even poured it into the mold. I contacted the company and NO RESPONSE. Now I have the plaster and no way to make the handprint. The last thing a company should do these days is ignore a customer's complaint. I guess I'll have to find something else to mold my daughter's hand and try the plaster like that.,1.0
"I tried to make a hand print with my 2 and a half year old.  What a disappointment!  The instructions say to keep the child's hand still in the gel for a minute until it sets up.  I don't know any toddler who can keep their hand still for 60 seconds.  Plus, do not touch the bottom of the pan.  The gel is < 1/2 inch thick, so it is almost impossible for a toddler not to push all the way through.  Needless to say the hand print was a disaster.",1.0
"The Colorbok 158721 Precious Hands Plaster Molding Kit (which is not what is currently pictured on this product page) was unusable. The cup that came with the kit was crushed, so I used an equivalent amount of water as directed. The gel was obviously too thin as it was supposed to just be in the middle of the mold but it was so runny it ran to the edge immediately. My daughter could not put her hand into the gel and not touch the bottom as instructed because it was so thin. She kept her hand in the gel for 10 minutes and it did not set up right so when she pulled her hand out, it just turned into a goopy mess. The color of the gel mixture was green instead of white. This stuff is plain awful.",1.0
"I have done two of these same brand kits in the past with my older child and they worked really well.  Like other reviewers have stated, something changed in the gel mix and now it doesn't work at all.  After reading the reviews, I thought I'd still risk purchasing it and that maybe people just weren't following the directions.  I followed them to the letter - exactly 6 ounces room temperature water added to the gel mix and it turns into a foamy pancake batter consistency, but doesn't set up AT ALL.  Even tried having my child sit for longer than the 1 minute and then blow-drying lightly on low temp to no avail.  The kit gel is nothing like it used to be when I did it with my older child a few years ago.  Buyer beware - not worth the money or effort.",1.0
Wish I read the reviews that this does not work....it doesn't.  The first step doesn't set up. I then made some play dough and made an imprint in that and then filled in the rest with the plaster.,1.0
"Bought this product 5 times in the past for making molds of kids hands and it was perfect, this time, and this is the second in two weeks the gel never set up and when I removed my kids hand it just turned to mush. Can't even say if the plaster works or not. I even bought a new kit on Monday (today is Wednesday) to see if it was just a bad batch, it wasn't same thing happened. I even tried different temp of water for gel.",1.0
"Wast of money! I've used kits like this before and they actually worked. I followed the directions for both kits and still didn't work.

The 3D gel never set up! After 10 minutes I threw the kit away, went to the next kit I bought tried using less water than was instructed and the gel again never set up!",1.0
Product never setup just as many others have stated in their review. After an hour the mixture is still like pancake battery.,1.0
"I have used this product many times and was pleased and the outcome are some of my most prized possessions, so what happened to the quality of this product?? I'm so NOT impressed!",1.0
"Do Not Purchase!!  Precious Hands Plaster Molding kit has apparently changed the gel used to make the initial hand mold.  New gel mix does NOT work.  This would have been my 8th year making a hand print of my daughter, however new mix would not solidify enough do make the actual mold.  Mold fell apart and was unusable.  Not sure why they ruined a good product.",1.0
Directions said add water but it didn't say how much. i added a little at a time and it looked fine in the package but when we poured it At first it was too thin so we let it set and then it just crumbled. Very disappointed.,1.0
Used to be a great product. Have done these before and it worked great. This time the gel took several minutes to set (supposed to be 45 seconds) and when the child removed hand the gel stuck all over the hand and destroyed the mold. Waste of money.,1.0
"This is my second kit.  The first kit (same Precious Hands brand) worked fantastically for us a few years ago - it's still hanging on the wall.  I have followed the instructions and know how it works.

This time, it didn't work.  This second try, a few years later, was awful.  It didn't gel up.  At all.  I don't know if they changed the mix or ratio, but this was a waste of money, and I wasn't even sure how to return the mess of goo that never did dry even after a day.  Something is wrong with this, so use due caution if you purchase it.",1.0
I love this...when it finally works. I used this on several children and you would have thought I bought stock in the company with how many extra I had to buy to get the gel to work. I always followed the instructions carefully. I do not know what I am doing wrong but am very frustrated with the gel in this product.,1.0
Beyond bummed. I used this same product 9 years ago for my oldest. But come this year i bought it for my youngest...the gel mold never set...ever. I followed the directions to a T and i was really bummed when it didn't work.,1.0
"This is our second one. The first went great, this one was a nightmare. After carefully measuring the water the gel would not harden. What a disappointment. The 3 year old cooperated well holding still for over 3 minutes. Even then there were elevated spots where the gel was still sticky. Big disappointment. Have no idea what happened maybe the company changed formulas to increase profitability. We will not buy any more of the Webster products. Have to voice our displeasure. With our wallet",1.0
"Don't waste your time. Didn't even get to the plaster part. Followed directions and gel didn't work. Lumpy, thin and runny, took several minutes to set. Horrible.",1.0
"Do NOT buy! I bought this at Hobby Lobby as a gift, watched the YouTube video on how to make it, and followed the instructions exactly. The gel did not keep my 2 year old daughter's handprint at all despite her holding very still until it was ""rubbery"" as the video said. Wasted time, effort, and money.",1.0
"cat lady.... it's amazing that you think because you succeeded with your pets, that ALL the MANY people who couldn't make it work, must be inept. I also followed the instructions carefully and it was also a complete fail. you shouldn't insult people's intelligence - sometimes there is truth in the mass responses.....  i would tell anyone interested in this product that you have a 10% chance it might work. MORE THAN LiKELY it WONT.",1.0
"I followed the directions exactly for the 3D gel.  Well, we never got to the plaster part, because the gel took over 8 minutes to harden.  It was too thin and filled the entire heart instead of just a small puddle, and my son held his hand in the gel for well over 45 seconds (a serious struggle for a 3.5 year old, but he did and was very still).  Gel finally started hardening a little around 8 minutes, so I tried it and it took my hand print ... but not nearly as nicely as in the picture ... probably because it took so long to begin firming up.  Saved the plaster, so maybe we'll try again.  But the gel definitely did not work as advertised.",1.0
"Got this to make a Mother's Day gift of my daughter's hand print for my mother and it didn't even work! I followed all the directions to a T and when I went to gently remove the dried plaster from the heart shaped tray, the entire thing crumbled in my hands like cake! I ended up just throwing it away! My time and money wasted!

You have to mix the gel in a bowl and you only have, they claim, 1 1/2 minutes before it gets firm around the child's hand, but it got hard a lot faster than that. Also, if you make a mistake or the child moves his or her hand, you can't redo it. Luckily, my daughter cooperated and we did get a decent print the first time...not that it mattered because the whole thing fell apart anyway. For $15 this is a complete waste of money. After the epic fail that is this kit, I found another kit&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clay-Handprint-Footprint-Keepsake-Photo-Wall-Frame-Black/dp/B002PAV6T2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clay Handprint & Footprint Keepsake Photo Wall Frame - Black</a>&nbsp;that was amazing! This kit required no mixing and was clay so if you made a mistake you can redo it. For $10 extra, this is a WAY better product and I'd recommend this one instead!",1.0
"We have two of these kits.  Unfortunately we never made it past the gel part.  First time my son squeezed his hands and the gel hardened.  Second one our 2 week olds feet didn't go deep enough because the gel spread out too thinly on the plastic heart.  Disappointing.  Great idea but poor gel.

If the company reads this post.  Raise the price by a dollar or two and add a second or even a third gel packet. Maybe even develop a clay that we could mold our children's prints into.",1.0
This product is very hard. I have twins that are 14 now and I did this with them but it took several kits. Now I have a two year old and I have had to buy 3 kits so far and no success. I will try a few mor times because I would like one for all three girls. It would be helpfull if they sold the gel separately.,1.0
"I bought this product as a gift for my in-laws since we do not have much money this year I figured it'd be a nice gift. I Read the instructions and it had a hint that if it is an infant or toddler, to do it while they're sleeping. Well my daughter is 2 and not very patient so I mixed the gel and stuck her hand in while she was asleep. The instructions say it will harder within 1- 1 1/2 minutes. I was standing there with her hand in the gel for WELL over 2 minutes. The gel would not harden. I finally got frustrated and took her hand out and the gel was still runny and was all stuck to her hand. The whole project was ruined and ended up throwing everything in the trash. This product is nothing but frustration and I wasted ten bucks, now have to think of a new idea for a gift. THANKS!",1.0
"We got this gift for her birthday & I'm ashamed to tell my friend that it was a flop. My daughter ia  well behaved child..sits through projects & is crafty. This gel mess was just that.... A big mess the mold suck to get hand....& was A waste of a bday present. We have made plenty of molds & this brand compares none!!!.. I will have to go out & buy stuff to make mold...my friend had great intentions,..the product- didn't! I want my gel replaced!",1.0
"Very difficult to achieve the mold, and then the plaster didn't fill in all areas, so i'm left with a partial, useless handprint. Complete waste of time and money.",1.0
This product is absolutely worthless.  I tried it on my six year old and four year old grandsons.  Even though I followed the instructions explicitly the plaster was too runny the first time and a thick glob the second time.  A total waste of time and money.,1.0
"After the fourth attempt and still no success, this product is absolutely terrible.  As other reviews have stated, if your child can not sit patiently with his/her hand/foot in in mold, then this will be a waste.  It took over a minute for the mold to dry... little toddlers and babies cannot sit still.  While they are sleeping?  Are they serious?  My 21 month old is a light sleeper, as soon as I picked up her hand she new!  What a incredible waste of time and money!!!",1.0
"Would NOT recommend this product. I recieved mine from a friend who couldn't quite figure it out. I got it, and it constantly skips stitches. Tried singer serger needles, which made the problem worse. Took it into a repair shop, and still does not work. Then, there is the tension issue. No setting seems to be right.",1.0
"I purchased this serger 2 years ago ... big mistake! The price was great and it was sewing just fine in the beginning. I changed it to 1 needle instead of 2 needles and it lost tension. No matter what I did, follow the manual, change the tension, put back the second needle it was getting worse. The only way I could use this serger it was actually on rolled hem but that didn't last for too long!!!
Really Do Not Buy it. I'm not a beginner .... I bough it to make my clothing line!!! I can't use it anymore because of the loose tension. I had it for about 2 years now and Useless!!!! I'm looking for a better one right now :)",1.0
"I bought this machine for $218 (that's with tax) at Walmart. I was super excited to start making some clothes for my 1 month old daughter. Every chance I got to work on this machine (wasn't very often) I was fighting with the tension. I did absolutely everything!!! (A great video on YouTube is ""taming your server"" watch that) After two weeks I decided to take it back. My boyfriend asked why I didn't let him try to figure it out. I said ""if I pay that much for something I better be able to figure it out on my own....it shouldn't be that hard"". And yes I did read ALL of the manual. This machine did NOT work for me....I would rate it lower than a 1 star if I could. I'm looking into the brother 1034d.",1.0
"build quality not so good... ive tried using this thing one more than one occasion, and the thread kept breaking no matter what i did..",1.0
"First off, I usually don't do online reviews but this machine has frustrated me so badly that I really felt the need to warn others. I have been sewing for a few years now and have become pretty good at it. This was my first serger and I was so excited to use it. The threading of the machine was not hard but I am here to tell you....that is the most and ONLY positive thing I can say. The tension settings on this stupid thing are so hard to get right. I messed with the tension for two days straight and after going thru a huge pile of scrap fabric, I decided to sell this thing and get me a brother. It is about the same price so I would definitely consider the brother over this piece of garbage. the thread was also constantly breaking in mid-project and would get tangled up. I was repeatedly unthreading and rethreading it. I thought maybe it was me but after reading the manual front and back along with several you tube videos....I am convinced it is the machine.",1.0
I have been sewing on a 20 year old Brother serger that broke in the middle of a project. I ran to Walmart and bought this Singer off the shelf out of desperation. At first I was impressed because it was really easy to thread - way quicker than my old Brother. The stitch looked nice but I was immediately concerned about the squeaky noises all the moving parts were making. It sounded very cheap. Then after about 20 minutes of sewing I heard a loud CLUNK and see that my right needle thread has broken. I try re-threading and it breaks again...I look inside to investigate and see the needles are scraping against the lower looper arm - which means that it had somehow gotten bent in the few minutes I had been using it. I looked at the loopers and the metal looked so thin I think I could have bent it with my finger. I will be taking this back to Walmart tomorrow for a refund. I am going to buy the Brother 1034D - it is comparable in price and has way better reviews.,1.0
"I purchased this model from Joanns 3 days ago. I have had years of experience with a 5-thread serger, so I know how a serger is supposed to work.  The swatch of material under the needle showed a perfect 4-thread stitch when it was set up, (right out of the box)and I attempted to stitch on the same swatch of material.  It was a mess.  After investing about 18 hours in trying to get this machine to sew (I had resorted to trying only 2 threads utilizing the spreader)I contacted Singer and was given various ""tips"" to try as the tension would not hold for over 10 stitches, then would loop-de-loop for a few stitches, and go back to serging properly for only a few stitches.  I was told it was a problem with the tension holding (yes, I knew that) and since it was under warranty I could take it to one of 2 dealers in the State, each dealer located approximately 2-1/2 hours away.

It is easy to thread, yes, but the light is a big problem.  It is an LED light and only if there is no other light source you can see to sew with it. Unless you sew in the dark, consider a different purchase.

After reading the reviews (which I wish I had done before purchasing this serger) I ordered a Brother1034D from Amazon.  I've used only Singer machines for the past 40 years, but after this experience I doubt I'll swear by the Singer Brand again.",1.0
"Bought this at Walmart thinking that being a Singer it should be a decent machine.  After a few days, thread got all tangled up inside which I can understand can happen. Problem is that the threading directions and pictures in the manual are so lame, and the color coding is a joke, so it was impossible to get it re-threaded.  Funny thing is it says right on the box that it is color coded for foolproof threading!  There is no color coding on the more detailed pathways the thread must take. I have been a dentist for 27 years and am used to detailed work (machine is for my daughter), but there is no way anyone can thread this machine using only the directions provided.  The manual does not even show enough detail to see where the thread is going.  I could not find any other directions online.  Very disappointed in Singer's lack of regard for the consumer.  Returned to Walmart and told manager to pull it from the shelves.",1.0
"I purchased this machine thinking it would live up to the Singer Name, (even purchased a gathering foot, which by the way no attachements come with this machine,) boy was I wrong, the first time I used a different setting on the tension for gathering it never worked right again, no matter how it was set. I contacted support and they told me that it could be due to using different brands of thread, or setting the tension differently, anyway I got the run around. I have been a professional seamstress for over 30 years and know how to set tension and know about quality thread. They also told me to get it corrected I would have to send it to a repair shop, keep in mind that this machine was less than three weeks old! It worked a total of about one week. So I boxed it up and returned it to Wal-Mart and ordered a EZ Lock and it is working beautifully! and guess what, you can use different brands of thread.",1.0
"I have been sewing most of my 56 years - started out standing at my mother's treadle machine before I ever started to school. I have had plenty of experience with both sewing and serging machines. I have been a loyal Singer user because I was always satisfied with the ease of use, and the value for the dollar...until I met this serger. I purchased it online through Amazon. I spend many more hours threading and rethreading this machine than I do sewing with it. Even tying on a new color of thread and pulling it through does not work with this machine. Every color change of thread, I spend at least an hour trying to get all the spools to work together. The thread breaks constantly, and I cannot count the number of broken or bent needles I have had sewing nothing heavier than cotton quilting squares. I kept thinking I had to be doing something wrong, but according to the manual and DVD the machine was set up correctly. Do not depend on the manual or DVD to explain how to set the tensions though - nowhere does it tell you the difference in the needle tension controls and the differential feed tension. That is all guess work.

After dealing with this nightmare for a year now...I am ready to simply throw it in the trash and find a better serger. Singer lost a long time customer with this piece of junk. I could not even attempt to regain any of my costs by selling it somewhere like eBay because my conscious would not allow me to pass this machine along to another innocent user.

Steer clear of this serger, it is not worth the price no matter how good the value seems.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Singer-14SH6540-Differential-Feed-Serger-Sewing-Machine/dp/B00005NWQR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Singer 14SH6540 Differential Feed Serger Sewing Machine</a>",1.0
"I bought this machine from Joann's and it wouldn't sew a tight stitch at ALL.  The seam would pull apart, revealing about 1/2 inch of thread (on the OUTSIDE of the garmet).  I played with the tension for hours but it didn't do any good.

On top of that, the light bulb started flickering about 30 minutes into sewing (no, not sewing. . . ""trying"" to sew).  Eventually the light just went out.  If you tapped the side of the machine where the light is, it would flicker on for a split second before going out again.

So, I took the machine back for an exchange.  This one actually sews quite well. . . but the light went out after about 30 minutes.  What's worse is that the manual says NOTHING about how to replace the light.  I unscrewed the casing where the bulb is, but the bulb appears to be BUILT INTO the machine.  It's not like any bulb on a sewing machine that I've ever seen!

I wrote Singer an email, asking how I'm supposed to change the light. . . waiting on a reply.  I'd stay away from this machine for a while.  I've a feeling they're going to be put on recall soon.",1.0
"i ordered this exact serger through ebay, the bulb was busted and it didn't sew very well no matter how much i tried to work with the tensions.  the seller was great and sent me a new one right away, the exact model.  the serging is ok right out of the box, but if you change the threads and have to adjust the tension, forget it.  the serging is terrible.  i think the tensions in these machines are not very good quality, honestly, i don't know what its problem is.  it's become very frustrating working on it for hours, reading and rereading the instruction manuel, and threading and rethreading.  well, i'm on my way to the sewing repair shop!",1.0
"I have been using a similar priced brother serger for years and when it broke I couldn't find it in my town so i purchased this singer machine.

I am returning it tomorrow.

i am rather good at threading sergers and have used many other models besides my own with no dificulties (its still a pain though).  but this machine makes it as dificult as possible.

the #1 & #2 threads go through these loops that they seem to come out of pretty easily while the machine is in use.

the #3 & #4 thread that go through the needles could not be harder to thread.  the machine has an arm that sticks out just to the right of the needles (it is for the cutting blade i believe) which makes it nearly impossible to thread with your right hand.  and even while threading with your left the arm blocks most of your view.  making this very dificult.

the tension dials already began slipping from the factory setting after no more then 10 min of use and had to constently be adjusted to keep them at the right tension.

i did like how the threading instructions were very well marked on the machine (although a very important part for thread #2 was left off the drawing which makes it inoperable without this one instruction which you do find in the manual).  i also liked how the tension was clearly marked on the machine.  but after 10 min of use those settings were already wrong.

the machine itself does not feel as quality as the similar Brother 1034D model.  at first i thought the threading looked easier but after threading it several times it in fact is much more time consumming and much more dificult.  the machine also sergers at a slightly slower pace.

i am very disapointed with this machine and will be returning it and ordering the Brother 1034D instead.  that seems to me to be the best machine for the cost (although once the coil inside stretches it is not repairable (says the guy at the repair shop).  although i had the same machine for 4 years and i used it on a daily basis for my evening business.  so it got lots of use.  after the 1st year i had to baby the tension but it still worked!).",1.0
"I bought this item at Walmart for $229 and was excited to begin sewing my first project.  That was a huge mistake.  The thread kept popping out of the tension on #3 no matter what I did.  I tried tightening it several times, went back to directions repeatedly looking for what I could have done wrong, though everything appeared to have been done correctly.  To finish the initial project I was sewing I ended up having to hold thread #3 by hand to create the right tension to finish sewing.  Thank goodness for dexterity!  The other major problem I had was the machine jumped around a lot on my sewing table as it sewed.  It didn't weigh enough to hold it in place, nor were there any suction cups on the bottom to keep it stable.  I ended up having to chase the machine down while I was holding thread #3!  I'm sure it all looked quite comical, but it was WAY too much of a hassle for me.  I returned the item to Walmart, got my money back and went to a local sewing shop and found a Janome serger that didn't cost too much more.  The Janome threads beautifully with perfect tension and has little suction feet to hold the machine in place while sewing.  Going from the Singer to the Janome in the same day made it very clear to me what a cheap piece of junk the Singer is.  As a side note, I asked the repairman at the sewing shop about the Singer and he says he won't carry them anymore because they break too often.  3 Months later and I haven't had a single problem with my Janome!",1.0

This is a cheap case and a total waste of money.  Basically a big plastic box with a handle.  The machine bounces around inside.,1.0

"My husband bought this sewing machine for me for Christmas.  I was very excited to receive it.  The first time I got it out to use it, it jammed, the thread tangled, the needle bent, and the zig-zag stich would not work.  Eventually I discovered the pattern module was in wrong from the factory, which caused the zig-zag stich not to work.  I also realized that the reason it was jamming was that the thread was catching on the broken bobbin holder.  My husband and I brought the machine to a professional repair shop to have them look at it, and the owner said that the bobbin holder was not lubricated, and one of the parts was assembled incorrectly.  He recomended that we return it.  We followed his advise, and since we pay close attention to the reviews that other people give on these sights, decided to warn everyone else about how severely dissapointing this machine is.  In general, this machine is poorly made, the instruction manual is useless, and we expected much better from a Singer.",1.0
"We saw this advertised, and thought ""Wow, what a deal...""

First machine we received?  Timing was off, would NOT sew-- threads would not lock together---- so we returned it.

Second machine we received?

Halfway thru a seam, the presser foot stopped advancing, stitch length got really small, and fabric kept puckering.

In both cases, we spent time on the phone with Simplicity representatives, who eventually said that our machines had to be defective, as they had ""no idea"" why it wasn't working.

I'm glad other people have had pleasant experiences...

We're going to return the second one, and take a look at other makes/models.  This has left a bad taste in our mouth.",1.0
I bought this for my daughter based on the many good reviews. But when I received it I was disappointed in how cheap the plastic was. Some parts were just waiting to break! I didn't have to even try it before I shipped it back. Not even the free patterns and free shipping (which I lost for returning it anyways) could convince me. I spent a little more money and bought a Janome. You get what you pay for most of the time!,1.0

"I have owned a portable top-of-the line Singer sewing machine for 35 years and loved it.  When it broke, I of course wanted another Singer.  I have been greatly disappointed in this model.  It doesn't have the ""solid' feel of my other one.  Everything is plastic and the light weightness of it made it feel cheap.  The light did not illumine the entire sewing area and the large neck made it difficult to locate and lift the presser foot.  But what caused me to return it is that it did not sew consistently.  I sewed an item with it and it worked okay.  Then I changed thread, and the bobbin thread would not pick up and I found the enclosed pamphlet stating that this machine required concise threading to work right.  After a frustrating time of trying to find the ""right"" way to thread it again, it finally worked.  When I changed the thread the next time,  the same thing occurred and I had threaded it exactly according to how I had threaded it when it worked.  Talk about a frustrating day!  It works and then it doesn't.  It might be a defective machine, but if this is typical of the ease of using it, I don't want to deal with it and will get something else.",1.0
"Can't believe Singer would put their name on this machine!  Plastic pieces galore, all too easy to break.  The noise alone requires ear plugs!  After reading the reviews, obviously unexperienced with quality sewing machines, I thought I was getting a gem.  Turned out to be a piece of dung.  Now I have to pay a hefty return fee.  Don't buy this product!!!",1.0
"Well, in the beginning it must have been ""dumb luck"", because, after a few successful hemming tries, I recently tried simple repair to seams, straight stitching, and the bobbin is jamming up the works.  I cannot seem to adjust the bobbin tension to the slight change in fabric and the insturctions are no help.  After hours and hours of trial and error, I have given up.  My 30 year old singer sewed rings around this one for ease of use. I caution you, prepare to spend a lot of time learning how to  adjust this machine's numerous dials from one project to another. -- And the instructions and video are no help for simple sewing --",1.0
"This machine was broken when received and I can see why.  They make the parts out of plastic!  How easily they break apparently.  If you want a cheaply made machine, buy this one.  I sent mine back.",1.0
"I have nothing against this product, but SIX of these 14 reviews are BY THE SAME PERSON.  This unfairly pads the results and gives a false impression of the product, rather than providing helpful information.  It's great if a customer is enthusiastic, but when s/he misuses the review system to hype a product, that's not so great.",1.0
"When my two daughters spent their hard earned money on this toy, they were so excited. When we got it home and put it together, they were very disapointed. The ""stickers"" that came out were bumpy and when you peeled the backing off, the sticker part came off too. They were left with a picture that had some clear tape on top of it. This is a very frustrating and disapointing toy.",1.0
Broke on the first week. Bought a pair of Singer scissors that are much better.,1.0
These broke within 6 months.,1.0
These are soooooo cheap! Do not buy. I work with kids one day a week and our pairs were probably used a dozen times. Today I had FOUR pairs break while kids cut yarn!!! Ridiculous and dangerous. I want a refund or at minimum a replacement.,1.0
"Terrible scissors. I received the scissors but they're terrible, my kid can't use them and even for me is hard to open and close.",1.0
"I bought these at a local box store. These scissors were a total waste of money as they broke during the very first use due to a serious design flaw.  See that plastic circle at the hinge where a nut used to be located? It's now molded PLASTIC which is NOT a metal nut and easily breaks!  When shopping for scissors make sure there's a METAL screw and a METAL nut for the hinge. I'm very disappointed, Fiskars used to be better than this!",1.0
Absolute junk.  The hinge is a plastic piece that breaks after very little use (see photo).  You would be better off buying scissors from the dollar store.  It is kind of sad to see a brand name like Fiskars selling cheap crap like this.,1.0
"I bought Fiskars scissors because I thought they were reliable quality, but they broke while cutting a piece of string, after I'd only had them for a few weeks. The plastic handle snapped at the rivet, making them completely useless. These scissors are not worth the price premium; might as well buy the cheapest ones, since these broke anyway.",1.0
Wasn't happy not being able to pick a color and ordered these for my sons school supplies. Of course the color received was pink. Really doesn't make sense that you wouldn't send gender neutral colors if you're unable to pick colors.,1.0
"Cheap quality, fell apart after using 3 times",1.0
"At the end of every paper cut, it leaves a sideways tear in the paper, because of the poor design of the shape of the tip. My friend has a 99 cent pair of chinese scissors that work a lot better. Fiskars used to be good, now they are trash. I can't believe they tricked $7 out of me... don't make the same mistake !@#%!!!",1.0
Received scissors more then 2 weeks after I ordered them.  The scissors are not the same quality as the ones this company advertised.  I already had a pair like the ones I ordered so it was easy to see that the ones I ordered and the one I received were not the same type.  Not happy with this company and would like a refund.  I will be happy to return for a full refund and free return shipping.  We'll see how professional their customer service department is.,1.0
"We ordered this table for my 2 year old son's Chirstmas gift, since he was receiving  a Thomas train set.  Hight adjustment and side drawers looked perfect.  However the top part of the table was already broken in the box.  It looks very thin and fragile, so we returned it and bought a different train table.  I doubt how long it would last even if we got an unbroken one.",1.0
"... because it arrived broken. Whoever assembled it managed to torque the screws on the thread guide bar so tight that the rather flimsy spool stand attachment cracked. This may be a better 'live' purchase, I wouldn't advise buying this online.",1.0
"the problem starts with The manual for the Euro-Pro serger Model 534DX, from it, no one can understand how to thread the BOTTOM LOOPERS.
The manual was written by someone other than English speaking as obvious by the paragraph titled ""How to use the Lower Looper Automatic Threader (For certain type only)"".
The diagrams for the Automatic threader do not continue from the previous diagrams for the lower loopers.
Their manual offers 24 hour support, but the 800 telephone number (800-798-7398) goes straight to India, where a man tells you he can't answer your question, his English barely understandable.
He also gave me another 800 number(800-361-4639), that only gives you a busy tone.
Also part of their telephone support machine tells you go visit their Web site, but is so incoherent that I had to search the Internet to get the correct spelling.
then to add insult to injury, their Web site only deals with Vacuum Cleaners, not sergers.  I wonder why??
I also called HSN, where I purchased the serger, and their Customer Service person could only help me by giving me a non 800 telephone number (517-842-8691), where ""people who cant get through on the 800 number have better luck getting through"".
Unfortunately, there is no such number.
So with 5 xmas gifts to sew and no answer for ONE LITTLE QUESTION, ""HOW DO YOU THREAD THE BOTTOM LOOPERS CORRECTLY""?
and one expensive paper weight serger, I rate it as useless!!!!!!!!!!!!",1.0
This product is no good. Did not transfer at all. The one for dark fabric is rotten also. Don't waste your money on it. These should not be on the market!! A total waste.,1.0
"I made a tote bag with my family's pictures on it. It printed really nice and was great looking when I gave the gift. The first time it was washed, you could no longer tell the people's pictures. It was gently washed, but it didn't handle it well.",1.0
"Please go buy another product.  If you want to do iron-on transfers, there are MUCH better options than this one.  First complaint: the ""clear"" portion of the iron-on quickly turns a shade of ""cream"" the moment you finish ironing it in place.  Second: it looks and feels like you have ironed a place-mat to the shirt, which then quickly wrinkles, fades, and peels off, even after just the first wash.  Third: the iron-on does not stretch with the shirt behind it: it cracks! If you purchase or use this item, I guarantee you disappointment.  I have tried it three miserable times, and would never in this lifetime use it again on anything I intended to wear or give as a gift. I am throwing away my remaining sheets.",1.0
"When you iron on the design, the transfer paper is clear.  After washing it, it turns white, so it stands out.  After one washing (cold water, inside out, low heat in the dryer),  my transfers started to crack.  After a second washing, they further cracked and started to peel all throughout.",1.0
"I ironed and ironed and ironed--but still the transfer would not stick. I held the iron down so long I was afraid I'd scorch the shirt. I not only wasted the money on the transfers, but the shirts I tried to iron them on are ruined.",1.0
Terrible product. There are no instruction to flip the image even on their own website. Waste of money.,1.0
We've done dozens of t shirt transfers before but these kept coming out with odd colors when we completed the transfer.,1.0
"I followed the instructions exactly, and everything looked promising. The parts that did not have printer ink on them pressed on clearly, but turned white after washing and the design on one of the shirts got completely ripped after the shower. Wasted money, ink, and water and I had to wash each shirt individually. Save your money and go get professional screen printing or find something better.",1.0
"If I could give this less than a star I would...considering it did not work at all. I've printed transfers and created shirts before and never had an issue. When trying to print on this transfer paper, I can't even explain how bad it was. It was like little smeared chunks of ink sliding off of the page. I tried printing in black and white - it was like it was random pieces/chunks of ink barely clinging onto the page. I tried several different print settings and variations, and finally was honest with myself that there was nothing that could be done on this product.",1.0
This stuff is no good I wasted 3 shirts trying to get it to work,1.0
"Bought other iron-on brands and never had a problem. Followed instructions to a tee and after using them, the product bubbled immediantely and peeled off. Horrible. Would never buy again.",1.0
"The new ones bleed after being set when they're sprinkled with water.
Very disappointed, and these never used to have this problem.",1.0
Bought this and even expedited the service and it was horrible quality. This was my second time trying it and it was just as disappointing as the first.,1.0
i followed the direction and it peel after the second day i wore it,1.0
I put these on as directed. I was very careful about it as these were supposed to be Christmas presents. After 4 hours (not even a wash!) the transfer was pretty much all worn off the shirt. I had also purchased quality t-shirts as recommended on the product. This was a total waste of money.,1.0
Didn't print really well. The color would go out in 2 week. I even washed it inside out hoping the color would stay on for a long period of time.,1.0
Leaves a rough texture that makes the print look like a cheap sticker. The colors are extremely muted and the quality is not good at all.,1.0
I found these hard to use especially since it ate up a couple printers with the gel coating on the transfers that the designs go on. The transfers in my inkjet while printing started smoking,1.0
I bought these transfers on 4 - 20 - 2017. I packed them away and didn't use them until this month. Well I bought six shirts and I applied all six transfers after one where they all cracked. I couldn't figure out why until I looked at the date on the transfers it said 10 - 4 - 2016. They sold me old transfers. So I lost the money for the transfers and for all six shirts I purchased that look like crap. Very pissed off customer.,1.0
Didn't work,1.0
It is close to impossible to find an inkjet printer these days. I had no idea it mattered what kind of printer you needed for these things - definitely my bad for not reading the reviews first. This will NOT work in any other kind of printer. It will melt and waste the pages you spent money on.,1.0
Don't buy this product. Despite carefully following the instructions the transferred image peeled and lifted at the edges of a t shirt after one low temp wash. The image also cracks with the slightest amount of movement of stretch.,1.0
Did not work,1.0
When you try to peel it from the paper it just rips. Then when i finally got one done it melted to the shirt. Do not buy.,1.0
"I've never used this brand before bit thought I'd give it a try. MISTAKE!! Not even a hour after wearing, it started to peel, I plan on trashing the rest so I don't waste any more shirts.",1.0
I purchased this to use with my Cricut Explore Air 2.  I printed on the paper and then used my Cricut to cut out the design.  The backing WILL NOT peel off. Maybe I got a bad batch of these but it was horrible.  Would not recommend for Cricut users.,1.0
"These did not work well for me at all. Still not sure what I did wrong, followed directions to the letter. I put print outs on small white cotton canvas totes and they came out terribly. Extremely disappointed.",1.0
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!,1.0
"Edit: I left the t shirt on sofa for 2 days coz I dunno if I should just discard it or what. So I gave it a last chance : I tried to peel it off. And surprisingly, the image stayed! Just that the edge was not really settled in and so we were actually peeling the ""iron on"" along which gave us the impression that it wasn't ironed on.
**on the very first day we did cool it down until the tee was cool to touch, no more heat. So probably we just gotta wait longer like few hours or 1-2days?

This is is wasted, I'll try washing in and see how would the image stay, and probably give it another try

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Followed all the steps but it just doesn't work.
Can't be transferred to 100% cotton tee... even though we have ironed way extra minutes than instructed. it's so disappointing..
I was customizing a tee for my daughter's birthday but it just couldn't work. :(",1.0
What a mess,1.0
The edges raised immediately even after proper application. Won't by again.,1.0
"After the first day.... never again was the image the same.
Did not last one single wash.
100% unhappy",1.0
"BEWARE... Package of transfers is out of date...Even if they're still usable, it should have been disclosed.",1.0
"These might be OK, but amazon sent me expired product. There is an expiration date on them that was 2 months prior to me trying to use them.
The end product was mediocre with a little trouble getting the edges to adhere to the fabric.",1.0
Poor quality. Transfer did not completely stick to t-shirt. Most of the transfer came off after a few hours. Very disappointing.,1.0
I ordered the wrong product.,1.0
"Doesn't stick well and it doesn't show.
Complete crap",1.0
"I wanted to use these to make shirts with my Logo on them for my husband and I for when I do craft shows.

FAIL. big time.

I followed the instructions and even printed off a page to practice on a piece of fabric (The 4x4"" piece worked WONDERFULLY) So I tried my full page logo. Read the instructions one more time just for good measure, noting that ironing time for a full page should take about 3 minutes. An hour and a half later, I'm still struggling to get an edge, any edge, of the paper to peel off of the plasticy stuff that the transfer is made out of. I finally get one edge to peel off and the transfer tears in the middle. I carefully place the bit that tore back on the shirt and iron over it again. Finally success! sort of. the edges that I painstakingly ironed with all of my weight against it are still peeling and frayed.
My 2 shirts are currently in the wash, by themselves, on cold and I'm not expecting much when they come out.",1.0
"I printed first on a sample page and the printing worked great! Then I printed on the transfer paper and it melted into the printer. Tried several times and every time it happened. Maybe this is an issue with my printer, an HP Laserjet but if that is the case, it should be clearly stated by Avery.",1.0
No matter where I printed this the ink melted onto the printer!,1.0
"Loved the ideas, followed the directions exactly but the transfer didn't last more than a few hours. I didn't think to create a separate image for the pockets and thought for sure that would be the area to peel, the corners peeled first. I made sure I concentrated on the edges most of all with no luck. I got a few nice pics but will not use this product again.",1.0
Started to peel off less then 2 hours after applying. I would not waste my money. I wish I could give it no stars!,1.0
"I love all of Avery's other products. But these just don't work. The process is easy enough, but the results were just sad. The transfer felt like paper, after washing the color faded, and the final product had no 'give' so the tiniest stretching caused the transfer to tear. Look into Photo Paper Direct in England...I had better luck with their products. Sorry Avery :(",1.0
SUCKS!!!!,1.0
Does not print very well. I ordered 2 because you only get 5 per package. Expensive for what you get especially with the poor quality. I have a high end printer so I know that is not the issue. I will not order again.,1.0
"Terrible , and leaves a film on the shirt",1.0
"I have used other brands, and never had this problem. Waste of money.",1.0
Horrible! Only got 1 transfer paper and 6 instruction sheets. The package should have had 6 iron on papers. VERRY DISAPPOINTED!,1.0
"Horrible.  Followed instructions to a t. Washed them, garbage. Peeled, wrinkled looking. Total waste of money.",1.0
Bleeding ink on first day. Used manufacturer ink. Tshirt ruined.,1.0
"Did not hold any ink on the paper, and I tried it with multiple inkjet printers. The ink just smeared everywhere as it printed. Very disappointed.",1.0
These transfers for light are horrible! The back does not peel off. I could not use a single one. You can use the transfers made for dark instead. They work great. The backing must be thicker.,1.0
"Very bad quality transfers. Wasted so much ink before I realized it was the paper, not the printer. Bubbles and peels, is very thin. I can't imagine it lasting through washes.",1.0
Will NOT show up on dark clothes.  Instructions need to be improved greatly.  Should include temp of iron.  Nothing in the drawing that is white shows up.,1.0
Poor color quality after printing and washes out.  Did not iron on well either.,1.0
"Did not work as easily as described... I made it work, but it took a lot",1.0
No matter what colors I print on these the result ends up turning really yellow after ironing.,1.0
These were the worst t-shirt transfers ever. When tried to use they would stick or stay on after applied. They were supposed to be white but they came clear.,1.0
"I've used many iron-ons over the years, and these are by far the worst. The images ended up bubbled or ripped no matter what I did. After ruining two onesies and three shirts, I bought a different product.",1.0
"Followed directions perfectly and the designs peeled off after one wash. Save yourself some time and frustration and just use the dark transfers from Avery. They work great on any fabric, light or dark. Only difference is that they have a white background rather than clear. Oh, and they actually work--that's different.",1.0
Did not last after the first wash. I did 6 shirts and all 6 of the transfers are coming off.  I washed them in my high efficiency washer which is easy on clothes.  Very disappointed in the product.  Not even close to what I expected,1.0
I could have done this wrong (although I followed the directions!) but when I washed the shirts and wore them the transfer cracked and peeled off.,1.0
It came out ok but started to come off after the first wash. Don't buy!,1.0
Way to complicated to work with,1.0
I am not happy. This came off almost immediately.,1.0
"The transfers done daily hold ink from the printer without melting. They also take a long time to iron-on, even with the correct temperature and heavy pressure. They were stiff even after being dried. I don't recommend them for t-shirts.",1.0
"Bad Quality Product, it comes out in pieces",1.0
Washed and dried garment without fabric softener prior to applying the transfer.  Looked good until first wash....peeled! Badly!,1.0
"This did not work at all. I followed the directions properly and ended up with a nice design on the shirt after I ironed it on and let it cool. But once I put it in the washer on low, it cracked and the design (which was the Nike swoosh) faded into the shirt I had bought at Forever 21 for over $15.00. I'm pretty sure I will never buy any transfer papers ever again. I'd rather just buy a shirt with the graphic I want on it. DO NOT BUY THIS. (However bad the outcome was, I did receive it earlier than I expected it to come. But I was NOT satisfied with this product.)",1.0
Colours leak into fabric. I tried these after having huge success with the the Dark Iron Ons.,1.0
Tried two sheets and it did not work as expected. I'm returning it hope to get my money back and will be doing my sons birthday shirt at a shop.,1.0
"Wasted several shirts with this product. Followed directions and put heavy pressure on the print. Didnt matter, it peeled up and cracked after one wash. Dont bother. And If you have a shirt that looks okay its still subpar and people can tell you did it yourself.",1.0
"Transfers sometimes, and sometimes not. Also leaves a shiny coating over transfer that does not blend well w fabric.  Stretchy fabric (like T-shirt) cause transfer to mis-shaps, crack or peal off.

update:
after one machine washing, they are falling off in pieces - now I have wasted time and money on these poor quality transfers AND the shirts I ironed on to. Big disappointment!!",1.0
"Two things I didn't like:

-The software/program that you can download via their website for this item did not have the option to flip the design (so your letters would not read backward).  I had to use Word to flip the letters.
-The instructions recommends to wash the item once so the shirt can be softer, but instead it just ruin the whole thing.

I guess this is not bad for one time use items or pictures that doesn't require flipping.",1.0
None of the prints worked -- disappointing.,1.0
Transfer is not very bright and takes a really long time to do if you have a good number of shirts.  I would recommend buying the transfers for dark material (even though it's usually more expensive) no matter what color your shirt is.  It's more of a printed adhesive sheet rather than a color transfer and comes out much nicer and brighter.,1.0
"Not only did the package show up over a week late, but almost all of the pieces of paper had black smudges on them. Very disappointing.",1.0
"The colors fade, the transfers peel and crack. Not recommended.",1.0
"This product was a total waste of our money, times 2 because it ruined the t-shirt we bought too.  We followed the directions exactly and the entire transfer turned a creamy burnt color as soon as we ironed it on.  We were using a white t-shirt, so the discoloring was really obvious.  When finished it was also stiff and ""plastic-y"" and looked really cheap.  I would never use this product again.",1.0
Awful!  Melted when I printed them out.  Used the same printer as another brand and had no issues.  Total waste!,1.0
"I normally buy my iron-on transfer paper from Michaels or Hobby Lobby but I was in a rush and picked these up! I used everything as directed! I printed my image like normal and the smallest touch of my nail or scissors and it scratched my image!! After the first scratch I thought ""ok, no big deal a little mess up!"" As I kept cutting.....if the scissors touched the image it added more damage! I honestly have printed two pictures and tried cutting both and both got scratched! My image wasn't even a very detailed cut, simple a Mickey head, lol. This product is awful and a waste of time and money compared to other iron-on transfers ive bought!",1.0
"I have used these transfer sheets before, with great results.  However, this was NOT the same.  I printed the image on my printer, per the usual.  I pre washed and pre ironed like the instructions say.  I used a cotton pillow case and a dry, hard surface.  i pressed with two hands on an iron on the cotton setting, without water.

As i said, I have used these before with ease and great end products.

This time, no matter what setting I set my printer to, the image was pale, dull in colour.  Then when i went to iron it onto a 100% cotton, prewashed and ironed shirt, the paper refused to peel away from the transfer.  My husband tried, I tried, we just tried anything we could think of.  Nothing would make the paper release from the transfer.  We had to scrub the paper off with a wet wash cloth.  The transfer was dull, just bad colour quality.

Bottom line is that, I don't know what happened to this particular batch of iron on transfer sheets, but I will not buy Avery brand anymore.",1.0
"The clear transfers are extremely had to transfer, especially lettering.  I have spent more than 2 hours pressing a date onto a quilt and it still isn't totally transfered.  I am not sure if there is a better way, expecially if you want particular lettering.  The delivery etc. was extremely high as usual from Amazon, but I would personally think twice about using them again.",1.0
"I wasted all of these because it wasn't clear that you need to flip the image. I have done many of these fabric transfers, and I had a different similar light fabric transfer
(Jolee's Boutique Easy Image Iron-on Transfer...) and this was just horrible.

Not only did I waste the paper on this but when printing on a huge Ricoh printer in my office, the paper snagged through the middle and left a huge line on every sheet.",1.0
"The paper jammed in the printer. Apparently, inkjet and laser jet are not the same. I realize that is my problem for not knowing, but who has inkjet printers? The ink for them is so expensive that most people have laser jet! I wasted 2 papers because they got destroyed running them through the printer.",1.0
"Used it on yellow and tan tee shirts. Left a white background area, a sort of 'halo' around iron-on.
Many years ago I used these with good results, I suspect Avery manufacturing has gone Chinese. These are not cheap either. I recall getting a ten pack of these for $8.99 about 10 years ago. Now they cost much more.
If you want to do transfers, try something else. I have done a lot of these, this is not a good product.",1.0
These are hard to get to stick and don't stay on well after even one wash.  not worth it.  Pay on online company to do it for you.,1.0
I just wanted to iron on some letters. This was a terrible solution. It didn't last. You could see the background paper. No way.,1.0
I opened the sealed package and there are blue dots or splotches all over the sheets. It almost looks like someone dripped ink all over the sheets so they aren't useable. Unfortunately I bought these a couple months ago and only opened the package today. This is just a warning to open the package ASAP and check so that Amazon can replace it for you.,1.0
I follow the directions and it still turns up cheap. I need at least a semi professional looking shirt... I even washed it before use and it will just crack on the shirt. What if I'm doing it wrong? Regardless even after I take a fresh sheet out of the box the paper has little scratches in it so when I go to transfer you see those scratches. I can't work with this.,1.0
very poor transfer paper if i could give it 0 stars i would have i made about 4 shirts with this and i should of just tested it on one when i saw the shirts i was really excited with how then turned out however after the first wash they were pretty much garbage the transfer were already crumbling and color was fading and i only had them for 1 day terrible product i recently bought espon transfer paper and so far that seems much better,1.0
I've tried using this product twice now and I had trouble getting the release paper off and made a big mess. The small size like this apparently came with the wrong instructions but the instructions with this larger size wasn't a whole lot better. I had no luck with it maybe it's my iron but I'm giving up trying maybe you will have better luck then me.,1.0
"I don't usually do product reviews but was so angered by this product that I just had to write something. I ended up ruining 3 items that i was trying to iron some words onto because once i ironed the printed sheet onto the fabric, I couldn't peel it off!! It reminded me of when i try to take off a price tag but half of it ends up sticking to the item and then you have to get ""goo-gone"" to get it off. So I had to get a wet washcloth and scrub off the backing which revealed the letters I wanted to show but then it had a white halo around the words... ugh - it was horrible. My cloth envelopes I was trying to label look horrible, at the very best. I am still trying to find a way to salvage them.

I am not sure what i will buy now but to be sure i will not be using this again!!",1.0
"Do your homework, read reviews before buying T-shirt transfers and find some that work.  The Avery brand transfers do not work.

I would have given it zero stars if that were possible.",1.0
"I made some t-shirts for work with these transfers.  Upon finishing them, i noticed there was a slight yellow tint to the transfers that were placed on white t-shirts.  Also, upon washing the ones placed on light colored tshirts, the color faded so bad that you could see where the transfer was cut. I was disappointed in my tshirt that had a white ""patch"" on the front with my design.

I was initially disappointed to see it uses twist-locks on the legs, but I thought it would only be an annoyance.  Wrong.  Despite being careful/gentle with my twists, the 2nd time I used it and tried to collapse the legs when done, I needed to use pliers to loosen the twist-lock on one leg.  And now, a month later pliers wouldn't even work to loosen and collapse TWO of the legs.

Note: Prior to this one I had the lighter weight version that used cam click locks for the legs.  I loved that one, but I lost it somehow and THOUGHT I'd be upgrading to get this heavier-duty version.  Boy was I wrong.",1.0
Difficult to use. Broke apart after a few uses. Waste of money.,1.0
"I purchased this to hold my quartet dry-erase board for approximately two hours per day while presenting lessons to my children.  Using it five days per week beginning in October 2014, it only lasted until December 2014 before breaking!  I bought the heavy-duty version based on the comments and unfortunately it didn't seem to make a difference.  Now we're back to leaning the board up against the kitchen counter with me sitting on the floor.  It was a complete waste of money!",1.0
"Flimsy and awkward design. The lower legs are thinner which throws off the balance of the unit. Had to hold my whiteboard while writing just to keep it from wobbling. Also the legs lock by twisting the leg itself, not the ring as one would think. The leg slipped a few times. Overall, this is just not a sturdy product and for almost $50, I think it ought to be.",1.0
Ugh! This thing is a pain in the butt. The leg adjusters are VERY sensitive and if you turn them too tight they get stuck. Way too shabby an item for the price.,1.0
"I CHOSE THIS EASEL BECAUSE THE ADVERTISING SAID IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR 25 POUNDS.  THE WHITEBOARD I PURCHASED WEIGHS 10.2 POUNDS.  THE LEGS ON THE EASEL ARE SO FLIMSY AND DON'T LOCK IN WELL AND THE WHITEBOARD FELL OVER WHILE NOT IN USE AND A HUGE GOUGE WAS MADE ON IT BY THE CORNER OF THE ORGAN--BOTH ARE NOW DAMAGED.
VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED.

"I recieved this item unusable. I did not take it out of the box until I needed it so I imagine it is my fault that I cannot exchange it. But I think it is rong I pulled the easel out of the box and it had a dent on the side of one of the legs, I did not think that would effect it but t when I tried to exsteend the legs that leg would not come all the way out. They make it so difficult to contact anyone here, I tried to contast the conpany but got noe response. Money is very tight and I work for  company and it is an educational company we cannot give money away.",1.0
"i was not happy with this as it is described as being heavy duty, nothing is further from the truth when you are using a white board.",1.0
"I purchased these crayons for my wife's students. When they arrived we noticed the colors brown ans purple only had fiftten crayons in each section. When we contacted the seller, we were told they would do nothing about it because no one else had reported this problem. Frankly, not all boxes are the same, they are all assembled separately. I did not appreciate their lack of customer service. I will not be buying from them again!",1.0
"Very disappointed in this product. Advertised as 50 of each color and this is not the case. This is the 2nd box I received (I sent the 1st one back for this reason). Also, it was not packed in any sort of box just plastic wrap around the box. Anybody could see what I purchased and had I not had it delivered to my place of business, I am sure it would not have been on my porch when I got home as everyone could see exactly what the product was.",1.0
"Do not buy if you are counting on getting 50 of each color as product advertised. I got 21 turquoise and 33 orange. I'm not bothering with counting anymore but from the looks of it, I got less than 50 each color!",1.0
Somehow all the crayons were not included in the box. It's very strange but there were 11 purple crayons missing. The packaging was sealed and still in tact. I don't know what to do because I needed to use many of the crayons for my daughters class. But I'm very disappointed that some were missing.,1.0
"i used it to keep some of my pillow cases and duvet covers enclosed. after two washes, they all came off. the glue sucked and the velcro sucked",1.0
"If you put these both together you might get 18"".They were not 18"" each as described. I sent them back",1.0
Product ripped within days of owning it.,1.0
Much shorter than advertised. They are not 18 inches long.,1.0
"The straps that came in for me measured only 13"". Not as described.",1.0
"The ends of the straps are glued on, not stitched which lead to them breaking after one use.  Cannot think of any use that these would be useful for.  Don't bother.",1.0
"The concept is good but the product is flimsy and not as ""long"" as you expect after the fold over.  I got these for attaching items to backpack (camping).  Will use them for wires and cables only, but a little long for that.",1.0
This is the most misrepresented item that I ever bought.one more like this and the amazon app is coming off all 4 iPads and 1 kindle in this house,1.0
"Waste of my money.  Shipping is more than cost of item so can't send it back.  Has a little plastic buckle at the end. Description made it sound like a self adhesive strap which is what I thought I was buying.  The tiny part that looks like it might stick, doesn't so don't waste your money.",1.0
"it's not even velcro

doesn't stick

if you are looking for a strap of velcro ,this isn't it

try another type",1.0
"This product is exactly what I wanted, unfortunately, I had to re-sew the velcro tabs on two of the straps. Two of the four have now come completely undone.",1.0
At first view loved it!  Its supposed to stick to all surfaces (even shows hammer hanging from it). Tried to stick it to fabric and let it sit for an hour before trying (said 15min to set) and immediately ripped off when trying to remove a tiny piece of Velcro to it (not even a 2strip). Totally disappointed.,1.0
There is absolutely nothing industrial about this. It will hold 10 lbs according to the box. 10 pounds is not industrial. It's home owner grade.,1.0
"What a complete waste of money. The item arrived promptly. However, the adhesive sides of the Velcro did not stick to the surface. As a result, the expected use for this product failed miserably.",1.0
The glue in the back does not hold. So for all intents and purposes this is a waste of money. I can't think of any use for this product.,1.0
Adhesive wasn't strong enough for what I needed.,1.0
