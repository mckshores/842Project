"This tool is light-weight, durable, convenient and easy to store in the vehicle and use. I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality level of all aspects of the little portable vacuum.

It plugs into the car cigarette lighter. After 15-20 minutes of being on continuously, the motor was not hot, actually...no heat at all....and THAT is surprising! All parts and attachments assemble together very easy, and all attachments STAY together even during vigorous usage.

The small brush easily gets between the seat and door posts where theres not much room, even for a hand. It picked up everything off the carpet and off the floor mats. It has a brush attachment that really works, and a crevice tool attachment that works well in the seat crevices. It also has a hose attachment which works well and appears to be very durable.

The front stays secured during usage and easily detaches for emptying the dirt out and then is easily re-attachable after emptying.  Everything, including cord and attachments, easily goes into the carrying/storage bag when finished using.  The case is nylon and durable. I was happy to get this in exchange for an honest review.

"When the manufacturer sent me this in exchange for an honest review, my husband rolled his eyes...he is really particular about his vehicles (has them detailed professionally), but he agreed to give it a shot.

When it first arrived, you could see that he was super skeptical.  First he wondered if they pieces all fit in the bag (they did).  Then he wondered if it could be dismantled for cleaning (it can).

He took it outside and vacuumed his freshly-washed car....and came back with a vacuum that had picked up a bunch of dirt in his squeaky-clean car.  haha.  (see pic) Now he's hooked!  He went from rolling his eyes to telling me to tell you all that this is a great thing to buy, and a must-have if you are totally uptight like he is.

It works great, is easy to empty and clean, and everything fits in the bag. :)

My apologies for how Amazon uploaded my photos.  I'm not sure why this happens from time to time.",5.0
"This a great in between car wash vacuums.  I typically use a shopvac to clean my cars out but that can be a hassle as I need to get extension cords and lug the big vacuum out of the basement. Of course this small vacuum doesn't have the same power as the shopvac but it does do a good job at cleaning up small messes. I like using this small vacuum to clean up small messes as it is very easy to use and I keep this in the trunk. The power cord is fairly long and allows me to reach every part of my car (4 door CTS) without any problems. I have yet to test the wet function of the vacuum, but the dry vacuum works as intended and picks up almost everything in its path. I received this item in exchange for a fair and honest review.",5.0

"I'm so excited about these diffuser necklaces!  This set comes with two!  One in silver and one in bronze to match other jewelry you are wearing.  I love them both and they are beautiful!  They arrived in a beautiful little black box and were packaged very nicely.  They would make an excellent gift for this reason, and you won''t be disappointed with the presentation! They come with eight different color choices for the felt pad that you put inside of them.  I love that there are so many pads so that I can change the oil smell on each one.  The variety in colors is a nice touch too so you can coordinate with different outfits. The lockets open up easily and the hinge is well hidden in the locket so that you don't really see it when you look at the jewelry head on.  I'm excited to have these aromatherapy diffuser necklaces because diffusing is a great way to therapeutically experience oils for emotional benefits.  Sometime when you put oils on your skin, they soak in so fast that you don't get the aromatherapy benefits for very long.  When an oil is placed on the felt pad inside these necklaces (I just use a couple drops) it lasts for hours!

I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I am happy to give these aromatherapy diffuser necklaces my five star recommendation becasue I would happily purchase these again! If it had been helpful to you please click ""yes"" below.  Thanks!",5.0

"Who doesn't need a little extra help when it comes to cleaning our vehicles?

Before getting this Hotor I was using a little broom and dustpan. Don't judge me. When I was offered this vacuum at a discount in exchange for an honest review I was eager to use it mainly because I NEEDED it, and I was curious as to how well it would do.

I was very impressed with it right out of the box. It is super easy to use. Just plug it into your cigarette lighter and you are ready to go. It has everything you need to be able to your carpeting in the car and even handle spills! Pretty cool, huh? I also was surprised to see the nice carrying case for it, making sure it is protected and easy recognizable when you need it.

This is one of those items you will want to keep close by, because an accident can happen at any time. Great to have something like this in your corner to help you keep your vehicle clean.",5.0
"A perfect color and perfect scent for the day.  I was lucky enough to try this product at a reduced price for my honest review.  This necklace is a gem.  I have worn this necklace out with just about everything both daytime and nighttime.  The necklace is a beautiful design which allows for many compliments and notices.  The infusion is absolutely wonderful.  The different oils I used with each of the colors just sets the mood for a wonderful day.  Throughout the day, my co-workers and people whom I am in contact with often commented on how they could smell the oil I was using that day and how nice it smelled.  I love this necklace and it will be a part of my wardrobe for a while.  Thanks for a great product.",5.0
"You can just slip this on, no hassle with fastening and unfastening.  It has a 24chain that matches.  There are 8 different discs that come with it.  They are in different colors.  If you are into the color sets the mood, then match your essential oil with the color.  If you are more concerned with fashion then you will probably find a color within the eight different colors to compliment what you are wearing.
The diffuser necklace I have is antique brass in color.  The design is simple yet interesting.  It opens up just like a picture locket. The hinge is on one side and it snaps closed on the other. To change discs, open it up, hold your hand under it, flip it over and the disc falls out.  The discs are a perfect fit so it isn't a problem to change them and they show no other color except the color of the disc.  I only used one drop of the lavender essential oil I have and it lasted two days before the scent begin to fade.  The first time I wore it I used lavender and when I took it off at bedtime I hung it on the bed post at the head of the bed.  I could smell lavender all night. With the ceiling fan running it was just a light scent.  Wonderful!
Wash the discs out with warm soapy water.  With some oils you may need to do it a couple times.  Lavender and peppermint were the two I had to do a second wash and rinse.
Each time I have worn it I have gotten several compliments.  After a compliment it makes for a good conversation piece.  It is an asset to any wardrobe.  It will go with most anything.  If you wanted you could change the chain. I think most people who are into essential oils will really like this.  If you haven't used essential oils this would be a good way to start.  The price is reasonable, it works with the oils, it is a nice piece of jewelry.  It deserves a 5 star.  Hope you find this review helpful.

"I've been looking for a good deal on Aromatherapy Diffuser necklaces for a few weeks and was super excited to come across this option where I didn't have to choose between a silver or a bronze colored necklace - I could get BOTH!
Each necklace is very lovely, the bronze is just right and the silver one has got a beautiful shine to it!  The chains are rather long for the necklaces so that they hang low on the chest, so it is easy to tuck away if you want and use your body heat to help warm the oil within the necklace as well as lift it away from your body far enough to smell it yourself or allow someone else to smell it without getting too much into your personal space either.  I like the length of the necklace. I think if you want to wear it shorter, although the chain isn't designed for it, I think the hook clasp that it has might be able to clasp on the links in the chain to be able to shorten it.
The felt pads that came with the necklaces are great quality as well. They are the perfect size for the necklaces, no having to squeeze them into the necklace and they aren't too small either. You can also only barely see the color of the pad through the filigree so it doesn't look weird either. The felt pads are nice and thick too, so that it holds a good amount of oil to last you throughout the day as well. It's totally bonus that this vendor uses Amazon Prime to ship the items and you can get them quickly!

"I purchased this diffuser necklace because it is beautiful and functional. I was not disappointed.

I love the color. I generally see stainless steel diffuser necklaces. The antique bronze is gorgeous.

The necklace stays closed. I feel sure that it will last. The design is beautiful. I'm gushing over here! It's so beautiful!!

The felt pads are thick and will last through washing it several times.

I received this item for free or at a discount for my honest opinion. The discount does not sway my opinion in any way. My review is honest and a 100% my own. I love this.",5.0
"Really beautiful necklace, I have another that I bought locally and actually enjoy this one more. The chain is sturdy, the metal looks shiny and really pretty against a dark outfit especially. I have already gotten compliments. The pads are thick and I love the different colors. I was originally going to get this item to review at a discounted rate but ended up not doing that, and just buying it outright. I think the necklace is a good value for what you get, and I'll be wearing this happily to work as I am now known as one of the ""oil"" ladies. Thanks so much!",5.0

"This necklace seems to be better constructed than the other aromatherapy necklaces I have. The felts are nice and thick, and they absorb essential oils well so that they do not drip. I've had one brand before that had felt so thin that one drop soaked it, and any more made it drip. This necklace does not have that problem, which makes it safer to use since essential oils are so concentrated they can cause sensitivity if used on the skin without being diluted.

The necklace came in a nice box that would make it a lovely gift.

I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.",5.0
"This is a really lovely oil diffuser necklace with some wonderful features:

1. Enjoy the essential oil whenever you are without directly touching your skin. I have sensitive skin, and sometimes I find the oils can be irritating. I like to use peppermint oil when I have a headache, and I have frequent headaches. I prefer using a diffuser necklace to rubbing the oil on my temples or forehead. I've had problems with my eyes watering with the peppermint so close to them. The necklace is the perfect solution for me.

2. Creative sunflower design and fits with a variety of current fashion style. Not only is it a piece of jewelry, it is a function work of art. It's really lovely. I was surprised by how nice it looks in person.

3. The material used for the pendant necklace is 316L surgical grade stainless steel, it is the highest quality of stainless steel in the market. It would absolutely guarantee a lifetime! The stainless steel is much better than silver. It maintains its lustre, not dulling and tarnishing like silver does.

4. The pendant has magnetic closure and it closes very well,you can never worry about the oil pad dropping out once you close it. The pendant closes firmly and stays closed. Because of the magnetic closure, there are no clasps to bend, wear out or break.

5. The pads are washable so you can clean them and use another type of oil in them. The necklace comes with 8 different colored pads, so you can color code them for different oils, which is what I do.

This pendant comes in a lovely box and would make a very nice gift.

"This is a great set of diffuser necklaces.  When I looked at other diffuser necklaces, some were rather unattractive and unappealing.  I got this so that I could wear them when I needed them, whether I was at work or home or school or wherever.  I like the option to have both colors.  I like that there is a gold and silver and then quite a few of the replacement pads for the essential oils.  The clasp is easy to open and close.  I haven't had any issues with the locket opening or anything.  I like that this is a long necklace.  I don't usually wear short necklaces so I was a little worried about the chain length of this product but it turned out I was worried for nothing.  I like the design on the front of the locket.  It is very feminine and pretty.  I also like how the back of the locket is smooth.  Ive ran into issues before where the back of the locket isn't smooth and will snag on my clothing so I appreciate that this one is very smooth and doesnt snag my clothing.  Overall, this is a great product if you do aromatherapy or essential oils.  I love having my oils on the go.  I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.

"I bought this diffuser necklace for my wife, and she absolutely LOVES it. She wears it with different colored pads and oils every day, and she just recently asked me to purchase a few more so she can give them as gifts. So many people have commented on how nice it looks and smells... along with asking where they can get one for themselves. She tells me that she feels that it looks great, the oil chamber is easy to open and close... and stays closed unless you want it opened. It came with enough colors to use with a variety of oils and outfits. We have ordered an additional set of pads so we are good to go for a long time. The biggest surprise was how nice and heavy the actual necklace was. She couldn't be happier, and I'm glad to report to all of you out there in Amazon-land that this is a fantastic product for a great price. You won't be disappointed.

I absolutely love this Aromatherapy necklace 2pk. It comes with 8 reusable pads which I thought was great since other similar options had disposable pads. I really didn't want to reorder the pads if I didn't have to. The necklace lays intentionally at chest length in order to continually release the essential oils from the warm of the chest. The pendant is nice size about 1.5 inches and is very stylish. Can easily go from jeans to dressy attire,very versatile. The only problem I had was which one I wanted to wear. Both the bronze and the silver are lovely. I have been using it with peppermint essential oil and it was so nice to smell it throughout the day for a quick pick me up. However, I found myself constantly sniffing it throughout the day. I couldn't leave it alone.  I received this necklace at a discounted rate in return for my honest review.",5.0

"This product is boxed beautifully and is of very high quality. It has not only one, but two necklaces in it. You can choose between the silver or gold look. It has many different color choices to put in the locket for your oil. I've used it and the oil Aroma lasted all day. These two necklaces give you many choices for a beautiful looking accessory. These necklaces can help you feel more beautiful not only on the outside but the inside as well. I find them very beautiful and helpful with my inner Spirit at the same time. Thank you very much.",5.0

"I like this little HOTOR 120 ml Essential Oil diffuser. It's cute and can fit almost anywhere, unlike some other, more expensive diffusers. I don't use it all the time, so time will tell about how long it lasts. I like that it's portable. Will take it traveling with us this summer and can report back how it's holding up. If it does well, I will buy another. I did receive this diffuser at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.",5.0
"I have a different infuser necklace that my 2 sons keep trying to get me to let them use so I purchased this set for them. There are 2 necklaces in this set one bronze and one silver. It includes 8 felt pads so you can change colors and oils in the diffuser necklace. Both necklaces are stylish and good quality. They are like lockets and the piece that locks them holds well so no worries that the felt pad will just fall out. These necklaces are nicely weighted, not too heavy. The chain is nice it is just the right size for us both in length and in thickness.

My youngest son is 8 he wears his when he is at home and I hang it near his bed at night with some lavender to help him rest better or with an oil that helps with breathing when he has a stuffy nose. My oldest son is 15, he wears his to school with Vetiver oil and Lavender oil to help him focus and relax. He likes it much better than having the oil on his skin. He loves how he can always lightly smell it but can lift it up and smell it if he is feeling more stressed. (Even his classmates come ask to smell his necklace). He gets a lot of compliments on his necklace and people asking where he got it from. We are very happy with this purchase of this diffuser necklace set and would recommend it.

"This is a winner in my opinion. It looks very fine and intricate in design.

The clasp is sturdy and well made. The chain is 24 inches long and nice, but I would prefer the chain to be about 2 inches longer for a locket type necklace. That is only my personal preference.

The locket opens to the side and seems to be very tight fitting which I like. To me it means it won't be opening up when I don't want it to and I like that.

The necklace comes with 8 colored discs that can be used to hold drops of your favorite Essential Oil. It is nice to be able to pick a color that will coordinate with the clothing I am wearing. (On a good note, it will be easy to use a piece of regular felt to cut my own discs in the future as they become soiled. You don't have to by special ones that could be pricey.)

"This HOTOR Aromatherapy Diffuser Necklace is wonderful. It has a better quality feel than expected. A lot of necklaces are light and cheap feeling where as this one has a little weight to it. The design is beautiful and I've received a lot of compliments on it. It comes with 8 round felt pads to drop aromatherapy on. I change out the felt pads to a color that matches my outfit for the day. I put about 6 to 8 drops of aromatherapy on it and it did't drip yet allowed enough scent. I have been traveling lately and driving through the country and wore this. I took it off for comfort and stored it on my rear view mirror. It hung there over night while I slept in a hotel. It was a delight to enter my car the next morning because the Stress Relief aromatherapy blend I had on the felt in the necklace. I think this is a wonder diffuser to use as a necklace or to keep your car smelling nice.

I recommend this product. It is a great way to enjoy the benefits of aromatherapy without placing essential oils directly on your skin.

"decent price, good quality",5.0
I am new to essential oils and I was interested in finding new ways to use them. One way that I found that I could use them was in an essential oil diffusing necklace. I love my diffusing necklace because it relaxes me and keeps me peaceful during the day. But the only thing that I do not like about my necklace is that I am not able to change scents out because my necklace only came with three pads. This is why I decided that I needed to get the HOTOR 11 Pics Diffuser Necklace Pads Round Pendant Necklace Refill Pads Reusable-0.886 Inch Diameter. I like the fact that they come in a variety of colors that way I can switch between different outfits plus I can change out scents quickly. So with this pack you get eleven pieces that you can switch out and you can rinse them out and change scents.  I love that you have so many colors and I love that they are thick pads and that they are very good quality ones. I bought these also specifically because this is the same brand that my diffuser necklace is so I knew that the quality would be great. They are extra thick and they do not leak unless you put too much oil on them. I find that they are perfect for my necklace. I have received a discount for my honest review. The opinions and statements are my own and are in no way biased because of said discount,5.0
"This is a beautiful necklace. It came in a nice gift box, and when I took out the necklace I was surprised how heavy and intricate it was. It is also on a nice chain. The pads for the aromatherapy are a perfect size to fit in the locket. The locket opened easily, but wasn't going to open accidentally.
I am new to aromatherapy, so I wasn't sure how much essential oil to use on the pad. The oil comes out in such a fine drop that I think I overdid it as the first time I tried it, I soon got a migraine headache. However, I am sure that is because I used too much oil.
The color of the pads shows through the cutouts of the locket nicely. They did not match very well with my wardrobe, but there also were black and white pads that would with anything. I see that there are plenty of places on Amazon where you can buy replacement pads.
In all, I think this is a beautiful necklace that I would wear even without the aromatherapy pad or with the pad to provide color but with no oil on it. For most of you, I know you are buying it for the aromatherapy quality, and I think it works perfectly as that as well.

"I got tons of compliments from day one!  Things like, ""You smell like the spa"" and ""I want one"".  A cashier complimented it before she even knew it was a diffuser and even had me write down the name so she could get one herself.  I don't love the chain length but a piece of ribbon or extender could fix that easily.  The colors look subtiler behind the pendant.  I put 7 drops (which was too much) but it lasted over 24 hours!!!!!  I love it and will probably get one in a silver tone.",5.0
"I received this product at a discount to give it my honest review and let me say it is AMAZING!!! I am an avid essential oil user and I am always looking for ways to diffuse essential oils and finding ways to use them in the best ways possible. This necklace is amazing. When I got it I put my tranquillity essential oil on one of the pads and I wore it all day.  I could smell the Tranquility throughout the day, it was calming, and beautiful! I received so many compliments on the necklace and I will be purchasing this for my customers as they are always looking for reccomendations for products like this. I love that it comes with a few different pads that you can interchange, so that you can use different essential oils or have different colors  as an accent. I absolutely love it and would purchase it at the full price. I cannot speak more highly of this product! If I could give it more than 5 stars I would!!",5.0

"This dual, double side comb is awesome! It is pretty nice, and has a simple design on it. This can be used for the bread but I will admit that I have been using it for hair and my fly aways. I do use oil in my hair, and bread and it helps comb it through. I have not ran into it causing damage it but do this at you own risk of course. I was able to get this product at a small discount in order to review and share my honest and open opinion. I really do like this. Since it is double sided you have the option of fine or course comb.

"I purchased the HOTOR Aromatherapy Diffuser Necklace Essential Oils Locket Pendant With 8 Refilled and Washable Pads in Gift Box in Silver.  I absolutely love it!  It is a wonderful size-not huge, but not tiny either.  The chain is a good length and hits in a nice place on my chest.  I love that it comes with different color felts so I can make it match my outfit-or I can use different colors for different scents of essential oils.  I have recently begun using essential oils, mainly for anxiety and to help me sleep as well.  I have tried diffusing and made several roll ons to use, but I love the idea of a diffuser necklace for when I'm on the go!  Then I can have my essential oil with me where ever I go.  It only takes a few drops of oil to make the necklace effective at diffusing the oil.  It is easy to add oils when I need to freshen up the scent as well.  The locket opens easily, but also latches closed tightly.  The felt pads are nice and thick and can easily be washed when needed.  They should last a long time with how durable they are.

I did receive this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion.  This in now way affects my review.  I would recommend this to anyone who uses essential oils.  It's a great necklace at a great price.",5.0

"I love this necklace. In all honesty, I wasn't expecting too much in the way of quality but was blown away when I'd opened the box. The product is situated just as you see in the picture, with a packet of scent-holding tabs in every color shown. The metal is solid and the hinges strong enough to hold together a soaked tab when shut. The size is larger than I expected, I expected a small little pendant when in reality it's about the size of a half dollar.

The vents in the front of this particular one allow whatever scent you choose to be readily smelled all day. I love to put some lavender into this pendant and where it out while doing errands. Frankly, the public is infuriating and when dealing with them while trying to get things done as soon as possible, aggravation is sure to occur. A little lavender is enough to ease the tension and any headaches that might occur.

I hadn't actually expected to receive this item yet, as it was due to be delivered this upcoming week. So shipping was astoundingly fast, especially for coming from China! I'm thoroughly impressed by this product and will probably order another in the bronze sometime soon!

"I received the Aromatherapy Diffuser Necklace Antique Bronze Essential Oils Locket Pendant With 8 Refilled and Washable Pads in Gift Box. Firstly, I this did not disappoint. I've been dying to have one of these necklaces, and so happy to finally have one. Let's start with the necklace it self. The necklace is light weight and very comfortable. It hangs just right on my neck. It has a very flattering design that shows color (from the pds). I love the Antique Bronze color, it goes with pretty much everything.
It comes with 8 colors of Pad refills that are reusable. I love this, as I can match it with what I'm wearing for the day. They are very easy to wash, with soap and water.
I received this at a discounted price for my honest review.",5.0

I absolutely love this little cloud!!! I'm so absent minded & this keeps my keys quickly accessible right by my front door. All I have to do is pull lightly as I rush out in the morning! It's strong enough to hold all my keys & it looks adorable on my wall. Would def buy again. Just pull back the paper covering the adhesive & press against the wall. That simple. No drilling required so that's a bonus.  Happy I made this purchase,5.0

"This product has good design features and accommodates several sized phones, tablets, pads, to be charged simultaneously. The front slots will hold the slimmer phones (without and thick protective cover) in the upright position. Note that in the picture you can see the upright position for the Samsung from Verizon has to be upside down for the charging cable to plug in to the phone. The phone that is in the horizontal position is on a protective case and is on the slot at the back. It is too thick to stand upright.
The two front slots can also accommodate a phone lying lengthwise, but the phone would need to be more to the left and out of the way of the ""watch stand"".
The watch stand has an embedded magnet and it connects to the base with that. I used the watch stand to thread the charging wires up to the phones. There is a nice hole in the top of it that works for this purpose.
There are several holes at the back of the stand for pens etc.
The footprint of this stand is small and tidy. For me, that means that the devices I have to charge will not be strewn all over the place; the wires will be where I need them for a charge and the phones and devices can be read while being charged. And all around good design.

I really like this diffuser.  Very pretty LED lights and puts out a nice mist.  I like that I can use it from 100ml to 500ml. It gives me options for how long I want to run it. I can smell my essential oils when diffusing.,5.0
"I received this Essential Oil Diffuser just a few days after I ordered them. It showed up in perfect condition and was very well packaged! I have been using aromatherapy and essential oils for a while now and decided it was time for a diffuser. What I like about this one is it has cool mist; its very quiet and has multiple run time options including a basic on / off for overnight use. There are also different colors for the nightlight option if needed and a no light setting as well. My husband snores a lot and the added moisture in the bedroom has helped reduce his snoring.
I did receive this for a discounted price for a fair and honest review... however, I try to work with items I need so I can give them a real trial, and thus my opinions and experiences are a real and true reflection of my experience with the product.

Another beautiful scent locket from HOTOR. I love the scent lockets made by this company. This is my second one and it's just as beautiful as the first one. This locket arrived much earlier than the estimated delivery date. It's made of some type of silver colored metal which I believe is steel. It's meant to keep a piece of material that is soaked in scented oil inside the locket and the scent is released or enhanced by the body heat. If you have scented fragrance oils this is a wonderful way to use them. The company includes three scent pads in pink white and black. These pads fit perfectly inside the locket. My only problem with the pads is that i can't reuse them. I will have to use cotton or fabric to soak up the oil once I use up the pads. I have many scent lockets made by Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab which I also wear but it's nice to switch off once in awhile. These lockets also remind me of jewelry made by Lois Hill. At one time that company made silver lockets that looked similar to these.,5.0

These are perfect for my diffuser. Nice and thick.  Watch other replacements are not thick and thats ok if your diffuser uses thinner ones.,5.0
"I use it every day and love it. I gave one to my friend as a gift (she has lots of headaches).  She uses it every day too and on the days with a headach she uses peppermint oil and it helps her a lot.

"I recently ordered an aromatherapy diffuser necklace that came with 5 pads for different scents.  I decided that I needed more pads for wearing different essential oils so I went ahead and ordered this kit.  I have to say that I am impressed with the pads.  They are about 3 times thicker than the ones that came with my necklace.  I've included a side by side comparison photo.  They fit perfectly in the necklace, despite the extra thickness as well.  I love that they are all different colors.  I tend to equate different essential oils with a color so keeping track of what oil I used on each pad will be a lot easier.  I also like that with all the colors available, I can color coordinate them with my clothes.  Disclosure! I was allowed to review this product at a  discount in return for my honest opinion.  All opinions expressed in this review are my own and the rating given is a reflection based off of my personal interaction with the product.  I keep my reviews fair as I also make my purchasing decisions based off of other's reviews as well and would hate to be led wrong.",5.0

This necklace is one of two that I own and I have to say it is my fave! It comes with three felt circles to apply oil to and they aren't cut too big like some are so the fit in the necklace nicely. The finish in the necklace is a brushed nickel look and it pairs nicely with lots of outfits.,5.0
"This mount has two of the best features I've seen, and I own four different car mounts for my phone.  Two stick to the dash, but my dashboard is at an angle and farther away than the air vents, so even though they work, I didn't much like them and had to scrape the taped portion of it off my dash.  I also tried one which clamped to the air vent, but the clamp had to by tightened by awkwardly turning a screw with your hand.  No matter how hard I tightened it, it would fall off within a couple of days, usually while I was trying to put my phone in it or rotate the phone.
This mount is a unique approach I've hadn't seen elsewhere, and I  didn't even know it until I got it.  The part that attaches to the vent looks like a clamp in the picture, unfortunately, but it's not.  It's a spring loaded device that completely encircles the air vent once it's attached making it impossible to fall off.  It also only takes a second to attach.  The other part I like about it are the arms that extend from the portion that holds the phone back to your dashboard keeping it from moving out of position.  It's more stable than the other air vent mount I tried.  The mount also has rubber lined grips with arms at the bottom of the base, both of which keep the phone from sliding out of place.  I can't think of any way they could improve it.  Highly recommend!",5.0
"I have been looking for an energy-saving aromatherapy lamp. This lamp can function (without oils and light) as a decent humidifier for a smaller room. When I added essential oils, it dispersed them nicely.

That said, the user manual is one of the most confusing and complicated I have encountered -- especially for a fairly simply item. The instructions seem to indicate that you may need to clean this every 24 hours and then let another 24 hours pass to dry out. And there are many thingd that may void any warranty offered.

I really like that you can use this as a small humidifier without any oil. And my experience has been that using essential oils in the amount recommended will do well with a small room -- but not a big room.

I was looking for an efficient (LED) aromatherapy diffuser that could fill the (smaller) spaces I have. It does.

"Im really pleased with these little felt discs. Theyve been packaged in a nice, resealable plastic pouch, where Ill be able to store them easily for future use. There are 11 of them, each one a different color. The pink disc is a little more vibrant than the one that came with my necklace, and I like it the better for it.

The main difference Im happy about, however, is the fact that these discs are just a little bit bigger than the original ones. With those, I found that the discs were a little too small for the recess in the pendant. It was a small thing, but it was still annoying. It wasn't very noticeable when the pendant was closed, but it was a little, if one were to look closely. These still don't fit perfectly, and are a little on the small side, but they're definitely an improvement over the ones that came with the pendant.

They hold the smell applied to them for ages, which is the same as the original pads. They work really well to carry about the smell of essential oils, as well as perfume, which is another use I put these to.

Im happy to have more than the three different colors, and all of them so vibrant! They show up well through the slots of the diffuser pendant, and make it easier to match what Im wearing. They have a smoother edge than the original discs as well. I don't know if that is better or not, just different. The original ones looked as if the round edge was melted during the cutting process, while these do not have that same look or feel. Maybe that is why they are a little bigger? Whatever the case, I love them!

I love this thing! I had a small space to hang a key holder so that I will (hopefully) stop misplacing my keys.

"Was very happy that this came a few day early! But it is so neat and solid wood. I was worried that it would be small but it is a perfect size. And matches my bedside table. I have a tablet, iPhone and apple watch and with all that going on next to my bed there are wires everywhere! So this made my apple's happy. Even if you don't have an apple product but you have even just tablet and phone this would still work great! and there are nice size holes in the back to stick stylets for your electronics. The great thing is the watch plugs into it nice and neatly from the bottom to make less wire mess. I did receive this at an discounted price for my honest unbiased opinion.",5.0
"I wasn't so sure about this when I ordered it, but I absolutely love this thing! I am going to buy a second one to keep in my office too. I like to watch Netflix on my phone while I am cooking dinner or doing other tasks while I am sitting in one place. I usually am leaning my phone up against something. It slides down and falls onto the counter and over and over and I keep setting it back up so I can see the display. I get food or water or whatever all over my phone in the process. This device holds my phone at the perfect angle for me to be able to watch whatever I want without worrying about my phone falling. Its cute and kind of goofy and the color was really pretty, but it is extremely useful!

"Very cute necklace. And I love aromatherapy so this is perfect. Mine did come without pads for some reason, but it's ok I just made some. I also added a different chain as this one just felt cheap.

"I recently bought the brand new Apple Watch Sport Model. Having bought the I new watch, I needed to buy some accessories for it. One of the first items I needed to purchase was a stand for the watch. Not just a stand, but one that was made with quality and that was easy to set up and one that could hold my iPhone 6 Plus and iPad Air 2. Also, I travel across the world frequently, so I needed something that I could easily pack, that was portable, but also very sturdy.

In my search for a stand I found the HOTOR Apple Watch Stand that was carved from bamboo. This stand is awesome! The stand is built with strong and sturdy construction because HOTOR built it with bamboo . This bamboo wood stand is solidly built and because of the way it's crafted, it's has a better stabilization. Plus it's natural look is very classy and chic for wherever you choose to place it. It's designed to perfectly to hold and support the Apple Watch at a perfect 45 degree angle as the watch charges (along with your smart phone and tablet). This stand is also designed that once your Apple Watch, smart phone and tablet on it, your items won't slip or fall off.

This stand fits perfectly on my desk at my office and on the night stand beside my bed at night. The bottom line is that the  stand is designed to work and fit anywhere. Plus I always receive numerous comments from my co-workers about how nice looking it is as well.",5.0

"I really like this oil diffuser. I bought it for in my son's room to diffuse lavender oil at night. My son really enjoys having this in his room and it actually cuts out the need for his night light due to the soft glow it gives off. I was hesitant to purchase due to prior reviews stating a small mist stream, but I have come to find out that it works perfectly for my son's room. The small stream deters my son from wanting to put his hand above the steam stream, because it is not as noticeable. I was also worried about the small stream not properly diffusing the oil thorough the room but my son's room is 10ft by 9ft, and this diffuser distributes the oil throughout the room. I really enjoy the timer on this item, as I can set it for two hours and it is on prior to and just as he falls asleep. My son has complimented this diffuser a couple times, and it has been a great hit with him. Disclaimer: This item was received at a discounted price for an honest review.",5.0
"This HOTOR wood stand is everything it needs to be and more.  The picture doesn't even show that the stand has three cutouts for my apple pen or any stylus.  As described the stand will hold your Apple Watch using a removable stand being held by a magnet.  There is a cutout that holds the cord in place while the watch is connected to the charger.  There are two spaces for your phone which is very convenient  for someone like me who has a work phone and personal phone.  You can display the phone either horizontal or vertically and your phone is more then secure.
  Now to the iPad holder cutout.  This for sure as advertised will hold your iPad mini and iPad Air.  I am a little hesitant to put the IPad pro in this as it may not be long enough for Horizontal display and sturdy enough for vertical display.  I do wish this part was a little bit larger to take away any doubt or apprehension but at any rate this stand is of high quality and is very useful on a nightstand or on a desk.  I like to be able to organize my devices while charging them so that they aren't taking up so much unneeded space.  I am grateful for the opportunity to receive this product at a discount to review and really encourage anyone looking for a high quality wood stand to hold all or most all your devices while they charge.",5.0

"This product is just what it says it is and just as the picture shows. It's perfect for me just to hold my phone while driving, and especially great for when I am using the GPS feature on my phone. I usually have my phone on my lap when using the GPS and we all know that is not the best idea, as looking down can cause an accident. If you happen to be someone who usually keeps your phone in your lap while trying to use the GPS then you NEED this product! Not only for the hands free aspect but for the safety of not looking down while driving! I mean let's be honest, how many times has your phone slid off your lap and onto the floor at your feet? This product stops that issue too! It fits my Galaxy S6 perfect and holds well on the windshield. I did have some problems with the vent clip however and it did get a little smooshed while trying to get it to clip. That may have just been a user error. I will try it again, but I really prefer to keep it on the windshield anyway. That is just personal preference. I don't know why I waited this long to make this purchase. This thing will gets lots of use! I did receive this product at a discounted rate for my unbiased review.",5.0
"Just as advertised. Stuck to the wall and the magnet is very strong. It held both sets of keys that I have. I was glad to see that it was able to hold my keys that have some rather bulky keychains on it. I was worried the weight of the keys might be too much, but the keys have been on the wall for most of the day and haven't fallen off. It's such a great product for some like myself that is always losing their keys. Now maybe I won't spend 10 minutes once a week running through my house trying to find my keys.

"I ordered this necklace for my daughter. She sometimes suffers from anxiety and we have found that aromatherapy/essential oils can help her. She carries a roller bottle in her backpack for school that she can usr to apply the essential oils as needed, but I wanted some way for her to utilize the aromatherapy to help her, especially during times she may not be able to access her backpack (like during testing, for example) My sister who sells essential oils recommended I look for a necklace diffuser. I wanted to find something that was pretty and didn't look like anything other than just a piece of jewelry.

First I must tell you that this piece is beautiful, the picture does not give it justice. It coms in a vary nice gift box, so if you are giving this as a gift that is something to consider. The different color pads give you options, being able to switch them out to match your outfit or using a color for different scents. My daughter loves the black because it really makes the silver design ""pop"". The length of the chain is on the longer side, which I was not sure my daughter would like, but she has learned that it is long enough to pull up closer to her nose is she feels like she needs the effects of the aromatherapy more, or as she called it ""if I need to take a hit""....teenagers. The ring on the diffuser is big enough you should be able to switch chains pretty easily if you wanted to. My daughter is considering putting hers on a silk rope because she like that look more and then she could just tie it at her desired length.

Chances are if you are searching for something like this you are at least somewhat familiar with the benefits of aromatherapy. This is a beautiful inconspicous way to achieve the results you are looking for. I wish I would have thought of something like this back when I used to work in a hospital, having something nice smelling close to my face would have probably been useful from time to time :) I am considering getting one for myself and my other daughter, we both suffer from  migraine headaches so these might help us also.

Although I received this product for reduced/free in exchange for my honest opinion, it is my honest opinion/review of this product. I am also a regular Amazon shopper and I rely on review for my decisions so I always strive to reviews that are as honest based my my experience.

"This diffuser necklace is perfect for wearing your favorite scents! I LOVE wearing spearmint, lime and stress away essential oils. IT's my ""happy"" scent! The diffuser part is pretty big, about the size of a 50 cent piece. But it is really light. It's not heavy at all like I thought it might be.
The picture shows 3 felt pieces that come with the necklace. I got a total of 5! The 3 pictured are thicker, heavier felt. The two additional ones that I got are thinner - standard thickness I would say. The colors pictured are accurate - black, white and a pretty light pink. The additional ones are purple and tan. I like having the extra options and colors. The locket it a pretty, shiny silver and can be work with just about anything.
I only tested this using therapeutic grade essential oils, I did not try actual perfumes or body sprays - I don't own any. Being that I am used to essential oils, I added about 3 drops, depending on the blend that I was using. The scent lasted all day! I would get a whiff throughout the day just by my normal body movements. If it was a particularly stressful day and I was wearing Stress Away I would hold it up to my nose as needed and take some deep breaths to help melt away the stressful feeling.
The chain is a little too long for my liking. The diffuser part sits right at breast level. Some like them long, I prefer a little shorter.
Make sure to take out the felt pads when you're not using, it will help to keep the necklace from tarnishing. I just clean the necklace with a drop of lemon essential oil if needed.
Overall I really enjoy this necklace, I plan on getting one for my daughter to wear to school to help her stay focused and I think this will work just fine.

This product is just as stated. It is perfect for a bedside diffuser. The only thing I would caution is it does not have a plug to connect from the USB cord they send to stick into the wall. On the positive side of that though is I can use it in my car!!! I have been looking for something like this for my car for quite some time! I have a USB connector in my car and this works great for that. If you do not have a USB connector in your car you can buy an adaptor and it will fit into the 12V charger. This is a perfect mini diffuser and I highly recommend getting it. I was able to get a discount when I purchaced mine in return for a review.

"I recently purchased my daughter an aromatherapy diffuser pendant necklace from this same company which she's really excited about, but it only comes with 3 pads - white, black, and pink. I was so happy to find these since it will give her so many other color choices to dress it up a little!  The colors shown in the description are very accurate - there is white, black, purple, royal blue, aqua blue, magenta (a little darker than hot pink), burgundy, light pink, lime green, orange, and yellow. I like that they are also made by Hotor so we knew they would be compatible with her pendant. These are made of a thick, sturdy, felt-like material. Not only are the pads reusable, they can also be washed up to 5 times, so she should get plenty of use out of them.

"Love this under umbrella light. It is easy to add onto the pole and has four surprisingly bright lights that light up the table below.
I like that it works on 3 AA batteries as I always have these types of batteries around. I also see what looks like a place to attach an electrical cord which would be a great addition should I want to run it on electricity (it seems the cord is not included).
The fact that the lights are so well spaced, means that all sides of the table get well lit.
I would definitely recommend this light.

"This bamboo stand is exactly what I was looking for!  I have an iPhone 6 and it fits perfectly on this stand, exactly as shown in the picture.  I read books on my phone, and this stand lets me multitask by eating breakfast and being able to read at the same time.  I do sometimes put the stand and phone on a box or something to elevate it, but it may not be necessary for everyone.  This stand is also a good place to just place your phone when you're not using it, and it doesn't get lost or covered with papers on the table.  The stand comes with little feet to stick on the bottom - I used it for a few days without the feet and never had a problem with it sliding.  I added the feet and now it stays put no matter what.

"I received this little guy today, and I love it. It is light-colored bamboo, just as pictured; the edges are very smooth. I am always laying my phone down and then covering it up with mail, etc.  I can set my iPhone 5 on it vertically, or horizontally.  The only way it can be charged while on this stand is to do it in horizontal/landscape mode, but that is not a problem to me.

"As photographer I'm always looking for different ways to use lights and shadows on my subject.  When I first saw this Rechargeable Camping Light I thought it looked like a smaller version of the ever so popular ICE light photographers rave about but the cost is hefty (nearly $500).  Upon getting this in the mail I was surprised at the packaging being in a tube with everything I needed to keep it charged and work it.  I love the multiple settings it has and how well it fits in your hand.  Each setting is noticeably a different brightness.  I'm excited to put this to use in my photography business as well as during our summer camping trips.

I was given this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",5.0
I gave this to my daughter for her infants room. It puts out a good amount of humidity without overdoing it. Its small enough to go on the nightstand without being intrusive. I gave her lavendar oil with it and just a couple drops soothes the fussy baby. She loves the night light on it to nurse the baby by so he will go right back to sleep. Wonderful product.,5.0
"I really like the design of this diffuser. It's sleeker than most, which I find really attractive. Functionally this diffuser works really well. It puts a good amount of mist out but doesn't get anything wet. I also love how it has time settings for automatic shut off.",5.0
"As advertised, this product shows bright colors or you can that function off. Really diffuses the oil well and the scent really carries throughout the room. Very user friendly when reading the enclosed instructions. A+ product!",5.0
"I'm quite impressed with this handy light. It's almost like a glow stick, holds nicely in your hand and seems like it's well made for everything it offers. I have many reasons to like this light... the first one being that it is rechargeable. So many times you go through so many batteries on with flashlights. This charges the same as a cell phone,  it actually is that same as my phone I currently have. The charging cord had a USB end to connect to a computer, adapter or you could charge in a vehicle using the cell phone charging adapter. I have a mega power pack we use for charging devices when camping that would also work well to charge this in emergency situations.
  Another reason I really like this light is because it is LED ,the light is very bright with 4 different modes of brightness and a mode where the light flashes.  With the bulb being LED you get longer battery life on a charge. It comes with 2 carrying /wrist cords that can be attached at either end or both. I find this would work excellent to hang this light inside of a tent etc. ..The size of this is also nice it will pack in just about anywhere.  I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. I am very happy with this purchase and look forward to using it next camping season.",5.0
Love this diffuser! Already used it multiple times and I just got it yesterday. It seems like a good quality and it's a great size for a small room. I am very pleased with it!,5.0
It's nicely made. Retuned because I didn't really need it and you can't really charge it while it's in this dock.,5.0
"Light has several settings. Each one increasing in brightness. The last setting flashes...which would be good in an emergency or an impromptu dance party! Haha! You just click the button on the device until you get to the desired light setting. With the final click, the device turns off again. It's about 1 foot long and a little bigger than a quarter in diameter. Easy to charge and convenient to carry with the included wrist straps.

I was given this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",5.0
what a great product. I don't know why anybody else has thought of it. its great for hanging keys up...the magnet is strong enough to hold 2 sets of keys with many keys on it.,5.0
"This is a great light.  It has low, medium, high, and shrobe.  Very bright on high but when you only need low light it is great.  You are able to use on low in a tent for example to find what you are looking for without waking the person next to you.  Can't sleep, use this light on low to read by and not wake the person next to you.  There are a million ways this light can be useful.  I look forward to exploring all I am of coming up with.  Recharges with my car charger for my phone too.  Great convenience.  This would be good for kids camping out.  Rechargable battery has long life for hours of seeing in the dark. I received a discount in exchange for writing a review.",5.0
"This is a very nice tabletop/umbrella light. Used it during a power outage and it easily lit up a 12x12 room for several hours. This unit is very light (less than a pound), so it won't help weight down your umbrella, but it fit mine with no issues. The light weight would make it an excellent light to take camping if you needed to carry your things with you.

"This cloud-shaped key holder is delightful - a very whimsical style that can hold even my husband's super-heavy key ring. It'll hold up anything magnetic, even my dog leashes, with very strong magnets. It has a cloud-shaped sticky backing that was a breeze to install. I received this product at a discount for my honest review and have been using it for several weeks now - I absolutely love it.

There are two spots to hang keys due to the magnets that are used. Every part of this is high-quality, from the backing, to the ultra-powerful magnets, to the perfectly smooth plastic cloud shape.",5.0

"I needed a small, effective, and attractive portable aromatherapy diffuser to bring with me to massage appointments. This one more than fits the bill!

The diffuser has a very low hum and pleasant bubbling sound but if music were playing during a session I doubt you would be able to hear it. The light cycles through the different colors or you have the option of clicking the button again to pause the light on a specific color. I love the light wood colored base paired with the colors. I went with the recommended 4 drops per 100 mL of water the first time I used it and that worked to fill a small room with a pleasant level of scent.",5.0

I use this all the time!!! All day when I'm home. I love that it shuts itself off and I can set timer also just in case I run out to work without remembering to turn it off. I love the night light feature also..... I can't say anything bad about it!!!,5.0
I received this in great time. I tried it out first thing!! It has a USB adapter so you'll need a bubble to plug it into the wall. It diffused my oils perfectly. I love the timer!! The glow is great and has two levels.,5.0
"Great Diffuser, I love this diffuser and have used it everyday over the last month so much healthier than those carcinogenic plug in air freshners. I use a couple of drop of bergamot oil mixed with water in this diffuser it fills the room with a very subtle pleasant aroma for hours. I couldn't be happier. I love the look of diffuser  and the the way it changes color is cool.",5.0

"This is a great little essential oil diffuser for the money.  If you are holding back purchasing a diffuser because they can be costly I'd recommend this one. It works great. We put it in my daughters room. It helps her sleep with relaxing lavender when she is stressed and helps with sinus congestion when we add peppermint, and also adds a fine mist of moisture to the air.",5.0
"Works perfectly as advertised. Looks great with apple products. The metallic finish complements MacBooks and iPads very well. The charger fits perfectly. The aluminum watch stand is admittedly lightweight, but I have had no problems using my 42mm stainless steel watch with the lightweight sports band and the heavier leather loop with magnetic closure. The non stick material underneath it makes it stick perfectly to my mirrored glass night table. It takes almost no room on my night stand and its size makes it portable enough to travel with if you wanted to. I love it and now will have to get one for my daughter too!! Highly recommended, especially at this low price point. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",5.0
This oil diffuser is awesome. We love it!!  I like the way that it changes colors and that you also have the option to keep it on 1 solid color or you can choose not to have any color at all. It is very soothing and relaxing and I also like that it has a 4 hour shut off built into it so your water never dries up and you kills your machine.  I have seen these kind of machines before and wanted one but they were always so expensive and this one is great and easy to use for the money.,5.0
I bought this item on a discount from the seller. Packaging was a frosted white box which could be reusable for another gift. The LED light is bright or can be dimmed and the timer on the mist can be changed. This item works well and I love it!!!,5.0

"After owning a small oil diffuser, I was in the market to get a bigger size diffuser for my large living room and going through less hassles re-pouring water every 3 hours. Once this product arrived, it was so easy to set it up and get started with my oils. My baby loved all the colors that changed in this diffuser and could watch this product for hours. On the other hand, my husband and I noticed right away that the smell from the essential oil I used was strong enough to pass it throughout entire room and within minutes we could smell lotus essential oil all over downstairs. It's not too strong but strong enough to create a fantastic smell all over the house. I highly recommend this product. It has several different features from how long you want this diffuser running 60, 120, 180 minutes and lights on or off. It was so simple to set up, you really don't need to read instructions. The only thing, I'd like to give a heads up. When the package arrives and you take the diffiser out, be aware the wall plug in is inside the diffuser. Simply open the top of the diffuser and everything you need will be inside.

"This diffuser is simple basic and compact just the height of my hand. It holds up to 100mls of water and no more then 3 drops of essential oils and runs continuously for up to 180 mins (3hrs) and has dim and bright white light options. One important thing to realize is that it plugs into a usb port, it does not have an electrical outlet plug in the kit. This makes it ideal for an office diffuser, but I honestly set it up in my living room using the base of an old cell phone charger after trying it several other places because I wanted something inconspicuous in the space and this just disappears against my white shelves. It works well, I have only used distilled water, so even though I cleaned it after three days, I saw no discernable buildup or lessening of steam or aroma. Note you need ascorbic acid for cleaning it, but I happen to keep.it in cabinet and it o took a few easy minutes to clean it.

Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount so that I could try it and share my honest and unbiased opinion about it with you.",5.0
"I purchased two different ultrasonic diffusers and of the two, this one is more attractive. I waited to review it until I had had chances to use it for several days and clean it once. It does require you to have ascorbic acid to clean it, but I actually did, and cleaning was easy. I have been using exclusively distilled water and there was no evidence of mineral build-up, but I can see how cleaning any oil residue would be important,so I intend to clean after every three days of use.  This diffuser runs continuously for the time you set it for, for up to 180 mins (3hrs) it can be left unlit or lit brightly or dimly, and I liked the bright setting for reading prebed stories. It takes no more then 3drops of essential oils and 100 mls of water, so if you want a blend it's best to premix it before adding it to the diffuser. The amount of steam is significant and can permeate the open front end of my house within 15 mins.

Personally, I don't need a diffuser with lots of colors and am fine with the continuous steam, if you want one that provides short bursts of steam, this is not for you, but for an attractive, simple option, this is a winner.

Everyone notices this on my desk! I am even considering ordering this as gift for some of my clients and friends!!! love it. simple and sleek!,5.0
"I love how compact and easy to move rooms this diffuser is! I have a larger one, that I sent way too much on (a mlm diffuser), thinking I would move it room to room. Nope, It's too much of a pain to get it set up in each room. This one is not small, but lightweight and petite enough where I easily take it back in forth from my office to my bedroom. It easily works filling up the whole room with the diffused oil. I know some diffusers have negative reviews for not working on enough square footage, this one is mighty. I love that it is USB charged. I plug it into my laptop and just face the oil to blow away from my computer. I also use it on my bedside table. I have an iHome docking station for my phone, which has a usb port where this plugs into. I love having all my essentials right at arms reach! If I get an upset tummy, I immediately diffuse without getting out of bed! Be sure to read the directions on how to remove old water. Then your diffuser will last forever!

I need this book to work on my parents sitting 95 chevy mark III van in the backyard.  It won't teach you how to blueprint the engine block but as far as maintenance (which is the only thing this old van really needs) it has mostly everything covered.,5.0
"So, I bought a 1988 Chevy Van thinking I would make a road trip from San Francisco to Portland in it. Alas, my $800 road trip van had some problems. Brake warning light on all the time, oil pressure gauge that jumped all over when I drove it. Anyway, I decided I would ""fix"" that van myself, so I bought this book. Being prone to long nights drinking and carousing in San Francisco and a procrastinator by nature, the van repair got put off for a bit. One sober day I decided to man up and start fixing the van. But where was the manual?

Hum! I looked high and low, and checked on Amazon to make sure I had actually bought it, which I had,  but I could not fine it anywhere. So I ask my girlfriend ""Hey, have you seem my Chilton manual for that van I bought?"" Her response was to point at a old bookcase in the corner of the hallway. ""Its there with my bibles and wedding planning books"" she said.

Hum, sounds like I am being set up. The problem is that this particular bookcase is right next to our super sized, four cat litter box. Being ignorant about littler box things, I stomped right over and, seeing my Chilton manual's spine, pulled it from the bookcase.

Well, as you probably guessed, the manual was not in it's original condition. It was somewhat damp, well actually, soaked with cat urine. It fell apart in my now urine soaked hands. If this was a movie, we would cut to a scene showing my girlfriend is cackling in the living room.

I guess what I am trying to say is that I have no idea if this manual is useful for GM Vans produced from 1987-1997. I sold the van soon afterwards and never gave it another thought. But my experience with other Chilton repair manuals had been very positive, so I guess this one would be good as well.",5.0

"The book is like most all Haynes books. I've bought like four of them. They always have detailed images with the descriptions that really tie the processes together.

"This rivet gun is garbage.

As others have said, there is a nut that slowly comes loose inside the head, eventually causing the gun to fail.  This nut is a pain in the neck to re-install, requiring you to have a long thin ratchet extension and to pull back a highly tensioned spring while making the repair..  If this happened after years or weeks I would give this item some slack, but I used this gun on only **THREE** rivets before this happened!  I installed three more and could see it loosening up again. That's completely unacceptable.  Do not waste your money on this product.",1.0

"I bought one of these because it looks about the same as the ACE brand model that I've used at my uncle's place. I used it on a few rivets, which it had a hard time gripping for some reason, and then I heard a snap. I took it apart and the rod between the handle and the head snapped. The metal was too thin. It's built too cheaply. Even the red grips are just a cheap plastic coating. I ended up going to ACE hardware to get the one they sell. I opened it up to see what that rod looks like and they use much thicker metal. Also, the grips they use are a soft rubber that makes using it more comfortable.",1.0
"Like most others who reviewed this tool, I thought I was buying an upgrade when my thirty year old no name riveter failed.  Was I fooled.  I've never in my life had a tool (or anything else, for that matter) fail so quickly.  I wasn't counting, but it probably worked for fewer than two dozen rivets when it started slipping and would no longer pop the rivet's mandrel.  What a disappointment.  Absolutely NOT RECOMMENDED.  I'd give it zero stars.",1.0
"Like everyone else said: it stopped working after a short time.  I haven't used one before so I thought all the slipping and not gripping might be normal, then it stopped working almost completely.  I ended up renting one the next day (another brand) and got more done in a few minutes then I did in many hours with this sub-functional product.  Under no circumstances would I allow a friend to purchase this product.",1.0
"Get a Malco 2 in 1 riveter, you won't regret spending the money. This is the worst riveter of the dozens I've used. I can't believe something like this even got out the door of quality control. Were they trying to build a tree ornament? Because it sure doesn't hold up to any riveting.",1.0
"I've used it several times but now that I'm in the middle of an important project, it completely fails.  I've taken it apart to try and fix it but no go.

The head split and broke within the first 5 rivets I used it for. Wouldn't recommend this one. Try another brand or a higher quality.,1.0

"I had used this model in the past and liked the convenience of the swivel head, so when it was time to pick up a rivet gun of my own for some projects I chose the same one.
Unfortunately I experienced the same problems as other reviewers. The very first time I tried to use it, it jammed up and wouldn't release the rivet. Twice I disassembled it to get it free and try again, to no avail.
I replaced it with a different brand and threw this one in the trash. The swivel head is a great idea if you get one that works, but based on all the poor reviews I think you'd be taking a risk buying this.",1.0
"This Arrow pop rivet gun seemed like a good choice to replace my cheap no name  gun that lasted for years and popped many rivets.

This is a ExcessUPS battery. It is clearly not am APC battery. Ir does not have the APC label and does not have the capacity that the APC battery in this class has.

"Very, very, very disappointed!!!

 I looked up and searched for an APC RBC4 battery, and when I found the item and looked at the product image and it showed a battery with APC logo, and I ordered what I thought was an APC battery, opting for the more expensive APC $45 battery over a clone $25 battery believing I was getting a real APC product.

I am not sure how I am to handle this. The item being reviewed even states ""APC Replacement Batter Cartridge RBC4"", which is exactly what I wanted, not  a ""unknown brand"" look alike!

Not what I expected from AMAZON or Amazon retailers!",1.0
"I purchased this ""name brand"" battery rather than a generic equivalent because I was led to beleive that return postage was prepaid to recycle the old battery. When I received my battery, there was no prepaid sticker for the shipping box, but rather there was mention of a website for further instructions. The website had a message indicating that they no longer handle these types of batteries, but to return the battery to a local recycling center for automotive batteries. Before I spend another 5 bucks in gas to drive this battery somewhere, I think this bad boy will be hitting the trash can. I own several more APC UPS's, but the next time I need a battery replacement, I'll go with a much cheaper alternative than APC. (bait and switch??)",1.0
"This is the third strike for APC in my book.  Their equipment has now failed me three times.  Three different models over the years have worked fine until the batteries were expended, then I buy replacements and the unit is trashed.  With the higher end XS900 I assumed it would be fine with the replacements, but the charging circuit is not working.  Batteries have been test and they are fine so I'm assuming APC designs products that won't survive the death of the first set of batteries. So these two new batteries go in the pile of perfectly functional batteries that have nothing to go in.

I've learned my lesson and will try another brand of UPS.  This product (the battery) works fine for me, but I'm scoring low to warn folks to think twice about flushing money down the toilet if they aren't sure that the unit will work with new batteries.  I'm off the cycle of replacing the hardware and strongly recommend you skip the replacements and go buy another brand.",1.0

I don't know why these pads fall apart so fast but I only used each one less than 15 minutes and they broke up and pieces of foam flew all over the room.  I think I should get my money back???????  I usually don't write negative reviews but there is really something wrong with the quality of this foam pad.,1.0

Update, 4 months later. No problems with the creeper. I am using it to go under my semi truck and trailer The only issue is that ""The Rough Rider""is little bit to high (with me on it) to pass under the brake chambers of the truck and trailer. It is a good product but should be like 4-5 inch lower to be used under semi truck. I purchased exactly this model, because the manufacturer stated that the Rough Ryder is widely used with low enforcement DOT. This is a false advertisement right here. I don't see any DOT inspector using this, if he can not go under the brake chambers, They probably using modified version or something else.

Contacted the company to complain about the head and neck rest. Talked to the owner. Absolutely disgusting how he will not stand behind his product to fix the problem. Problem is the head and neck rest is molded in a 3 dimensonal logo out of some very hard product. Feels like a bunch of rocks under your head or neck.

"(This review is for the battery powered model)  In 2001 I bought two Park-Zone PZ-1100 battery powered devices, one for each of my cars.  To this day they work flawlessly.  The batteries last about a year.  In 2008 I bought a new PZ-1100 for my mother, but it didn't work correctly it had all the symptoms described by other reviewers - green light never comes on, yellow and red only occasionally.  So I tried another new one, exact same symptoms.  Then I noticed a visible difference between the new units and my older units.  The current PZ-1100 has two 1/2 inch ultrasonic speakers, whereas my older PZ-1100 had a single one inch speaker.  I also noticed a slight change in the company name; the original single speaker models were made by Measurement Specialties in Fairfield, NJ.  The newer dual-speaker models are made by Measurement LTD, Inc. in Parsippany, NJ.  I suspect there has been an ownership change.  I decided to try and find an older Park-Zone like my original units.  I found several people selling the older version of PZ-1100 which has the single speaker.  You can tell whether it's the old or new by the photo on the box.  Even though the boxes look identical, if you look closely at the picture on the box you can see if the transmitter has one or two speakers.  I recently purchased a single-speaker PZ-1100 and it works great just like my original units. I bought another one from a different seller and it also works great.  I'll give one to my mother and keep the other as a spare.  In case anyone is tempted by the AC powered models, check out their user instructions and you'll discover that if the power fails it will not automatically switch to battery power, so you will lose your settings.  I briefly lose AC power several times a year so for me the battery powered model is actually more reliable.  And no you won't crash into your wall if the batteries go dead, because either you'll see a flashing red light as you enter the garage, or it will be completely dead.  Either way when you don't get that reassuring green light as you enter your garage you'll know you have to park it the old fashioned way this time.  Since that only happens about once a year it's not a big deal. ***Updated 2-21-09*** Another reviewer (Theseus on February 7, 2009) made an excellent point that Park Zone isn't designed to get you within inches of your wall, since the mimimum range is 1.3 feet.  As long as that's not your situation, I find that Park Zone very accurately places my cars in the exact spot every time, giving me the exact clearance that I want at both the front and rear of my cars.  Before Park Zone I was always worried that I hadn't pulled my car far enough into the garage, but with Park Zone I don't even look when I close the automatic garage door, after several years of use it has never put me in the wrong spot.",1.0
"I recieved as a gift and thought it was great, for a while. The green light is so dim you cannot see it. I called and was told that was normal and it is caused by the green lens being too thick. This is wrong, the green LED is too dim. If I wasn't happy they suggested I return it.",1.0
"We purchased two parkzones. One we sent it back already and the other one sits on the wall with dead batteries.

You can't use 2 in the same garage as they interfere with each other. Batteries don't last longer than 1 month and yellow to red indications are inconsistent. Sometimes the red indicator doesn't come on until you are inches from the wall, other times the back end of the car is still blocking the garage door from closing. At times the unit doesn't come on at all????

I don't recommend this unit unless you want to risk crunching the garage door onto your car or drive into the wall of your garage.",1.0
"Well, I had wanted this for a long time.  Just got one for Christmas and couldn't wait to get it installed.  We followed all the instructions, even measured.  But if I didn't have the sense to stop short of the wall, I would have hit it because the light never turned on.  If it did turn on, it would turn on way too late.  Poor produdct, :(",1.0
"I had to replace my old park zone and bought this one.  I didn't realize that this was not exactly the same as the older version.  It looked the same but it did not work the same.  When I installed it on the wall, I was able to calibrate it with no problems.  The lights blinked as it should and thought I was ready to go.  When I came home from work, the lights did not light up at all as I tried to park the car.  I recalibrated and tried again but the lights would not come on.  I decided to return the item.  It was not the same as the older version.  Unfortunately the old version is no longer available.",1.0
"I still have my original PZ-1100 which has worked fine. However...when I needed a second one...I bought the PZ-1500. The first thing I noticed was that it had 2 sensors. This proved to be very difficult to position as it has a WIDE area the it senses...as opposed to the one sensor unit.

Recently it stopped working and I discovered the power supply was bad. Thinking that it merely had failed I reverted to using batteries. There is something wrong in the unit (which undoubtably blew the power supply) because it 'eats' a new set of batteries in 3 days!!! It is out of warrantee and I will not send it back for repairs.

I thought that I might get another PZ-1100...but I see that it now also has 2 sensors...and from all the customer reviews...'eats' batteries. The OLD PZ-1100 was a good unit and the battery life has been exceptional.

Too bad the design has changed...and for that reason I guess I will go back to the tennis ball for my wife's car. I notice from reading all the customer reviews that I am not alone in my thinking and that many people wish they could also get the OLD PZ-1100.

I would NOT recommend buying either Park Zone!!!!",1.0
This parking device turned out to be completely useless because its sensor does not work correctly within the range of 1.3 feet - manual states that and I observed that as well. If I would not need to park the car closer than 1.3 feet to garage wall then I would not need this device at the first place.,1.0
"I purchased the Park-Zone PZ-1500 for my Father-in-Law for father's day and upon installing the device in his garage found that it would not work.  He installed the unit where an identical one was once mounted which finally died after about 12 years of operation, however the new parking device, despite several attaempts would not function. I will be returning it for a refund.",1.0
"This was extremely disappointing. I have had a version of this for both of my cars for the last few years. One of them seemed to be dying so I bought this as a replacement. The difference was startling. My old one had a reliable green, yellow, red sequence. Red came on reliably at the same point. This unit did not. The picture with the light pushed through the garage wall that someone posted said it all. It is completely unreliable. It usually does nothing until the red light comes on and then you have no idea whether the car is in the right spot or not. I took it off and repaired my old unit instead.",1.0
"I have the 2-sensor version and it hardly ever works.  Every now and then the lights will go from green to red as advertised, but sometimes it will just sit at yellow even after you have passed the safe point.  In fact, today, mine stayed yellow so I advanced the car and completely obliterated the sensor with the cars bumper.  After the sensor was completely crushed, it still read yellow, and it never changed to red.  I guess I'm a glutton for punishment because I went and ordered another one, this time the version with only 1-sensor.  I'm hoping that the reviews below are accurate and the 1-sensor version is much better.",1.0
"I purchased 2 of the Park Zone 1500 based on my neighbors experience with an older model. The older model has one sensor and works great all of the time. The new model that I received has two sensors and works sporadically at best. I have at least twenty holes in the wall from trying to get a suitable location for the sensors. I have a car and a minivan and when I enter the garage with either, end up backing in and out several times just to get the unit to light up. My neighbors goes from green to yellow then red every time. Very disappointed.",1.0
I bought 2 of these for my garage.  They functioned fine until after a few months one quit working.  I did not bother sending it back because it wasn't worth the effort.  The other quit working before it was a year old.  Neither works with battery or AC power.  I wish had saved my money and used a tennis ball on a string instead of this gadget.,1.0
"This thing is completely unreliable.  I tried a variety of sensor heights and distances, and THREE DIFFERENT CARS.  I moved everything else away from the sensor but the red light would not come on.  I could have driven right through the wall without it telling me to stop.

Apparently, based on the other reviews, a few people have gotten lucky, but there are also plenty of other people like me for whom it would not work at all.  The odds aren't in your favor.",1.0
The new model has two sensors as opposed to one larger sensor on the original model. The original is problem free while the new seems to have problems finding the car.,1.0

"I've owned this device for about six months now.  I installed it according to manufacturer's recommendations.  My garage is clean and new.  The device is unable to reliably detect the position of our honda odyssey.  It appears to calibrate the initial position fine, which is about 3 feet from the wall.  But any subsequent attempts to park only produce a yellow light as I get less than a foot from the wall.  I presume that it is a problem with the sharp nose of our van.  I rigged up a bracket to angle the transmitter at about a 45 degree angle from the wall at a height of about five feet from the floor in hopes of reflecting the ultrasound better off the angled hood of our van, but this only marginally improved things.  Overall, I can't rely on it to safely park our car.  I should have returned it.",1.0
"I don't have easy access to electrical outlets on the far side of my garage, and I don't want to be running wires everywhere, so I ran both of the units I bought of off Batteries. They worked great at first, but the battery life if very disapointing, I think because the don't go off quickly enough. To change the batteries you have to take it off the wall, and it loses its distance setting, so you need a second person to direct you while you pull in the car. After changing the batteries every month it seemed like, I got sick of it, both devices are still up on the but not being used. I'm going to look into the Laser of the stop stick.",1.0
I bought one via amazon.com by auto alley.  Had problems from the start.  Did not work on AC power.  Maybe because the power supply put out 15.6 volts instead of 9 volts listed.  Even 9 volts seemed high when the unit takes 4AA batteries or 1.3 volt x 4 = 5.2 volts.  Unit did not set up at all on AC power but did on batteries.  Even than the Green light did not light when parking though the yellow and red did. Could park this way but definitely a bad product.  Called auto alley and they stated they had many problems with this unit.  Last heard from.,1.0
"I tried this unit for about two weeks and finally returned it.

The unit never seems to sense the car properly as it enters the garage. The green light never came on while approaching, and then finally the yellow would light shortly followed by the red. The performance was intermittent, in my opinion, and we decided that placing a mark on the wall was just as good and costs nothing. I can't recommend this device based on it's sub-par performance.

Construction is cheap, design is awkward. Even $5 was too much to pay for this craptastic device. Mine worked fine for a week or two, then sporadically for another week before it failed completely and was moved to the trash... ""precisely"" where it belongs. Don't waste your money!",1.0
"This comes with a surprisingly long ""instructions"" pamphlet which mostly just goes on and on and on about how this is so easy to install.  And it is very easy.  Just put it up, plug it in, and it calibrates automatically.

The trouble is, if that doesn't work, the complete lack of things you can do renders it entirely useless.  I wasted hours trying to move the car, change the position of the sensor, unplug and replug to get it to recalibrate, etc. and no matter what I did, it consistently proved useless.  Most of the time the lights don't even come on, or it gets to yellow when I'm all the way in the garage, but sometimes it goes to red while I'm still barely with the nose in.

The only really useful suggestion they offer for how to correct this kind of problem is to change the height of the sensor, but they provide very little by way of guidelines of what height to move it to.  I followed their guidelines, then tried various other heights.  For my efforts, I now have a lot of unnecessary screw-holes in my wall.  None of them helped, though.

For all I know, I got a bad unit somehow, but in their quest to make this easy to install by removing all control the user has over it, they made it impossible to even tell.  If you get lucky and it happens to be able to find your car like they intend, you'll get great use from this.  If you don't, there won't be a single thing you can do about it.  Feeling lucky?",1.0
"I live in a townhome so I have a very small one car garage. I have a small tool chest and workbench along the back of the garage and there is really only wnough room for my car. I honestly only have about a 6 inch space between my car and the garage door and my tool chest. As you can understand, I need something to make sure my car is in the same exact place every day. I bought this from Brookstone in a mall around christmas time of last year. It only worked for a couple of months and now it doesnt light up at all. You can click the only button at the top to reset it, but it does not remember the setting. I unplugged it and then it started to work for a couple of days and now if you back up it seems to work when it shows green, then it shows yellow and as you slowly back up it starts to blink a couple of times and shuts off. Now I just open my door and stop a couple of inches in front of a crack in my garage.

It is a better buy to get one of those things on the ground which your tires sit in, or even make a mark on your wall to figure out when you are in a good spot.",1.0
"I bought the Park-Zone PZ-1500 Platinum Edition parking aid for my wife in early March of 2005 from Amazon.com.

Installation and initial calibration was quick and easy, and it worked fine for about a couple of weeks. Then it started going nuts with the lights winking in random order. After that, it started flashing red indicating it needs new batteries. So I put a fresh set of batteries in the unit, recalibrated it, and we were good to go until a couple of days ago. That's when it would have a solid yellow light that would stay on for minutes at a time. Now it flashes red, and is telling me it wants fresh batteries. No more batteries for this dud. I was planning on using the AC adapter once I got an electrical outlet installed nearby; but that is a moot point now.

The Park-Zone receives my ""Just say NO to Chinese made crap!"" seal of disapproval.

If you want an effective parking aid that will positively park your car in the same place everytime, then (...)They come in yellow or blue. The curb may cost more than the Park-Zone, and the shipping is not free; but the curb works. I have one for my truck and compact tractor, and I just ordered one for my wife's car. Just be certain you can drill 3/4"" holes in concrete for the lead lag shields to secure the curb to the floor.",1.0

Measurement Specialties to find out what was wrong and was inform that you can't used two in the same garage. I informed them it had worked for a month.

Great parking concept. ours is 15 months old and works great. the issue we have is that the THE PARK ZONE OWNERS MANUAL STATES YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PARK YOUR CAR FOR ONE YEAR WITHOUT HAVING TO REPLACE THE BATTERIES!!!THIS STATEMENT IS INCORRECT. We have had to replace the 4 AA batteries every month and that becomes too expensive. This reason alone i do not recommend this product.

I bought this three years ago and seldom used it as it was hard to hold on the tire stem. Today I got it out of my van center storage area and it just would not light up. I thought the two button back light batteries were dead so I got them out and tested them. they are fully charged. Instead of sending the unit back right away I decided to look online to see if others were happy with it. After looking at this site I will take the two good batteries out and throw the thing away.,1.0
"I purchased this as i wanted an accurate tire pressure gauge. The gauge itself is well designed and is great. The problem is that it will not seal to the tire.

Save your money or look at the dump, you may just come across mine. That's where it's headed.",1.0

"I've had this gauge for a few years, but stopped using it with any regularity pretty quickly. Worked great the first few months, then the plastic tip wore out and no longer stayed centered in the hole, and it now takes several tries to get a good seal and thus a good reading. The rubber shroud over the tip slips forward and gets in the way as you push ever harder, trying to get a good seal and bleeding off pressure with every try.

Don't waste your money. I just ordered an Accu-Gage, with a real brass tip, made and calibrated in the good ole USA.",1.0
The rubber sleeve on the business end rides up and gets in the way of getting a good seal on the valve stem. Its also a too fat and requires a certain angle which makes it hard to get a reading from hard to reach valve stems like on my motorcycle.,1.0

There are no instructions on how to calibrate it, or if it needs to be applied to the tire stem with some kind of special maneuver, etc.  Tossed it and bought an ""old fashioned"" pneumatic guage that is very reliable and accurate.

"The MS-4000B is even worse the the MS-4021B. It too, will

with a hard plastic surface just plain awful.",1.0
Was not impressed with this item. recieved it new in package and decided to test it againts a mechanical tire gauge. Air pressures varied or couldn't get a reading. Somtimes  showed lower or higher than I expected. Is a piece of junk since it seemed to work better after having to buy new batteries.  I should get a refund  on this,1.0
Being a mechanic I should have known better. This tire gage is not only the worst tire gage I have ever bought but it is the worst tool I had ever bought. After the third use it leaked to the point where I had to reinflate my tires and recheck them with a simple yet always reliable analog gage. Not only that but I compared the accuracy with a calibrated gage from my shop and found the accutire gage was up to 5 psi off. Take some advice from a mechanic/sucker the simpler the better.,1.0
"I bought this item and then returned it. The gauge didn't seal very well on the tire stems in both my cars of different makes (8 stems in total!!) and let out a large amount of air. When it does seal, the readings had large differences between consecutive reads.",1.0
"In addition to the previously discussed problem of getting a good seal, I tried to use it the other day, and found it is totally dead. Replacing the button cells did not correct the problem. Seems the lithium battery failed prematurely. Considering the seal problem, I doubt I will bother to pay shipping & insurance to return it to the manufacturer for repair even if it is within the 5 year warranty.",1.0
I had an older Accutire that did not work well on my new car. I figured it was worn out and ordered this Gauge. It doesn't work either. It is impossible to maintain a good seal between the valve and the gauge. Instead of investing in fancy backlight etc. Accutire would have done much better by using a high quality sealing mechanism and not that flimiscal plastic/rubber combination. Using a different Gauge with a solid brass/metal connector I have no trouble at all. In short: I do not recommend.,1.0
"While the gauge itself is accurate, the center plastic tip wears out after about a year of use rendering the unit inoperable.  Should have used a metal tip.  Sorry I spent the money.",1.0
"This miracle of modern science works great the first 10 or 20 or 30 times.
Then you realize that readings are becoming increasingly inaccurate (and hard to obtain -- pfffffft!), and it's obvious that the $0.03 seal at the tip is failing.  Where do you get a replacement?  Ha, gotcha!
All show, no go at this point.",1.0
"Long on looks but short on durability and quality of material.  With use, it becomes more and more difficult to get a good seal between the guage and your valve stem because: (1) the outer rubber sleeve on the tip of the guage tends to slide when you press the guage against the valve stem of your tires; and (2) the actual piece of the guage that makes contact with the center of your valve stem is made of plastic, not metal, and it wears out rather quickly.  The result is that my guage does not even work due to worn parts after only one year of moderate use.  Although now useless, the guage looks so nice I still have not thrown it away.  Maybe I will use it as a paperweight!",1.0
"Great idea, gauge no workie! No instructions for re-setting (not Zero set) just -0.0 staring back at me. Worse! No website with which to lodge a complaint or ask for help (even though it's not rocket science). C'mon guys, it's 2003! I must be one of the unlucky ones or just unbearably grumpy.",1.0
"I have a 2010 Honda Civic sedan.

I'm not sure if this problem is due to the embedded heating elements in the rear window that don't allow for good suction or if it's just not a good quality product.  If anyone has found a way to make the shade stick, I'd be interested in hearing the solution.  It is also too wide (from top to bottom) and doesn't stretch taut.  I tuck it into the back seat as far as I can, but it just doesn't seem to be a good fit. It does provide adequate sun protection, but I wouldn't recommend it if you have a Honda Civic sedan.",1.0

I bought this to use in the back of a subaru wagon. It doesn't cover the whole back window...which is probably to be expected with a station wagon.

You can sort of see through it but I didn't feel like it did my baby any good and I'd rather see clearly while driving so I took it down.,1.0
"The product's suction cups won't stay up for more than 30 seconds! It doesn't completely block the sun from hitting my baby's eyes. The product creates a blurred and darkened rear vision. I don't feel safe and in control with the thing up, especially at night and when I have the baby in the car. So it has to be continuously removed for night driving- that is if you can somehow make it stay up for that long! I had to pull over on the freeway a couple of times; once in order to make the suction cups stick during the day and another time to get the one side that was still up, down in order to have a clear view of the road at night!",1.0

"Here's a story to tell my grandkids one day.  I plugged it in, and it seemed just a bit tighter than other AC/DC tips, but it worked fine for my cell phone charger, so I left it in.  The next day I came home after work, and my MDX's headlights were flickering like a SOS signal.  What happened was my wife left the lights on, and because the inverter was plugged in and turned on, it bypassed the power-saving mode and the headlights were draining juice from the battery. I immediately went to unplug it and guessed what? IT'S STUCK! I gave it a hard pull, and the stupid plastic tip broke, leaving my battery bleeding out like a stabbing victim.  I ended up cutting the inverter's cord to bypass the antitheft system, then after yelling with my wife for not know to how to use the auto headlight mode, I duct-taped it back so I can salvage my $25.  So now the thing works, but it's stuck in there like a bullet fragment the doctor does not want to touch.  By the way if you're wondering, the car's battery is fine.  Without the anti-theft system, the battery would have been drained completely.  So I have Acura to thank for that.  This is what happened to me and me only, so buy this product at your own risk.",1.0
