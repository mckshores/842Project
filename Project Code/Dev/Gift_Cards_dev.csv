"Bought for my moms wedding, definitely worth it, Love it, We have bought most of he reception stuff from Amazon",5.0
"I needed a bird cage for the reception of my wedding. I wanted something very autumn like, but everything that was in that range was $50+. I bought this for much cheaper, then hit it with some antique gold paint. After that, I roughed it up with light sandpaper shabby-chic style and put a handmade bow on top. Half the price of storebought fall-themed birdcages and much nicer. This is very well made, and easily customizable.",5.0
"I'd ordered a couple of different card holders for an event. This one by far exceeded quality in comparison to the cardboard ones. Unfortunately, I had to return it because it didn't suit my needs as it was a little small but I would totally recommend this box. It's elegant, sturdy and very nice to look at.",5.0
Very nice for the price. It was used for my son's wedding in June and will be used in my daughter's wedding in April.,5.0
I bought this for my nieces wedding. We put ribbons on it and had it on the present table. Perfect for all the cards so they don't get lost.,5.0
I needed this for our wedding cards. The price was excellent. Its so pretty I plan to re-purpose it into seasonal house/outdoor decor. I'm very happy with it.,5.0
"We used this on the gift table for cards at a wedding reception. It did the job very well. Although the holder has some decorative interest, it was easy to further decorate it with artificial flowers in the ""wedding colors"". Also the top opens on small hinges and the person decorating it propped the top partially open so that persons did not have to open it each time they put an envelope inside. With its design, the holder is easy to decorate if desired.",5.0
It was a perfect addition for wedding cards received at the reception.  Well made and much more durable than expected.  And much better than the paper boxes that I see advertised.,5.0
I am using this for my wedding so I added ribbons and flowers and it is beautiful. Glad I purchased it.,5.0
We used this for a graduation party.  It looked so stylish on the table and worked wonderfully.  It added a touch of elegance.,5.0
"Very pretty, It is going to add to the bridal shower. My daughter came from the Philippines,
and she loves it also. She will be returning to the Philippines for her wedding. I'm her mom
and I want the shower to be very special. The card holder will be something special. So
glad I ordered this.",5.0
Getting this cage was a great idea and beautiful addition to our wedding. The cage is lightweight but sturdy. The clasp is strong.,5.0
I ordered this for my upcoming wedding to use for gift cards. It is a great size - I like the fact that the side slots are large enough to slide larger cards into. Good quality. It was easy to decorate.  Maybe I will use it for a planter afterwards! Super fast delivery- very pleased.,5.0
Placed this on an sparkly teal organza runner and glued sheer/sparkly teal & silver ribbon.  Just gorgeous and so much nicer than cardboard gift boxes!!,5.0
I bought this to hold the cards for my wedding. I haven't used it yet but it looks like it's going to work out great. Plus you can decorate it with ribbon or rose petals.,5.0
Love it. Exactly what i wanted for wedding reception and the cheapest one I could find anywhere. Very happy with it,5.0
"The bird cage its well made. No chips or discolorations. it does not have a slit to insert the cards, you have to open the top. The cage is about 1 ft tall. Not many cards will fit but its so pretty its worth while to buy.",5.0
This cage worked great. We decorated it and made it look fantastic for our wedding. The price was great compared to the card holders that we could have purchased,5.0
we purchased this for my sisters wedding reception.  my mother jazzed it up with a bow and viola it was good to go.  it looked cute on the gift table.,5.0
This was a very nice card holder and looked great at my reception. It went very well with my lovebird themed wedding. I would recommend it.,5.0
We used this at our wedding for cards. It was exactly what I wanted and worked perfectly. I wove ribbon of our wedding color through the spokes and put the same color flower petals on the bottom. It looked great!,5.0
"nos encanto el producto es algo novedoso para una fiesta de 15 a&ntilde;os es algo fuera de lo comun aca en venezuela,",5.0
This was the perfect size cage for placement on a table at our wedding reception.  Bird cage look without birdcage size.  I painted it with 'oil rubbed bronze' spray paint because it wasn't available in colors other then white.  I've added a picture to show the finished product.,5.0
"It was a perfect size and unique, instead of birdcage type.  We used it for 60th Wed. Anniv. Celebration for my parents.",5.0
"This product gets five stars because it's exactly what it's advertised to be: a wire bird cage-style card holder (the type that's so fashionable at weddings these days).  The top portion of the card holder is hinged and easily opens and closes.  It also can be locked (lock of your choice sold separately) in case any unsavory individuals show up to your wedding/event (I'm looking at you, hotel bartender with the goatee who keeps making eyes at the maid of honor!).  It decorates easily with ribbon / flowers to match your color scheme.

My only caveat about this card holder would be its actual size - it's small!  Today's wedding cards are much too big to lay flat in this card holder.  Also, many didn't even fit through the openings.  And, if you have a family of impatient drunks (don't judge), cards easily get backed up.  If you're having an event where you anticipate more than 20 - 25 cards, then please entertain other options.  This card holder would be great at a bridal or baby shower, but unless you're having a small to moderately-sized wedding this card holder ain't going to cut it.

Again, it's a great product; just make sure you're aware of the size and plan accordingly.",5.0
I bought this card holder along with some ribbon to dress it up. It's larger than I expected - more than enough room for our 90 guests to insert cards. The quality is good and the price is right. Better than the cardboard variety I think.,5.0
"We found this on clearance at Wal Mart.  It is very detailed, well made, & appears to definitely serve its purpose.  We were going to purchase a similar one elsewhere, because it was larger & less expensive than this item would have been had it not been on sale.  We are on a serious budget, so we went with this shorter, less expensive one.  Check the measurements before your purchase.  It should be fine for us as long as no one tries to put any large envelopes in there.",5.0
"This is gorgeous!!!
I have gotten so many compliments already.
I filled the bottom of the cage with glossy/shiny shreds of paper that matched my wedding color.",5.0
"I had a wishing well wedding, we just asked for cash and blessings from our guests! Which I HIGHLY recommend! This bird cage was the answer! Our reception was Art Decco themed and this went swimmingly with the room decor. We had 110 guests and all but 3 gave us cards with money! All the cards fit and it looked so cute! My sister decorated it to go along with the theme too. I'm so glad I purchased this. And, it is not expensive and arrived very quickly!",5.0
"I ordered this product from Amazon On Sunday January 8, 2012 and recieved it on Wednesday January 11, 2012.  Service was great.",5.0
"Have not used the item yet, but it came in excellent condition and is a good size. Looking forward to customizing it to use at both my bridal shower and at the weddding by adding different ribbons and flowers to it.",5.0
"I love it, not as big as i though it would be but its still a great size will be able to hold a lot of cards. it shipped within 3 days so that is a bonus as well. Oh and it doesnt come with a lock, but that doesn't really matter to me.",5.0
"It is made pretty well, and even though it is not HUGE, I still think it will hold plenty of cards for my reception. I added a bow to the top, and filled the bottom with rose petals, it looks great!",5.0
Very nice...sturdy and good quality!!! It is perfect for my theme. I'm looking forward to using it in a few months! Worth the money!,5.0
"This was a great, low cost gift card holder for my wedding.  I spray painted mine bronze, wrapped a deep red satin ribbon around it, and placed some flowers around the base to match the colors of my wedding.  Looked great and just as elegant as the other options online.",5.0
"I bought this birdcage to be used at my April wedding reception.  It was packaged up safe and secure and shipped very quickly with no issues.  It looks great and will be perfect as a card holder on our gift table.  I plan to gussy it up with some ribbon and a few fake birds on the outside, and perhaps some nesting material on the inside for our spring-themed wedding.

Just what I was looking for!",5.0
"This item worked beautifully for my daughter's wedding! I filled the bottom with silk rose petals, and tied a large matching organza bow to the top circle, and it was beautiful! It held LOTS of cards, as it is pretty big. I highly recommend this.",5.0
This bird cage gift card holder was just the item needed for my daughter's wedding.  It looked very elegant and everyone liked it.,5.0

"I've bought Regal movie gift cards for many occasions and they are always a hit! I can have them shipped all over the country and since they have so many theatres, there's almost always one nearby. It's a great, easy way for me to get everyone something that they like.",5.0

"Outback, if you haven't tried it, has some of the best food, always prepared the exact same, never is it good one time and bad the next. It is always delicious.  I order the Victoria Filet steak.  It is the most tender, melts in your mouth.  Very friendly staff.",5.0
I originally wanted this product shipped to another address but customer service worked with me to get it shipped to where I needed it in a decent time.,5.0

This was a very easy and nice gift for my 10 year old grandson for his birthday.  He received a Kindle Fire for Christmas and is really enjoying it.  This makes it easy for him to get books & games and he still has to have supervision when he shops.  It is a gift that lasts over a period of time.  He is enjoying it!,5.0
"We decided to buy the Amazon gift card for a birthday present to our boss at work. He is a regular Amazon customer. So, we printed the colorful elephant birthday card - it looked very pretty - and like a real greeting card and gave it to him. It took him about 2-3 minutes to realize what it was (he never paid attention to an online gift card, as such) and when he did, he was so happy! He inquired about all the details of our purchase, printing, etc. and said it was the smartest idea of a present for him.",5.0
idea. Got this for my nephew and colored it in. He liked the fact that I decorated it for him.,5.0
"The Gift Card - does it mean you don't care or you don't want to spend the time thinking about what gift to give.  Well my gift card was for a 16 year old.  My youngest child in almost 30.  Come on, I'm out of touch with this young man's world.  He bought a game with the gift card - the game he wanted to play!  He was delighted that I let him choose what he wanted.  The Amazon Gift Card allowed me to be a part of his world - no I can't play the game but it sure is fun to watch him - when I am invited in.  Have a great day1",5.0

"I enjoy shopping at Amazon, and can't imagine who wouldn't.  Rather than guessing about a gift, or limiting the possibilities by a gift card to a single store, I give Amazon cards, which work for a recipient of any age.  I print my own from the Amazon download.  I believe the recipients truly enjoy them.",5.0

"Amazon printable gift cards are convenient and unique.  I was able to personalize the message on my cards and was able to choose what ""theme"" I wanted to place on the front of it.  I had them printed out and placed in my envelopes in less than 10 minutes.  By giving an Amazon gift card, it allows the user to purchase anything they want.  That is why I purchased them for my employees.  The only suggestion I would give to the website, is to list the code that is unique to each card on the memo portion, next to the ""print now"" button.  I purchased multiple cards and wanted to double check to make sure I print out each of them.  I had to open each card to compare the codes that were printed.  It would have made this process easier if the code was on the memo portion.  I plan to purchase more cards in the future because of the convenience and because each of my employees were happy.  They work hard and deserve to receive a gift they can use.",5.0

"Print at home gift cards are a perfect way to express appreciation or thanks.  They are convenient to give and get.  I love the 24 hour availability and the ability to ""shop"" at home.  I will certainly be using print at home gift cards again.",5.0
The Print-at-Home Amazon gift cards are a great way to reward employees for their years of service.  Employees pick out something they want and need vs. receiving a plaque or other gift they have no interest for.  Printing the gift cards is a quick way to take care of this when there are so many details a HR Director has to keep up with.  No follow-up needed; place the order and voila! they're ready to print to present to employees.,5.0

"Purchased this gift card for my brother in New Zealand on his birthday.
He was only able to buy books and media from that location, using my gift card, majority of items not available for shipping to his location. Nothing wrong with books and other media, however, where is the ""beef""...?

"I thought an Amazon GC would be perfect for those in my family that love to listen to audiobooks.  Boy was I wrong.  Amazon GCs do NOT WORK with audible.com accounts, even though audible has amazon branding all over it.  I'm sure the recipient will be more than willing to use it at amazon to buy some odd trinket or other, but that defeats the spirit in which the gift was given.  Last time I even think about buying GCs with amazon until they correct their systems so that all companies across the board accept legal amazon tender.  I already do not like the concept re: GCs because it forces someone to purchase with a specific company, I especially HATE GCs that force someoen to purchase within a specific division of a company.",1.0

"*DO NOT BUY* Purchased 20 $50.00 Amazon gift cards ($1000.00 worth) through this site with the ""Thank You"" cards attached for employees at work. I've been an Amazon customer for over a decade. All the gift cards were claimed when I asked all the employees to check their claim codes after one staff member complained her's wasn't usable. I called customer service, received the same ""call your bank"" email response. I called again this time extremely frustrated. They escalated it to the gift card/escalation department. They had me prove to them that all 20 gift cards were compromised. I asked all 20 employees to take photo copies of their cards, where then I prepared a document showing all 20 card numbers with detailed explanation. In short, I had to ""work for it"" - proving that indeed, they're careless service of not checking these card numbers were recycled and unusable. When I mentioned a couple of times, ""Do you guys read your comments on how most of these gift cards have the same complaints?"" They acted clueless. Also, they only do customer service responses via email, even after repeated requests for them to call me back - they never do. You have to initiate phone contact. After over two weeks, and constant nagging on my end, I did receive the amount back, but not in the form of 20 gift cards as I originally intended to give as employee gifts, but a credit on one account. Are they expecting me to purchase more gift cards from this site to give to the employees? What do they expect me to do now that the money is on just one Amazon account?

Back to online chat and then come to find out the RECIPIENT needs an account with Amazon to get a card in their email - that it will not go through if there is no account associated with the card (???). I ended up (after about two hours of this back and forth not to mention I was asked to ask my niece to check various inboxes, etc..) cancelling the card. I went back and looked, nowhere does it mention that the person getting the card also needs an account. So my niece gets nothing from me, I get to feel terrible I missed her birthday.

Be advised that something had changed with Amazon in the couple of years. Their once excellent customer service has ended up in the toilet. This goes from gift cards to orders in general. They're losing customers and I don't know why they don't care! Very sad! So...be aware!,1.0

"What is the problem with Amazon? Fraudulent gift cards are not good! I have read all your reviews on gift cards and very Leary to send another one to my granddaughter across the US.

I want to thank you however for allowing customers to tell on you!!! Im a prime member and this is changing my outlook on Amazon.",1.0

"The card I had purchased was a gift to a good friend of mine in Japan. He was very happy with it, until he was trying to use his giftcard! He was not able to do so. Amazon told him,  the reason was; that he lives in Japan,and only US citizens are able to use the gift cards!!!!!!! I was very disappointed to hear this and I was wondering why Amazon did not communicate this to their customers!!! Very BAD service, and a waste of money!!!!! I will NEVER use amazon again!!!!!!",1.0

"I had a bad experience this time. I live in Canada and my sister lives in the USA.
She has a Kindle, which in my experience has always been a product you could only purchase
in the USA.  I was shopping at my grocery store (Real Canadian Superstore) and was very
excited to see I could buy Kindle gift cards. So I bought $100 worth and mailed them to my sister
for a birthday gift.

Once she received them, she told me she couldn't use them. She said someone had given
them to her before after purchasing them in Canada and she couldn't use them for that reason.

So she mailed them back to me, unused, untouched. I tried to take them back to the store and
they told me they would not refund me because Amazon won't take them.

In the meantime, I purchased $100 of Kindle giftcards online and emailed them to her and she
is using them.

I am stuck with these Kindle gift cards that can only be used in Canada and cannot use them.

I am frustrated and will probably not purchase gift cards from Amazon again. It's a ridiculous
rule.",1.0
