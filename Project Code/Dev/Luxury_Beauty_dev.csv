"Good and valuable, must buy:-D",5.0
Best hand cream ever!!!,5.0
LOVE LOVE LOVE this subtle fresh scent. Not too heavy and leaves skin feeling like you just left the spa!!,5.0
I just started using the Supersmile packets and Toothpaste. AH-Mazing! I don't think I've ever been more confident when I smile. Also because its exciting to brush I do use it more often. Thank you Supersmile!,5.0
"I buy these and use them exclusively when I'm travelling. It's nice to be able to keep up with the oral hygiene without having to lug around a bottle of mouthwash (which, is primarily water, and water is heavy). Couple that with the TSA restrictions of liquids in carry-on baggage on flights... These powered packets win out each time.

I personally split the package into two uses (pour half the powder into a glass and mix water into the glass). I think using the full concentrated solution is like eating baking soda and comes with a bad aftertaste. The half dose isn't all that bad...",5.0
"I cannot be without these.  I have to brush after every meal but sometimes that is just not possible.  These are so easy to use, just tear open the packet and add water.  The contents leave your mouth feeling fresh and clean.  I keep a couple with me at all times.  They take up about as much space as a credit card.",5.0
It's ok.,5.0
good product.  nice price,5.0
I use these for travel.  Easy enough to fill with water to use in a restroom.  Clean feeling.,5.0
This is great,5.0

I recently took a trip to Australia and could not take more than 3oz. of any liquid in my carryon.  I was determined not to check my baggage. This was the perfect solution. I've used it in the past and really like it. It was a no brainier. I will order it again,5.0
"Worked very well. For our long trip
The powder must be mixed",5.0
"Supersmile mouthrinse does everything I need it to do whenever I'm on the go and it's inconvenient for me to brush my teeth.  I keep a couple of packets in my handbag at all times.  Just fill the packet up with warm water (to the conveniently marked fill line), gently shake to mix it, vigorously rinse your mouth (using the packet as your cup).  Refill the packet with clean water and rinse a second time to remove any lingering mixture from your mouth.  Your breath will be fresh as can be for the next several hours and your teeth will feel really clean.  I've been using this for years and I love it.",5.0
"I have been using this for about a week now, and I really enjoy the way it makes my mouth & teeth feel.  At first I didn't care for the taste, but it's not bad.",5.0
"I have used Supersmile for years - I have porcelein veneers and it keeps them as shining white as possible.  It does whiten my real teeth, especially if you add the whitening accelerator.  I drink red wine, coffee, etc and it removes all the stains that may come!",5.0
"I bought this toothpaste about a month and a half before I went to the dentist for my semi annual..

I asked him if I should get my teeth whitened and he said I thought you already did, I was about to comment on your teeth. What did you use? I told him Supersmile. He said they look great!! in fact he got out the sample teeth for shade gage.. and he said that I was between a 1 and a 2. One being the whitest!!! I love this toothpaste!! and I have never found anything that whitens better..",5.0
"In the past I have bought just about every whiting toothpaste known to man.  I ordered this one about 3years ago and I've been using it ever since.  When I used other toothpastes after trying supersmile, my teeth just felt dirty in comparison.  I could really tell after a few brushings that my teeth did look whiter and if you use it with the accelerator it works even better.  If you think crest strips works good, you just need to try some supersmile.  I only use this toothpaste and I just recently got my husband, sister, and mother started using it.  We all love it!",5.0
"My favorite, teeth feel clean, great taste",5.0
Have been buying this for years.  Favorite tooth paste ever.,5.0
love it so much I recommend it to friends,5.0
"Excellent quality, work spectacular, I have resin in some teeth and it keeps them white",5.0
I recommend the green apple flavor for people who hate mint but want fluoride. The taste is fine and my dentist is happy. It definitely whitens better if you use it on a dry toothbrush as directed; I noticed a change after I finally read the directions.,5.0
LOVE IT. Great Cinnamon flavor as well,5.0
Always a good buy.,5.0
"This really works! I smoked cigars for years and would quaff down coffee like water. Needless to say my teeth were a nice light brown.  I stopped the cigars, cut way back on coffee, and found this toothpaste. I followed directions and use a pearl size amount on my toothbrush. In one week I have seen a difference. This gradually removes stain. And I doubt if i will have a movie star smile. But it works, and works gently without abrasives. I am going to use this from now on. Twice a day.",5.0
"It doesnt have mint in it. Its probably the only toothpaste that doesnt.  Mint in toothpaste gives me ulcers in my mouth.  I used to use Go Smile, but they stopped selling it and came out with mint in it  Very happy with Supersmile.",5.0
Whiter teeth AND extra benefit-- my gums are healthier! mouth FEELS better,5.0
It works great on coffee stains !,5.0
"Love this stuff! It will definitely make your teeth whiter. Been using it for ever.
I put a little on my toothbrush with regular toothpaste. It stretches it out.",5.0
"Being a fanatic about white teeth, I love love this toothpaste.  It brightens, protects and gives a sense of satisfaction when smiling.  I have not used any other toothpaste in many years, and when used with the accelerator, stained teeth are a thing of the past.",5.0
Used for years. Perfect for veneers and really keeps my teeth white,5.0

"Tried so many products and this is the most effective teeth whitening without irritation, use with accelator is important",5.0
"I am not usually one for whitening toothpaste, as I have pretty thin enamel as-is. I was looking for a toothpaste that didn't have baking soda or small pebbles that would grate away at my teeth and found this. Yes, it's a bit pricey. But yes, it works really, really well. I use it without getting the toothbrush or my teeth wet before brushing. It took a few weeks by my teeth became noticeably whiter.

I've now found a good all-round toothpaste that whitens great!",5.0
"I've been using this for around 10 years. It's the ONLY toothpaste that actually whitens your teeth. I tried all the ""whitening"" toothpastes sold in stores and they did nothing. My dentist is always remarking how white my teeth are. When I get crowns and they have to match them to my natural teeth, they always give me the A1 or B1 color, which are the whitest two colors. This whitening toothpaste actually works. Try it and see. Oh, and the tubes last a loooooooooooooooooong time (2 months at least) because they fill them all the way up, not halfway or less like other toothpaste makers.",5.0
love the product!,5.0
Really works,5.0
It works. Removed some annoying stains in 2-3 applications. My kids really liked green apple flavor.,5.0
I really love this brand. My teeth are white and beautiful now.,5.0
I have used this product before so I knew I loved it. It is disappointing that the accelerator is so much more expensive than it was a few years back. It used to be around $36 for a set of both paste and accelerator in these same size tubes. I'm still happy with the Whitening toothpaste but you really need both to get that gleaming white smile.,5.0
"Seeing whitening of my teeth after only a week of 2X daily use.  Much more effective than drugstore ""whitening"" toothpastes (which don't seem to whiten at all), and much more gentle and natural results than peroxide-based whitening products.
Very happy with this toothpaste and would definitely order again.",5.0
"Great product, I repeatedly get told how nice my teeth look!",5.0
"I love the way it tastes. Most toothpastes burn my very sensitive mouth but this one doesn't. It tastes like spearmint to me, doesn't burn at all, and keeps my teeth white.",5.0
I can tell a difference on my veners and crowns. My teeth seem to be whiter which I thought was not possible. I will order again.,5.0
I have been told twice in less than three weeks of using this tooth paste that my teeth look exceptionally white- it must be working! This also not a super strong tooth paste for those who may have mouth sensitivity issues. I love it! I will definitely purchase again and I will even go for their other products.,5.0
"This stuff is the best. I like all the flavors, but Green Apple is my fave. So different and refreshing. But the main point is the clean, clean, clean feeling I get from using Supersmile. I think other reviewers have said it all--my teeth are cleaner and whiter, but it happens slowly and subtly. And there's something about this toothpaste that makes me want to brush every chance I get. How much is that worth?",5.0
"Very happy with product, however, stains still exist...",5.0
Works great,5.0
Our favorite whitening toothpaste!  Wish it were a little less expensive.,5.0
BEST TOOTHPASTE IN THE WORLD...,5.0
Works,5.0
Very happy with it,5.0
I was really interested behind the science in this toothpaste. I have veneers on my top whether they stain or not this has been formulated to remove that the taste is nice and minty,5.0
Thanks so much...,5.0
I have used this product for  5 yrs. When I saw it on amazon and the price.  I jumped on it....  It really works...,5.0
The best whitener out there.,5.0
"I've used this toothpaste for year - AWESOME and dentist can always tell the difference. Go for it - you'll love it too! Read directions - only a pea size, on dry brush- no water.",5.0
Excellent! Just as described!,5.0
"Works really great.  I have porcelain veneers and it works really to use as instructed (first with dry brush and the product), then with a wet toothbrush and toothpaste.  I will definitely buy again.",5.0
"I'm SO glad I decided to try this toothpaste! Not only does it work, but it's so incredibly gentle! I seem to have become sensitive to whitening products, be it toothpaste or otherwise. They all either leave my gums raw, or cause tooth sensitivity. Not so with this toothpaste!
My teeth have become blinding white since using. My dentist even asked me what I was using because the difference was so drastic (as I had hoped it would be!).
I drink red wine, coffee, and I'm an ex-smoker. My teeth were getting a bit yellower as I neared 30 but they are finally white again and they are staying white!

The mint isn't too strong and doesn't make my eyes water either. Most toothpastes make my mouth feel like it's on fire, but this toothpaste does not.

My teeth look and feel great. This toothpaste gives my teeth that squeaky clean feeling and my dentist said my enamel doesn't look like it's taking a beating either which is a plus.

I couldn't recommend this toothpaste more. Skip the popular name brands and try this out. Yes, its more expensive, but a tube lasts me quite a long time and IT WORKS! The only downside is it can leave your toothbrush feeling hard after drying. This isn't too big of a deal for me personally, its just an annoying aspect. You also have to rinse with this toothpaste a bit. If you try it youll see why and what I mean. It leaves a milky white look behind even once you spit it out.

I went a period without repurchasing when I needed to because my husband wanted to try charcoal. It did nothing except cause gum pain. Over the course of this time my teeth started to dull but after reordering this and using it just once, my teeth were already whiter again. Its been a few weeks and my teeth are blinding white again.

This is my HG toothpaste and I recommend it to all my friends and family as well. It's pretty amazing stuff.",5.0
"This is the real deal. My teeth have measurably whitened even before I'm half through the first tube

The feel and taste of my mouth is a pleasure after each use",5.0
Wow this is great stuff!  Will buy again.,5.0
"I love coffee, red wine, and cigarettes, so of course I am always searching for tooth stain remedies. This product is most effective I've ever tried, and at a great price! This tube is actually a 3 month supply if used according to directions. It has a pleasant minty taste but does kinda burn and make gums sensitive the first few days. I brushed my teeth the first night and didn't notice much. But in the morning, I saw already noticeable fading in the dark stains of my teeth! 2 weeks later, friends are asking if I got my teeth bleached!! I will never use another toothpaste or whitening product!",5.0
Great tasting whitening toothpaste (really need it after playing beanboozled with my granddaughter) like the design as well stands on its own and dispenses easily. Great price as well...,5.0
Best toothpaste eve!!!!!!,5.0
Really works and foams up nicely on my teeth.,5.0
It's great. Will definitely buy it again,5.0
When you are done trying whitening trays and whitening toothpastes try Supersmile. My dental hygienist couldn't believe the difference as my teeth were terribly stained from coffee and tea each visit until I started using Supersmile. I have stopped covering my mouth when I smile or laugh. :-),5.0
"The taste is so so good, that's why the 5 stars but usually I do use a 'real' toothpaste before :))",5.0

Absolutely,5.0
"My favorite toothpaste. Makes my teeth feel so clean, and it whitens them to a reasonable white (not fluorescent white like some of the strips...I don't like the fluorescent white anyhow). I think it is mildly abrasive, but not any more than other whitening toothpastes.",5.0
Flavor is wierd but good nice change.,5.0
Very satisfied!,5.0

great,5.0
I have been using Supersmile for about a year. I'm a smoker and it really brightens your smile ',5.0
"Have been using this for over 12 years and even though it's on the expensive side, it's well worth the money for the quality of the product.  My dentist thought I quit smoking and drinking coffee after I started using this,  he couldn't believe that a toothpaste was that effective at stain removal and cavity protection!!  One tube lasts a long time and I use just a pea size amount as directed on a DRY round tip electric toothbrush.  Hope they never discontinue this product!",5.0
"Dentist recommended so I bought, can't say my teeth are any whiter, but the case is not overwhelming and I hope the fluoride is making my teeth stronger. Can't say the high price is justified, the benefits are likely more theoretical but if you have the bucks, go for it.  Don't see how you can be hurt by it.",5.0

Awesome. Whittens my teeth very well. I like that it last a long time bc you don't use a large amount.,5.0
"I started buying this some years ago after I quit smoking. My teeth are resistant to whitening, I drank iced tea daily and had smoked for 30 years. I've never had a cavity and other than the embarrassing staining, I've had really good oral health. The first time I used this, I thought I noticed a difference but wasn't sure. Within three days though (I brush twice a day and floss) there was a definite improvement. It's quite noticeable.

I used two tubes to whiten my teeth and then I brushed with Super Smile twice a week or so, to maintain it. My teeth weren't blazing, TV white but they were a far bit whiter than they were. I also used the mouthwash intermittently. I had better results when I switch to a Sonic Care electric tooth brush too. Just an inexpensive model was fine.  It's been a while and it's time to whiten again so, yeah. But I've tried other tooth pastes that claim to effect change and this is the only one, of the many which I've tried, that delivers.",5.0
As described,5.0
It is not harsh and it is  cheaper than on QVC. Whitening  effect takes a long time.,5.0
Great whitening toothpaste,5.0
I won't be without this toothpaste!,5.0
"This is a great product!  I use it with the accelerator and Pre-rinse.  I have never had such healthy gums and such clean teeth.  Just like when I leave the dentist office or better.  I noticed a change in shade of my teeth in less than one week!!  And they are almost pearly looking, not just clean.  I will never go back!  I have to say if you like a stronger taste order the Icy Mint flavor.  I had to exchange my regular flavor for this one.",5.0

Supersmile whitening tooth paste is the best.  I have tried others but none of them compares to Supersmile.  Thank you Dr. Smigel for such a great product.,5.0
"""Supersmile"" exceeded my expectations. I just spent a good deal of money on my teeth. I didn't want them damaged again and I didn't want a  dull,scratched looking smile. With ""Supersmile"" my teeth feel clean and look great. I would recommend it to anyone looking to present a great smile and protect their investment.  And the best part was that I was able to find and purchase it at a great deal on Amazon.",5.0

My FAVORITE toothpaste EVER----Just wish it cost LESS!,5.0
"Easy to use whitening toothpaste that makes a huge difference if you are a coffee drinker. In my opinion, this toothpaste's effectiveness increases if you use it at night before going to bed as you will have had a full day's worth of meals and activities. The flavor of this toothpaste isn't overpowering (I used the mint) and the consistency of this toothpaste is as most other toothpastes.

Personally, I saw results after two weeks of consistent use. I also didn't notice any tooth sensitivity after my usage (as I have with other whitening products).",5.0
It is awesomatic :),5.0
I really like this product. Expensive but it works.,5.0

"I hate whitening strips. No matter how advanced Crest has gotten, I still obsess about the filmy gooey thing stuck to my teeth. I inevitably keep touching it with my tongue and thus eating half of the whitening gel before I can't stand it anymore and remove the strip. This toothpaste is a welcome alternative that actually worked!! I have sensitive teeth, so I only used it once a day but I definitely noticed results after a couple weeks of use. My teeth did end up feeling a little sensitive after those weeks, so I switched to a sensitive toothpaste and have been alternating since!",5.0
Really like this toothpaste.,5.0
This stuff is great and truly whitens in a very short amount of time. I am about to purchase again because we are almost out. Use as recommended you do not need more than a pea size on your brush and for best results do not rinse under water before you brush. When you brush without water it allows for the chemicals to do what they are designed to do. Take this advice for what it is as you will not regret it.,5.0
I really like this tooth paste. I would recommend it,5.0
"WHEN USED WITH THE WHITENING ACCELERATOR, IT DOES A VERY GOOD JOB",5.0
My teeth were noticeable whiter after just a week & continue to look great. I've received so many compliments on them. I will continue to use this once a day along with my regular toothpaste due to other people saying they have cavities from using this solely. I just switch up throughout the day. I haven't experienced any sensitivity. However my friend is also using this and she has whiter teeth but has very little sensitivity as well. She will continue to use this as well. So I would say this definitely works.,5.0
so glad to find these at Amazon. Love the results.,5.0
"When used with their Accelerator tube, this is phenomenal,even for sensitivity! Also works on ALL dental work, eg: caps,  crowns,  veneers,  etc!!
Regular whitening toothpaste doesn't work from my own experiences & the sensitivity is STILL a problem!",5.0
This stuff works,5.0
There is a noticeable difference using this toothpaste. It really does whiten.,5.0
LOVE! I love this tooth paste and use it all the time! I like to use it at night because I feel in the am I want something a tad stronger but this does wonders to keep teeth white! I love coffee and red wine so I like all the help I can get! I used to use the accelerator but don't think it's totally necessary anymore!,5.0
"I've tried plenty of other whitening toothpastes before, but this is the first one that I can say absolutely, unequivocally does what it says. Within a week, stains that had been on my teeth for probably years just lifted off like they were nothing. It's a little pricey, but in my honest opinion definitely worth the cost!",5.0
great stuff,5.0
"Best whitening toothpaste out there. Great for teeth that are sensitive to other whitening pastes. I've seen a few negative reviews and think they might be due to improper use of the product. It needs to be used on a completely dry toothbrush, without rinsing your mouth before it after use, and no drinking/eating for AT LEAST half an hour after use. It might be different to use, but it works wonders. My teeth are super white, and I get great dental checkups every time.",5.0
Best toothpaste for whitening.,5.0

"I liked the color, but the nail polish appeared old and thick.",1.0
"Horrible. I threw it away. uneven coating. I mean I got curious how much it would take to look even. After 4 coats it still was not. If all the colors of this brand are this bad they should close up shop and try something else, in my opinion, of course.",1.0
This product removes some of the polish as you apply it.  I tried it a second time and let the underlying polish dry for more than 1 hour before applying the top coat and it still removed color.  Don't recommend!,1.0
"I got this because I always see the salons using OPI. However, It doesn't dry shiny at all. That kind of defeats the purpose of using it as a top coat. Waste of money!",1.0
"Very disappointed in this polish the first and only OPI polish I have not liked! It has a very flat, dull finish!. Should have returned it!",1.0
Very disappointed this is how I received this polish obviously it was broken when placed in the box . even the inside of the primer has pink polish,1.0
I dispute the claim of being super shiny. These polishes are no more shiny than any other. Don't buy the hype. OPI I expect more of them.,1.0
"This is not the right picture! I thought I was ordering the color in this picture which I love. Instead the real ""to the finish lime"" color is so ugly. If you look at ""withstand the test of thyme"" you'll see the real color for this product. I'm assuming the one I really wanted is the thyme one.",1.0
"Not what I  received. I ordered this, and got a generic brand top coat. I love in Argentina, and cannot return items...",1.0
Way to light in color.  I was hoping for a more natural nail color.  I gave the polish to my granddaughter.,1.0
"Ok - more than 2 stars for delivery of product.  it was ontime, and delivered safely.

Less than 1 star for seller.  I sent note to ask for a refund.  I never heard back.

1 star for product itself....
- I tried 3 times with this polish at my salon (I always bring my own color --to do touch ups at home in between )
---- THe color 'puckered' on my nails each time.  Bubbles in the polish.  Hard to explain in words.  But not a sheen smooth finish at all
---- Could not get the color to dry on some nails, so it had big smugdes
---- Chipped within a day
---- So poor after 5 days, I went back for a polish change

After going back for 3rd polish change, I gave up on the jar.  But the seller never got back to me.

The color itself is a BEAUTY red, the rest.  HARUMF

Disappointing! It melts the nail polish and make them look awful!!!,1.0
Awful! No shine at all and it made the color nail polish come off on the brush. It was so thin it looked like I was putting water on my nails. Too bad I can't send it back.,1.0

Infinite shine is terrible. Starts chipping within one or two days. Not shiny at all! :( don't waste your money!,1.0
Its dull and after it goes on it bubbles in places and looks gloppy. Had to use other top coat to cover and make it shine. Will never use this OPI gel again and think it was released too early maybe. Contacted OPI about it but never even got an acknowledgement of email.,1.0
"I have already used the opi Infinite shine twice in a week. It is terrible. I used the primer, Polish, and gloss. The polish was the You can count on it pink. It is ugly, gloppy, thick and streaky.  The gloss doesn't even shine it started chipping the next day!  Don't buy it, it is overpriced and doesn't work!",1.0
"I had such high hopes for OPI's Infinite Shine, but it is just not a good product.  I ordered the primer and top coat, plus two colors--You Can Count on It and Can't Be Beet!.  The consistency of the pink, You Can Count on It, was awful--streaky and gloppy; it left brush marks that refused to smooth out after application.  I let the first coat dry very well before applying the second coat, but it, too, left brush marks. Can't Be Beet, a dark, rich red, was better, but not great.  The pink (primer, 2 ccolor coats, and a top coat, began chipping the very next day.  What a disappointment!  I will stick to OPI Gelcolor.",1.0
"Sorry, but I did not order this.",1.0
THIS IS NOT OPI INFINITE SHINE! False advertising is a crime!,1.0
ruins the polish it goes ....and Amazon would not let me return it,1.0
At first I thought I was missing the ends of my nails. But I reapplied one last time today. Sat for over an hour to let them dry. About 10 mins of normal activity and tips of my nails were completely bare again. It just peels back from my nails like a weird jelly film.,1.0
There is something wrong with this particular bottle. The polish color is very attractive but it streaks. I've asked friends to use it and they have the same results.,1.0

"Shame on OPI. There are two versions of this color with exactly the same name and product code. I liked this color at the salon, so I bought this for touch ups. It was more of a halloween green than the spring grass green in the salon.",1.0

"I bought this nail polish from Amazon after choosing it during a salon pedicure. I had no trouble with the delivery, but after using it on my nails, I questioned whether it was authentic or previously used. First, the level of polish in the bottle was low. I had to put the brush all the way back in before I would get an adequate amount of polish. Second, it was crusty around the opening like it had been open and used several times. Third, while the color was what I remembered, the overall quality of the polish itself was unlike OPI products I've used in the past. It seemed watered down and thin to put it simply. Since there wasn't a price difference, I would probably just buy OPI directly from a salon or other more reputable source.",1.0
FOR 16.98 I RECEIVED ONE BOTTLE-I THOUGHT THE TITLE SAID 2.  I WILL NOT USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!  I CAN GET ONE BOTTLE FOR $7 OR $8 DOLLARS.,1.0
"Product came and was old-- nail polish was goopy, streaky, and unusable.",1.0
This is terrible. I do not know why but it bubbled which either means it's really old or a knock off . Ruined my manicure every time I used it. Money wasted.,1.0
I bought this color a while ago. I went to use it recently and it was hard as rock in the glass bottle. I've never had this happen to my other OPI polishes. Really disappointed and thinking I should jus stick with buying my colors in store rather than online. Who knows if it was even brand new.,1.0
My wife bought this nailpolish and complained about it cause it doesn't last even 2 days.,1.0
"This top coat's ancestors probably mated with sea foam or something because all I get are freaking bubbles everywhere every time. I think I'm actually better off without top coat now, at least with this thing.",1.0
"This product is a beautiful bright blue with tons of glitter in it. The only thing I don't like about it isn't about the color it's about the brush. The brush is super short and quite wide which makes putting on the polish a difficult and messy task. The brush is too wide in my opinion. It's not the same brush that regular OPI polishes have. It's much shorter and wider. I do not like it. Other than that it's great!

The shape of the bottle is quite odd, I certainly wasn't expecting a ""deformed"" bottle but that's how it's made so oh well. I think that once the polish is used up a bit the shape of the bottle and the brush will make it unusable unless you close the bottle shake it then reopen it for each nail. That's a big disappointment.

The glitter is very dense making the nail feel rough even with 2 coats of OPI Top Coat on top. OPI's other glittery nail polishes don't feel so rough even without a top coat on. But there must be a lot more glitter in this polish than the other standard OPI polishes. Overall I really like this polish and I do recommend it.

EDIT: (Oct 13, 2011) The nail polish peeled off of my nails the day after I applied it. I had just gotten out of a short bath and noticed they were peeling. What a rip off! I'm certainly not happy. The only things I had on my nails yesterday when I applied it was OPI natural nails base coat, two coats of the color and two coats of the OPI top coat. No lotion or oils on my nails prior to putting it on. What a bummer!",1.0
Product bubbles on your nails...looks terrible,1.0
I love OPI and its pretty much all i use. Color is pretty but Im assuming it was how it was stored its thick and doesnt apply right. Wasnt worth my effort to make it work this morning !!!!,1.0
"No stars for this product , it's 100 percent fake ,the brush is cheap and poor quality , don't buy this product ,waste of your money",1.0
This product is clearly not an authentic OPI product - it's a cheap knock-off.  There are noticeable differences between this bottle and authentic OPI bottles.  There is also a very harsh smell and the product bubbles on my nails.  This was not the case with the authentic OPI I had previously purchased (which is a fantastic product and worth the money). I should have realized OPI couldn't be this cheap. At least Amazon was great and made sure I got a refund for this product that wasn't what it claimed to be.,1.0
"Be careful who you buy this from. I'm about 98% sure the bottle I received is a knock off. I can tell it's cheap and it left bubbles on my nails. The bottle even looks different from the rest of my OPI products. The handle is smoother than the rest and the back of the bottle looks different as well. I'm very upset with this purchase.

Uploaded a pic so you can see the different in the bottles. The far right is the knock off.",1.0
"I bought this as a replacement for the Seche Vite top coat that I usually use (and love).  The store that I purchase from was out of Seche Vite, so I purchased this, thinking O.P.I. makes great quality polishes, so their top coat should perform well.  Very, very wrong.  This, to me, was no better than using a plain clear polish as a top coat (which does not serve the purpose of a top coat at all). It dries very slowly, pulls tacky nail polish color off, and chips very, very quickly - possibly more quickly than using no top coat at all.

If you're in the market for a good top coat, get Seche Vite. It's a similar price, you can apply it to tacky nail polish without any color coming off, and it dries to the touch in less than a minute. It also lasts for at least one week, without chipping.  This O.P.I. top coat chipped overnight, without me using my hands for anything other than normal activity: not even dish washing or a shower in that time.

Don't waste your money on this one.",1.0
"The colors of the OPI Burlesque series are sensational...however, the polish goes on makikng the nails feel as if there were sand paper on top of them.  It chips at the slightest touch, but removing from nails altogether is a major hassle...acetone polish required, and nails have to soak for at least one minute, then only 1/2 comes off, involving another soaking before all polish could be removed.  I bought four of these in different colors...have thrown them all out and I love OPI polish more than most.",1.0
It's a fun and glamorous product but directions/warning should come attached as to how hard it is to remove the product!  It took me 25 minutes and lots of remover and cotton to get the polish off!,1.0
"I really don't like glitter nail polish. This nail polish doesn't look glitter at all in the pictures, both here at Amazon and OPI's website. I was disappointed when I got the nail polish. Way too glitter for me, AND it's much darker than in the picture too.",1.0
Contains formaldehyde :(,1.0
Who knew Russian Navy is purple. Really disappointed.,1.0
One star due to the fact that the polish is not authentic. The bottle is not authentic OPI and it does not have its etched number on the bottle like its supposed to. The lettering on the bottle is dull and crooked and not raised to the touch as with authentic OPI polishes. Tried to return to seller but wanted me to pay shipping to have it returned back.,1.0

"Very runny, steaky, doesn't stay on for more then 2-3 days.",1.0
"Read the reviews, I wish I had. If you put it on thin (to dry, painted nails) it streaks your paint job. If you put it on thick, it takes hours to dry.  It then feels tacky and looks dull the next day. As someone else said, go with Sally Hansen top coat.",1.0
Its a gel nail polish... not what I wanted and not what is in the picture....,1.0
this color is not what I expected.  You need to put on 3 coats to get the real color and then it is still not a good color.  Disappointed that I am unable to return it!  Bummer...,1.0
It's broken as you can see,1.0
Don't know if the polish was old. I purchased this for my Meme because she had been looking for this color and I found it here. She applied the color to her finger nails let dry and then it just scratched off after a shower. So not sure what's up with this because I know this brand is good never had issues in the past.,1.0
"Even after it dries.....it is sticky, and dries ""cloudy"".....I do not recommend this to anyone. Sorry OPI. I love  your products....but this one...I am not a fan of.",1.0
"I bought this to match a manicure in the same color. Unfortunately, this is not the same color. It claims it's ""Mod About You"", but it's more of a neon/Barbie pink instead of the pretty neutral pink it should be. Too bad it can't be returned as it's not the correct color.",1.0
Beware: the Russian Navy should be called Purple McPurpleton. I hate it. Waste of $8.,1.0

How is Russian NAVY purple & not the navy blue I have always used. Totally disappointed.,1.0
"The product i received was a fake, The code on the stick was sliced through and re-stamped with a different code. There is also no code imprinted on the bottle. Very unsatisfied.",1.0
After using this product I would suggest that you get the original Nail Envy over this. My nails have always been weak; they break easily and peel like no other. I tried the Dry & Brittle formula and found that when it dries it peels? It would flake off in a day or two. Stick to the original.,1.0
Pretty sure this was a fake/knockoff one its not the same as my other OPI polishes that I got from salons and it takes forever to dry.,1.0
Very watery and un-OPI like,1.0
Yes it dried but not super fast and it would cause my nail polish to chip faster and it was super expensive...not worth it!,1.0
"I bought this product thinking it was the regular O.P.I top coat, but I received the fast dry top coat instead. Generally fast dry nail polish doesn't make a big difference for me because fast dry or not it still takes too long for me. But this product actually dried very quickly! I was nervous because I had used a base coat and then very thick layers of the colored nail polish to finally finishing up with the top coat, and thought this would take forever to dry and I needed to go to sleep. But just a few minutes later I checked and it was almost perfectly dry!

Edit: Yes, this product dries really fast, but it doesn't last whatsoever! It's so bad you are better off not using any top coat at all! After only 1 or 2 days, you can literally peel the nail polish off your nail like those really cheap nail polishes or those toy nail polishes for little girls! I totally hate it. Waste of money",1.0
"with 4 coats, it still doesn't cover.",1.0
"Do not buy this top coat. It did not work, and it had a really weird odor. I think it might have been mixed with something else.",1.0
"So. First off I'd like to explain that this wasn't even the product I ordered. I wanted a Matte topcoat, and for some reason when I searched matte topcoats, this came up. I ordered it, not realizing that it was just a regular topcoat. I decided, what the hell, it was only six or seven bucks, might as well keep it. So I used it a few times. Every time that I have used this topcoat, it has caused the nail
polish underneath to form little bumps and bubbles. Instead of looking smooth and shiny, my nails end up bumpy and ugly. I have never had this issue with any other top coat, so I'm not sure what the issue is. I've stopped using it and went back to my other top coats and have had no issues since.",1.0
Came very clumpy. I had to throw it away.,1.0
"The one nice thing I have to say about the product is that this colour is really quite nice.

Now the bad:  I have used OPI polish twice, and both times my nails have become weak, brittle, and prone to break/chip/split.  The polish itself did not last.  I like to get hands-on with computers, so I'm used to wrecking my nails if I'm not careful, but this stuff chipped while I was typing.  I tried it with and without a top coat, and the top coat seemed to be weakened like my nails.

Worse, it comes off terribly.  A couple of fingers look like I tried to remove it with a coarse metal file.  I've ordered some nail therapy (local stores don't have any stocked) in hopes that maybe I can undo some of the damage.

I cannot say for a medical certainty that the paint is the problem.  I also can't say that it will happen to you.  With 75% positive reviews, I have trouble imagining everyone's nails are getting ruined.  But in 25 years of painting my nails, the only other time I had this happen was with cheap dollar store-type nail polish.  And this is a shame, because I really like the colour.",1.0
"Must be a ""second"" Brush is a mess.",1.0
"I was using it about a month, and it's actually pretty good quality and nail polish stays on about 5 days or a week.

"This product doesn't work on my nails. They feel dry at first, but they are still wet and soft (easily messes up the nail polish when touched). I wouldn't purchase this again, nor will I use the bottle I bought. Came very quickly though. No issues with the seller.",1.0
"Product is soooooo thin and runny. And also wasn't sealed when I got it.  It's obviously been mixed with something or is just not authentic OPI. It also won't dry on my nails Bc it's been ""watered"" down with remover. Can't return it.",1.0

This is not the real mod about you. i used it on my toes and used the gel on my fingers and the color from this polish is much darker than the actual color it should be. it's more of a pepto bismol pink than a pale pink.

Also, the polish is the consistency of water. I showed it to my manicurist who laughed and said ""you've been ripped off."" Unfortunately it is too late to return this so i have just wasted my money ($9.50). It was overpriced for OPI anyway but I was willing to pay extra to get the color which I couldn't find locally at this time. Although this is in an OPI bottle, the label on the bottom of the bottle is not like any other OPI label that I have or have ever seen. It appears to be a counterfeit label. I did not open the package right away because I still had some of my original bottle left so now it is unfortunately too late to return the bottle for a refund.",1.0
"I bought this product to cover a tiny scar on my face and a few freckles. After reading the reviews, I was convinced to spend the extra dough on this product.
First of all, it's a pain in the butt to apply, you have to chisel it out of the container with the tiny plastic spatula they give you (and you will subsequently lose immediately), then put it on your hand and massage it with the tiny spatula until it becomes mushy -- It's gross! Not to mention messy and time-consuming.
However, I could deal with all this this if it actually worked like it was supposed to. It didn't cover any of my ""imperfections"" even though it was so heavy it made me look like a dime store dummy.

This Dermablend Cover CremeFull Coverage foundation is very thick and hard to work with. At first I thought it was going to be smoother and work better but it was so thick. It started to almost peel off of my skin a little. It also stuck to my problem areas ( t zone ) and caked near the under eye. The color and pigmentation of the foundation was more on the warmer side. They are definitely darker than I thought it would be. I would personally It was on for an hour and was already becoming blotchy.,1.0

The bruise and tattoo were still visible and after a couple of hours they were completely visible. It does not dry,  it stays tacky so a powder or setting spray is definitely needed. Is not water resistant. I would not recommend  this product for the price.  Any cake make up would do the same. I would not buy again. 40 bucks wasted.",1.0

"I am sure after using this product, that it is exactly what it touts to be.  That is a durable, full coverage foundation makeup.  Be sure that that is EXACTLY what you want because that is what you are going to get.
I am a fair complected senior citizen with very fair skin.  Still a few freckles.  What I don't need is a product like this one.  I think that this product is relatively easy to apply.  I followed the directions exactly.  There is a little spatula included and I used it to take a small amount of product (it only takes a little, believe me) and put it on the back of my hand.  Then I used my fingers to ""stir"" the product a little and then apply it to my face.  WOW!  A little bit of this stuff goes a long way.  Just remember that you can always add more but it is more difficult to take some away.
Several things of note here.
1) Much, much darker than I needed
2) Coverage is total.  I mean total.  You get a flawless look.  Rather like stage makeup with which I am familiar.
If that is what you want, fine.  Personally I prefer a more natural look.  If you too are looking for natural then this is not what you want.
Summary---I would prefer to use a concealer or cover up just on the spots where I might need it and not go for a total coverage foundation.  That is what this is and that is what you will be getting when you order this.",1.0

I purchased this foundation directly from the vendor website. Had high hopes. I have hyperpigmentation on my face And this foundation full coverage promised to cover them to a perfection. I warmed it up on my hand and work it on my face. I dab the first layer and reapply a second layer only on those areas where it was needed. It only looked dry and cakey. I could still see my dark spots. I was very disappointed. I try and try following the demos; but the results where always the same. Maybe it works for some people; it did not work for me.,1.0

Instead it just showed up more where the makeup came off. By the time I was ready to leave work the makeup was so bad I look like my face was scared (kind of like a burn victim) and very wrinkly. I have very few wrinkles under my eyes, but nothing like this! It also made my pores look huge! I'm glad this works for so many other people and wished it worked for me too.",1.0
"Let me start off by saying i never spend alot of money on make up, in fact it kills me to spend $9 on cover up.... I bought this because of its excellent reviews. And figured, why not just spend mone on myslef.... as i was so excited, I tried it for the first time today. And this is horrible. Does not cover any flaw. ( and i don't have many. Just a couole dry spots really) Goes on like water!!! I would have never ever ever buy this for that price ever!",1.0
"I am using my husbands shared account to write this post, so here it is....
This product is awful! I gave it many attempts and even watched youtube videos on it to try to convince me it was worth the money.
IT ISNT!
I am a pale girl so already my skin shows everything but I also have mild acne scares and lets just say this nicely....This product is like clown make up. It is thick and yeah it may fill in those acne scares but it looks so caked on. Not only is it caked on but you can feel it sitting on your skin. I attempted to apply several layers and even bought the setting powder with it and did as instructed and it looked so awful, I was wondering if it came with a red squeaky nose too. Please girls if you do not have perfect skin or looking for something light weight (like it claims) don't get this product. Save the money.",1.0

"Oh, how I hate Dermablend for tattoo cover-up. I mean, I tried to think really hard on what part of the body it would actually be effective and realized it would only be good somewhere where it won't rub off by coming in contact with other parts of the body or clothes. Which pretty much leaves the face, maybe the head and possibly the neck. Legs? The outer arm? Maybe, but you better not bump into anyone or it will leave a print and rub off.",1.0

"DOES NOT cover up red/purple bruising on the forearm, so how could it even cover up a tattoo? Try a cheap drug store product: Rimmel Match Perfection, it comes in a little tube with an brush type applicator. Even my Covergirl tube of concealer covers the bruise better than dermablend. I don't recommend it at all, waste of money.",1.0
"First, the company was excellent as far as accepting the return and issuing a refund. I ordered several shades so that I could mix to match skin tone to no avail. I tried several different methods in applying the product all with the same outcome. It was obvious that something unnatural was applied to the skin. The appearance was very similar to that used by morticians. The final appearance was similar to a mannequin made of rubber.",1.0

"The main ingredient is mineral oil, an inexpensive petrochemical byproduct made from petroleum. Mineral oil forms an impenetrable film over skin that traps in toxins and hinders normal skin respiration. Not only does it create a heavy feeling, but it can also plug up pores and lead to breakouts. Then, theres talc. A National Toxicology Program report found that cosmetic grade talc, even without any asbestos-like fibers, caused tumors in animals, and a group of senators have tried to have it banned. And theres isopropyl palmitate, a synthetic emollient that can cause skin irritation.",1.0
"This product makes me break out and I purchased it without reading the ingredients because it is supposed to be safe, but it is not safe for skins with acne. Moreover, I could never get some sort of natural ""makeup"" look using this creme and it did not cover my hyperpigmentation by itself. I needed to add other products before this creme to color correct the contrast.",1.0
"I have dry/combination skin, and this makeup is only for those with smooth/oily skin. If you have a few dry patches, or old acne scars, this will in no way look good. No matter how much i slather my skin with lotions or creams beforehand, this stuff just highlights all the dry parts, making me look like a scaly, cakey makeup monster. It's horrible. That being said, when I moved to a (considerable more) humid area, it blended in better. If you want to look natural and fresh, this is not the makeup for you. I am severely disappointed, especially considering all the positive reviews.",1.0
"I chose the right color, but I don't feel the coverage is good. I only have a few darkened areas, one major one and it isn't covered. Maybe if I applied it with a trowel, it would cover, but I'm older and that would look terrible.

I also had a problem with the tracking information on my order. I don't know if this is a problem with the vendor or a new amazon mailing policy.
The day before I received my package in my mailbox, the tracking information said:
""Package was delivered in office
The delivery receipt was signed by DON""
I have no idea who Don is or which office this passed through, but that is shoddy tracking information and is unacceptable. Don't tell me my package is already delivered a whole day before I get it in my hands.",1.0
"Too thick and greasy...Other cover up cosmetics do just as good a job on facial problems. I just think that

If you are searching for a good cover up that will cover up anything use the mac one in the pots. I would not buy this product again.,1.0

I tried blending it on the back of my hand and then putting it on my face, but my acne scars look even more noticeable after putting it on (and I also put foundation and powder on over it). It looks too orangy and just doesn't hide the redness.",1.0
"Wasn't exactly what I expected from other reviews. It does smear off and is cakey. If I were to wipe somewhere around it, you can see that It most of it had wiped off, wouldn't recommend for those who have vilitigo , it really looks cakey and has this glossy texture.",1.0

Bad color for me to light for my skin tone. They change their colors and now you have less to choose from. I guess they didn't sale much in the dark skin tones so they stop making it. And I love this product it covers and blends so good all day long if you have the right color. Carmel color!!! No more!!!!,1.0

"I'm not 100% positive but I don't believe this is a real Jane Iredale product. I've been using their products for years.
One, I ordered my normal color and this was not. Even. Close.
Two, it smells wrong and felt wrong on my skin.
I would never purchase again!",1.0
"This is not Authentic! I was so disappointed when I received it! I opened the box, which looks identical the the real stuff, however I could tell the sifter had been removed and replaced because it was not tight. The smell is soapy smelling and the authentic Jane Iredale has no smell. So sad!",1.0

If you wear Golden Glow PRESSED powder do not buy this product. It is wayyyyy darker and yellow than the pressed powder. Waste of time and money.,1.0
I don't like the product that was sent to be because it wasn't mineral powder but liquid foundation that I received. The mineral is more suitable for my skin than liquid bc I usually use the mineral as a finishing powder. The liquid foundation is watery and not thick enough for my liking even with using it alone. I've been a fan of the mineral powder ever since two yrs ago. I didn't want to send it back due to expense with shipment.,1.0
This product is a total fake. I thought the price was too good to be true and I was right. It smelled funny as soon as I opened it and it does not go on smooth with the brush the way the real Jane Iredale does. What a scam and I fell for it. This is not the real deal and I'm sad that this exists. I will never order from this seller again.,1.0
"I am a certified Jane Iredale makeup artist, and this isn't Jane Iredale foundation. It is in the correct packaging but the foundation has been switched out.  I ordered this hoping to find my favorite and the only makeup that doesn't irritate my skin at a discounted price, however when I received my order I put it on and the first thing I noticed was the scent. Jane makeup does have a smell, as all makeup does, but it has no fragrance and this most definitely had fragrance,  I could also smell the talc (it has a very distinct smell and if you know it, you can spot it in any makeup) which Jane NEVER puts in their products. My face then proceeded to rash and itch and I knew for sure something was up. I later bought an amazing base from an accredited Jane Iredale vendor and compared the two, there is a noticeable difference in color, texture, and smell. This is not the real deal, if you purchase this you are undoubtedly getting scammed by fake Jane Iredale, normally I wouldn't believe a review like this, but know that I am certified with jane and am a master aesthatician, I know my makeup and skin care. This may be cheaper, but that's because it isn't the real deal.",1.0
