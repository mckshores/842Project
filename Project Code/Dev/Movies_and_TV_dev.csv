"The movie was everything that we expected.  When we had recorded the movie from the TV with all the commercials. We had been looking for the VSH or DVD, but could not find it in the stores. When I checked Amazon and you had the movie I jumped on purchasing it. Thank you for caring things that you can't find in Department Stores.",5.0
"Henry Winkler is one of my favorite actors of all time.  He is wonderful in An American Christmas Carol!  This is another movie that has not been shown at Christmas in the last few years, but should be.  So glad that I could get it for my collection of favorite Christmas movies.",5.0
I found this take on Scrooge a very interesting and new . Sent it as a gift to my sisiter-in-law to enjoy also !,5.0
"Henry Winkler is a gifted actor and pulls off the part of an older man with style.  A new way to look at Dickens classic A Christmas Carol.  I remember this from years ago and was pleased to find it on DVD.
Great family entertainment.",5.0
This is a great movie.  I purchased it for my kindle fire and watched it and it still is a movie I love.  It was clear and the sound was great.  I can not stress enough how clear this is and how words can not express enough of how this movie is.  I will be getting more HD movies for the kindle fire.  Great for traveling for me.,5.0
I have always enjoyed this movie.  I had it on DVD but wanted it on Blue Ray and the quality is excellent.  I have no complaints and am very pleased to buy from Amazon.,5.0

"An American Christmas Carol is one of my favorite all time Christmas movies. Henry Winkler is surperb in his performance as a depression era scrooge. I encourage people to watch, they will not be disappointed. Patrick Wallace",5.0
"Henry Winkler does a great acting job as he protrays ""Mr. Scrooge."" Here again one the whole family can enjoy!",5.0
A Family Classic and Henry Winkler makes it great. I would make a great gift for any of your family or friends.,5.0
"As usual, Henry Winkler gave a superb performance, (Way to go Fonzie). Owning quite a few movies and cartoons on the Christmas Carol, I must say that this version has a somewhat modern, 20th century, yet fitting theme. I loved it. Highly recommended!",5.0
"Although my husband prefers the original Christmas carol, he does like this as well.  I love it. Henry Winkler is very good in this movie. A nice change from the original Christmas carol movies.",5.0
"A wonderful story about the Christmas Spirit & how it changed the life of a very lonely, old miser.  A true witness that it is ''NEVER TOO LATE''  to open up you heart & life to others.",5.0
Excellent movie. One of my favorite Christmas Carol versions. The movie takes on the usual Christmas Carol story with an American twist. Henry Winkler is a great actor.,5.0
Great twist on the original Christmas Carol. I have always enjoyed this one and it is never seen on television anymore.,5.0
Henry Winkler played a great part as Scrooge.  It gave yet another twist to all the Christmas Carols of the past.,5.0
"I was so thankful to come across this dvd. For some reason during the Christmas season they never show this movie on any of the numerous cable stations anyore. I haven't seen this movie on tv since the 1980's and I don't understand why, it is such a good movie and Henry Winkler's performance is terrific. I believe Happy Days was still on tv at this time albiet it was probably during the end of the series. The only place to find this movie was through Amazon just as they don't play it on tv you can't find the dvd in the stores either so the ability to find this movie was almost impossible except thankfully through Amazon. I would never pay as much for a dvd as I did for this one but it is one of my husbands favorite Christmas movies so it had a special meaning to surprise him with this as a gift, so thank you.",5.0
"I received the DVD within days; it was exactly what I wanted. It was a gift for my father for Christmas, we watched the DVD together as a family. Billing was easy, shipping was earlier than expected and product was exactly what I wanted.",5.0
"My brother loves this Henry Winkler version of A Christmas Carol called ""An American Christmas Carol"" and wanted it for his DVD Christmas collection. Its not in the stores and my brother was too cheap to purchase a DVD over $20, so it was the perfect gift!  I also purchased the suggested ""Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" with Henry Winkler, my brother hasn't watched it yet but said he has never seen it before, so I was happy Amazon suggested it also.  They arrived quickly and securely, overall 5 stars of happiness with Amazon.",5.0
I enjoyed this TV production the first time I saw it in 1979 or 1980 and really enjoyed it this time.  It is obvious that it is a TV production but most of the acting is good and the story set in the depression is good.  I am very happy it was still available.,5.0
"So hard to find this movie - it is by far the best SCROOGE of them all - used to play on TV every year but not for a long time now, so glad to have my copy now",5.0
"I worked for an ABC station in the 70's and early 80's so I knew and watched when this movie first aired.  I wasn't expecting a great show, just one of those expositions of ABC stars like ""Love American Style"" was in that error.  I was very surprised and my wife even cried.  This is a well written, well directed and edited movie.  Not corny but as the title denotes, with a script that moves away from the original script.  In this era of NAFTA and trade treaties this message is as timely as it was in the period of the movie.  Also Henry Winkler, who obviously plays the character in several ages, does a great job.",5.0
"This is a great movie, one that has truly been overlooked as one of the great ""Christmas Classics. It brings an refreshing twist to the ageless story of redemption.",5.0
A classic tale which has not been regularly shown on TV for years. This is one of the all time greats and Henry Winkler's performance is outstanding.  Highly recommended!,5.0
"I last watched this movie sometime back in the 80's when it used to be on regularly around Christmas time on TV. I loved this movie as it was an interesting and engaging alternative to the more common Scott and Finney versions of the classic Christmas Carol that always got the most airtime. It depicts depression era New England with a cold, grey feeling that really comes across the screen without bogging the movie down and having grown up in Boston, it makes it that much more intersting to me. The acting is top-notch, particularly from Henry Winkler. It was always one of my favorite Christmas specials. Then it went off the air never to return sometime back then (80's, 90's, I'm not sure exactly when) and I never forgot about it and often pined to watch it again but somehow always seemed to forget to look for it on VHS, DVD, or online. I stumbled onto it on Amazon via my Roku box and was delighted to see it again and purchased it so I can once again enjoy this teriffic movie with my kids! Any fan of A Christmas Carol (or just really good Christmas movies) should immediately get this movie in their collection!",5.0
"This is an excellent movie.  I had not seen it for many years.  It used to be on television every Christmas, but not in the last several years.  I checked Amazon and there it was.  I watched with my daughter the other night - she had never seen it before.  She enjoyed it.  Well worth watching.",5.0
I had been looking for this dvd for years.  Finally able to find on Amazon and am very pleased with the dvd.,5.0
"For years this edition of The Christmas Carol was shown on TV but has not been for the past ten years.  I bought this DVD four years ago and still enjoy it each December.
It is a great story of a man who finally realizes, it is never too late to live life!",5.0
"Henry Winkler did a wonderful acting job as Benedict Slade. I first saw this movie online recently and wonder how I missed never seeing it on TV. And not just his acting but it seemed all actors did a great job in this American version of Scrooge. After seeing it online I ordered it right away to add to our Christmas collection. If you haven't seen it I believe you will be pleasantly surprised. If you enjoy other adaptations of Scrooge you will certainly enjoy this movie.

If you would like to read more or order the dvd click this link. I've added it for your convenience, not persuaded by the seller.

"Saw this years ago on network TV and remembered how much I liked it. Winkler did a great job as the ""scrooge"" character. A more ""true to life"" version of ""A Christmas Carol"".",5.0
"Most of us remember Henry Winkler in the role of Arthur ""The Fonz"" Fonzarelli on Happy Days. I took a chance on this. He's an even better actor than I remember. The story is set during the depression. Henry's character reposesses furniture rented from him by various poor families. Instead of ghosts, he has visions involving the people he's left destitute. Not sappy like some Christmas Carol renditions are. I was favorably impressed by the story as well as the acting. Gerard Parks (Doc from Fraggle Rock) was also in it, as was a young Dorian Harewood. A nice addition to my Christmas Carol collection.",5.0
This is one of my favorite versions of the Scrooge story but they never show it now I can watch when I want to,5.0
I saw this movie on tv years ago one time. I always look for it every year to come back on tv. I never see it listed. It is a very good version of A Christmas Carol. Throughly enjoyed the video.,5.0
Henry Winkler was great and so was the cast.  I saw this years ago and very happy I could own it.  A great American take on an English classic.,5.0
"This is one of my two favorite adaptations of this classic. Henry Winkler plays an outstanding Scrooge character and this is my favorite role of his, cheesy moustache notwithstanding.

You will also find many great lines about life (look for the comment about ""the larger state"", ""records"" & ""if"").

Buy this movie, you won't regret it.",5.0
"""An American Christmas Carol"" is a quintessential version of Dickens' classic tale set during the depression.  I view it every year.  Henry Winkler does a wonderful job of the ""Scrooge"" character and his supporting cast does equally well.  It should be consider a classic film and is definitely one of the best versions of ""A Christmas Carol"".",5.0
i loved henry winkler in this movie i thought he did a great job  of acting,5.0
"What an enjoyable movie, it is a good one to have to go along with all my other versions of The Christmas Carol. It was a different role for Henry Winkler but he made a good Scrooge!",5.0
"This version of Dickens classic tale was a made for tv special in 1979. I first saw it when I was a kid and have watched it every year since. Henry Winkler does a great job as Benidict Slade, a Scrooge like charecter who needs to find the meaning of giving again. Sure the make up and some of the dialogue are dated, but the true meaning of the story shines through. If you have never seen this classic then try it out.",5.0
Glad that this american classic came out on dvd.  I have been waiting for it for a long time.  I haven't seen this production since it came out years ago.  Plus it's better than some Hallmark holiday movies.,5.0
"This is one of the best Christmas stories out there.
It was on T.V 15 or 20 years ago, I've been trying to track it down ever since.
It's the Christmas Carol - Scrooge story but with a new twist.
It takes place in America during the depression.

Received the product in excellent condition, in the expected time.
At a good price.",5.0
"How coincidental that this program, aired by ABC in 1979, is set in the USA during the Depression era and here we are 30 years later, in 2009, experiencing an economic malaise of our own!  I remember having seen this on TV but viewing it again now on DVD made me realize that I'd forgotten about how downright mean and cold-hearted Henry Winkler's character, Benedict Slade, really is!!!  Politically-correct viewing in the 21st Century has really insulated from harsh emotions such as those portrayed by Mr. Winkler.  The production has that 70's look to it but it is well done and the actors and actresses all bring an unpolished genuine-ness to their parts.  Being a fan of ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens, I am pleased to have this rendition alongside other classic versions as well as the 1984 IBM production.",5.0
"Henry Winkler is excellent. The only thing I have to say is, there was too much time spent on his Christmas past. I got bored with it. Otherwise, it was good and worth the money.",5.0
"this is my favorite twist on the orginal christmas carol.if you collect and enjoy different versions of this story this is a must have. henry winkler is fantastic, and the character transformation from a crabbie tight wad to a friendly giving man was very convincing . in the end his way of ""paying it forward"" added a new ending to an old classic.",5.0
"The best Christmas movie ever!  I saw this when it was aired on TV back in 1979 and purchased it on VHS when it became available.  It was our family tradition for years to watch this on Thanksgivng evening. I bought DVD copies for my children who now have families of their own who will carry on the tradition.
  Henry Winkler is amazing in this! No matter how many times I've seen this, I still laugh and cry.",5.0
Enjoyed the movie very much. It had been years since I had seen it on television. It is not on tv any more.,5.0
"Love ""A Christmas Carol"" with Reginald Owens In 1938.  But this Henry Winkler version has a nice twist on the original version, but nothing too way out. Hard to find movie now.",5.0
"This is the American adaptation of the Charles Dickens' classic.  It is interesting that in the movie the main character is seen ripping the pages out of a collector's item book of ""A Christmas Carol.""

Henry Winkler gives an outstanding performance as Benedict Slade, a loan officer who reclaims valued possessions of those unable to make late payments on Christmas Eve.

His visit by the spirits, the life in the orphanage and how one man helped him, leads to a very sentimental ending.

It would have been good if the images could be enhanced for better viewing.  This originally was a 'made-for-TV' program and is presented complete with the fade-outs for the commercial breaks.

David Wayne gives a great performance as the book owner as well as Christmases past.",5.0
"The Christmas Carol is my all-time favorite movie, and I had ever version imagionable on VHS, including this adaptation, but the remarkably enhanced quality of the DVD version is extremely enjoyable to watch. This rendition gives it an American twist, as Henry Winkler did a wonderful performance of a modern-day Scrooge.",5.0
"I was so excited to get a dvd of ""an american christmas carol"".
the quality is great and the service was excellent. this is one of our favorite christmas movies.",5.0
"93 Snazzes on the 100 Point Snazz-O-Scale! An excellent and original adaption.

An American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.
-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.
-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.

""Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.""
""Thank God,"" Slade responds.
""It's worse,"" Latham says.

A short while later Slade says ""But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!""
""Evil isn't just what you do,"" Latham replies, ""It's also what you DON'T do.""

A wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him.
-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged.
-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.
-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. ""Did you read that book, Mister Slade?"" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed.
""The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future? Complete and utter ... what was the word he used?""
""Humbug?""",5.0
This is an excellent remake of the Dickins' A Christmas Carol.  It should be placed along side your existing Christmas collection!,5.0
"We'd taped this from TV years ago and I was delighted to find this version on Amazon.  Winkler is fantastic as the Scrooge character.  While the story-line has been modified to be early 20th century New England the elements of the original Dickens story are preserved in this version.  I'm a ""Christmas Carol"" fanatic and this is a super addition to my collection.  Buy it- you won't be disappointed!",5.0
"""Scrooge"" will never be seen the same after you watch Henry Winkler perform!
  He brings depth to his character and makes this story more than merely an old miser waking up to the wretched reality of his existence.  ""Mr. Slade"" becomes someone we can understand, someone whose ambitions become a source of tragedy in his life; it was never his intention to become such a cold-hearted skinflint -- he simply allowed his thirst for ""success"" to blind his view.
  For anyone who appreciates art in its purest form, this movie is a must!!",5.0
"A friend put me on to this a few years back when he asked me to find it for him on DVD.  A Christmas Carol is a yearly read for me (at least once) and the Patrick Stewart version, being well-casted and closest to the book text, is also a yearly event, for me.  I also like the George C. Scott version, however, with reservations as other reviews mentioned - the annoying changes on some of the key points of the story.  That is to give you an idea where I am coming from with this version.  The title describes what you're getting - the Christmas Carol story with an American flavor.  Henry Winkler is excellent and, considering the time in which this was made, the production value is fairly good!!  Dorian Harewood is my favorite of the three ""ghosts"" who visit him and (SPOILER ALERT) I like the twist of having the visiting ghosts be the same people he was mistreating.  Depression-era America doesn't have nearly the ""romantic"" quality that Victorian England does, but it works well with the story.  Overall, a worthy addition to your collection of Christmas Carol movies.  Also, kudos to Image entertainment for re-releasing this at a reasonable price and getting rid of the dreaded snap-case.",5.0
"I have been looking for this particular video for some time (video stores and garage sales) It is not shown on regular t.v. any more and I was thrilled to see if for sale.  I would have paid what ever ther person wanted, but it turns out that I paid a very small fee and made my husband very happy.  The only thing I could say that was misleading was the mail time - when purchasing this I was told it would be at my door on December 17th and I did not receive it until December 22nd.  I try to understand it was the ""season"" but when it was shipped on the 14th it is very hard to see why when I live in a very populated city (tampa bay area)",5.0
I feel this is one of the very best Christmas movies of all times.  If I had the ownership of this movie I would reissue it into the movie theaters at Christmastime. Henry Winkler acting is purely magical.,5.0
I really enjoy this movie.  Its a Christmas Carol slightly reworked and looks like a television production.  I think Winkler does a good job covering all the age changes required.  I have it on my list of 5 or 6 must see DVDs every Christmas Season.,5.0
"Our family loves the modern tones to this classic story.  Henry Winkler is a joy to watch and each character plays their part perfectly.  I watched this as a little girl, and now my children are enjoying it as well. As the story unfolds I find myself furious with Slade, compassionate toward him and then in the end celebrating with him as he decides to take his new found joy and help someone else...we just love it!",5.0
"This is a wonderful movie. It stay faithful to A Christmas Carol, but it very American. A fun movie for one and all.",5.0
"We love this movie, and the DVD seems to be of very good quality.",5.0
"One of the best ""Scrooge"" movies, a very creative adaptation.",5.0
"I am happy I got to see this and it plays on my UK DVD player.

Mr Slade is as nasty as all the other Scrooges and you can tell who the characters are, Slade is Mr Scrooge and Thatcher is meant to be Bob Cratchet.

I am happy that I got to see this DVD because that is the only Christmas Carol DVD that I have not seen.",5.0
"Loved the movie with Henry Winkler, that aired on TV quite a few years ago.  We always waited every Holiday Season for it to be re-aired, but never saw it again.  It was great finding it on Amazon, and really enjoyed watching this charming movie again.",5.0
"This is far and away my favorite serious (i.e., not Scrooged) version of A Christmas Carol.  Pre-redemption Benedict Slade is simultaneously worse than Ebeneezer Scrooge, and more believable.  Scrooge is merely cheap, while Slade is actively harming his community, including the very orphanage where he grew up.  Meanwhile, his poor origins make his lifelong aquisitiveness easy to believe.  After the ghosts come, his earlier repossesions allow for a longer and more fun sequence of surprising everyone else with his new self.",5.0
"If you want the classic version, go with the George C. Scott or Patrick Stewart version. If you want the best family version, go with the Muppet Christmas Carol, which stars Michael Caine and is suprisingly good. But if you want to hear the same old story told in a new, effective setting, get this movie.  As a depression-era American miser whose experiences parallel Scrooge's, Henry Winkler gives a convincing (and at times heart-wrenching) performance. The supporting cast, including Dorian Harewood, also turn in exceptional performances. Nothing in this movie is tacky, anachronistic, overacted, or otherwise out of place - it is as well-crafted a Christmas movie as you can find. And if it leaves you completely untouched, let's just say that you may need some nocturnal visitors to give you Christmas spirit a special ""jump start"" this year.  In short, this movie deserves your family's full attention in the coming Christmas season.  I'm glad it's out on DVD, as we've worn out two videotapes of the show.

"This version of the classic ""A Christmas Carol"" is one of the best.

Henry Winkler is brillant as Benedict Slade and in my opinion this is his most outstanding performance. I watched this movie when it was first released on TV during his Fonzie heyday, and I never once saw that 50's character. He is immersed in his character and is a completely convincing ""Scrooge.""

I'm disappointed that this isn't shown on TV, and I have purchased it so I can enjoy it again and again along with my husband and little girl.

My top three ""A Christmas Carol"" versions star ""A Christmas Carol"" with Alistair Sim, ""Scrooge"" with Albert Finney, and ""An American Christmas Carol"" with Henry Winkler. I won't bother with the others.",5.0
"My wife and I grew up in New Hampshire where this version takes place; so we can easily relate to the characters and setting.  Asside from this, we both really like this version because it places the story in a more comfortable setting in general; early America versus England.

Both spins are great, this just adds to an already powerful Christmas message.",5.0
This is a great movie...It's a great twist of the original and Henry Winkler does an outstanding job as Mr. Slade.  I love the ending.,5.0
Io One word WONDERFUL MOVIE Henrey Winkler dose great job in this movie. A movie for the all family to watch if you love him as the fonz you love him as slade (scrooge),5.0
Henry Winkler stars in this remake of the classic tale of Scrooge.  This one is set in post-Depression era America and is oneof the best I've ever seen.  Winkler is equally at ease as a young man with a girlfriend or an old man with an attitude.  I watch this every Christmas and was delighted to discover it on DVD.  You'll love it!,5.0
"Bonjour!
Je crois que de toutes les versions qui ont t faites du conte de Charles Dickens, celle-ci est sans doute  la fois la plus originale et la plus fidle.  Le thme central est bien respect mais l'adaptation est totale puisqu'elle situe l'action en Amrique plutt que dans l'Angleterre du 19e sicle mais avec une touche dbut du sicle et moderne.
Mme si ce film n'est disponible qu'en anglais sur DVD, il vaut la peine d'tre achet puisqu'il n'est plus diffus  la tlvision depuis plusieurs annes suite  une msentente avec le producteur et il semble bien que la situation n'est pas prs de changer.  C'est un film de collection que tous se doivent de possder pour le temps de Nol.  Une version franaise a jadis t disponible mais elle ne l'est plus maintenant ce qui est trs malheureux.  Henry Winkler est remarquable.",5.0
"Like many other reviewers, I first saw this as a kid on television in '79 and Henry Winkler's ""Fonzie"" persona was still so much a part of the cultural fabric that it was somewhat shocking to even think of him, much less see him, as anything else.
However, I was transfixed by this adaptation on the Dickens story and was genuinely moved by Winkler's ( Benedict Slade ) transformation at the end. Winkler is simply superb: believable, funny, dramatic, and imminently likable even as the curmudgeon. The supporting cast is wonderful as well even though most of them, with the possible exception of David Wayne, will be unknown to most viewers. The actor who plays Thatcher (the ""Cratchit"" character in the Dickens novel) does a wonderful job of being as compassionate as the role demands without being too ""soft"".
The actors playing the roles of Mr. Brewster and Helen Brewster also hold their own and give Winkler solid performances to react to even with limited screen time.
The movie looks and feels like I would imagine turn of the century and Depression era New England to look and feel like to an outsider: quaint, majestic, proud; yet tired and despairing.
My only problem with the movie, and this is REALLY nitpicking, is that they simply made Winkler look too old for the latter Slade (""Scrooge"") part. the movie does an excellenet job of letting us know when things are happening, even in the Christmas Past scenarios, e.g., we know Slade and Helen broke up around 1917 because of the backdrop of the war effort (WW I). The contemporary story is set in 1933 and Slade looks like he has aged forty years instead of only 16 or so. He looks MUCH older than his contemporaries. However, maybe they intended to achieve this effect to accentuate his gnarliness. I just thought it was too much. The only other thing is that many of the actors are obviously Canadian born (Mr. and Mrs. Thatcher and Helen , for example)and several times their Canadian tones and speech patterns come out. This is noticeable particularly against the distinctive New England accents employed throughout the rest of the picture.
I recommend this DVD highly for anyone who loves the Christmas season, the Dickens novel in particular, Henry Winkler, or just any good heartwarming story. I looked for this on DVD and/or VHS for almost twenty years. It was worth the wait.",5.0
"""A Christmas Carol"" may well be the most-adapted Christmas story in literature, with version ranging from whimsical to musical to deadly serious.  This particular version, starring Henry Winkler as Benedict Slade (a.k.a. Scrooge) is my favorite.
The movie translates Dickens' classic story from 19th century England to Depression-era New England.  The result is very effective.  For me, an American born to parents who grew up in the Depression, the 20th century setting made the story feel very real.  The writers and director made excellent decisions in their choice of sets.  Three notable examples were the New England furniture factory as the setting for Slade's youth, the newly-conceived idea of consumer credit as the source of his subsequent wealth and avarice, and the choice of an African-American as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (""You must be Future,"" Slade declares, cowering before him).
Winkler's performance is brilliant.  He captures the essence of Slade perfectly, and makes the gradual transformation from miser to redeemed man seem natural and believable.  The scene at the Thatcher (a.k.a. Cratchit) household at the end of the film never fails to bring tears to my eyes and those of my family.  The supporting cast performs ably as well, making this a Christmas classic that one can watch every year.
""An American Christmas Carol"" debuted in 1979, midway through Winkler's popular ""Happy Days"" television series run.  After a few years of reruns, it disappeared from view until recently, when it became available on DVD and video.  I heartily recommend it for your holiday DVD collection.",5.0
"First time i saw this movie was 1985 on television. Henry Winkler was excellent! Actually, the whole cast was great. I spent 17 years trying to locate this movie. You won't find it in a video store, at least where i live. And they don't show it on regular t.v. anymore. It is a MUST HAVE if you collect christmas movies.",5.0
"TNT has put together a surprisingly good account of the Biblical story of  Joseph, betrayed into slavery in Egypt by his jealous brothers.  Martin  Landau as Jacob and Ben Kingsley as Potiphar give their usual first-rate  performances, with the role of Joseph also well-acted.  Leslie-Anne Warren is  the lustful wife of Potiphar, who unsuccessfully tries to seduce Joseph,  and lands him in the Pharoah's prison.  This film offers a very credible  depiction of life in the ancient Near East, from the desert tents of the  Hebrews, to the claustrophobic walled towns like Sichem, to the lushness of  civilized Egypt and the Pharoah's court. The film is faithful to the  Biblical account, and succeeds in making it come alive on the screen.  A  well-acted, well-scripted, and entertaining film.  END",5.0

"The story of Joseph and his victory over human weakness, enemies and oppression is an inspiring tale beautifully portrayed in the Emmy award winning 1995 miniseries ""Joseph"", with Ben Kingsley as Potiphar and Martin Landau as Jacob.  Excellent performances of jealousy and humanity that leave us rooting for Joseph and his brothers to get what's coming to them!  Life lessons from history that we can still learn from today.  Includes some scenes of violence.  Before showing to teen and younger audiences you might want to preview Scene 3 of Potiphar's wife's attempted seduction and decide if you want to skip it and forward to Scene 4.  Well worth the price with English, Spanish and French subtitles.",5.0

One of the best Christian movies I have ever seen.  Long but very impressionable.  It builds faith.,5.0
"One of my favorite movies. They did an excellent job of staying true to the story. As you watch this movie you are reminded of the faith AND patience of Joseph. If anyone in history had a reason to throw his hands up and declare that God had forgotten him it was Joseph, yet he remained faithful. The full story is told, even the account of Judah and Tamar which ended up in the birth of the root of the kingly line of Israel. Virtually everything was portrayed and accurately so. To me, the main point they really nailed was how Joseph woke up one day, still a prisoner, and by sunset he was the second most powerful man on the face of the Earth. This led to another fantastic lesson, Joseph all of a sudden had all the power anyone could want and while today we see people desire power so they can lord it over those beneath them and settle old scores, Joseph instead showed compassion. He could have easily destroyed his brothers or a least made them suffer as he had suffered but instead he displayed true character.... a lesson many in positions of power today could learn from. The story of Joseph is one of the most remarkable in Biblical history and rightly so.
You can spend your hard earned dollars with confidence when you buy this movie and you will want to either loan it to others or buy it for them as a gift. It's too bad that more movies of this quality are made, especially when you consider all the technology that is available.",5.0

"The 1977 theatrical version of this film was truly great.  It was a breakthrough. I hated the rerelease the so called ""special edition"".  It was the first time that I had ever heard of a director taking a magnificent film and then ruining it.  When VHS came out I hoped the far superior original '77 version of the film would become available but they only offered that aweful ""SE"" version.  Now the DVD is out and again Speilberg has blown it.  At least he has finally admitted that showing the inside of the mothership was a big mistake.  STill, he seemed to think the rest of his changes were worth making.  In my view everything they ended up doing weakened a once great film.  Now I hate that film.  It sucks.  I understand the only way to view the great origional '77 version is on laser disk which are probably very hard to find.  Screwing around with the original '77 version was the greatest mistake I'd ever seen a professional filmmaker make.  Allowing the origional to disappear the next.",1.0

"There's nothing wrong with this movie, if you like a bunch of bad tasted sequences, terrible acting, bad horror, this is the movie for you.",1.0
"What more need be said about this other than that it is a film by Spielberg, the insipid director who brought us such films as ""Always"" or ""Hook"", other than that he is the worst filmmaker since Bill Rebane? This early effort is even more idiotic than most of his more recent, half-hearted efforts. This film is an incredibly boring, almost plotless, overlong borefest that may well cure you of insomnia by boring you to death. Also, a special note to the manufacturers of this disk: This is the 21st century! We want more than just some sorry movie on the disk. If all we the public wanted was the movie we would gladly buy the VHS. For your next release, try putting some worthwhile extra features on the disk. At least then you might be able to trick the public into thinking they are getting something worth the money they paid.",1.0

THis is a dishonest ""horror"" movie, taking some bad teen actors, adding some badly produced gore, making funnyless jokes all around ... Everyhting failed miserably here ( and I like to watch ridiculous horror movies, like ""SCREAMS"", ""NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET"",etc, just for the sake of laughing ). But this one is so bad, I almost ejected the tape from my VCR in the middle of it. A shame that actor so young accept to shoot this kind of garbage.",1.0
"Having heard a lot about this movie, after seeing it, I utterly fail to understand what people like about it. The story: guy has a hell of a row with his wife, leaves her and his nice kids, travels the country with another wife, and finally leaves the mess around him in a spaceship. If this is what happens when aliens come down, well, let them please stay where they belong.",1.0
"I was sorely disappointed with this movie. I loved it when I was a kid, but after watching it for the first time since it was in theatres, I just wasn't impressed at all. I saw the DVD and couldn't resist, but I wish I would have. This has got to be one of the slowest movies I've ever seen. Spielberg never has been too impressive in my opinion, but this is pathetic. At least Jaws and E.T. have some action throughout the entire movie. Here you get a small glimpse of the alien happenings at the beginning, 1.25 hours of boredom, and an ending that just wasn't nearly as good as it was when I was kid. My kids couldn't stand it, so it's obviously not a timeless classic, like the other space/alien movies of the late 70s early 80s.",1.0
"THis movie is ridiculous. Even watching it as a black-horror comedy, it is horrible. To show gore is the only goal of the movie and even this fails, because the special effects are stupid. This could be a ""trash"" or ""B"" movie great picture, but everyone involved (teen actors, director, etc) are uninspired. This was a shame to the horror genre, which already is full of prejudices against it.",1.0
"Every remotely funny line in this movie (promoted as a comedic horror movie) was shown in the preview. If you like alternative horror movies, this may be for you, but I thought the plot was weak, the dialogue  contrived and the movie generally awful. The only redeeming qualities of  this movie were the acting skills of Seth Green and Rodman Flender. Know  what you are getting into with this ""B"" movie for the nineties.",1.0
"This movie is only for people who think teenagers smoking weed is funny. This movie didn't provide any laughs or gore, and it was nothing but an Evil Dead 2 ripoff. The story was one of the most pathetic I have seen in a  long time, and it resembled something of a late-night B Movie. In fact,  I've seen B movies with a better plot than this. Evil Dead 2 was 10 times  funnier in it's 20 minute possessed hand sequence, and a lot more original.  And the ending??? could they have come up with anything worse??? the chick  is tied up on to a car that is going to flatliner here on the ceiling,  which has a pentagram painted on it??? give me a break. but, like I said,  when you have guys like Seth Green smoking weed in a movie, it's sure to be  a winner with a lot of brainless teenagers who don't know what a real  horror movie is. or a comedy for that matter.",1.0

"'Stepmom' features the conflict between the ex (Susan Sarandon) and her replacement (Julia Roberts), augmented by the childrens' natural loyalties to their mother. Lots of tart-tongued dialogue in the beginning, with preventable and meaningless conflicts at the PTA, the home, etc. Eventually they come together, drawn by the ex's slow death from cancer. Maudlin, boring, and way too long.",1.0
I didnot like this movie. I thought it would be good because Julia Roberts were in it. (WRONG). It was just as boring as it could be. Watch Pretty Woman for a outstanding Julia Roberts performance.,1.0
"I bought this DVD for my collection.  I do not buy full screen format DVDs.  Amazon described the DVD as ""Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Full Screen, Widescreen, NTSC"" with an aspect ration of 2.35:1.  However, when it arrived, it was Full Screen only with an aspect ratio of 1:33.1.  Consequently, I returned it.  My recommendation, if you only want Widescreen, don't believe the description that this DVD is dual-layered and don't buy it.",1.0
"Julia Roberts plays Ed Harris' young new wife. Susan Sarandon plays Harris' ex-wife. Ex-wife does not like new wife. New wife does not like ex-wife. Ex-wife's cutsey, but bratty kids make new wife's life a living hell. Ex-wife thinks new wife is a stupid bimbo. New wife thinks ex-wife is a nagging battle axe. New wife and ex-wife fight and yell at each other ad nauseum. How does the film solve this conflict? Ex-wife is diagnosed with terminal cancer -- everyone reconciles, ex-wife and new wife suddenly love each other ... the end. Nothing like a convenient disease-of-the-week solution in lieu of a well-written, plausible resolution to the conflict. This is one of the most cliched, saccharine and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by Hollywood in the past decade. All of the acting talent in this film is wasted in support of a lazy, hackneyed screenplay that cheats its audience emotionally. If you like Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon or Ed Harris, please see Erin Brokovich, Dead Man Walking and The Right Stuff and run screaming from this nauseating cinematic catastrophe.",1.0
"Predictible, sob-story melodrama with a girlfriend agenda to boot! I'm surprised that Sarandon went anywhere near this, it's such a boring Hollywood take on the mom vs. younger girlfriend scenerio. Should be understood that this screenplay was originally written by real-life stepmom Gigi Levangie. I think Gigi had an agenda to push. For once I'd like to see Hollywood come out with a film that sings the praises of original moms, not younger-model girlfriends, and makes these original moms the attractive, healthy, mentally-sound very cool and sexy women they often are in real life. Let's give them the happy ending--they make the world go round! If you like soap opera drama-rama or you're a younger stepmom/girlfriend who wants justification and wants to demean the original mom/wife (I'm not an original mom or first wife, BTW, just an annoyed viewer), you'll think this is a great film. Otherwise, this is one to skip.",1.0
"Let's get one thing straight, I HATE this movie, I will make no attempt to give an un-biased review here. This movie deserves nothing more.
Where to start? Well firstly, It features the super hag, Julia Roberts, and as if this wasn't enough, Susan Sarandon is in it aswell.
Now if you haven't fainted at the sheer horror of that concept, you will when you realise the dullness of it's plot. Super hag doesn't get on with her boyfriends ex wife, then the ex-wife dies, the end. BORING.
After sitting through this painfully bad movie, I had to take a shower to get the stench of bad movie off me. I then had to watch some ninja movies to forget my terrifiying ordeal.
This movie was lacking (and went I say lacking, I mean totally viod of)in the most essential aspect of a movie, a** kicking. This movie could've been so much more entertaining if it had robots or pirates.
Please do not buy this movie, It's possibly the worse movie ever made.",1.0
"Stepmom (Chris Columbus, 1998)
It's probably considered at least a venial sin in America to criticize Columbus, who's bookended his directorial career with two of the biggest blockbusters ever to hit a big screen, Home Alone and the Harry Potter franchise. But let's face it. Home Alone was pure unadulterated emotionally manipulative schlock. The guy's made his mark directing the kinds of teen comedies John Hughes wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole (and Hughes even wrote Home Alone. One wonders why he didn't direct...). With Stepmom, Columbus has all the schlock with none of the cuteness of the child actors. Not that said cuteness ever made his films watchable previously.
There is only one actress in Hollywood who can make Julia Roberts look like she can act, and that is the detestable Susan Sarandon. While Sarandon has been nausea-inducing in a number of roles, this one goes above and beyond the call of duty. Sarandon's character, Jackie Harrison, is the ex-wife of hapless Luke (Ed Harris, showing once and for all that no matter how good an actor you are, if the script makes you look like an idiot, you will look like an idiot). She can't stand Luke's new girlfriend, Isabel (Roberts), and for that matter can't seem to stand much of anyone, including her own kids. Jackie is as loathsome a creature as the average viewer, and most non-average viewers, will ever want to meet. Were she male, she'd be on the Lifetime Movie network in a wifebeater T-shirt, throwing beer cans at the football game and smacking the kids around, and everyone would hate her. But she's female, and she's in a Chris Columbus movie, and so we're supposed to sympathize. (Oh, and to make sure we do, not far into the film she's diagnosed with cancer. Because that's an excuse to be [a jerk].)
Julia Roberts has only managed one decent role in her career, and that (Flatliners) lay in the strength of the rest of the cast. The fact that she can be singled out here because of the weakness of the cast around her says volumes. I could easily go on for another half-hour about the painfully overdramatized script, the shameless attempts at emotional manipulation throughout, the pedestrian camerawork, and the fact that, even though he's working with adults, Chris Columbus is still directing teen feel-good-because-everyone-bonds movies. But there are so many more deserving things to give bad reviews to out there I can't justify spending any more time on this painfully bad piece of dreck. (zero)",1.0
"I hated this movie.  I lived the ""stepmom"" role.  I currently the ""ex"" and my son has to deal with his ""stepmom"".  Let's start with the fact that Susan Saradon's character is so far from unreal it is not funny.  She dotes on her kids to a fault, keeps up the 3 story Victorian house all by herself, is smart and funny.  So I guess the only reason her husband didn't want her anymore is because she grew older.  But at least they still can be friends.  Hell, he even went out and bought a lid of grass for her to help with the cancer treatment.  I hate the depiction of father is suppose to be spending time with the kids and they are being taken care of by the fiance'.  Dad has to go to work, well doesn't she?  She loses her job over his kids crisis?  The mom doesn't have any friends or relatives that the kids can go to while she is in treatment?  No, she has to go to the woman who lost her son while she was working on a photo shoot. Too silly for words.  Pass on this movie...unless you are looking for the fantasy of how to deal with a family that is not yours.  Also see the Brady Bunch....",1.0
"I have been wanting to view this movie for quite some time. What a disappointment! The only character that was marginally believable was Sarandon's as a mother battling the fears of losing her children to the trophy wife. The rest of the characters were very uninteresting. I think the screenwriter and director should have done better step-parenting research. It would have done them wonders to log on to any number of newsgroups to get a feel for what real step families go through. The characters in this movie weren't real. I was very disappointed.
The rest of the movie was bland, boring, and frankly, unbelievable. I mean, what mother can afford to take a child out on a twilight horse ride on a moments notice? And where, pray tell, is this fantastic New York suburb Sarandon lived in that afforded her pastoral views of mountains and woods? Did anyone miss the fact the Roberts worked in NYC and was mysteriously able to pick-up the stepkids at their birthday parties and schools in this lush suburb? Sorry, I grew up in that area of the East Coast and I'm still guessing where this suburb is.
Find something better to do with 2 hours. If your really want to watch an excellent movie about the horrors and nuances of divorce see 1982's ""Shoot The Moon"" with Albert Finney and Diane Keaton. Now that was a good movie.",1.0
"This is one of the WORST movies I've ever seen. Not that the plot is that boring or the music not entertaining. But it is indicative of Hollywood's limits - having Roberts, Sarandon and Harris (thank God he's in here)  together is by no means a guarantee for a good movie. Everything sounds  fake, the acting is really poor, especially Julia Roberts' - but this isn't  new (see the last scene, for example). Let's forget this movie, there are  thousands of others waiting to be seen.",1.0

"Michelle Pfeiffer fails to convince me of her grief at losing her son to a kidnapper. She seems guilty about losing sight of him momentarily and for letting him get lost. Her guilt overtakes everything, and she is not a very devoted mother to her other two children. You can see that they are suffering from her neglect and total self-absorption. I felt that the movie was supposed to have been very compelling on an emotional, almost primal, level, but it was not compelling at all. I imagine that the book did a better job of conveying the terror of losing your child and realizing that your child may be gone forever. The people in the film all seemed to be too obsessed with themselves. Naturally this kind of tragedy will cause introspection and times of real doubt and soul searching, but I did not get the sense that the people here had any level of depth or sincerity.",1.0

"I must say, after watching this movie, I was looking forward to reading  some hilarious amazon reviews that would rip it to shreds....however, it  seems that most of the reviews were written by people that liked this  movie.  All in all, it was AWFUL!  The actors, some of whom did a fair job,  suffered from the terrible script.  Who wrote this movie anyway?  Most of  the dialogue was so unbelievably generic that it could have been written by  fifth graders.  I'm not really sure why Michelle Pfeiffer would waste her  time with this movie.  Unfortunately, she had to look as sad and vulnerable  as possible in nearly EVERY scene--this became OLD FAST.  Whoopie Goldberg  as an agent of the law?  Treat Williams, not a bad actor, also suffered  from his horrid lines.  I kept waiting for him to begin chasing Michelle  around the house with a butcher's knife yelling how it was really him that  planned the whole thing.  Then there's the oldest kid--all he does is WHINE  his dialogue throughout the movie.  And then there's Sam, the kid that was  lost for so many years...he looked as though he was quietly plotting the  demise of his biological family and just waiting for the right moment to  kill them all.  About the only role that didn't suck was the little girl,  who mysteriously disappears half way through the movie, never to be heard  from again.  And then there's the costumes and scenery.  I know this is  supposed to be suburban chicago, and I love movies set in Chicago, but the  wardrobe people apparently decided to dress everyone in the most cliched  suburban way possible, actually they look like they're modeling the new  fall wardrobe for some department store, and scenery....well you'll see  what I mean.  I haven't read the book, I must say, by the end of the movie,  it seems like the writers either forgot what they were writing about, or  the production ran out of money and had to end the movie the way it was.  Remarkably, the longest any dramatic tension is sustained is for about two  seconds, and any emotional interest in the characters is completely  non-existent by the end of the movie.  The chain of events throughout the  movie is nonsensical and ridiculous.  All in my opinion, of course.",1.0

I don't hate this movie title but I hate the company who produce it. It is Mill Creek Entertainment. They almost removed all of the closed-captioning or English Subtitling features on DVD. I do not understand why the original DVDs companies have it and sell off to Mill Creek Entertainment by reducing some of the important features. Even they don't add booklet inside (chapters/information). Whole thing is sucks! Try purchase original DVD of this title from Columbia/Tristar DVD if available out there.,1.0

Even though I've not changed my opinions about the former films, I thought I'd give LAH one more try.... I was unfortunate enough to find a DVD copy in the horrid & worthless pan & scan format.. albeit, it was only $1... Turned it off after 2 minutes in.. You know, had this been a 1.85:1 film & it was ""full Screen"", I could have worked with that and adjusted my HDTV to make it 1.85:1, but this is not the case with this film & most of the DVD's that Sony now releases in the 1.33 ratio...

The fact that any company this late in the home entertainment game would release a 2.35:1 film in a lousy 1:33 ratio is not only insulting and reckless, it shows incompetent individuals are making key decisions at the studios and they deserve to lose money.. This is yet another DVD from Sony which is worthless, and anyone who cares about movies and this film should avoid this version..... Oh, and I finally found an original '97 DVD release of LAH when released in both P&S & Widescreen on the same disc..

"This movie is the epitome of excess: budget, explosions, melodrama, ""cuteness"", in-jokes.  LAH is one of those films that thinks its a lot more hip and clever than what it really is.  It claims to be a spoof of the action movie genre when all it really does is shake its own hands.  The jokes are not funny and yet you get the feeling that the people responsible for this cinematic atrocity are sending a subliminal message that translates as, "" That skit was pretty cool, huh?"".  The action sequences, intended to be absurd, only elicit yawning.  The child, who was intended to be cute, is annoying.
The only saving grace, if you can call it that, LAH has is Arnold Schwarzeneggar's performance.  His (non)acting is just as good in this movie as it is in THE TERMINATOR or TRUE LIES.  If the only good thing about your movie is Schwarzeneggar's acting, then your movie is in serious trouble.
I like a good spoof movie as much as anyone, as long as it is funny like BLAZING SADDLES or THE NAKED GUN movies.  But I think this movie was best described on an episode of THE SIMPSONS.  On that episode there was a fancy party in which all the beautiful people of Springfield attended.  There was a character at the party inspired by Arnold Schwarzeneggar named Rainier Wolfcastle.  Police Chief Wiggum walked up the Wolfcastle and said, ""Magic ticket, my a**!"".  My sentiments exactly.",1.0

"I am one of the few who still has a VCR player and a dwindling library of VHS tapes. My prized tape was the Muppet's family Christmas. A few weeks ago . . . right after Christmas I wanted to watch it as I do almost every year or every other year. I popped it into my VCR and couldn't wait to hear the Muppet's preform ""It's a lovely weather for a slay ride together with you. ""  While driving to the home of Fozzy's mother. As all VHS tapes are bound to do,the tape broke ! :( :( I was soo heart broken. Now after new years and to give myself a present or two I didn't get during the season I came with a list that Santa didn't fill hoping to cross off a couple of my list. I saw that AMAZON had it and I was very excited. Till I read the comments. Than I was heart broken again! I would rather have not have any of it than a small part of it. I Wish I knew someone who had a tape of it I could borrow! I would be glad to have to fast forward though the commercials. As much as I love the show. It's the end seeing Jim Henson smiling and talking to sprocket that was my favorite part. He died a year or two after it premiered. Or at least I think that he died that year or sometime in the two years after. I remember wanting to watch it that December after he died. I watched the whole show happy to watch it on air with the commercials and they edited him out. It was very sad that he died so young.",1.0

"Yep, like just about everyone else here, I was extremely frustrated by the edited portions that were left out of this DVD. The cuts happen in what seem to be arbitrary places, and would probably be very confusing to someone who hasn't seen it before. E.g., the part where Fozzie and the snowman do their number together was completely cut, but not the later parts where he's trying to show Kermit his new act. Also, the part where Miss Piggy slips and falls on the icy patch was completely cut out, which was supposed to be the big pay-off of that whole running gag. I would never have bought this DVD if I had known ahead of time that I'd only be getting 2/3rds of the special I loved from TV. Not sure why they'd even bother putting this to DVD in the first place, honestly, unless they were just trying to get suckers like me to fork over the cash without being completely upfront about the product they're selling.

If you can get your computer's DVD player to play Region 2, your system will play the PAL format just fine. If you want to watch this on a traditional DVD player, you will need to either get a region-free player or convert it over to NTSC.

"My sister and I have been watching this special together since I was in sixth grade. I am now 25. Two years ago I purchased the VHS version, as our old version taped from the TV has some serious sound problems to the point of being unwatchable. I was *sick* with disappointment when I found that some of my favorite scenes, including the charming ""Muppet Babies"" scene, had been cut out.
Yesterday my sister told my that ""A Muppet Family Christmas"" had been released on DVD. I was thrilled, and immediately rushed out, looking for reviews of it. Imagine my frustration when I found that the DVD contained the cut version as well!
I think this is ridiculous.... and so should you! I really, truly, fail to understand Columbia-Tristar's logic. The total scenes cut were only about 10 minutes, but when you consider that the original show was only 50 minutes, you realize that they have cut out *20%* of the movie! With DVDs that can easily hold over three hours of movie time and are cheaper to produce than their VHS counterparts, how does Columbia-Tristar justify cutting out ten minutes of this classic? I could see paying... for a remastered, uncut edition of ""AMFC""...heck, I'd be willing to pay a lot more than that. But until they release it in its intact form, Columbia-Tristar won't be seeing a dime of my money...and I would advise you not to waste yours on this disappointing (DVD).

"Just watched this the other night for poops and giggles, holy jesus it's awful. You can see the twist the second you meet the character and everyone plays their crappy cardboard cut-out roles like a factory produced them. Really it's so unremarkable, so what's the appeal? Well the first one was a big success, so obviously it's riding on the coat tails, but what is it about dumb kids being underwhelmingly picked off by some guy in a raincoat.

Really it was entertaining to me though just because how stupid and typical it was, from the opening 'jump scare' where the white virgin wakes up in the middle of highschool class, I knew I was in for a craptacular 90's slasher. So white virgin wants to work on school like a good girl until her evil fun-loving black friends have her reluctantly come out and meet up with THE MOST OBVIOUS F***ING MURDERE-I mean sweet awkward innocent JC Penny Model # 12. The implications behind this movie are laughably obvious. ""Ohhh she's so sweet and innocent, she deserves to live, but the fat stoner deserves to DIE! Take that people I passively look down on!"".

Also in a packed and crowded club the director knows that another cheap jump scare needs to be tossed in or else the mouth breathing teenagers won't be interested, so white virgin sees a shadow reminding her of the killer until she realizes it's just the dark, but wait, it's the corner of a club with couches and everything, and no one's sitting there? Have any of them actually been to a club or did they have to ignore basic club settings in order for the cheap phoned in jump scare to work.

So eventually they wind up on the tropical island for some stupid trivia thing with the worst hosts ever, for CREEP FACTOR we have to have the hotel staff be antisocial and intrusive, the maid for example ignores white virgin, ""oooooh, how creepy, she doesn't respond"" F*** you that's stupid. Then they meet the hotel owner who glares at them and basically makes them feel as unwelcome as possible, even though his business seems to be going into the crapper. Then they meet Jack Black playing himself, and the guy seems friendly enough, basically offering the guests some marijuana if they need some, then Tiesha is all like 'get away from me you smelly hippie', there goes what little amount of empathy I had for these characters.

So much more stupid crap happens without a shred of thought or time put into the production, even the kills are PG-13 caliber (well by today's standards) and we often cut back to Freddie Prince Jr. doing, something? I don't really know what he just has a bad feeling and runs around, apparently as fan service to the girls watching. Then we get more standard cookie-cutter unorignal scenes such as NO ONE BELIEVING WHITE VIRGIN GURRL, or Token black guy is the first of them to get offed and no one seems to care.

Then later we meed biker chick who runs the bar, and while virgin white gurrrl lives, random biker chick is killed off, because the white suburb kids watching need to know that that lifestyle is looked down upon and you'll likely get murdered if you live like that. Token black girl living was only a treat for virgin white girl because no one else really cared about her character.

So OH NO CREEPY AWKWARD WHITE DUDE TURNS OUT TO BE THE MURDERER, no f***ing s***, who didn't see that coming a mile away? Then he disappears throughout the second half of the movie and only pops in once in awhile to remind the audience ""hey I'm still here"", then finally shows that he's the bad guy to the last retard in the audience who couldn't tell and puts his EVIL FACE!!! on. This wimp is the least threating villain ever, and his dad comes up and f***s him in the ass or whatever, I stopped paying attention at this point, this movie SUCKS!

"Trash and an unnecessary sequel.

So many holes in this story it makes no sense. First of all if Karla is Julie's best friend and sees how much Julie likes Ray why is she trying to hook her up with someone else. She's not trying to help her alleged best friend and comfort her just go and sleep with someone else. Knowing that Julie is somewhat paranoid and Karla knew most of the story that Julie went through why is she sneaking around the apartment in the dark with no lights on in the house and if they go to the same school why would Karla think Julie was out of town, looks to me classes are still going on

To make this movie even more ridiculous, Karla the genius says Rio as the capital of Brazil and for those who know geography very well know right off the bat that this was a set up. Bill Cobbs' character knew that it was the wrong answer but yet didn't say anything to warn the four people that Rio was the wrong answer and help them try to go back home, waits until the last minute for the body count to pile up.

Ben Willis have so many opportunities to kill Julie when she's at the club, in the bathroom, in the tanning bed and don't do anything plus he could have killed Ray after he fell but didn't do anything there either. So this killer is a complete moron but the victims are even dumber when some of them were armed with weapons ( a knife, axe, baseball bat mind you) they completely forget they had these weapons and don't make it a possible 3 on 1 attack and just run. Don't even try to work together to kill this man. I guess if you have common sense horror movies won't exist.

Plot holes everywhere in this movie.",1.0
"This is a terrible film that was totally unnecessary and unoriginal. It is just a rehash of the first film, I Know What You Did Last Summer. The film has a clich epilogue that contradicts what came before. I won't give it away, but you could easily guess it. I hated this film.",1.0
"amazing 109 people out of 295 gave this sickening display of  B-cinema uniform acting no-no's...five stars. Horrendous, exceedingly poor inception, timing, predictable, not fun, not scary, not suspensful, lacked character development, irritating and nauseating tension, if any; grade school level acting responses to often life threatening situations, freddie prinz jr is enough to make this film a one star from jumpstreet, jennifer hewiit is cute...cute, not talented, cute.

The whole film is a basis of a makover of Scream which just goes to show, that anyone...ANYONE...can be famous...that is food for thought for all your theatre majors and film students.

Save your money, and save your precious time, avoid this film. ""Uh, duh, uh duh,"" that is how one feels after viewing this atrocity; this mindless banter of redundant B film acting.

"Director:  Danny Cannon

Cast:  Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Brandy Norwood, Mekhi Phifer, Muse Watson, Bill Cobbs, Mathew Settle, Jeffrey Combs, Jennifer Esposito.

Running Time:  100 minutes

Rated R for intense terror violence and gore, strong language and some drug use.

It might not have been the greatest movie ever made but, thanks to the canny direction and score, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" was a very effective thriller. Shame the same can't be said of this sequel, which crams in every slasher clich known to man with such little awareness of how hackneyed it all is that it actually seems to believe this is scary stuff.  In a fit of apparent desperation, writer Trey Callaway packs Julie (Hewitt), survivor of the first film, off to an island in the Bahamas when she wins a holiday thanks to a radio show calling her number. Joining her is fish-faced Karla (Brandy), her boyfriend Tyrell (Mekhi Pfeiffer, who I seem to remember used to have a promising career) and spare wheel Will (Matthew Settle). Joining them soon after that is the killer fisherman, who engineered the prize (the fact that Julie's number's unlisted doesn't set off any warning bells) and proceeds to slice his way from one end of the movie to the other. There are no boats scheduled for days, the phones don't work, and there's a storm on the way...you get the picture.

You can practically hear director Danny Cannon, whose last movie was the underrated ""Judge Dredd"" and who deserves a lot better than this, sighing behind the camera at just how witless all this is. Cannon does manage to captivate the beautiful island scenery and the excellently-captured eeriness of the hotel at which the quartet of teen protagonists are vacationing (it's also a sort of sad waste of overall possibilities when you reflect on how they utilized these potent settings); a couple good scares throughout, though nothing scary, as if any movie could be deemed such; Freddie Prinze, Jr. is certainly not a notable talent, yet he exudes sufficient charm and is a likable hero; Mekhi Phifer, in a stereotype black tough-guy role, gives his role some enjoyable attitude, but his disbelief of Julie's claims that a killer's on the loose become tiring and cruel. ""I Still Know..."" fails due to a maddening lack of logic, intelligence, and most plausible qualities of humanity in all the characters; entirely arbitrary and thus boring murders of all the islanders we don't even really know is an obvious compensatory ploy for the fact that only two of main five characters are killed; technically mediocre acting (except Hewitt), plus bothersome, forgettable work from newcomer Brandy; low-IQ script; splotches of incompetent directing throughout; an incredibly demeaning and character-betraying ""shocker"" finale that essentially tosses this film into the pile of identical slasher formula flicks from the past 20 years. Our only consolation is that it may just be a dream, a la the ""surprise"" ending of the first ""I Know What You Did Last Summer""...I guess we'll find out if and when ""I Still Know What You Did Lots of Summers Ago"" is made.",1.0
"Please if you think this is good horor then you don't know what good horror is, this movie along with the first one and even all of the Scream movies are garbage any real fan of cult horror or real horror will tell you don't wste your money. Real horror is made from the start of the first night of the living dead 1968 till about late 80's then from there horror quit is not wat it use to be.  "" I know what you did last summer "" is not good AT ALL",1.0
"I can understand why a sequel was made to ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" because of the ending of the original.  But I DON'T get why it had to be so stereotypical and poor.
The sequel follows Jennifer Love Hewitt's character Julie to college, where she still has flashbacks of that fateful summer where she was being chased by a hook-wielding killer.  Her roommate Karla, played with limited acting skills by singer Brandy, tries to take her mind off things and suggests that Julie dates someone new (Julie and Freddie Prinze Jr.'s character Ray are estranged at the film's start).  To their surprise, the girls win a trip for four to the Bahamas for answering a trivia question in a radio contest.  Julie invites new crush Will (Matthew Settle) and Karla takes along boyfriend Ty (Mekhi Pfeiffer).
Here's where the problems start.  First of all, the writers must think that the average viewer of this film has a third-grade education.  Intelligent audience members smell a rat early on in the film when the girls incorrectly answer that the capital of Brazil is Rio de Janeiro (it's actually Brasilia).  When the real answer is revealed at the climax of the movie, did the writers expect everyone to go ""Ohhhhh!!""?  I hope they don't think we are THAT stupid!
Another problem:  the geniuses behind this film were obviously trying to clinch the attention of the males in the theatre by having Jennifer Love Hewitt run around in white t-shirts drenched with rain.  As a heterosexual female, I got tired of seeing Ms. Hewitt bounce around and felt this move was cheap on behalf of the filmmakers.  Well, with a sub-par plot and mediocre acting, I guess they felt the need to do something.
One more pet peeve:  why must Hewitt sing at some point in every TV show or film she appears in?  I cringed at the contrived karaoke scene in this movie.  Don't you think it would been more obvious (and probably more enjoyable) to have already-established pop star Brandy sing a song?
Viewers sit through one cliche after another until the unsatisfying and predictable twist is revealed at the end.  And then the ending itself is another cliche, hinting once again at another installment.  Thank goodness it hasn't been made (yet).
Chalk this up as another unnecessary slasher flick specifically made to capitalize on the success of ""Scream.""  While ""Scream"" had a certain wit to it, this is plain silliness rolled up with blatant T & A.  Don't waste your time.",1.0
"If you couldn't get enough of attractive well-known actresses from this month's hot TV show being casted in moronic horror movies with no love for the genre whatsoever then I've got good news. Another ""I Know What You Did"" film. The fisher man with the hook for a hand is back after Hewitt and her obnoxious friends which include returning Freddy Prinze, Brandy, and Mekhi Pfefier as the token black guy.
A year after the first incident, Julie (Hewitt) and company have won a trip to a tropical resort. Little do they know that it has all been set-up by the killer from the original and he is looking for a little more retribution. A predictably gory onslaught ensues to the backdrop of an incoming storm that is making life even more difficult for these poor kids.
Hewitt is the highlight of this film- but not for her acting chops. Her beautiful cleavage and knack for wearing soaking-wet white T-shirts is really the only redeeming value in this very dumb sequel. Jack Black as a goofy white wannabe Jamiacan is too annoying for words. Freddy Prinze is as terrible as always in his portrayal of goofy guy-next-door Ray. Love gets to do her thing here as she not only sings karaoke but gets to explain to co-star Pfeifer why ""her people can't dance"". Even tremendous character actor, Bill Cobbs, is wasted in this awful sequel. It's over-acting galore as Hewitt and Brandy trade screams and arguments back and forth in the rain. As mediocre and tired as I found the first film, the script for ""part two"" manages to show it up in every way except the good kind.",1.0
"I Still Know...is as absurd as they come. Four teens, who are sharing a brain, win a trip to the Bahamas. They arrive to learn that they have arrived at the end of season, which is the 4th of July. Forget the fact that they don't celebrate the 4th of July there. This is a neat way of reducing the cast size. Later, there is a supposed hurricane, but the production company wouldn't put out for more than one rain machine, so it's pretty dinky. It does make a fine mess of Hewitt's hairdo, which was bad before it got wet.
The fisherman they thought they killed in the first movie is back, and boy! is he upset! The kids waste a lot of time chasing the wrong killer. One of the hotel employees practices voodoo, so he's got to be it, right? No, this is the Caribbean, not Omaha.
I lost track of the body count because the person I watched this one with couldn't keep a straight face. When I said I was doing my job, they really fell apart.
This is that new breed of movie in which no one knows how to write the music. Here, there is scary music every time someone turns their back to the camera. HD20 had the same problem. These little movies used to have some interesting music, as well as some swell camera angles. Now they've all turned into MTV marathons.",1.0
"'I Still Know What You Did Last Summer' really does milk the slasher formula.  It's a follow-up to the pretty good 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' but the first movie already killed off the only two members of the cast that could act.  The title is also all wrong - shouldn't it be the summer before last?
The story involves Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and her new best friend (Brandy) win a trip to the Caribbean.  So off they hop to a conveniently remote island with Brandy's boyfriend and a random guy that they don't know.  The fact that's it's storm season leads to a lot of obvious plots involving people not being heard over the wind and a lot of thunder that is probably supposed to rack up tension.  There is absolutely nothing tense about this movie.  The usual round of killings ensue with a man stalking through the hotel, which is inexplicably almost empty save for a few signposted red herrings.
Whilst the first movie had a tongue-in-cheek yet still fairly creepy script by Kevin Williamson of 'Scream' fame, this has no hallmarks whatsoever.  Apart from Brandy, who manages to ground the rest of the cast, the acting is dismal.  It says it all when the audience looks forward to the arrival of Freddy Prinze Junior.  The ending is laughable and there isn't a scare in sight.  This isn't just one of the worst sequels ever made but one of the worst movies too.",1.0
"""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,"" if nothing else, should at least get an Academy Award for Longest Movie Title of 1998. In fact, the title could be a testament to the movie itself: unnecessarily long, cheesy, and a big letdown as a sequel to a movie that is only slightly better. The plot is pure contrivance for the conveniance of putting its characters in unspeakably tedious situations, the acting and characters are equally uninvolving, and the overall message gleaned from this film is one that portrays it as a pointless excuse for bloodletting and gore.
The movie picks up where the predecessor left off, with a silly dream sequence that seems to belong in a comedy spoof of these films instead of here. Julie apparently has been haunted by these dreams for many months since her last encounter with the killer from the first film, Ben Willis, who fell off the boat in the end of the movie and was never seen again. Until now, but more happens before then. Julie's best friend, Carla, wins a trip to the Bahamas by answering incorrectly to the question requiring the capital of Brazil. Of course, given the mentality of this film, I wouldn't expect too many people to know the right answer, and I guess the filmmakers were counting on that, too.
Anyway, Julie calls up long-lost Ray, asking him to go to the Bahamas with her, Carla, and Carla's boyfriend Ty. Ray refuses her, but then decides to surprise her. Of course, on his way to meet Julie at the airport, he is set upon by Ben Willis, and ends up in the hospital, from which he escapes and spends the rest of the movie trying to reach the resort. That resort is Tower Bay, where the group, along with newcomer Will Benson, who has it bad for Julie, finds out that the resort is left entirely to them due to the incoming of heavily inclimate weather. ""This is our version of winter,"" says the hotel clerk. So pretty soon, the rain is falling, and so are the bodies, moreso than the first movie, and much more gratuitously.
The movie really has nowhere to go but down from here, relying heavily on gore, blood, and useless plot twists to create what they hope will be a sense of tension and suspense. No such luck. Yes, we do spend some time wondering who is going to meet the fishhooked Ben Willis next, but since we never get the chance to know the characters, we never can care for them once they are killed, sauteed, gutted, and what-have-you. There is never a moment in this movie where you'll find yourself saying, ""This is such a good film,"" because there's never any reason to. What makes it even worse is that the movie makes itself out so that it is not necessary to see the first in order to get the second. It spends so much time dwelling on the past that its concern for its own events are missed by a longshot.
Nothing but contrivance for this film as well, bringing us the same, tired situations that its characters dwell in, going over the same old routine until we feel like we've seen every horror movie known to man. Ben Willis was supposedly killed in the ending of the first, and even if he's alive, he missing a hand. Not a problem. Slap a new hook on him in place of the severed hand, one that's permantently attached, so he can kill quicker and easier. Now the characters need to be placed in the most vulnerable of positions at key points in the movie. All taken care of; just send them to a secluded island paradise that is about to experience a major weather crisis. Need a couple of simple characters for extra bloodletting. Hotel management: 'nuff said. Are you seeing a pattern here?
And what is with the secondary characters of the movie, anyway? One of them is the waitress in the hotel bar, who always seems to be giving us hints that she may have something to do with the killings going on, but trust me, thinking that way leads nowhere. And what about that pot dealing freak with the dread locks? This is as hokey a character as you can get, and never have I seen such a waste of plot on such a stupid character (though I kept wishing he'd hand me a joint to get me through the rest of the movie). The character of Will is a wuss, enough said, and even when it comes time for his major involvement in the plot, it turns out to be one of the cheesiest and most contrived aspects of the story.
I had a hard time trying to decide as to whether or not this is one of those bad movies that happens to good actors, or if they should be held responsible for getting into it. Hewitt and Prinze, Jr, who reprise the roles of the earlier film, should have known better when they read the script that this material would not be sufficient enough to live up to the standards, however low, set by the first film. Brandy Norwood and Mekhi Phifer are the newcomers in the places of Phillipe and Gellar, and Phifer is the most amusing as the oversexed boyfriend who turns sexual frustration into comedic relief; Brandy is okay on TV, but I think in this case, a bad movie happened to her as an actress.
In watching this movie, I kept thinking to myself, ""People are actually going to like this."" Then I found myself thinking of the demographic group who would gobble this stuff up and actually enjoy it. This is going to appeal mostly to young teens who want to be more like the older set of teenagers who have seen movies like this, one of those ""in-crowd"" movies that makes you look popular. To those who fit into this group, you're in for a sorely rude awakening.",1.0
"Even if you watch this as a comedy, you'll feel bad. You take an already weak plot from the original and throw away any merits it could have in this  lousy sequel.

"I can't believe a sequel was made. It's not like IKWYDLS was original or that anyone ASKED for a sequel. The idea of sequels isn't a bad idea. If the sequel improves on the original or develops the characters more it is a  very good idea. But ISKWYDLS was ONLY made to make money from the naive  audiences who saw the first.

Well we were very much robbed. This film is  worse than the first. Nothing surprising happens. It is a VERY badly  written film, I kid you not. This is not the films worst quality. The  acting, photography, lighting, direction, music and editing are terrible.  Even the title is too long and stupid. I STILL KNOW would have been a much  better title.

Like many of it's predecessors, in the late 90s and early  80s, we have close-ups of the actors who are suddenly surprised by their  friends from behind while being suspicious that someone is at that moment  watching them. While this happens a burst of very, very loud music tries to  enhance the ""effect"" of the ""scare"". The other clich it doesn't bother to  not use is the one where we think that ""The killer"" is watching them from a  closet or something and then we realize it's just cat or banging window in  the wind. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN (during a moment of false security) THE  KILLER APPEARS OUT OF NOWHERE. Puh-lease. Give us a little credit.",1.0

There are some films that try to be something MORE than they are.  B-Movies are awful,  everyone knows it.  Movies like Iron Eagle, Red Dawn, Batman & Robin, and Alien:  Resurrection are trying to be something they are not; attempting to be  better than they actually are by throwing more money at it, casting bigger  stars, rewriting the already confusing script to cover the plot holes, or  just painting the screen with violence and explosions so they can get the  male crowd to buy the ticket.  This film is rife with so many alarming  problems that make you wonder how funding for it got off the ground.  But,  it was mid-eighties and the Cold War, so we needed flicks that flexed the  American military might and insulted Middle Eastern countries.  This film  is an embarassment to the US Air Force (yes, I am a member) and is  characteristic of America's skewed prejudice of Middle Eastern countries.  The generalized depiction of these people is abhorrent and frankly very  embarassing to watch.  No wonder America seems to not understand that  region of the world.  We take movies more at face value than we should.  If  you want to kick back and just watch it and veg, fine.  Just don't think  it's a realistic and deep film.  It isn't.
Easily the top film on my  list as the worst ever.  Funny thing is, if it's on, I watch it so I can  amuse myself by ripping it apart.  I guess you could watch it for the  flying sequences.  But, if you're going to do that, why don't you just buy  a video on military aircraft then.

"This movie was recommended to me and I had heard that it was classic and like De Niro as an actor along with Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel.  If you were to edit the useless scenes out of this movie it'd be about 30 min.  Foster is billed as a main character but has one scene in the first hour.  Shepherd's character serves no purpose outside of showing that De Niro's character has issues, which you should be able to figure out fairly easy without her character.

Having not been alive when this movie came I'm not going to try to understand the time because I simply can't but this movie is so utterly boring that it almost puts you to sleep.

All that says that is one particular clip in a liquor store where this stupid black bank robber comes in and uses the GD word while trying to steal money from the clerk. Hearing the GD word come out of this pile of steaming trash made me so infuriated that I wante to scream so loud that it would kill me. USING THE 'GD' WORD IN A MOVIE IS INEXCUSABLE REPULSIVE!!!!

I don't mind the fact that he is cursing, but using the GD word, or anything else that takes God's or Jesus's name in vein is incredibly wrong. I'm glad this nobody was killed in this scene, because he he deserved to die and suffer for eternity.

Do not watch this movie, or any movie with cursing where nobody actors use the GD word while trying to get their point out while using swear words. Watch movies that are innovative where the usage of this word is easy to ignore.

That, of course, means a lot of the picture is cut off. The so-called 5.1 surround sound is just as bad, with little detectable sound from separate audio channels.

We all must overlook the details in most movies.
However, this inane and unplausible plot is not saved by the thrill of a boy hopping in a slick military plane and the ensuing ""save the world"" 8-year-old fantasy.  The storyline would make much more sense if the hero/child Doug Masters actually were a 5-year-old boy who wandered away from his nanny and happened upon an Air Force jet.  Then, the film could be enjoyed for its ridiculousness.
The memory of seeing repeated glimpses of this movie repeated on HBO 18 years ago reminds me of how well this film captured the ""Worst Movie Ever"" in my book.  There are worse movies out there, but this one is insidiously hyped up enough to make a fool out of you too to ever actually watch it.",1.0

"I rarely feel like walking out of a movie, but I did with this.  I was watching the DVD and thought about stopping it but instead just let it play while I went about other business.

This movie has no point to it.  it is weird oddball humor for no other reason or purpose other than weird oddball humor.  And I use the term ""humor"" very loosely.

It's obviously not supposed to be a real-life story; it's too strange.  It can't be a satire; there's no parallel to anything in real life.  It's not much of a comedy; the story is weird without being funny.  So what is it?  Nothing.  It's just a bunch of strange characters doing strange things for strange reasons, that has no emotional heft.  You don't care about the characters because they are all caricatures.  You don't feel any emotion because the plot is just absurd.  You don't laugh at any ""jokes"" because they aren't jokes, they're just people acting oddly.  There is nothing to enjoy in this movie.  It seems to be an exercise in deliberately being as weird as possible just for the sake of being weird.  But I see no purpose or artistic point to it.  Maybe we're supposed to be challenged in our assumptions of narrative, coherent story, interesting characters?  For what?  The whole thing is pointless and a waste of time.

I felt the same way about The Royal Tenenbaums.  But I want to be fair and say I did like Rushmore, which was odd but had more of a believable plot and characters.  I am sure nothing and nobody like that exists in real life, but at least it was within the realm of realism.  At least enough within it to prevent me from rolling my eyes at the absurdity of it.",1.0

Dreary movie and disjointed. Can't believe it was nominated for best picture!,1.0
"This is a classic example of self-important Hollywood congratulating itself. Don't be swayed by the pseudo-intellectual thumbs up garbage.
De Niro's acting is phenomenal, but the story line, character development,( Jodi Foster gets top billing in the credits right after Di Nero, but does not really appear in the film well into it's second half,  the over the top music,( just listen to the score after everybody is dead, about 10 minuets before the end ). What is up with that? Most great directors make one or two horrible movies. This is Marty's absolute worst. Don't waste your time.",1.0

"I absolutely love Wes Anderson. He is, without a doubt, one of my favorite directors (and, who doesn't like the Wilson brothers?) Since it was Anderson's first film, I was expecting a ""rough around the edges, super quirky, but heartfelt"" story. Not so. I was shocked that his movie did nothing for me. As a matter of fact, I couldn't wait for it to end. My recommendation - don't waste your time.",1.0

"What did they do to TAXI DRIVER? I was excited to order the 4K version. I immediately put it on my 4K Blu Ray player to watch on my new 70 inch 4K TV.  What a waste of time and money. I don't know what mastered copy of the film they used for this version, but it's a total bust.
Grainy, no sharpness, even the colors seem slightly muted. DO NOT BUY. I'd return it, but can't since I've already opened the package.",1.0

"All the movies of Mel Brooks you'd want but I can't get any of them to play in 3 different DVD players. I bought back in October, gave to my son to put in our Ice Castle fish house for us to view or him and his buddies. He told me at the end of December, after a fishing trip,  that he couldn't  get the DVD's to play in Ice Castle. Finally got them back to me and I tried 2 more players and NOTHING. Now what do I do with the set?  They were a brand new, unopened set. Never ever thought I'd have to worry about a whole set being bad !!!!!!!!!!",1.0
