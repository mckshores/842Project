Review,Rating
My 7 year old son loved this case and all the pockets. It keeps his adventure bible protected and he loved the compass.,5.0
"Read reviews first! Med was WAY to big for a Cub Scout book, which is why I bought it and based on reviews. I don't know about the spiral versions because our troop gives them to us and they're not spiral. But the regular book, way too big. So I put the Adventure Bible hardback in it... Perfect fit (as description indicates). I will be trying the small for the scout book next.",5.0
"The PERFECT cover for a Boy Scout Handbook. Well made, and the pockets are nice to hold a spare pen (which Scouts typically forget on their uniform). We will see how it holds up, but it appears to be well made.

If you are buying this for the BSH, get the Medium size!",5.0
It was very hard to find a boys bible cover that fit my sons bible as it was either too big or too small. Odd sized bible I guess. This was perfect.,5.0
My son picked this out and I wouldn't be concerned about it travelling with him.  Very strong durable canvas cordura type material. No interior pockets.  Just pockets to slip in the front and back cover of bible with a pen holder.  My son puts in the back cover and leaves the front free so he can see his name and scripture he picked out on the front of his bible.  This leaves the slip pocket free for a notebook.  Very happy.,5.0
Worked perfectly for my Son's scouting manual that he must take with him to all scouting activities.  It works best with the three-ring binder version of the scouting book but I am using for the regular bound book and it's great.  Holds all his essentials nicely.,5.0
Fits the Boy Scout Handbook with ease inside with LOTS of room to spare.  My son has 2 individual merit badge books and the spiral bound merit badge master book in the front pouch.  Comments from everyone on what a great setup it is.,5.0
"I love this cover.  I keep my Bible in it which is bout 8 1/2 by 5 1/2 inches in it and it fits perfect.  The zipper zips smooth and the pockets are very handy as well.  The top pocket that has the compass on it spans the whole front cover.  As for the compass, though will point N. with a flick or two, I wouldn't rely on as my sole tool for geographic direction.",5.0
"Read a review that a medium size would fit a scout book.  It was true, a shade big, but my son is very happy with it.",5.0
"I got one of these for my son's boyscout handbook, and he loves it. I carries the book, as well as many other useful items and protects them. Shortly after he got his, I ordered 3 more, one for myself, another scout, and one for my mother for her tablet. She liked the fact that she could keep a couple stylus and the charger in the extra pockets and still have room for other items. Over all, a useful case that was built to handle whatever my 10 year old can throw at it.",5.0
"I bought a used study bible on ebay and got a great deal. I went searching for a decent cover for a reasonable price. I don't know how much a new one costs, but the used one works just fine. For what I paid for, I am very, very happy.

I took off the compass... well, because I don't need a compass on my bible cover. I love the pockets and the mesh compartment. The mesh compartment is especially useful for putting a pen and highlighter. Easy access. The larger pocket is perfect for a smaller notebook.

It's a great product. Please make sure you measure your bible or book and compare it to the measurement provided.",5.0
"This Bible cover is just right for a young (or older) man's Bible. It has pockets for what a boy needs to store, and the measurements were so accurate that it fit the Bible perfectly.",5.0
"This was a Christmas gift for a new Boy Scout and he loves it.  Has plenty room for manual, note pad and pencils.  The compass was a hit, too.",5.0
I bought this for my son to use with his Boy Scout book (with the spiral binding) and it fit perfectly! He loves the carry handle and the two little outside pockets. The flap on the outside provides an additional place for papers and notes. Very cool!,5.0
This bag fits my needs.  It has enough room inside for other literature as well as notepad and other small books.,5.0
"This is the perfect cover/organizer for my big, chunky, hardcover Bible. Now it's more attractive, easier to carry, and I have room for paper, pen, and more! No more juggling my Bible or losing papers out of it!

I'd recommend this to anyone. It's attractive, sturdy, and exactly what I'd hoped for.",5.0
"This is very roomy and durable so far. It has great function for everything you need to carry.  I can't say I have any complaints. It's bigger than I thought it would be, but definitely you get what you pay for. I was considering giving it as a gift, but I just couldn't give up. Just be sure to do the measurements so you know the size. I love the removable bible cover inside, that's very convenient and the strap inside is a little difficult, but it's not enough for me to give a bad review. I would highly recommend this product.",5.0
"Our Daughter is a volunteer minister, so we got this bag to hold her Bible (bookcover included) and Bible based literature. It also holds a pen, highlighter and a notepad - all of which are included. The ""leather"" on the bag seems easy to keep clean, but the light pink could show soil marks, easily. It is canvas. The handles seem sturdy. This bag has been used for a couple of weeks of daily use without problem. The zipper pulls have attached metal crosses, but other than that there are no emblems, idols, symbols or brands visible.",5.0
"It looks great, is the perfect size, and is sturdy without looking or feeling big and klunky. It comes with a highlighter which was a nice surprise, along with room for some accessories such as one of my devotional books. The internal sleeve holds my large print bible with no trouble. This is a great product and feels as if it will last for years.",5.0
"Oh, I love this case!!  I am involved in a couple of Bible studies and now I can carry all of my study materials in one bag!  It is handy when I stumble in the kitchen first thing in the morning to do my studies to have it already together!  There is a separate bible cover that is removable (for the times you only need a Bible).  It was a little big for my bible, but my bible is tiny and I easily resewed it.  There is also a removable should strap.  It comes with a pad of paper for notes and a yellow highlighter.  Love this cover.  Love it!  I have gotten so many compliments I am now looking to buy another for a friend who has been coveting it since she first saw it!  It definitely meets my needs.  It is more money than I would have normally spent, but I'm so glad I did!",5.0
Works all right for what I need!!,5.0
Just what I needed.  Thanks!,5.0
"I really like it, my bible fits in the small pocket which is convenient for me and I can fit two small note books and my pens, I had compliments because it's cute",5.0

"Excellent case.  Im able to fit my large bible, bible study workbook, pens, notebook, glasses etc all within the stylish bag.  Best part, the Bible can come out from the Velcro tabs so you don't have to hold whole case while reading.  Lovely !  No more excuses for not having your bible with you, stylish and practiced all in one.",5.0

Great bag to hold my Bible and Bible studying tools. It is really spacious and I like how I could hold it like a messenger bag.,5.0
"I love, love this Bible case. Its so spacious. I have a thick large print Bible plus thick notebooks, still room for more stuff.  The detachable interior Bible case is large, strong, sturdy and snaps shut to hold Bible firmly in place. Lots of pockets ,even came with ink pen, yellow highlighter ,and lined note paper. Ohhhh yeah, it has a attachable shoulder strap . Im going to order another one , makes a perfect gift.

Love this!!!  holds my big study bible perfectly along with my teaching guides.  very stylish too.,5.0
"Three generous, sized slots for my Bible study materials. Pens, highlighters slots, includes a pen and highlighter that work! The Bible case doesn't take over your Bible, just a light and simple cover that snaps right in. If I didn't know better I would think my Bible study partners created this. If you're on the fence, just buy it you won't be sorry.",5.0
Love love it's the perfect size and perfect amount of space and pockets,5.0
"I love this Bible organizer and bought one for a gift, I actually paid to have it gift wrapped.  I would not recommend anyone to pay for gift wrapping, it came in a very oversize blue bag that was dusty, mine you I purchased this gift the end of July the gift tag on the present had snow flakes on it.  I ended up wrapping it myself and redoing the gift card.  Really snow flakes in July!!! Very disappointed in the gift wrap will never pay for it again.",5.0
I love this bible study organizer. It is stylish and the right size. If you have a lot of materials you take to church or bible study this may not be the organizer for you but if you are a minimalist then this is perfect.,5.0
"Of good quality, has numerous compartments and has enough space and is pretty enough to use as a purse",5.0
and she loves having her all of her Sunday school items in one place - I love the elimination of last minute searching!,5.0
"This is perfect for my bible.  It was hard to find a cover that fit my Zondervan NIV study bible because it is so thick but the cover that is included in this case works great.  This case is big enough for me to add a composition notebook for notes, plus loops for pens, highlighters and such.  I love this and am glad that I purchased this.  I do wish there were more colors to choose from though!",5.0
Beautiful bible organizer. It is like a purse. There is a separate bible cover inside this bag that you attach to your bible. It fit by bible perfectly.  Then you can use the straps to secure the bible in the purse/organizer. There are filing pockets and plenty of space for my stuff.,5.0
"Really nice. I bought this organizer for my ""The Word"" Bible. There is a bible cover on the inside that is detachable so you can to take the bible out to use it. There are 3 large pockets for storage, 3 holders for pens and highlighter (1 of each included) and a sleeve that fits my Samsung 7.9"" tablet (nice). FYI - it is quite large when opened up so it is not convenient to take to church but still a great organizer.",5.0
Light weight and easy to carry. Love the pockets and it fits my large bible perfectly.,5.0
"Got it for my mom's birthday, and she loves it. Its very practical and esaly fits her Bibble and a few other books.",5.0

"I have a VERY LARGE STUDY BIBLE and i was worried it wouldn't fit but it was perfect! So much better than I expected! It's Sturdy. Has some sort of card board or light weight plastic  inner case that makes it extra Sturdy.
the Velcro loops that hold in the bible with attached case is strong. Even came with a pen and pad",5.0
Really like this organizer for my bible studies. Would like to see other colors offered.  Great large pockets for all my needs.,5.0
Such a treat to be able to fit everything from the bible to my notebook and papers from classes in this organizer.  Extremely durable and with the shoulder strap it makes it easy to carry.,5.0
"I absolutely love this organizer! I've never had one before & figured I wanted to buy newer bible study items, now that I'm getting back on track with my relationship with the Lord. This organizer comes with a lot more than I thought it would! It comes with pockets to hold your Bible, a note pad, a pen, a highlighter, & a strap if you want to wear it on your shoulder. I was expecting the bag to be bigger, but it's not & I'm glad! You can even carry it like a regular purse!

I highly recommend!",5.0
"Big and roomy for , pen, highlighter, tithe, notes etc.",5.0
"Great Bible cover and carrier. I love the shoulder strap. I use it to carry like a messenger bag.  The bag is almost too big for me, but I'm sure I will end up filling it up. It comes with a note pad, highlighter, pen, and Bible cover. It also has three pouches to file papers. The bag is very roomy. I'm able to add another book to it if need be. In all I am happy with my purchase.",5.0
I had to return it due to personal reason but it is a beautiful and unique and for the use of it was meant to be for the bible and other uses.,5.0
"This is the perfect organizer for my large Bible.  It securely holds my Bible closed in the snap-in cover inside so there is no danger of pages getting folded or torn.  (It's actually designed as a cover, so you could use your Bible in it, but I just drop mine in and snap it closed.)  It has three pockets inside that will hold full 8 1/2 x 11 pads of paper.  It's nice and roomy so I can put my Sunday School book and notes in it without feeling that everything is crowded.  It even accommodates my iPad, but that makes it rather heavy.  There is a highlighter and pen included with another loop for a pencil/pen.  I'm using the small pocket on the outside to hold post-it notes, place markers, and extra leads for my multi-lead pencil. It holds a lot more than I though it would.  I love it!  It's nice to have most of my Bible study aids in one place.",5.0
"I love it!  Very handy and keeps everything organized. I love how it comes with the notepad,  ink pen,  n highlighter as well as how it has the three side file slots.  It also had its very own extra Bible cover that velcro's inside the purse too pull out when you're ready to use it!  It's definitely a must have for everyone!",5.0
"This Bible Study organizer carries ALL my stuff and lots of room, it looks just like a real purse. It even has slats for my loose paper, yellow highlighter that does NOT bleed thru my Bible when I high light scripture, TWO pen holders",5.0
This bag is great! It has a separate cover for my bible that velcros into the bag. It came with a pad of paper that slips right into one of the pockets and has a holder for a pen. The pockets in this bag are perfect too. I can fit my kindle in it that has my bible study. Plus the pockets are big enough to hold a notebook that I take notes in! I love this bag!,5.0
"Love it. Holds all of my bible books , and paper work for class. It comes with a pen and a note pad . It's all set up yo go",5.0
"Fits all my stuff with room for more. I love the fact that it comes with a shoulder strap which allows me to keep my hands free when  I need them. It is not as purple as shown in pic, it is more of a softer pink color which I love and I just could not be happier.",5.0
I love this bible study case! It has lots of room  to store things and can hold a larger bible. I am going to order another one for my mom because she loves mine so much. It's a great buy for the price!,5.0
"Organization, organization, organization!!  I absolutely love this bible bag!! Keeps all my study materials together and I know where they are.",5.0
I love the organizer - room for every thing but not too bulky.  I usually have my hands full so I really like the handy shoulder strap.,5.0
and she loves having her all of her Sunday school items in one place - I love the elimination of last minute searching!,5.0
"Arrived on time. Very very nice. I got the pink with brown trim. Workmanship appears well done, fabric is high quality. I like the extra shoulder strap. Lots of room! Highly recommend if you are in need of a good sized Bible organizer.",5.0
"This case is great! It has a bible cover separate from the case itself that you can take out in church and hold to keep your Bible in your hands firmly without worry about in papers falling out and the case has 3 separators so you can put different items in each one.  One for Sunday school lessons, another for bible study and another for what ever else you hold for church.",5.0
The case has enough room to add your iPad. The notepad and pen included were a nice touch. The color is uplifting.,5.0
"I received this as a Christmas gift. It fits my Zondervan NIV study bible perfectly! I was worried because the dimensions were just a tad bit off, but no worries, PERFECT fit! I so glad I decided to put it on my list. The pockets are great for the weekly bible studies, devos, and handouts. I have my pen and pencil nice and handy! I love that I can easily detach the bible from the case to hold without having to take the cover off. It is easy to take in and put back. I highly recommend it. I am thrilled and so glad I went with my gut to give it a try!!",5.0
"This organizer is so perfect for me.  Not only can I carry my Bible in it, but it holds everything (folders, notebook, small book) that I need for my Bible study, and can hold my Awanas teacher's binder too.  I have received several compliments on it, and I highly recommend it.",5.0
"The photograph shows a pale olive green. I bought mine at a local store and the color is darker ( a rich medium olive). I prefer the darker look. I suspect that the flash may have washed out the picture posted here.
I love this cover. It is perfect for my needs. I carry a book light with my bible and there is a front pouch in this cover that it fits in perfectly (the flap at the top of the photo shows the entry to the pouch). The exterior feels like synthetic water resistant canvas - a nice weight. The interior is slick black nylon fabric like luggage liner. Visible black zipper. I feel that the cover is strong and I carry it by the handle.  Pen holders on the left and right interiors. I don't know if I will leave the compass attached - right now I find it rather amusing as it kind of captures the way I feel about my bible - first aid/marching orders/survival kit with a compass, for my heart.",5.0
Super cool and perfect  for quest study bible,5.0
"It fit perfectly, I gave the compass to a young man who had never had one.",5.0
"This item is great!!! I have my Boy Scout Spiral Edition Hand Book, my BSA Spiral Field Book, my 2016 BSA Requirements Book, and the BSA Guide to Safe Scouting all inside plus several pens and markers and note pad in the outer pocket's.",5.0

Ordered for my grandson. He loves it. Excellent product.,5.0
"I got several of these for the Sunday School kids (ages 6-9) at our church to keep their new Bibles and marking sets in. They absolutely love them. We had someone embroider their names on the backs of them so they can tell them apart. These were a great find as they fit the rather oddly sized Bibles that came with our Sunday School Curriculum (about 9x7x2 inches). My brother also has had one in a smaller size and it has lasted him for over ten years, through Bible Camp, confirmation, and many other activities. The compasses seemed to work ok, but were not one of the main reasons we bought the covers.",5.0
"As a Army veteran and a Christian this is the perfect Bible cover for me. It works exactly is it that was designed to, all the pockets and netting work and seem to be sewn on well same with the zipper. It fits my MacArthur Study Bible a little bit snuggly but works all the same. Very good product in my opinion. God bless.",5.0
Grandson loves it,5.0
great. fits perfectly,5.0
"This bible carrying bag is most certainly well made. Its canvas material, plastic zipper, and brushed metal hardware ensure longevity and durability. I purchased this for my Zondervan auth. KJV bible, and it's dimensions are: 5.8"" x 0.9"" x 8.7"". It's a bit roomy but for the most part this bag fit well. The bag even had room to contain my NWT bible!

The said NWT has the dimensions of  4.8"" x 1.4"" x 6.8"". The compass on my bag worked as it should, bare in mind that the compass must lay flat to freely spin. And that is a nice addition to a great product.",5.0
"Perfect for preparing to send my son to the Army, it's perfectly fitting for him!",5.0
Ordered for my husband and he loves it!,5.0
I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  It was a little bigger than I thought it would be but it works just fine and it seems that it will protect his bible very well.,5.0
I bought this for my son's boy scout hand book works great he loves it.,5.0
Love it!,5.0
I love this! Better than I expected! Great price too.,5.0
I recently bought a New Inductive Study Bible (ESV). The dimensions made it hard until I found this cover. It arrived today. The quality is top notch and the measurements are exactly as described. It is an XL case. I read a review that complains about the dimensions being different. It could be they received a medium and not an XL. I love it and will do business with these folks again.,5.0
"Great case, but did not care for the little pockets--I mean what exactly would you use them for?",5.0
my grandson loved it,5.0
My son loves it,5.0
My 10 year old daughter requested this Bible cover because it came with a compass. She loves this case! It has a ton of little pockets for all her little doo-dads. The material is very sturdy. This is a very good quality case.,5.0
"awesome, alot of room for my properties. Looks fashionable and easy to carry.",5.0
Great cover.  Sturdy.  Works awesome.,5.0
"Good quality! Purchased for our son who joined the Army and started going to church. Rugged construction, just as he needs.",5.0
"Overall very nice bible case. Sturdy enough construction and the hardware appears to be strong as well. The compass is junk, just toss that aside. Plenty of room for my large Bible, some notes or pamphlets in the secondary pouch, and challenge coins in the little pockets.",5.0
I bought it as a gift. She really loved it.,5.0
"I was very pleased with this bible cover. It's well built and sturdy. It seems to be water-resistant but not water-proof. I'm not sure why there's a compass on it, I think it may be to make it look more ""outdoorsy"". I took the compass off but have it in a small bag I use when I go camping. All in all I'd recommend this item to any of my friends.",5.0
"Made from light weight very durable material with a unique color.  Position of zipper could be better to allow one to open the Bible further while studying.  The zipper will if one does not watch it, fray the Bible cover.",5.0
He really loves the bible cover and that it comes with the compass. What a wonderful present for a young man.,5.0
I enjoyed using this bible bag. It serves its purpose and it's practical. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a bible carrier.,5.0
"Cover exactly what I needed.  My boy scout needed a cover for his handbook.  More than enough room for his book, papers, pen and extra stuff.  Love the mesh pocket on the front!",5.0
"Good, sturdy Bible bag with helpful pockets.  I love the mesh pencil pocket so you can easily tell if you have pen with you.  The notebook pocket on the outside (hard to see- it is the same length and width of the bag, but only .5 inch deep) is helpful for paperwork.  It fits an Awana Sparks handbook.  The main interior section about 2 in. deep.  The size is generous.  I tested my husband's large hardcover MacArthur Study Bible inside - it fits well. The compass/carabiner is good quality and has stood up to roughhousing, etc. from my son.  Overall, it is a quality bag and perfect for any boy's Bible.",5.0
It's perfection. I was looking for a cover for my new bible and couldn't find the perfect one until I came across this one. Love it.,5.0
"I ordered this to cover a KJV Thompson soft cover bible. It is exactly what I was hoping for. As other reviews state, the COMPASS DOES NOT WORK, but I was not looking for a functional compass to carry around with my bible anyway. I may leave it attached as the nonfunctional accessory I believe it was intended to be. The picture is washed out some. The color is a bit darker than the pic, but that just means it won't show wear as easily. I am extremely pleased with the design and the quality. The pockets are perfect for my mini post notes and sticky tabs. The extra pocket at the top will be perfect for bulletins or my non-interleaved catechism book. There is nothing I do not love about this case. I am thrilled with this product. If you have a standard ""pew sized"" bible, This case will be a bit big. Though you may be able to use the extra room to carry any extras you may want for your studies.",5.0
I really like this bible cover it protects my bible and it has lots of pockets for storageand a compas for an added bonus,5.0
I purchased this for my daughter and she loves it.  It's a rich olive green color.  The material is durable.  My daughter loves it because its not the typical bible cover.,5.0
"So far looks great its a gift for my son, hope the plastic zipper holds up. But over all looks nice I think he will love the compass and little pockets.",5.0
This is a cover for my teenage son and it is cool.  It is durable and attractive cover and he doesn't mind bringing it to youth group.,5.0
"Terrific cover for other types of books as well. Bought this for my son's Boy Scout handbook and then had the velcro flap embroidered with his name. The fact that it fulls zips is the best selling point ever. We put post-it notes in the two small pockets and so far the elastic at the top of the pen holder is firm enough to keep the pens from sliding out. Really wish BSA would talk to this manufacturer.

The one thing is that I probably could have been fine getting the L size. There's a lot of movement inside because the BSA handbook is not as big as a Bible, but the zipper saves the day.",5.0
"I really enjoy this Bible cover.  The cover fits snugly over my Complete Jewish Bible and holds better than my previous Bible cover.  I like the military-looking cover without being the common camouflage style.  This Bible cover also has a lot of pockets where I can store my pens, mints, and note paper.  The added key ring also is good for me to attach any important keys (for keeping track).",5.0
"I bought this book cover for my son's Boy Scout Handbook. It's plenty big enough and even holds some extra drawing paper and vellum for leaf rubbings. Durable ripstop nylon and the color is the perfect olive drab. The compass seems to be durable as well.
I would recommend this cover to other Boy Scouts looking to protect their handbook and manage a few extra writing accessories.",5.0
"I bought this cover to go on the spiral bound Boy Scouts of America handbook, but it was way too big for that purpose. However, it is a really cool looking cover. I sent it back and got the medium size which is a better fit, though still not perfect.",5.0
"So far this cover seems to be quite sturdy. My son loves it, but he was disappointed that the compass on his didn't work. This was not a big problem, though, as we purchased him another compass and he was happy. The zipper is big and strong, and the front pocket is the perfect size for his AWANA handbook and a small notebook.",5.0
Love this bible cover.  Bought it for my 8 year old son and he loves it.  Loves the color and the compass on it.,5.0
"I purchased this bag for my son to carry his Bible in.  He loves it and says his friends all think it awesome too.  It fits his Bible and still has plenty of space for extra papers, pencils, etc.  The compass is an added bonus.  He has the NIrV Adventure Bible for early readers which measures 8.75"" X 5.75"" X 1.75""",5.0
The pocket in the front is the same size as the bible and is perfect for a small notebook for bible study notes and can stash pens and sticky tabs in it too.  Fits the Zondervan Study Bible perfectly.,5.0
Got this for a family member going into the military.  This one was nicely put together and the person I gave it to liked it. It held the Bible well. I'd buy one again.,5.0
"Bought for son to use at church. The color appears lighter in the picture. It is actually a dark camo green. Son likes it and loves the little compass but hasn't needed the compass, just for looks imho. Sturdy cover that will for sure last him many, many years.",5.0
"I got this for my adult son. It seems real sturdy and all the pocket spaces are great for pens, small tablet & misc. I bought this along with the Personal size Life Application Study Bible NIV. According to the dimensions of both I thought the case would have had a bit extra room with the Bible in it...it has ALOT of extra room.  The case is much to big for that size of Bible but he has plenty of room for booklets or study guides along with his Bible and it's great for toting it all around.  I don't know how the fit would be with other size Bibles, but it is a nice and sturdy Bible case.",5.0
My own fault for not paying attention to the dimension but the zipper is first rate. The compass is inspiring and I love it for my bible! I can fit my pens in there and my kiddos check in cards for church so I don't even need to bring my purse in from the car.,5.0
"These Bible Book Covers make great covers for Boy Scout Handbooks.

The Medium in particular has several extra pockets on the front for scouting doodads.

My son uses the Medium - perfect size for even the ring bound version of the handbook (highly recommend the ring bound over the perfect bound for handbooks - spend the extra dollar or two) - and far preferable (to us) to the velcro closure BSA one (that doesn't have room for much else either).

My son thought, from pictures, that the handle was sissy (you know, purse), but he wouldn't have it without it now (it's a book pack right?)

These are also thicker so there's room - and a left side flap - for a notepad as well as every Scout should have.

These do come in sizes, and Amazon has all three, though from confusing inconsistent entries. So do get the Medium for the Boy Scout Handbook. I bought to try the XL before finding the other sizes. It's pretty big - but I'm a Scout Master - and have already stuffed it with the extra handbooks and field books a leader may use. Recommendation in general for Scouts - Medium.

I was looking for a bible cover for my NIV Archaeological Study Bible and came across this one which happened to be 50% at The Family Christian Store!  From first glance I liked the Leather look and after closer inspection had a feeling that this cover would be a good fit with my bible and I was correct!  Not only was it a good fit but is very well stitched!  I found the zipper on this cover to be very smooth unlike covers I have had in the past and am very pleased with my choice.  I should have picked up a couple of more while I was at the store but they went quickly!  Highly recommended!  Very stylish looking and protects your bible very well!,5.0

The attached label states that it fits the following: Zondervan NIV Study Bible, Large Print; NIV Quest Study Bible, Large Print, and NIV Life Application Study Bible.

"The map was in very bad shape. We would have returned it, but we didn't have time to get another one. It would have been great if it had been packaged better.",1.0

"I bought this map for my classroom. Something that is not clear from the photo is the dismal, dark, dead-foliage coloring. It is much darker in person than it appears on Amazon, and has a black border.

Why all the states are shown as dark olive, purple, dull burnt orange, or brown beats me. Unless your nose is close to the map, you cannot read the names (in black) of most of the states. You can't even easily distinguish the borders of the states! Moreover, the map shows EVERY interstate highway, which makes it hugely busy and adds to the difficulty in reading it.

I am returning this map. I'm sure I can find something better for my 8th grade classroom.",1.0

"I am a busy Mom of 4 children.  I really thought this binder/organizer was going to be great, but I am left very disappointed, and wishing I could get my money back.  I like the idea of it, but the execution is all wrong.  There are pocket folders in each section.  Sounds fantastic, but the pocket folders are the same exact size as a piece of paper...but then 3 hole punched to fit it in the binder.  Basically, you cannot easily fit a piece of paper in the folders because it isn't large enough.  Second, there is a LOT of useless information in here.  The organizer is big, bulky and the pages are very hard to turn.  I like the size of the calendar, but the website link for refill paper does not work.  I took the calendar portion out of it and put it in a smaller binder.  Save your money.  I only gave it 1 star because I couldn't give it 0 stars, so I guess the 1 star is because it's pretty.",1.0
This planner is way too large and they need to rework the weekly planning part of it. I returned it.,1.0

I purchased the binder/planner set for around $50 for both.  For THAT price, I would have expected AMERICAN made products.

The paper is mediocre at best - I am sincerely worried that it won't have the strength and endurance for carrying around that a planner is made to do.  Spiral bound, yes, but reinforced? Certainly not.

"I should think that something as general and seemingly non-biased as a *daily planner* would be without religious influence, or be described as such in the item description. I suppose I should have read the other 5 star reviews more thoroughly. Almost every aspect of this planner is faith oriented, to put it mildly...from daily bible verses to weekly catechisms. It even goes so far (in one of its periodic articles) as to describe the secular culture as being an enemy. This mindset is not startling, but the fact that it is in a *planner* certainly is. Is it assumed that every homeschooling family is fundamentally Christian? Well, we're not. It's too bad this planner is so heavily inundated with god and his army, as it actually does have some nice points. Hesitant to purchase any others online.",1.0
"The photos on this calendar are nice, but the print on each line is very small. So small that I couldn't give it as a gift and had to keep it even though I already have one. I do not recommend unless the publishers increases the size. The pages may need to be larger to fit larger print.",1.0
"If you want to learn how to draw Zentangles, this book is not for you!
It states to deliver ""How to create Zentangle art"" but beware, you will find very little information on how to. It does not contain any basic Zentangle patterns and relatively few ""pure"" Zentangle images for a book about Zentangles. The Zentangle images shown are examples of elaborate art works, somthing you can aspire to, but this book won't get you there, and you might not like 'ornate' as much as the authors.

While giving very limited advice on practical ""how to"", the book might appeal to you if you are intersted in the spiritual side of ""zentangling"" (breathe, slow down, feel gratitude and appreciation...). I was hoping the book would provide the real 'how to' & Zentangle patterns, but was very dissapointed.

She examined my eyes,concluded I had a raging infection (already knew that!) and as I was about to leave the office. I just happened to mention that I had  used a eyelash growth product on the tuesday night before bed and by 8pm wednesday night my eye infection started. I live in a small town and the Dr.s office is in the same town, I say that cause it is not like a chain or a large practice that sees hundreds of pts. She stopped writing my new prescription and said that I was the 3rd patient to come in with an eye infection after using (other brand not known) an eye lash growth serum. I said the tube was sealed and looked new, she said that it is possible that these products are not made in a sterile environment and that could transmit bacteria to cause an infection. I am not saying that this product absolutely caused my infection, but to be the 3rd person in the small practice that just happened to have this happen must be suspected there may be a problem. The product says MADE IN USA but confusingly there is in small print THE UKRAINE???",1.0

"It's false product description. It's not organic, should be returned, because i don't trust them.",1.0
"When purchasing this item I was super happy that in the description it said  'organic and natural'. Today I received my serum but doesn't say natural or organic on the product!!! So I'm super skeptical to put it on my eyes. So I wanted to give the product the benefit of the doubt so I did a Google search to see what comes up.....NOTHING.... I hate the fact that I purchased an item and it said something on the description but not on the product .When it comes to your eyes you got to make sure it is safe for your eyes..
Unfortunately my review is not on the product itself but on the false description",1.0
very nice.,1.0
The pump is jammed. Everytime I tried to pump it would leak the Jojoba oil all over from the bottle opening and the spout. It smells horrible. Rancid. Jojoba oil has no scent. I'm returning,1.0
love this password book - lots of space to write in - has good clean lines and is just a nice addition to my computer desk,1.0
Cards were stuck together and fit very tight in the envelope making it very hard to stuff.  Made in China.,1.0
The cards are nice but the ENVELOPES are way TOO TIGHT.  Yes! They are RIDICULOUSLY SMALL. There's no saving when you have to buy other envelopes. Try to force the card in and you risk wrinkling it. Done without common sense. It's like you're wearing a beautiful dress and it is so tight you can't even breathe. An envelope must have enough room for a card to slide in without force. This company is saving money at the consumers' expense. Don't buy this item! CHEAP! CHEAP! CHEAP!. Waste of money.,1.0
It was smaller than expected but it is good quality but if it was much larger I would have kept it.,1.0
Worst quality of leather.,1.0

I don't like it. Hope to return it.,1.0
Many limitations and cheaply made. Structure of each page limits notes and weeks are only 5 days.,1.0
"I returned the first set because the pencils were shattered and couldn't be sharpened without the leads falling out. Received my second set today and they were even worse. I sharpened one pencil and the casing cracked all the way up the pencil. Shame because the colors are pretty, and the book is nice.",1.0
This is a hoax,1.0
The journal is well designed and as shown but my copy was dented in the corner and several other locations. For a $40 journal you'd expect the condition to be better when you're buying new.,1.0
"I find it very hard to believe any of these 5 star comments regarding this Freedom Journal.

Here's what you get...

The journal consists of ONLY TWO PAGES, that being day and night.
Generic questions that you could find on any website.
Lot's of blank spaces to write answers to the generic questions.
Repeat for 99 days.

Summary: You could make 99 copies and save yourself the money.

It's not worth the money. Way overhyped.

Do not waste your time or money as you'll be retuning it just as fast as I did.",1.0

Received today and the latch was glued shut. I tried peeling it open and it ended up ripping off the leather. Confused why the latch would be glued shut.,1.0

"$11.95 for a password keeper- expensive but had a leather-type cover & looked good!
Opened it up to the 'A's"" & put in my password info......turned the page to the next section & all of the pages fell out!!!!!
Also found a small metal piece in the binding that was loose & would have choked a small child or dog.
I want my $ back

"I can't necessarily blame the manufacturer for this, but sturdier packaging could have prevented damage. It is just as well, I didn't realize it didn't come with alphabetized tabs, which is a must. It was a nice size for a purse, though, if tabs are not essential to you.",1.0
"I ordered the Italian set. There is a card for Perdere (meaning ""lose""). On the back of the card it says ""loose"" instead of ""lose"".

Honestly, everything else is great but if you can't spell one of the most basic words in the language you're translating FROM and it doesn't get caught by anyone reviewing the product through the company selling it then it calls into question the integrity of the product itself.

Great idea. Excellent packaging. Hopefully they review their products going forward.",1.0
Looks nice - zipper only lasted a couple of days. Cheaply made.,1.0

I work for a school and we use projectors extensively in the classroom. I thought we could save some money by ordering these lamps instead of OEM lamps to replace in our projectors when the time came to replace the lamps. So I ordered 10 of these lamps. NONE of the ones we opened have worked. The quality of the picture is TERRIBLE.  The picture is very DIM even when the lights are turned off in the classroom. I cannot return the 5 remaining unopened ones because the window to return them has closed. CAVEAT EMPTOR!,1.0

These little books tear up in my purse.,1.0
"These are worthless! The print is too small, the quality is bad!",1.0
They're cute but I got a pack that was missing one of the designs/had a duplicate.,1.0
They are very small,1.0
"Too small for what I needed, returned",1.0
These are really small and thin. Looks much better in the photo. Definitely not worth the price. Better of going to the Dollar Tree and finding cuter journals. I only purchased these because I have several small boxes that I would need them to fit in but I doubt these will be used by the people I am giving it to.,1.0
"Really cute.  And smelly.  For some unknown reason the pages smell strongly of mentholaedom or eucalyptus or something along those lines.  Not sure why.  Slight mildew smell underneath, perhaps to cover that up?  I ordered for a class, no time to return.  Will have to use.  Not happy.",1.0
"Too small, too stiff, little room for entries.  Theater spiral bound pages hang up upon opening and closing.",1.0
terrible quality,1.0
Cheap product.  Several didn't write.  None really had an identifiable smell.  Would not buy again.,1.0
These are some of the worst pens I've ever bought. call me weird I love pens and I buy a lot of them and these were horrible. The ink constantly skipped and there is nothing worse than a gel pen that skips.  There was no scent so I imagine I got a decade old set lol!! They look so cute which is why I initially wanted them yup I'm cheesy!!,1.0
"Okay, these are bad for most things, but keeping your game card secret in a game of Clue isn't one of them.  The ink is hard to see, watery, and worst of all, has no scent.",1.0
"Only two or three smelled and they didn't have the yummiest scents.  Considering the primary reason I bought them was for the smell in order to help my son with his spelling. Scent can help with memory, so the scent was as important as the gel ink he enjoys using.",1.0
"It claimed to be scented gel pens, but only five of them have scents. The color doesn't come out well. It's a waste of money. Wish I can get a refund or return them.",1.0
Most of them didn't have any scent at all. I returned them. Maybe I got a bad batch or something.,1.0
Very streaky. It does not draw cleanly and the ink doesn't flow easily most of the time.,1.0
"We have the Ooly Scented Glitter Pens and as colors are running out, I went to order a replacement. These are the same brand and appeared to include 12 of the scented pens plus 6 neons and 6 pastels too so seemed like a good deal. Unfortunately the pens arrived and they are a mini size. I was still willing to keep them, but my daughter tried them and they just don't work well. Not nice and smooth color flow like our other pens. Returned them and ordered the 12 pack of Scented Pens, they arrived and work perfectly!",1.0
These don't write very well. They smell good but that's about it. I expected a better quality product.,1.0
They only have a scent for like a second ,1.0
The packaging was great and it was very nice however they did not smell very good. Some didn't even smell at all! Very dissapointed in this purchase.,1.0
"Some of the pens same the same, the only one that actually smells like a fruit is the grape and banana thats it the rest smells all the same",1.0
Doesn't even write or have a scent when it's called turtifrutti I expected it to have a scent.,1.0
Not good quality,1.0
Sad to say is I used the pens for maybe 2 hours and went through 1 and a half pens. And I wasn't writing paragraphs or anything. I was just grading papers. The colors are very bright and you can definitely smell them.,1.0
"These are junk, do not waste your money on these pens. They hardly write on any surface at all. I shouldnt have wasted my money!",1.0
"Although they smell pleasant, the ink does not roll out smoothly at all. Daughter was very disappointed in the performance.",1.0
I was not impressed. These are very watery and tend to streak and even ball up if not used quickly. The ink pools on the tip and stops up the rest of the ink. Next time I will purchase individual colors as there is a texture change especially between color changes,1.0
"I was expecting a pen that would write better and more consistently, but unfortunately they write muddy lines that tend to skip or stop writing altogether. The colors are also more faint than I expected. They are made cheap and leave ink all over the tip of the pen. For the price, I wouldn't recommend them. They seem more like a novelty that would be at a dollar store.",1.0
"Very upset!
First of all, the plastic bag that the pen box came in had a hole in it. As if someone tried to open it. Second, only one pen was actually inside the box. Third, the box was completely damaged! This was part of my daughter's birthday gifts and it's ruined.",1.0

ink skips and impossible to actually write with,1.0
"These pens suck. They smell awful, and the color changing feature is...well, stupid.
They skip frequently while writing and you have to use a lot of pressure. I purchased these as a gift for my wife and she hates them.",1.0
"These pens have very pretty colors and smell fantastic. However, they write poorly. They are scratchy against the paper and the ink skips leaving lots of holes in your writing.",1.0
"The Tutti Frutti Gel Pens that I received are sub-par.  They are not scented, the ink flow is horrid -- either skipping or flooding & they only work when held straight up/down.

Packaging was great.  Cute to look at.  Just not worth using and can be frustratingly messy.",1.0
These skip horribly. Can't write with them. Useless.,1.0
"I am sorry to say, but these pens are HORRIBLE!! I am a stationary junkie (LOL!!) & I LOVE cute pens. I REALLY wished that these worked but they did not. The color did not change as u wrote, (Like description says) some did not work @ all, & others worked, but then skipped.",1.0
"Not impressed. Ended up throwing them away. The ink doesn't show up well, and they didn't want to work.",1.0
These are the cutest pens that we gave away as part of a party favor goody bag. I used it for the first time recently and the ink was completely inconsistent and spotty. My daughter tried to use it to write her thank you's snd we had to give up. Bummed that I gave them away as part of a gift.,1.0
barely scented,1.0
These pens are super fun and have great color but they leak through paper like crazy! I had to take them away from my 6 year old daughter because she had smeared the ink everywhere!,1.0
"These were not what I expected.  I expected them to be like the rainbow pens I had as a teen.  Apparently, they don't make those anymore, and you will NOT find anything ""similar"" like I thought I was getting.  While these are rainbow colored, they write in one color for a long time before switching, rather than switching a bunch of times with every letter like I was looking for with the ""zebra"" pens.",1.0
