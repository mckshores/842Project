"Excellent for resistance exercises.  The handles have a soft covering, so they're comfortable to hold.  The resistance I got was a little too light for me, but I think that was my error in choosing the color.  Even so, it's a good workout.",5.0
"I really like the Black Mountain line of resistance bands, so much that I bought three of them! One for me and two for my wife, as she uses one for stretching only and the other for resistance training.

We both use the bands daily during our work-outs and have nothing but praise so far. The door anchor is very useful; it's great for working your chest muscles and triceps. I found it also especially good for pull downs and ""fly"" moves. Same goes for other body-stretching moves, as well as bicep curls.

Overall, a great product for a great price!",5.0
I have had the Black Mountain resistance band for a couple of days now and it has been giving me an intense work out. It can be used in more that just one way and it is a great and inexpensive way to stay in shape!,5.0
"Great resistance band, good quality, excellent price, highly recommend Black Mountain Products - A+++; have used several resistances bands in the past and this is one of the best, if not the best for price and quality.",5.0
works fine!,5.0
"Order arrived in pristine condition.  Received customary strong, sturdy Amazon box.  Within Amazon Box were 10 individual boxes, each containing one (1) resistance band, individual Exercise Program using the band and a door anchor (also to use with specific exercises with the Bands).  In other words - everything you need to get started and in guaranteed excellent condition in it's individual box.  I opened all my boxes this morning and, what can I say other than I am utterly delighted !!!  The products were shipped in perfect condition and please allow me to thank you for offering products of such exceptional quality.  The Fitness Center, which is one of the locations where I work as an Independent Contractor uses Spri products exclusively.  Although I have not had an opportunity to use the Resistance bands I just received from B.M.P., I can tell by observation that they are by far superior.  The handles alone are more than double the size of the Spri models.  The Spri models handles are hard plastic only.  Your padding and larger size will make them much more comfortable in the hands of not only all the members, but in particular the Senior population with whom I work.  Seniors often have grip issues, and I can tell already they will prefer the B.M.P. models. Also the quality of the band itself is superior to the Spri ones we use.  The rubber is higher quality and although they stretch to the capacity they should (given the different weight strengths), it's obvious these bands will not become ""overstretched"" as quickly as the Spris.

All in all - I'm very impressed !!!  I called BMP directly, with some other questions, and experienced TOP QUALITY Customer Service.  Thank you BMP and Amazon for a great product at a great value!

This is a fair and independent review and I DID NOT receive my Products as part of a Review process.  I paid the Amazon price for them.  Thank you",5.0
I purchased a red band sometime ago and I decided to purchase the purple band because the red one was such a good product and still has its elasticity like day one. The grips are pretty comfortable and the product comes with a door anchor great for all kinds of exercises. Overall great product and I recommend it. I am looking forward to purchasing the atomic band in the future.,5.0
I wish someone told me about this product long time ago. This thing really can substitute a gym membership. Thanks a lot!,5.0
I love Black Mountain Products!! They are very durable and well worth the money!!,5.0
Great exercise band.  Seems sturdy and well made.  Door anchor and user guide are great suppliments for this product!,5.0

So far so good. It seems to be really good quality and it's easyt o use. Just the right resistance for me.,5.0
Good quality product,5.0
"They stretch out and loose some of their strength with daily use over time but I still give them a top rating. For the money, I think it's a good buy.",5.0
Strong and well made exercise bands. My wife uses them and they show no sign of wear/tear.,5.0
"durable, good grips, and straightforward -- i left it out in the fire escape under a rainstorm and it weathered it perfectly! I usually lift 10lb weights so i went with this, but i think i'll go with a heavier resistance next time",5.0
"Dear Black Mountain Products,
I am very happy with this product.
I use the resistance bands as preparation for yoga, pilates, swimming and dance.
I also showed my yoga student how to use these resistance bands.
Thank you so much!

Diana Abdul",5.0
It is exactly what we use in my exercise class and reasonably priced.,5.0
Just as advertised.  Good quality.,5.0
"I can't afford a gym membership, so having a good resistance band is key! This one has been working great for me, so far.",5.0
I bought this green one and ended up buying the blue one too for less resistance.  You don't realize how tight 10 pounds can be until you try to do arms.  Make sure you check the color guide before purchasing!,5.0
"I am new to resistance bands. I have always used weights and medicine balls for strength training. I like the band because it is a different challenge to my stability and balance while providing resistance. I've had this band for a couple weeks and have been using it a couple days a week that I am not lifting weights. I haven't done any lower body exercises with it. But I work on my arms and shoulders most, back and chest some too. I can see how you could go light with it, but with enough reps I work up a good burn. One of my favorites is an ""uppercut"" motion while standing on the band. It seems to hit something weights can't quite duplicate. As to quality, this feels like a well-made product. The grips are comfortable. The length works well for the routine I'm on (I'm 6' tall). The ""catch"" that sticks in a door jam is the essential element for most of my exercises. You can put it under the bottom or middle hinge. Or you can put it over the top hinge. My door won't quite close with the catch lodged in there, but it doesn't swing open and unhook my band. You will need to find a place in your house/apartment where your door hinges provide you the space to extend the band for whatever exercise you're doing. Overall I'm really happy with this product. Also got a good price compared to what I've see at big box retailers for bands that seem similar.",5.0
"I mainly use this band, as well as a couple from the Black Mountain band set, for traveling. It's great being able to get a full body workout wherever you go! They go with me anywhere I go, whether that's here in the US or abroad.",5.0
"Work great.  Really help me in the morning when i am stretching.  Never used one of these before, but i am glad i bought it!",5.0
Good workout without strain.,5.0
"I love this product, so far it's stands up to all the activities I put it through.",5.0
I bought one of these for working out at home when I would be unable to go to a gym or was on a trip. The handles are quite comfortable and the rubber itself is well made so there is no issues with wear and tear and the included guide is quite helpful if you are unsure of what you want to do. Overall the bands themselves are well made and long enough to use comfortably. They are great for living in a small apartment with not a lot of space for the heavy exercise equipment so to be able to get a decent workout in on a busy day from home is a great thing and these get the job done. I do wish that I had more than one of the bands.,5.0
Excelent,5.0
I bought this resistance band to help me do the sit-up. It has a good quality and it is well-made. The handle is very soft and comfortable on hand. Love it and I will recommend to my friends.,5.0
Will Definitely buy again!!!!!,5.0
Great workout,5.0
"Half the price of the other brand I replaced it with, and the quality seems equal.  In fact, possibly better, as I like the padded handles.  Also, they come with an attachment for securing them in a door jamb.  I will look for this manufacturer the next time I need one.",5.0
This product did a lot more than I thought. All you need is yourself and a door.,5.0
Started using resistance band as soon as a received it in the mail. I choose the red band because of the strength is the heaviest. I must say this works great! I love the anchor for the door as well. You can feel the burn even more. The grips are easy to clean too after a work out. If you're looking for a good resistance band then I'd choose these guys. Plus they shipped out right away.,5.0
"great product
came quickly",5.0
"I'm doing some upper body rebuilding after an injury and thought I'd try the Black Mountain Bands. I find them a great alternative to free weights and something I can pack easily when traveling. The door anchor that is included can be used both in a door stop or you can slip a dowel through the loop to stand on or to use under a door for a different pulling angle. I have two bands now and intend to purchase more as my resistance needs grow. Also, you can actually double up the bands as the pull handles are padded enough to hold two in your hands (I wear medium sized gloves, so smaller hands might have trouble with this). Also Black Mountain makes a set with removable/swappable handles to make multiple-banding easier.",5.0
I can feel the gains already,5.0
got it for husband to use in the morning. Does what it's supposed to do.,5.0
good values for the cost nice bands,5.0
I love the convenience of being able to resistance train at home without having to purchase expensive weights. This band has been a great addition to my home workout routine. The quality is excellent and I love that the handles are cushioned so it is much more comfortable and I can use it longer than other resistance bands. Great purchase!,5.0
excellent quality and didn't broke until now ...,5.0
Well I have had this band for about a month and its as good as when I got it so yeah I will be ordering another if this one snaps.,5.0
Very happy- came as ordered. I haven't tried using to wall anchor yet but it looks very durable. Will update when used,5.0
"This resistance band is very nice , provides exactly what I need to get an extra burn in my workouts. Can be used for biceps , resistance running and all other exercise.

I chose the purple band , beats all other prices at retail stores and worth the price. It is very durable , it hasn't stretched out ... Yet.

I recommend this product.",5.0
"This is a fine quality resistance band and does its job well. The door jamb is especially thick, so if your door gap is unusually narrow you'll need to find a different door to use this with, but the tradeoff is a very secure feeling jamb. Band feels good stretched a few times its length. Simple.",5.0
Good quality product for a low price.  The only downside is that I was hoping for something I can travel with and the handles are a bit heavy. Up side is that the handles are comfortable and perfect for a home workout.,5.0
great workout with them,5.0
"This product is exactly what I was looking for.  It's great that it comes with several step-by-step exercises.  I've actually tried out some of them.  Since I recently joined a gym, it helps with my at home strength exercises.",5.0
"I had returned a Zon Resistance band and wrote a poor review of that product. This product however, was better, stronger and most important, hasn't broken.  I needed a strong band and purchased the purple. Wow, great resistance for me.",5.0
This product was as described! The door hook is very practical and useful. The yellow band seemed a little bit more tighter than what I have used in my fitness center but has been loosening up since then! The attached exercise book is equally helpful. Would recommend this product and the seller!,5.0
So far so good! Seems to be holding up well with daily use. And VERY comfortable grips! I love holding the grips lol. They feel so nice!,5.0
Great durable product that helps keep you in shape. I got this to keep my body strong after completing my physical therapy at the chiropractor. Also comes with workout guide.,5.0

"There are a whole lot of brands of resistance tubes available in the market; but, there are distinct differences in quality that exist & should be considered. My last 3 resistance tubes (bought from a local national sports store; & online vendors) snapped in only 4 months. I decided to try a reputable brand/company. Black Mountain Products came very highly reviewed; & I immediately observed differences in the quality of the rubber used. Black Mountain is thicker & has good rebound/spring. I also really appreciate their commitment to product support & customer satisfaction; they warranty their products for life & genuinely seem to value the customer. So far my experience with BMP has been extremely positive.
From now on when I'm comparing exercise products I'll look for Black Mountain.",5.0
My back is rippling with muscles in large part to this helping me during p90x & hammer & chisel type workouts.,5.0

"I just started using resistance bands and this blue one (4-6 pounds) seems perfect for me. I use it with Julian Michaels 90 day revolution,
Month 1, and love the band and the workouts.
Will move up to the black band next month as the resistance bands have weight associated with them.",5.0
Love it!,5.0
Great for when traveling or can't make it to the gym!,5.0
Great product. Works very well for pilates and it's fun to use instead of weights for some exercise. Im using it for the 21 day fix extreme workouts and it's just what I expected for a resistance band.,5.0
"I bought this to take on an upcoming cruise thinking it would be a good, easy to carry tool to take on the road and keep up on my workouts.  I used it at the office and home and LOVED it.  I'm getting another one for the office so I can just keep it there.  A real all around workout and high quality.",5.0

"Quality resistance bands from a company that back its product.  This band is high resistance.  I have had a set from Black Mountain already.  One band had the handle break.  With a simple phone call and email, they replaced it.  Good product with excellent service. Do not buy bands with any metal rings or attachments.  When the band finally breaks, you may not like the metal rings flying toward your face.",5.0
Great product for a great price! I have used this band for a few weeks and it's perfect for several different exercises. As a personal trainer I like to try out different products so I can tell my clients what to buy for a good home workout. These bands are a must!,5.0
excellent product and service,5.0
"I love it, using it for Golfer's elbow.",5.0
I got this for my girlfriend because she wanted to do resistance training but was bot comfortable with weights. So far she loves it. The bad provides adequate resistance with lots of flexibility for exercises that can be performed. Tested it myself and it actually feels like a 15lb band comparable to weights over the course of a full workout. They have been used for over a month now and so far they show no signs of damage and stretch quite far.,5.0
It works really well! I needed it as a modifier for some pull ups/chin ups and the door anchor helped. I'll probably buy it in a few more colors.,5.0
Works great to stretch out rotator cuff.,5.0
You can do so much with this resistance band! Such a awesome workout!,5.0

"Just what I was looking for!  Purchased as a replacement for a similar product (returned, due to disappointment with quality).  This resistance band is sturdy, with padded handles.  A great deal.  Highly recommend.",5.0
Love this. I use it to give me support when doing squats.,5.0
"I love this very much, i use to work out on one when i was in a vocation school but the more was a bit more thicker than this one. It really help shape muscles, become more defined and increased my flexibility.",5.0
These bands are of great quality.  I see them lasting a long time.  I would recommend.,5.0
Does the trick!  Stays put in door,5.0
"I bought this to get back into working out.  I was struggling to find time getting to the gym and I didn't see a point in investing in an elaborate work out machine or getting multiple weights to lift with.  After doing some research I decided to try this out.  First off, I like that it is light weight. I have taken this on one trip so far and it fit super easily in my luggage without any extra weight.  Second I liked how versatile this band is especially with the door weight.  So basically, the product comes with an attachable door anchor which allows you to be able to do a variety of work outs such as pec flies or rotator cuff exercises.  I found that the anchor was sturdy and I didn't have much trouble with it.  The band itself has seemed pretty sturdy along with the handles.  I've gotten some good use out of this band and have had no troubles with it.  I feel that I can get in a decent work out when I can't make it to the gym.",5.0
This will help you get some workouts in. Very durable and so many exercises you can do and will help you stay active if you're traveling and have no time to stop by a gym.,5.0
As advertised!,5.0
"I purchased the orange resistance band, and am satisfied with my purchase. I am a 19 year old male, about 5' 10"", 155 lbs. The orange resistance band is a great band for male starters, I believe. After a couple days using the band, however, I believe that I could have used a band one or two resistance weights higher. If you consider yourself a stronger male, I would go perhaps one weight above the orange band.

As for the band itself, it is very handy. It is portable, so you can take your workout anywhere. I have had no structural problems with the band, as it looks well made. The band comes with an instructional booklet, so you can test out different exercises. I love using the band, because you can get the same workout as a weight bench from just a single resistance band. The attachment for the door is also handy, allowing you to do pull downs, rows, presses, and even squats. After a couple weeks of use, the band shows no signs of wear, despite stretching it to full capacity.

Note: if you are looking for simple stretching for sports warm-ups, you may want to take a look at a lighter band.",5.0
The band serve it's purpose. The description of the tension was on point.,5.0
"I have no issues with this. It looks like the photo, does what they say it will do, and came with a booklet of ideas on how to use it. The door strap thing at first glance had me questioning how in the world that would work, but it did. I'm happy.",5.0
I really like this resistance band. It has enough pull to get a good workout anywhere! Quality is good!,5.0
"I have had their purple and black bands, and needed a little stronger band.  This is definitely a stronger band, my goodness, it looks like a water hose.  After one use, it will no doubt take time to build up the strength to use it on all exercises.  It seems to be built to hold up for a long time.",5.0
"This resistance band works great, I do wish I had gotten a higher weight.",5.0
"good quality, would purchase again",5.0
Great product,5.0
I love this resistance band. The Green Atomic band is truly a heavy one (70Ibs to 75Ibs). I get a good pump when doing band flies for my chest. For now I have to step on the band on the floor with my feet and use one arm bicep curls because it is truly a heavy band for me. One arm at a time. The Atomic one is really heavy.,5.0
Good resistance and the foam on the grips is excellent,5.0
Works great and hasn't fallen apart like other resistance bands.,5.0

"Black Mountain bands are usually great, I've had a set that's lasted a few years.  Got this one and the handle broke; contacted customer service on social media and they replaced it with no hassle!!  It's unreal to have that kind of service in today's phone tree world.

As for this specific band, it's the perfect weight and is well-made; the band won't break.",5.0
"I do a lot of traveling where I usually don't have access to a gym, and lugging around dumbbells just isn't very practical.  This product seemed like it might be the solution to my problem.  I'd never really heard much about resistance bands in the past and so I decided to give them a try, and now I don't know how I ever lived without them.  I throw them in my luggage wherever I go and I can continue to work my shoulders, biceps and back in my regular routine no matter where I happen to be.  The resistance feels just right, and they haven't shown any signs of wearing out even though I've put them through a lot of use now.

For anyone who moves around a lot, or if you just don't like the hassle of keeping dumbbells and other bulky equipment around at home, definitely try out the Black Mountain resistance bands.  They're great quality and really made me a believer in strength training through resistance equipment.",5.0
Love resistant bands and the amount of exercises you can do with them! High quality rubber band that has lasted several months of garage gym use with no fraying or signs of deteriorating . This band is high quality and the handles are very comfortable. Would recommend the Black Mountain Products and wouldn't have any issue going back and purchasing more!,5.0
"It's been 3 days since I've purchased this band and I am loving it. I've been doing all kinds of crazy workouts with this thing and I haven't had any problems with it.

"These Resistance Bands from Black Mountain Products (BMP) are AMAZING!!!  I purchased the 5-pack bundle a couple of years ago and they are still going Strong!  They have not broken, yet may be a little stretched from the past 2 years of use 2 times a week.  Over the past two years I have gotten stronger and therefore justifying my purchase of the 70-75lbs lime green resistance band from BMP.  I did not realize how Strong this resistance band was.  I quickly understood it was Strong when I unpacked it.  It is HUGE!  I placed a tape measure around it and it is 2.5 inches around.  It almost looks like a water hose.  It's GREAT!!  I hooked it up to the door using the door anchor that came with it, and tried to stretch it out and I could Not even get close to the Strength of this Lime Green Monster.  It is EXCITING having a resistance band that will CHALLENGE me and make me adapt my workouts to a resistance band that is EXTREMELY STRONG!  I look forward to the next few months as I STRUGGLE with this Lime Green Monster!  The cost is worthy of the product you receive.  You will Not be disappointed.  I highly recommend this Lime Green Monster from Black Mountain Products and Highly recommend Black Mountain Products resistance bands!  I think I am going to purchase the Purple Monster (45-50lbs) from BMP and add it with this one and rotate my workout between the two.  I can't imagine using two of the Lime Green resistance bands at one time!  One is bad enough!",5.0
Needed a stronger band than what I had previously. This works great!,5.0
"Great bands. So far so good, Perfect length for my height",5.0
"This is the second Black Mountain band that I bought and obviously I like their products.  It is not expensive, but it works great.  The door plug that keeps it works very well and will prevent spring back. Handles are comfortable.  I found one nice feature is to put one handle in each hand, or double the force and put two handles in one hand.l It appears to be high quality surgical rubber that will last a very long time.

I bought the first to help with a shoulder injury and the second, this one, to give me a little muscle exercise when traveling.  Packs easily and keeps me fit.

Seems to be from a good family-owned company with a quality product.  I have not needed customer service but phone number is prominently provided",5.0
Does its job.,5.0
This band is a lot more thick and sturdy than I ever could've imagined! Great for doing rows hooked to a pole while I sit on the ground and also for lat pulls. Seems like it will last for the long haul as I use it regularly and hasn't seemed to change in about a month of moderate use. Great heavy band.,5.0
Excellent,5.0
Works very well. The door anchor increases the versatility of the product significantly and I use it several times a week. I will buy one with more resistance a well as since I'm apparently stronger than I first anticipated.,5.0

"Great Product, exactly what I expected. Great value for the price.",5.0
I use this band for the P90x program and I love how soft the handles are. This band in particular (red) really seems like the perfect weight needed for starting the first month of the program. Will definitely come back to buy the next higher tension band from here as I progress through the three months.,5.0
"High quality resistance bands. This is my second purchase from Black Mountain and I couldn't he happier with my product. The handles are comfortable and offer good grip. The band itself offers a great workout. If you are going to purchase bands, buy this brand.",5.0
"Great band that I can stretch in any direction. I just got it and love working muscles that are difficult to do with weights. The padded handle is very comfortable, since an unpadded hard handle would be uncomfortable. Main two issues are: that the door strap needs a door with a wide enough gap and unfortunately my door seals shut so I tie it to a sturdy piece of furniture; and the rubber is not very long and could be an issue for tall folks who don't have a high enough anchor point (works fine for me at 5'9"").",5.0
This product is true to its description of weight (45-50 lbs). It can be taken anywhere and has a very sturdy door anchor. Definitely an awesome product if you are considering weight training with no actual weights! Super convenient to take with you if you are traveling!,5.0
"great product, I've snapped the rubber straps, this product is holding up very well.",5.0
"I use it at the gym for shoulder workouts along with free weights, and  I combine it with other exercises. The tension is strong.",5.0
Very nice band I love the weight and the soft handles that don't hurt my hands. Really there's not much more to say about this product it does what it's supposed to with good durability and comes with a door anchor so you can't go wrong there.,5.0
I recently bought this resistance band for my Beachbody workouts. I love that I can change the resistance by making it shorter and that I don't have to store a bunch of different sized weights. Not to mention it is so easy to travel with! This band is great quality and I can tell that its durability will last a long time. The handles have a great cushion to them and are very comfortable to use. I haven't used the door feature yet but I do like that the band comes with a booklet of exercises that I can do and explains how to use the door feature. The only negative is that I wish the band were a little longer. There are some exercises that I do that require the band to be under both feet or all the way over your head while the band is under your feet. Its easy to modify for the length of the band but I do wish it was a little longer.,5.0
I love my Blue Mountain stretch bands,5.0
"These are such good quality, and I can stretch them over my head (I'm 6'3"") during my workouts. They seem incredibly durable.",5.0
"Very helpful during recovery from spine surgery. Handles are a huge benefit, as compared to the plain straps.",5.0
This resistance band is an excellent addition to my workout.  I am 72 and use the band both at home with recommended resistance moves and during interval training while walking.  The bands are so simple and easy to store as well as travel with and yet strengthen  a large range of muscle groups.  My family has to strength bands now and will be getting a third resistance level to round out our workouts.,5.0
"Great for at home workouts , really comfortable handles !",5.0
"This product is great and now incorporated in my total body workout. Especially arm and leg toning. It's great, I don't miss my free weights. I never thought it possible. The door stop makes for good exercise routines. The stops seem small but are very effective. Shipment was on time, packaging good. I would definately buy more products from Black Mountain. My overall experience was excellent.",5.0
"I bought the orange resistance band about a month ago, and so far I am well satisfied. The rubber is great material that should not dry rot anytime soon as long as it is kept inside. The handles are pretty durable and the door mount has held up fine so far. Be sure to look up exercises from a respectable site, and enjoy your work out!",5.0
"This is great for simulating pull ups. I love the door attachment, it works well and I feel completely safe using it. High quality product that I would (will) absolutely purchase again.",5.0

Very pleased with this product. It seems to be made of quality materials than will last for a long time. The door anchor is a very simple design and is easy to use. It allows me to change the resistance angle quickly and easily. Great product. Recommend highly.,5.0
I really did like...I'm still learning how to use it (beginner) but I do like the amount of resistance it has...for my body type,5.0
"Quality item. When I received the green (medium 10-12 lb) resistance band I was very pleased.
It was recommended by my physical therapist. It is exactly what I need to tone up my body.

After using this product for some time I can say that it is well built and a great resistance band. The advertised resistance is correct (I have the red color and it feels about 25-30 lbs). Would recommend purchasing from this company,5.0

"This is just what I was looking for!  I can get all the arm exercises in I want, without having a bunch of weights laying around. I plan to order one for my 86 year old father who has weights laying around to trip over; this will be so much easier for him!  I love this and highly recommend to everyone!",5.0
"Its so easy to use, awesome for home workouts. this is my second time purchasing it, with different resistant bands.
Its great for people who can't access to gym all day, so u can carry this to ur office or other workplace during break times.
Awesome !! Loved it!!! Long lasting!!",5.0

"I started with the light resistances band. After being well satisfied with that  band, I decided to try a the this band. I loved it from right out of the box. Keep up the great work Black Mountain. :).",5.0
"Excellent product! The handles are comfortable, yet sturdy. I was skeptical as to how the door piece would work, but it worked great! I use it in a dead-bolted door, just in case. Superb piece of equipment. Excellent quality for the price. I highly recommend this product.",5.0

"Was looking for a band that would provide a good amount of resistance and came across Black Mountain Products.  Read the reviews and like what I saw, especially for the price.  Picked up the purple band, heaviest they offer, and was VERY pleased with it out of the box.  A few weeks and many workouts later and I'm still as happy with the quality of the band as the first day I used it.  I will most certainly be purchasing more bands from the company in the future.

A great bonus, inside the box was a piece of paper with a phone number and and offer for a free band.  Called the number and was expecting to speak to an automated system or some typical customer service rep with an attitude.  Was pleasantly surprised to speak to a gentleman that seemed as happy to talk to me as I was to get a normal person with a good attitude.

Looking forward to doing much more business with them in the future.",5.0
"I love my resistance band, this is my first resistance band I have bought and I really like it.  It gives you the strength will definitely order more when I need a higher resistance.",5.0
Good quality. I would definitely buy another black mountain product.,5.0
"great exercise band.  super easy to use, good amount of resistance and great for a work out anywhere.  if you had the excuse of not having enough space or time to work out then you can't make any excuses with this band.  it has a good amount of resistance for both males and females.  don't expect this to build up huge muscles though. this is for those that want a toned body (arms) and are ok with using resistance as a mean of doing so.

personally i like the toned look than the bulk so this is perfect for me.  i can put this in my luggage so i can carry it when i travel and work out in the hotel.  theres enough amount of exercises you can do with it so you can work out several body parts with a flick of the wrist.  the product itself seems durable and of good quality.",5.0
Excellent product...better than the equipment I use at local gyms and fitness centers. Highly recommend.,5.0
This resistance band is of excellent quality.  It is made so that the stretch band will not pull out of the handles.  The handles are well padded and make the band comfortable to use.,5.0
Great product and fast shipping. Already used and love the excerises it comes with. I highly reccomend this product .,5.0
Great product!,5.0
Very well built and strong. Just what I needed,5.0
This product is a fantastic way to get in shape. I have used it for a few days now and it is absolutely perfect. The product comes with a small booklet that lets you know about the many different types of exercises that can be done. I also used this resistance band with a few of the kids I train at soccer practice and they love it. The resistance band has one small stretch mark but other than that no sign of wear and tear. The black resistance band is definitely for people ages 14 and up.,5.0
Very pleased so far - use multiple times throughout the day,5.0
"After a few weeks of use, the dexterity remains. I feel my band will last quite some time.",5.0
I like the quality of the handles. The stretch is good. The only thing I would prefer if it were a little longer.,5.0
"Great product, excellent material.",5.0
I've never avidly used resistance bands until now and I'm happy that these were my first bands. They are very well made and come with a handy door anchor and booklet with exercises. I chose the Green (medium) bands equal to lifting about 10-15 lbs. Handles are well cushioned and the band itself is strong enough that I am confident that it will be a long time before it starts to wear out. Great price too! Highly recommend!,5.0
Got this to use with my 21 day fix extreme workouts and it works great and was a lot cheaper then the beach body ones!,5.0
I recently purchased the Blue 5 lb Black Mountain Resistance Band and found it well made and easy to carry and use at my exercise class. I am looking forward to purchasing various strengths of Black Mountain Resistance Bands as I progress with my strength training and rehabilitation. I recommend these products and encourage other seniors to use them for improving their strength.,5.0

"I started a club with band strength training and I have been building up a home/travel collection of bands to use and I really like the Black Mountain bands they have a slightly different feel to their handles but the quality matches what they have in the gymn and the other, apparently no name bands that I received as a gift.

I will be looking to fill in more of the bands as budget allows, and I think I'm going to go with a set of the fixed Black Mountain bands as they appear to be fairly decent quality.

As for a workout, if you are thinking about using bands, they are effective and all your truly need to get toned.  I use them in the gymn setting and the workouts go by fast, can easily be increased to make sure you are reaching muscle failure and are flexible for all major muscle groups. I'm a workout novice, but love using them and I've had striking results in just months.",5.0
"Doesn't get any easier than this.  You slide the flap in between a door, then shut it, then loop the bands through it.  The padded end hangs on the other side of the door so it doesn't move.  You can adjust the height by moving the flap up.  There is nothing to ""install"" and no tools are involved.",5.0
Great product that is easy to use.,5.0
I bought this band so I could exercise between meetings and calls at work. I am just doing standing curls. This product works great! I would say the weight is closer to 40 lbs. I was seeing tears after a week of use and I called support. They were fantastic. They immediately sent out a new one. You have to watch to not go over 3 times the size of non stretched length. I would definitely by this product and from Black Mountain again.,5.0
"Very disappointed.  Delivered in a box that was falling apart and re-taped with duct tape.  The tricycle I received had a return label in it from another customer.  Pedal was broken, huge chunk of tire was missing, numerous scratches on paint.  Waste of time and money.  Definitely returning.",1.0

Did not even take it out of the box. Has a very strong chemical smell. Probably from the tires.,1.0
"Would not recommend. Amazon lists this as USA made, but it's made in China! The box this came in was filled with a horrible chemical smell and the bike itself has the same smell. I had to leave it outside to air and the tired and streamers still smell. I had to cut the streamers off because if you touch them your hands will have the chemical smell on them. It's just ridiculous for a child's product to be so toxic. Very disappointed.",1.0

"I'm very disappointed with this product, especially since it's impossible to find tricycles in bike shops where I live.

The rubber wheels smell like campfire as if something went wrong in the forging process. Even after several weeks they still smell.

The hubs on the rear wheels are poorly made. The shaft hole on each wheel is not perpendicular to the wheel, it's on an angle. So when viewed from behind, the wheels tilt outwards rather than being vertical. This causes them to wobble and make a horrible squeaking sound.",1.0
"Because I believe that American product quality, make light of travelling a thousand li to American buy, results received after found many places were scratched, very disappointed.",1.0
Made in CHINA what is up with that I did not know Radio Flyer was made in China. Very Very disapointed with purchase .,1.0
"Pros:
 - It looks nice...
 - Yeah, I don't have anything else here.

Cons:
 - NOT for 2 year olds!  The description says it's appropriate for 2-5 but it is WAY too big for an average 2 year old (and I know from our Dr. that my girls are pretty much average for 2).
 - Hard to assemble!  This is absolutely the hardest piece of children's equipment to assemble I've ever encountered.  Let's start by saying that I'm not particularly handy, but I have put together play sets, cribs, rocking horses and many other things for my kids and this was just the worst.  The pieces don't go together very well, one of the screws is basically impossible to put in (it goes under the foot stand at the back where there is not space for both a screw and a screwdriver to operate) and then there's the handle bars... they attach to the base of the bike basically by screwing down a clamp, which is already a stupid way to do it.  In order to keep the handle bars from moving independently you have to screw it in very hard, but when I attempted to do this I just stripped the heck out of the screw and STILL ended up with handle bars that are wibbly wobbly and sometimes turn without turning the wheel.  Anyway, could be partly my fault... but they honestly shouldn't be producing something that's so easy to mess up!
  - Fairly heavy.  Based on other reviews it sounds like it tips over easily but it's a really heavy thing which I would not want falling on my kids.

Anyway, we ended up buying some plastic Fisher Price tricycles instead and we LOVE those.  They were easy to assemble, a much better size and just overall such a better experience plus they were pretty much half the price.",1.0
"My 35 lbs./4 yo son crashed (onto grass, he suffered no injury and was laughing) after rolling down about a 2 and 1/2 foot hill on our lawn and the entire vertical piece of the handle bar cracked - not at a welded joint but the length of the entire shaft.  What a piece of junk.",1.0
My wife and I ordered this trike for our granddaughter and the first one we received was impossible to assemble because the primary bolt holes in the frame didn't align properly. We ordered a replacement which arrived promptly and much to our chagrin the problem was worse with the second trike. Very poor manufacturing standards.,1.0
I had a problem with the assembly due to a part (a bolt).  Customer service told me I had the wrong part and they would send the correct one.  3 weeks and 2 replacement parts later I found out that the original part was correct.  I discovered this on my own.  The part ( the bolt) did not match the assembly instructions (the picture or the part number).  Once I figured it out it was easy to complete the assembly.,1.0
The seat was broken on arrival. Looks like poor quality in the stem screw and hole. Had to be returned.,1.0
"Yet not open, till will visit my granddaughter,. for the Jewish Holidays, beginning of Sept, spending the holidays in NYC",1.0
"Save your money and buy a different trike. I bought this for my son and it was such a waste of money I wish I could return it. First the bike is a pain to put together. It is not very hard but the pieces don't fit together very well so there is a lot of adjusting and playing around you have to do. Second, the bike is very wobbly and you really can't fix it. Everything on this bike is so loosely held together that the bike is a wobbly mess. We tried to tighten it up but to no avail. Lastly, there are so many sharp edges on this trike you wonder what Radio Flyer was thinking. It is a cute trike but very poorly made.",1.0
"My daughter doesn't like it as she can'r stop when she need to, also it not comfortable when sit and ride it.",1.0
"the bike keeps tipping over during maneuvering and making turns. The front handles keep comming off.  It is a very heavy bike for a kid to maneuver. The back is heavier than the front, therefore there is no balance when riding the bike. It was not a good purchase.",1.0
Sorry to say but the product got a negative review for safety from children's magazine because it tips over easily.  We got it for our grandson and before we could give it we were asked to take it back.,1.0
"I bought this tricycle as christmas gift for my 3 year old son in December 2010. We could not use it till now because the handle bar could not be tightened enough to stay in proper alignment with the front tire.

The design is very bad. The handle bar is connected to the front tire completely by friction. No matter how much I tightened the clap which make the friction between handle bar and front tire, the handle bar still turns away from the from tire easily. So the handle bar and front tire cannot be aligned. This tricycle is completely useless.

I saw someone just drilled a hole and put a pin bwteen handle bar and front tire connection. Maybe that is the only solution.",1.0
"We bought these bikes for our 2 y/o son and 3 y/o daughter for Christmas.  While they look great and are very sturdy, they are just too darned big for a little toddler.  Even now 9 months later they still cannot sit on the seat and reach the pedals.  By the time they will be able to reach teh pedals they will be ready for a two wheeler.  My kids are not tiny either, my daughter is 50 percentile and my son is 90 percentile.  Get a smaller tricycle so your kids can ride it.  We have a Planet Kiddo hand me down (made in Germany) that is much smaller and my daughter rides that around.

Edited to add:  Now, when my kids are 4 and 3, they still cannot reach the pedals. I am going to get coaster bikes for them that can have pedals added later.  What a waste of money these tricycles were. It only gets ons start b/c I could not put zero stars...",1.0
"My 2-year is a tricycle riding maniac. He LOVES riding and can peddle so well. I bought this tricycle because he can comfortably reach the peddles. The problem is that it tips over VERY easily. I am searching for another trike that is more stable so I don't have to stay within a foot of him to try and catch him when he's about to have a bad fall. I recommend you find a tricycle with a lower center of gravity and a wider wheel base in back. However, my son enjoys it and it is durable.",1.0
"This trike is advertised with other trikes.  However, while the others are 10 inch trikes, this one doesnt inform the custumer that it is a 12"" trike and not suitable for 2 year olds.

It is beyond me why the size of this bike is not in the ad!

Isnt it fair to assume that if it is listed with other 10 inch trikes and no other sizes that this is a 10inch also?

This trike is much too big for a 2 yo.",1.0
I would never buy this trike again for a child.  It tips VERY easily when the child's weight leans even the slightest bit forward or to the side.  Enough said.  Money wasted and damage done.,1.0
"This trike is too tall, and the front wheel is too small.  The result is that it tips over VERY easily.  I won't even let my two year old on it, because it falls over so easily.  My 3 1/2 year old can ride it straight on a totally flat surface, but we live on a cul-de-sac that has a slight slant to it, and any time she tries to turn it at all she tips right over.  Even the 4 year old boy next door falls down on this.  It's so tippy that the neighbors won't let any of their kids ride it!  Not only that, but the grippers on the handles come right off.  I love Radio Flyer, and I certainly have fond memories of their products from when I was a kid, but I wish I had gotten a lower, wider, safer tricycle instead of this one.",1.0
"My husband bought this for our two year old son... and it was just too big for him to use.  So, we thought we'd wait.  We had it outside, under a tarp and within two months, it started to rust.  Once it started, the rust couldn't stop.  So basically, a big waste of money.

Should have bought the plastic Rock-n-Roll Trike instead or a Kettler.",1.0
"My 2 1/2 year-old received this bike for Christmas.  We all loved its retro look and it seemed pretty sturdy.  He had only had it for a couple of days when we noticed he was peeling off the shiny metallic coating from the handlebars.  His grandmother tried to brush away the loose flakes and received several substantial cuts on her fingers and hand.  We got rid of the bike immediately!  Also, while it says it is appropriate for ages 2 and up, his older brother was barely big enough to pedal it.",1.0
"I ordered this bike as the main present for my four year old's birthday.  Imagine the disappointment when we could not sufficiently tighten the bolt that attaches the handlebars to the front wheel, so the handlebars turn independently from the wheel (making the bike unusable).  We called the manufacturer and they sent us a new part--we replaced it and it did not solve the problem.  Now they are sending us a different part.  Meanwhile, my daughter is still without a bike.",1.0
"My little guy received this trike from his Grandparents when he was two.  He could just reach the peddles and was very excited about it.  It took a few months before he could really reach the peddles and get moving on it.  Every time and I mean EVERY time he rides the trike it tips over on him and he ends up hurt.  As one of the other reviews states, I thought maybe he was turning to sharp but even when I hold on and help him turn slowly I feel it start to tip.  It's now hanging in the garage and he will not be riding it again.  We will be buying him a more stable/safe trike.",1.0
"My daughter received this for Christmas when she was about 2.  She loved all things red, so it seemed to be the perfect gift.  However, when kids try to turn, it flips over!  I thought it was just my daughter trying to turn too sharp, but my son has flipped it nearly every time he has tried it as well.  THe neighborhood kids have flipped it over as well, resulting in many scraped hands and knees but luckily no heads.  I AM THROWING IT AWAY!",1.0
"I bought two of these for my twin daughters who are 4-1/2 now and they still have trouble riding them.
The trike will topple over if the wheels are turned too sharply.  The center of gravity is too high for small children.  One of my daughters said she's rather just walk in the parade and wave a flag than learn how to ride it for the 4th of July parade.  That's when I decided I need to get her a different trike if her experience has been that bad.
Also, the bolts come loose and the wheel can turn without turning the steering wheel no matter how tightly the bolts are tightened.  Same with the seat - it wiggles.
The other daughter fell off the trike and the lever for the bell dug into her skin causing a bad scrape.
It's pretty and the bell has a lot of nostalgia but it hasn't been practical at all.  Trike riding should feel like a joy but with these, the kids think I'm giving them a chore when I say ""Let's go ride tricycles.""",1.0
"My daughter received this tricylcle for her second birthday. She is very tall for her age and already knew how to pedal a trike. She was so excited to get her first bike, but that excitement turned to frustration very quickly. She tipped over every time, even when she was not moving--just leaning over to look at the pedals. The center of gravity on this tricycle is much too high and the back wheel base is too narrow. We went to ToysRUs and let my daughter try out several other trikes and she loves the Kiddi-O Supertrike 4. A great bike that isn't a health hazard!",1.0
"I had the same problems and have written to Radio Flyer.  The handlbars do not stay in alignment (and I even got a replacement part to supposedly fix this problem) and the tricycle tips far too easily.  Don't fall for the rugged look, it is not worth the money.  Get something from another company made of plastic.  I find this bike dangerous and will not let my son ride it.",1.0
"We purchased this bike for our two and a half year old son, since it's age reccomendation was for 24 months through 5 years.  He could not reach the pedals, let alone the ground (and he is in the 75% for his height) and he was constantly falling over on it.  Also, the handle bar could not be tightened enough to stay in proper alignment with the front tire, so it was always turned sideways to make the bike go straight.  My neighbor also has this bike and hers does the same thing.  Finally, after about five months of my four year old riding it, the front tire has just completely broke off of the frame!!  We are very disappointed in the stability and quality of this bike.  It looks cute, but don't be fooled.  It is very top/front heavy and is always falling over when you make a turn.  Don't buy it!!!",1.0
"My son received this bike for his 3rd birthday from his grandparents.  We loved it's looks.  When the weather broke we took it outside and we were ready for some fun.  Well everytime my son turned the bike fell over.  When you turn it cuts too sharp and the bike tips over.  After three times of getting hurt that was it and he will not ride the bike now.  We thought maybe he was too young so we let our neighbors son ride, he is four he also fell twice and will not ride.  Last but not least we let a 5 year old try she also fell twice and that was it for her.  They look at the bike as if to say, ""I'm not riding that bike.""  So now it sits in our garage.  I will say though it is a beautiful bike just not made to turn.",1.0
"This is an amazing tool - beefy, smooth action and all the good stuff and I truly want to love it.  Why one star?  The Phillips screwdriver bit.

It is a classic study in manufacturing failure and will snap like glass the first time you use it.

Someone at SOG (or, more likely, one of their components vendors) couldn't be bothered to consider what happens when you stamp lettering right at a stress concentration point then harden a bit that will be subjected to considerable torsion (note in the picture that the crack follows the letter ""A"").  SOG's own parts listing is full of complaints about this and of course these aren't covered by the warranty.  If this is an example of their engineering or quality control, I can't wait to see what happens next.

You can read the reviews on SOG's own web site by searching ""Phillips screwdriver""

I'm sorry, but there are just too many good tools by good manufacturers out there to be a repeat customer for this kind of negligence.",1.0

"Worst Multi-tool ever! This thing is so tight it can't hardly be opened. The pliers hinge out, this is clumsy and also leaves a void in the handles so if you can open it, it's hard to use. Getting at anything, like the knife, is almost dangerous, be careful not to cut yourself. The idea that designers took this from paper, to a prototype, and then actually mass-produced this, is a joke. DON'T BUY!",1.0
"I am incredibly disappointed in this.  IMHO, it is a complete waste of money.  It is very difficult to use.  The pliers are always in the way and have to be manipulated before you can use ANYTHING.  The ""ruler"" is useless.  There are no scissors.  I own a Gerber Suspension which is light years ahead of this piece of junk.",1.0
"This ""educational"" toy is designed for 10 and up.  That could be because only a 10 year old would not realize how poorly designed this thing is.  It will require an IMMENSE amount of patience to complete.  I have been helping my daughter with this toy for WAY TOO LONG.  The pieces sort of snap together, but must all be glued.  They then need to be positioned into the plastic body and somehow held with 10 hands that can contort into unexplainable positions to hold it all in alignment with the body and be glued at the same time.  If it were not for the fact that my daughter REALLY wants this thing completed, I would have taken great joy in smashing it with a hammer.  I would not recommend this to anyone who is not extremely patient and who has the room on a spare table to glue all the pieces together, then assemble.......oh yeah, and get a bunch of mini rubber bands to hold it all together while drying.",1.0
"My 11 year old daughter bought this from a museum gift shop.  She loves horses and science and thought this would be fun.

We have spent hours assembling this thing.  Whatever you do, don't follow the instructions.  They are backwards.  If you do the skeleton first, there is no way to insert the organs.  The pieces are supposed to be able to be snapped together.  They don't.  Glue doesn't hold them either.  At one point the instructions told us to use cement - it was not included.  The box shows the organs different colors, they aren't.

We finally rearranged the picture instructions (there are very few words) and used clear packing tape to hold it together.  It now vaguely resembles the front photo.  The organs are all the color of Silly Putty and the leg bones are held in place by hope, prayer, and the clear outer case.",1.0

"This is a total piece of you-know-what. My 3-year-old son's feet have no shot at reaching the pedals (which were well nigh impossible to attach as one came semi-stripped and partially assembled incorrectly by a previous customer who returned it...that's my best guess). It took me and my wife hours and hours to put together and when we were finally finished (no thanks to, but rather in spite of, the imbecile-written instructions) the thing was unrideable. The photo here on the Amazon page has the front fender backwards and the actual thing here in front of me looks like a chopper compared to the photo. I have always held John Deere in high esteem. That they have the nerve to peddle such a product as this has certainly changed that. They're now on my you-know-what list. Oh, the worst part is the odor emanating from both the box and the bike. My entire house now smells like a chemical plant or burning rubber or moth balls or a propane leak or whatever that nasty toxic smell is. Either the rave reviews are fake or I'm living in bizarro land and have received some ersatz version of the tricycle.",1.0
"I saw a weather-beaten, rusty version of this trike outside a secondhand store recently.  It was obviously years old but still very sturdy.  I went inside to inquire, thinking that perhaps it could be refurbished, and the woman told me it was a $250 trike new and that she wouldn't take less than $50 for it.  I walked away and decided to do a little research.  That was a GOOD decision.

This is not a John-Deere or USA-made product.  If you look, you'll see several similar trikes with identical construction available at different retailers.
All are Chinese-made, presumably by one manufacturer.  Sometimes the handlebars vary, but the core of the tricycle does not.

Here on Amazon, search for Grip or All-Terrain Tricycle.
On Ebay, you can find them under Western Express.
At Harbor Freight, they call it All-Terrain Tricycle.

(There's also a USA-made Dirt King tricycle that's similar, but not identical; you might try that if you're set on paying over $200 for a tricycle.)

As for me, there's a shiny new red Harbor Freight tricycle on my front porch.  My little boy loves it, and I love the money I still have in the bank.

Not happy at all. This product has holes in it and is held together with duct tape. I was scammed thinking I was getting a quality product.,1.0
Big disappointment.  I ordered this as a lighting deal and i should have read all the info. The box comes labled as to what it is and there are pictures on it too. Any hope of a surprise on Christmas morning is crushed as my kids were home when it arrived. It does say this is an issue on the description so shame on me for jumping on this to quickly. All other 20 plus amazon items i ordered were in nondescript boxes. Next time i'll be more cautious.,1.0
It came and is missing one of the slit T parts and therefore can not be put together.  We have gone to the plumbing store and nothing works for it.  I will remove this bad review if you will over night him a part.  Better check your shipments better.,1.0
"Do not get this net! My kids play lacrosse and wanted to use it for that. The net part was very thin. Every time the would take a shot, the ball would rip a whole in it. It got to the point where we needed to get a better quality net.",1.0

"After several attempts I finally gave up.  They first replaced the net with one that fit worse than the original.  Then, they had me send the whole unit in so they could fit the net to the frame and return it.  After holding it for many weeks, they returned it to me and to this day the net is still way too big for the frame.  This all transpired over several month, almost a year all together.  Very dissatisfied.  If it was a choice, I would give this transaction ZERO stars.",1.0

"Was disappointed that this is titled a one-person inflatable boat. It's a one child or very small person inflatable boat. Even with the weight limit being what it is, it's just too tiny. I was going to return it, but it had been longer than 30 days. The seller would take it back but they charge a 50% restocking fee, then I would have to pay to ship it back. Not worth it. I can sell it at a garage sale and actually make a profit from it. Not very happy with the product or the seller :(",1.0

"I'm writing this review on a gorgeous Friday afternoon after a full week building a rooftop deck up and down a ladder all day- there are so many better things I've got to do right now, and I ordinarily NEVER write reviews, but I HAD TO chime in on this toilet of a cooler....
  2 words- STEER CLEAR! If you're a tradesman, opt for the side button coolers....I know they tend to lose the button if the cooler opens too far, but let me tell you my experiences with the top button release cooler:
  Day 1 on the job, I lift the cooler into the back of a pick up truck, only to have my forearm lightly touch the button..... cooler flips open and my lunch lands on the ground....not cool!
  Day 3 on the job, one of the laborers picked up my cooler to move it....again, lunch lands on the ground......broke my glass bowl that my cereal was in, so I had to go without at coffee break......now I'm getting irate :-@
  Alas, Friday afternoon (today), as I proceed to bring my cooler up the ladder, I lift it to put it onto the roof, again it flips open, lunch lands 2 stories down.....
  At that point, I'm beyond pissed! So I'd like to say this, now that I've had my 1 hour commute home to cool off: If I owned PLAYMATE INC., I would FIRE THE IDIOT DESIGNER/DESIGNERS that cape up with this design!!!!!! HE or SHE or THEY get a BIG F! This P.O.S. cooler design fails the consumer, and PLAYMATE ought to be recalling every one of these! If my lunch happened to land on the homeowner, or a passer by, while I was up on a ladder.... let's just say this, our clientele are 7 figure customers, I'm sure they've got very thorough attorneys......

  As for the positives with this cooler, If you're looking to lose weight, this cooler will manage to cut your food consumption for sure! In All seriousness, PLAYMATE makes a good product, generally speaking. This design modification from the side button release coolers to top button release coolers was the direct result of overpaid designers trying to reinvent the wheel- I'd like to quote a wise man, by saying ""IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT"". PLAYMATE ought to begin a new campaign, ""designed by tradesmen, for tradesmen"", fire the design staff, and hire actual tradespeople to design these products. As of today, this cooler is officially taken out of service. ZERO STARS!",1.0
"The top is just a single thickness of plastic with no other insulating qualities. Plus it has a hole in it where the latch mechanism passes through; that hole lets water in to soak the contents. So on sunny days the ""cooler"" becomes a little solar oven, and on rainy days it's a bathtub. Cheap design, all around.",1.0
"I was very disappointed that when I unboxed the Igloo Playmate Elite Cooler upon its arrival, it was considerably dusty/dirty giving the impression that the cooler was ""used"" (or sat unprotected in storage for a long time) and it was listed as ""NEW"" ... I attempted to clean it up, but it still has some light staining on the lid ... Of course, it is functional so I am not going to take the time to send it back; but I remain VERY DISAPPOINTED in Amazon ... This simply is not like them.",1.0
"I received this rack as a gift, so I didn't get to evaluate it before purchase.  I have a 2"" hitch receiver.  The included 2"" adapter is worthless, wobbly, and unstable.  The reason is the use of nylon and loose tolerance in the adapter.  Had to buy a steel adapter that fit from another vendor.  Don't trust the included cheap plastic bike straps unless you want to risk losing your bikes to following traffic.  Use plently of tiedowns that you provide yourself.  The horizonal bars that hold the bikes are attached to the upright pipe by screw knobs that are only hand-tightened and can back out.  The upright pipe is the one thing that is over-engineered and more sturdy than needed.  I would strongly recommend a potential purchaser spend more money for a better carrier.  It might be OK for taking a kid's bike to a neighborhood park, but that's about it.",1.0
"If you need a ""starter"" or ""disposable"" bike carrier, this might be okay, but not suitable for longer trips or valuable bikes.

Good parts:

Cheap, $99

Bad parts:

1.  Cheap

2.  The adapter for a 2"" reciever hitch is horrible, you'll have to shim it, jury-rig something, or go to a parts store and pay for a workable one.

3.  Way too much sway, which is obvious as you put it together.  Turning corners in town have you checking your mirrors with concern.  Multiply the effect for highway speeds or bumps.  Would need to rig something.

4.  Straps holding the bikes.  Cheap, rough on your bike, and not very tight.

In summary, if you want to spend alot of time rigging it up to save a few bucks, it might be worth it, but out of the box, I wouldn't trust any worthwhile bike or vehicle with it.",1.0
I gave this product one star because it was the lowest option. What I really give it is this: WARNING! The outback hitchback 4 product is a dangerous piece of junk. I installed it on my Suburban (which required the - needs to be redesigned - adaptor to 2 inch) and put one full-sized and three kid bikes on it. It swayed a range of 10-12 inches newly installed. My wife  had went on the Target web site earlier and read that the sway was normal. By the time I had traveled 1/3 of the way back to the Bay Area from LakeTahoe (in the middle of the night) I noticed in the lights of the car behind me the hub of the full sized bike wheel sticking out from the side of the vehicle. I pulled over in the dark and checked it out. Due to the constant side-to-side motion of the winding mountain roads the main metal braket had bent and the sway had increased to a now dangerous 2 feet! Needless to say the rest of the four hour trip was nerve racking. Roping the rack to try and stabilize it. I'm taking the rack back to Target!,1.0

"I bought this for my husband, and he was truly so excited about it because we had been searching for years for a replacement for his old one (that he had for years btw). Within the first 2 days the head flew off the handle, which was no big deal, my husband just pounded a couple extra shims into it and reattached it. But then I get a picture from him today that shows the entire head cracked down the middle of it! My husband is a framer, so he uses his tools for what they are made for, and he isn't always gentle with them, but I have never seen anything like that happen before. I would not waste my money on another one of these.",1.0
Handle broke the second time I used it.  Don't waste your money.,1.0
"Tthe initial resistance while pumping gave me the impression that i was using it wrong. Oh, but apparently there are no instructions that come with it to tell you exactly how to use it. So, I attach it and start pumping. The up pull is like picking up an anvil. I say that because I was trying to use a specific amount of pull because I didn't want to break it. But there's no way that it gives any indication that it's working. So I pull harder. After about 3 reps up and down, it broke off at the bottom end of the handle.

No wonder it only cost 10 bucks. Not even worth that, really.",1.0
"This will not pump up a basketball. It will pump up an air mattress, but if you try it with anything with much pressure, it doesn't work.",1.0

Only problem is I didn't read all 3 pages of reviews!  If I had, I would have seen the ones that warn ""it doesn't inflate bicycle tires"" and I might have given this purchase a second thought.  Instead, I went by the review that said ""It inflates everything--tires, balls, pools... anything you need inflated!"" and bought it.  It inflated my daughter's kickball just fine, but it's utterly useless for my wheelbarrow wheel, which is the only reason I bought it in the first place!  BIG disappointment, but lesson learned:  READ ALL THE REVIEWS.",1.0
"In layman's terms, it sucked. Yes it did everything it was said to and more, but about 4 minutes after i opened it up and tried to use it, it broke. I put a little water on the needle and on my basketball and pumped it up. When I tried to take it out, the end nozzle separated from the needle. I couldn't even get the needle out, so I ended up having to cut open the basketball...But it did pump really well.",1.0

"Worked in the pest control industry for 16 years, till recently. We used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time (it's usually nice toasty warm in there). Sanitation, exclusion, and very careful application of pesticides is what you need.
Rodents are often repelled for a brief time, but quickly adapt (adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best). Again, count on sanitation, exclusion, and traps; try to avoid baits because you'd rather know where the little s.o.b. died (i.e. in a trap, rather than in a wall somewhere).",1.0

There are 2 descriptions listed for this ball.  The Amazon description (stating it is made of rubber) is correct.  The Product description stating it is made of leather is incorrect.

"I'm sorry to say that I was very disapointed with the quality of this product. I had 2 concerns with the build quality of the sleigh, 1st the side rails were not mounted securely and were prone to wobbling which did not instill confidence in their safety factor. Secondly was with the mounting set-up for the runners of the sleigh, the surface that the runers mounted too was almost twice as wide as the actual runners themselves which caused the snow to build up under the sleigh creating a fair amount of drag, which could cause the sleigh to become unstable and tip over. I have since returned the sleigh and am currently looking for another that is built better.",1.0
"I ordered this sleigh for my nephew as a Christmas present and was disappointed upon receipt due to the quality and unfinished wood of the product.

Today I attempted to return and fell 2 days over the 30 day return window (with 15% restocking fee for only unopened purchases) and they will not accept my return.  I am floored.  My bad for missing it by 2 days but their fine print is ridiculous.  Apparently their standard return policy is 7 day and that's if the box is unopened????  Ummmmm how does that work?  I am really shocked that Amazon uses them as a vendor with policies like that!  I have never had an issue with any other purchase I have ever made on Amazon.

"We received this as a splurge gift from the grandparents. It LOOKS lovely and appears to be high quality however it is USELESS.

Neither of my babies (at sitting up independently stage) could not be pulled in the sled as the tugging of the rope caused the sled to tip backwards and dumped the babies out. DANGEROUS! I assumed it was due to their weight being too low.

I tried again in the toddler years when they were heavier and taller, thinking maybe then it would work but it didn't work.  It seemed stuck in the snow and would not pull. Then when we tugged harder or faster,  again the sled tipped backward and dumped the child out!

I asked two friends about theirs (when I saw them being stored in their garages!) and was told they didn't work for them either, but they too were keeping them since they were gifts from the grandparents and were nice wooden objects; they felt guilty giving the `like new' items away.

After allowing this lovely piece of woodworking to sit in my garage for twelve years I finally donated it to a thrift shop.

The most disappointing thing was this is not an inexpensive item and it is made by a reputable company FLEXIBLE FLYER yet it is completely USELESS and DANGEROUS!

There is a less beautiful, one piece solid plastic, brightly colored sled on the market for toddlers that actually glides in the snow and does not tip over, the PARICON 625 TODDLER BOGGAN. Consider buying that one, it works and is safe. Someone gave us that as a hand-me down and we used it with success.",1.0

""send your broken expensive plastic watch here and we will fix it.""

My G-shock, by comparison,lasted longer than I wanted it to and cost one-quarter of what the Suunto cost.

"This is a bunch of money for high tech plastic! I bought an original jig several years ago and liked the method of joinery, but thought I would simplify the operation with this jig. It may simplify it, but it is grossly over priced for what it is...Amazon is getting this one back.",1.0
Product wasn't right for my garage door so I can't really give a comprehensive review.,1.0
I would highly recommend staying far away from this product.  It basically crumbled when I tried to nail it to the garage.  Waste of money get something better.,1.0
After only a couple months of having this installed now we have issues with it ripping from where the fasteners go in. Its falling off. Not what I would expect. We put in on really good too. I really feel that I should get a refund or a replacement and better quality nails. Maybe if the plastic grommets were metal it would hold better....When my door is shut there is a gap from cement to gasket so there is nothing but gravity that made it start to fall off. Not impressed.,1.0

"I ordered this product from one of the independent sellers on Amazon. What I received was a loose roll of rubber (no plastic wrap, just thrown in the shipping box) very different from what's shown on the pictures. Most importantly, the cross section of the rubber is different. The material is very thin and flimsy. It did not come with nails. As my inquiry with the seller was left unanswered for more than two weeks I put through a request for return, at which time I was sent a return label requiring payment of return shipping. When considering that I already paid for the shipping of the product, the seller sent me the wrong product and didn't even bother replying to my inquiry even after two weeks, AND the return shipping is almost as much as the product's cost, I decided to bring this to Amazon's attention in a claim.",1.0
"Nov 2013 - The product was ordered by a client to replace the worn torn original garage door weather strip. Given the horrible standards I repeatedly encounter with prefabricated materials, equipment and fixtures I did not just trust the package installation instructions.

The product did not disappoint my cynicism and was short by about 6"" so there would be nothing to ""trim"" per the instructions. I started in the middle and working toward each end in disregard to the instructions. I was able to stretch the gasket to just reach the edge of the door opening. Possibly because I had brought #8 stainless steel screws and washers, instead of the narrow galvanized nails and washers provided, I did not have the material tear when stretched out as far as possible.

With the middle and end secured I worked from the center out on each end to complete the installation. I spaced fasteners at 13""(+/-) on center between two fasteners placed at each end 1"" and another 4"" from the end. No telling what the manufacture has in mind for fastener spacing.",1.0
"If they had an option for a negative five star rating that's what I would have chosen.  I am very familiar with this product, I have purchased (2) from Home Depot over the last 4 years.  North Shore Commercial Door, Inc.,(NSCD, Inc.) should be ashamed and in particular, Amazon should be ashamed for allowing NSCD, Inc. to perpetrate such a fraud.  I wouldn't have had any problem with the product if they would have used the actual picture of the item they are selling.  Instead NSCD, Inc. chooses to  mislead consumers.  On the Amazon website they have posted (5) pictures of a high quality product which I have purchased in the past, from M-D Buiding Products that states on the packaging it is made of (Premium Rubber).  This sorry a** product is made from a cheap, flimsy foam rubber which will easily tear and deteriorate in no time.  Besides the extremely poor quality of the product, NSCD, Inc. decides to short me the nails that are listed and supposed to come with this item.  I have purchased many, many  items/products from and through Amazon over the last couple of years and this is the first time I have been completely and utterly disappointed.
*** Warning ***  Think long and hard before purchasing anything from NORTH SHORE COMMERCIAL DOOR, INC. obviously a disreputable company!

Brought it to Hawaii and again in San Diego. Both times it didn't not inflate. I purchased 2 so we can play in the pool and at the lagoon. Took up most of my luggage space too.,1.0

"I may have given it a higher rating, if I was actually able to use it. I pulled it out of the box, aired it up and took it to the river to be used as a 'Duck Retrieval System' in the event that I could not reach a duck with my extended pole. The first duck of the day drifted into a snag on the opposite side of the river, requiring me to paddle across the river to get to it. When I went to put the raft in the water, the ultra thin rubber had a 6"" tear along the seam. The mill thickness of material on this raft appears significantly less than Dollar Store saran wrap...",1.0

The picture of the two people in the boat and advertised as a 2 person boat is extremely misleading. There is a 200 lb weight limit that I didn't see mentioned anywhere in the listing...by looking at the pictures one would assume the weight limit is much higher - If this remotely to be considered  a two person boat it will have to be two young kids for both the size of the boat once its blown up and the weight limit,1.0
Cheap for a reason.  Barely fits one person.  Popped after ten minutes.,1.0

My daughter received this for a birthday gift.  The first time we blew it up we found it to have several holes.  She was very disappointed.,1.0
Super disappointed! I ordered this as a gift for my nephews who live in Florida. They were so excited to get in and play with the boat but when they took it to the beach the pump completely snapped off and broke. So  unfortunately they were unable to use the boat.,1.0
