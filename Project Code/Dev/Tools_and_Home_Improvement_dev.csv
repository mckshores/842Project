"Plenty bright and doesn't disturb my spouse in bed at night. The clip could be a bit larger to accept more pages, but easily handles a few hundred pages.

The neck is long. This is great because it can be positioned entirely out of view, yet still provide plent if focused light.

Only two power levels (single led, or dual led). Running on low setting is still adequate for nighttime reading.",5.0
"This reading lamp is bright, and light.  These things have come a long way since I first started using a book light.  I have bought many units looking for the perfect light, and found it with Mighty Bright.  It really is everything you need if you read in a dark area; like a bedroom.  The light is very concentrated and easy on the eyes, and very little escapes the reading page, so my wife is not bothered by the light.
It does suck the batteries fairly fast, but that is the only quibble I have.  Highly recommended.",5.0
Although the color that was sent is black versus blue it is a good and versatile product.,5.0
Perfect for bedtime reading.  Doesn't keep my husband awake and yet provides adequate light for reading.  Great item.,5.0
Works great!,5.0
Hope they never change this great gook light!! It's great!,5.0
Fantastic! It's like daytime on your pages. I'm buying more for Christmas gifts this year. Would make a great teacher's present or an item for a gift exchange.,5.0
This is a super book light!  Bought two of these to replace two we had misplaced.  Excellent brightness--sort of glad we lost the others!,5.0
Very bright but it's good.,5.0
"Daughter uses it nightly. We both love it, much better than reading in the dark and has brightness settings.",5.0
"Got this for my husband as a birthday gift, and he's used it every night since. It seems very well made, and the batteries seem to be lasting for a pretty long time. It's not very heavy, but still feels fairly solid. The clamp is padded on both sides, so it won't mar your book pages. The light has 2 LEDs for brightness control - press the button once to turn it on with both LEDs, press it again to dim the light by having only one LED on, and then press it a third time to turn it off completely.
I may have to invest in one of these for myself, after seeing how nice it is.",5.0
"This is a great light! It's very bright (high, low and off settings) and I like that the gooseneck will bend 360 degrees but is not at all flimsy. It works well on both hardbound and paperback books. I don't usually write reviews, but this is worth one.",5.0
"Bought this for my daughter to take to camp and she loved it! It takes 3 AAA batteries, which are included. When I packed it for camp I turned one of the batteries around so it wouldn't accidentally turn on and run down. She used it at camp nightly for 2 weeks and it never went dim.

She loved the flexible neck so she could position it exactly as she needed. The light was a nice bright white, making it easy to see the print on the page. The clip was sturdy and stayed in place on the book.

She also use it for her tablet to give her some extra light and it clips on easy and doesn't interfere with anything she's doing. And because it's lightweight it's still comfortable whether she's using it on her book or tablet.

Since she didn't have a side table light at camp she used it kind of as a regular lamp, too. It wasn't very bright but just enough for what she needed. It was also better than her flashlight at times because she could clip it to herself and be hands-free. A multi-tasker!

Over the past 25 years I've gone through many iterations of the book light and this is the best so far. And to add it it's great features is the ability to buy it in a variety of fun colors. Finally a book light that works that's not black (unless that's what you want!)",5.0
But allows for two settings. My other light was too dim; would love a light that's in between.,5.0
"Great reading light.  This is the 3rd one I own: I keep one at bedside for reading at night (so I don't disturb hubby with a brighter bedside lamp), one in my suitcase so it's ready for travel, and one in the guest bedroom.  Good lighting, batteries last a long time and can also  it serves as an emergency light if you ever need one due to a power outage - either at home or while traveling.",5.0
It's perfect the light is just enough for book reading at night and does not disturb my husband sleeping,5.0
I love being able to have the option to use an ac adapter with this booklight!  The two light settings are also a nice feature.,5.0
great for what its supposed to be for.,5.0
This is the best book light by far. I use this every night.,5.0
The base is a little thick but otherwise really pleased with this.,5.0
Great bright light!,5.0
"Perfect for what I needed! holds good on my books and the light is great.  And I ordered it through Alexa without ever seeing it first, so that gives me a good notion of trying Alexa for more purchases in the future.",5.0
This is a really good book light as it can cover one or two pages easily.  The button is right on top and easy to reach while reading.  Good choice!,5.0
"I purchased both this and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LuminoLite-Rechargeable-Extra-Bright-4-LED-Book-Light-Easy-Clip-On-Reading-Light-USB-Cable-UL-Certified-AC-Charger-Included-2-Brightness-Settings-Soft-Padded-Clamp-Perfect-for-Bookworms/dp/B00YXSF31Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LuminoLite Rechargeable Extra-Bright 4 LED Book Light, Easy Clip On Reading Light, USB Cable & UL Certified AC Charger Included, 2 Brightness Settings, Soft Padded Clamp. Perfect for Bookworms</a>&nbsp;to compare them -- the product listings look so similar, and I figured it wouldn't hurt to have one as a backup.

Well it turns out this Mighty Bright is way better. They're the same brightness and the same form factor, but the LuminoLight doesn't cast an even light -- it's strong in the center and fades quickly to the edges. While this Mighty Bright is even all around. And that really makes a huge difference -- much easier to read on the page.

(Besides that, the LuminoLight is made of a glossy plastic that feels a bit cheaper, whereas this Mighty Bright is a matte plastic that feels and looks a bit nicer.)",5.0
"I use this on my antique book stand which holds a very large reference book.
It works well.  I love it.",5.0
This little device keeps my marriage running. When I want to read and she wants to sleep it is the perfect tool. Shines bright in a small area and easy on batteries.,5.0
my boyfriend got this light for me since our sleep schedules are a little staggered. he almost always falls asleep before and is sensitive to light. this does a great job of keeping the surrounding dark and my book illuminated. the quality of the light is great and lasts long,5.0
"This light works well. It stays clipped on with not trouble, gives a lot of light without disturbing my husband and has 2 light settings. I love it for times when I am reading a real book as opposed to my Kindle.",5.0
"Might Bright is very good as both a book light and kindle light.

Its most promising feature is the evenly spread out white light and I can certainly attest to that. It doesnt have that blue tint like some LEDs and 2 brightness modes means that there is always enough light to complete your work comfortably.

It is very much multipurpose in nature - I also use it to illuminate my laptop setup (includes external keyboard) during light and it hardly creates any glare on the shiny plastic surface. Even when there is some light in the room, sometimes I use it to illuminate my book pages if it looks too dull (in terms of brightness).

The battery is quite good, but not exceptional - I have used it for a week roughly, and kept it on for a long time even when my studies were completed. Finally, one night I noticed that it was too dim and replaced the batteries - which is when I understood how dim it became in the last days. So, my guess is that it is probably good for 4-5 days if you use it extensively. I bought 4 rechargeable AAA batteries with this, which I would recommend doing as it will probably become a costly affair to replace the batteries so often.

I usually don't rate anything 5 star unless it is really really good compared to the competition.",5.0
Perfect for saving electricity and a book lover.,5.0
I have never had a book light before and came across this one. This is amazing. It gives the ability to adjust the position of the light giving you the best angle. The light is perfect for any type of book. It Is led and the lights do not produce a circle like most books lights do. For the price it is a great light.,5.0
"I really love this, enough light for you to read by, but not enough to wake up anyone else",5.0
This little light is fantastic. After researching a lot of reading lights I often read that some were too bright. This one illuminates my book pages perfectly without throwing extra light into my sleeping husbands eyes. He is able to fall asleep quickly while I continue to read. I'm so glad I found this because my other option was to stay in the living room alone at night.,5.0
fantastic light worth every cent,5.0
"I love this light! It is very lightweight, the clamp definitely opens an inch. The light easily illuminates two pages of a book with no hot spots, and the flexible neck is never in the way-- so you don't have to adjust it when you are using it. It can also stand on its own, without having to clamp on to anything. There are two bulbs; you can have both on or just one. The light is a nice white color.",5.0
Met all of my expectations!,5.0
The last book light you will ever buy...unless you lose this one.,5.0
"Great book light for children.  My 7 year old left hers on all night, quick change of the batteries and its still working like new!",5.0
"This is a perfect light for reading at night, but not generating so much light that it wakes my partner.",5.0
Super handy and easy to use.,5.0
"very useful ,",5.0
"See how we use it in our daughter's reading nook, as well as a timer at bedtime! We used it as a reward for when she could read some words by herself.

[...]",5.0
Daughter loves these to read at night. Nice led light . Battery lasts awhile.,5.0
"I started clipping this on my binder, and I jump on a couch while I study. It's extremely convenient and feels like i'm using an ottlight except tiny and only big enough to cover my binder. Now I don't have to hunch over a desk, instead i can lean back while I get my work done. :)

I'm really happy with it, it's the bees knees.",5.0
"Almost too bright xD I put masking tape over the light so it wouldn't wake my roommate. Definitely gets the job done.

Still running after over a year.",5.0
"Great, I'll be getting another one.",5.0
This works so well that I have actually purchased it for friends.  The flexible stem works beautifully and the light seems to last much longer than any other book light I've had in the past.,5.0
"I've fallen asleep multiple times with this little light on (leaving it on all night long) and the battery is still going strong. Great light, pretty powerful but not overbearing. I like that it has two intensity options. I haven't had it for long but so far it's worked like a charm.",5.0
very functional and reliable,5.0
"Awesome light. We have been using it for 6 months. We have dropped it a few times and no issues, very bright.",5.0
Simple and effective.  Have not had device long enough to comment on battery life.,5.0
"This little light of mine... It's wonderful, exactly what I needed for reading in bed. It clips to the book nice. But what I do is stack pillows behind me and I clip it to the bunched up material on one of the pillows and the light shines over my shoulder. I store it by clipping it to my curtain right behind the headboard. It could also be used while clipped to the curtains, the 2 brightness settings are good as well. Very happy with this product and would by again, in fact I am going to buy one as a gift for my mom who loves to read in bed!",5.0
"Great, soft white light.  It's perfect for what i needed, which was a light in a recording booth with limited light in there",5.0
This is the third of these book lights that I've purchased. Everyone that I give them to loves them and say that they are really bright on the page without being intrusive to people next to them.,5.0
"What an amazing little device!  I am legally blind and was having a hard time reading LP words from my LP Hymn Book in a simi dark chapel.  I saw this and read some of the reviews and found that it is true that this wonderful lighting does indeed light up my whole book, about 8 1/2 x 11 size page.  Now I can sing a lot better while following the words.  Also, a real plus, this is so helpful when I do my counted cross stitching, yes I can do this very well.  I've been told that I am amazing.  This device is everything that was mentioned in the description.  I bought two!  Thank you to whoever came up with the device, bless you!",5.0
Excellent book light i used it nightly and it has 2 different brightness settings.,5.0
Easy to use. Great design. Very bright. No problems at all. I've already started recommending to others! Attaches easily to any book and stays in place. Plus my favorite color purple!,5.0
Does the job,5.0
Nice light. Works great and it came with batteries.,5.0
"This little guy is just what I needed for my late night reading. My light switch is ALL the way on the other side of my room and once I get all cozy in bed I do not want to get up and turn the light on and off.

The light clamps onto any thing you want it to or you can clamp it to your book. The light has 3 modes: on bright, on less bright, and off. Simply uses a AA battery and is not super distracting for other people that may be trying to sleep in the same room. The light is very portable and light weight. A great tool for any avid reader!",5.0
"I bought this to clip to my newborns diaper changing station so I could change her diaper in the middle of the night without turning on the lights. This gave me enough light to see but not overly bright, worked perfect for what I needed",5.0
great for late night studying or for homework with out having all the lights on and disturbing other people in the room. good quality solid. have had for about 4 months every thing is still working great.,5.0
"I HAVE 4 OF THESE, IN MY PURSE, IN MY CAR, IN MY BRIEFCASE AND BY MY BED",5.0
Been using these for years worth rechargeable batteries. Work great and have a long battery life.,5.0
This is our 2nd one. First one still works great that we bought 5 years ago!,5.0
Great for reading at night in bed with focused light. It's saving my eyes!,5.0
love it. works well.,5.0
This was a gift for my avid reader child. It is a great book light. Far better than the book lights when I was a kid!! It bright enough to illuminate the entire book but does not hurt the eyes in a dim/dark room. It has two settings depending on how much light you need. It clips on easily and the flexible head is easily adjusted.,5.0
Great for what I use it for - a light for my laptop and a reading light in a bedroom.,5.0
Bright and kind of Bright setting. Wish it was a little dimmer but eye adjust quick. Have been using for an hour-three hours every night and still on original battery (3 months).,5.0
"Works great, does it's job. Bright light, comes with battery, the clip is strong.",5.0
Super bright on highest setting. Goose neck is also very functional. Use on low setting to conserve battery,5.0
I would definitely purchase this product again.,5.0
"Wow, what an improvement over the one I had, and it takes regular batteries. Really make my evening reading a pleasure.",5.0
My husband loves to read in bed and he doesn't have a nightstand for a lamp. So I was looking for something portable but effective for him to read in bed still while I can catch some Zzzs. This thing does an excellent job and the clip is good for holding the pages. There are two light intensity settings and the lowest setting is enough. He's happy with it.,5.0
"Good quality, nice light, especially having option for high/low light. Strong clip. Can be used for reading a book or speaking at a podium.",5.0
Bought two of these for my nephews. Light is bright and works great. They love it!,5.0
"Is perfecting for my private reading time. It covers the whole page and is bright!  It's not too top-heavy, but is sturdy.",5.0
bought this for my husband and he liked it so much I bought one for me - and then bought two more!  Comes with batteries but my husband has used his so much he already had to replace the batteries.,5.0
my second light.  my friends love it.,5.0
Nice light. My kid loves it.,5.0
"Great Product. I have had one like this for over ten years.  Finally decided another one would be handy.  :-)  The booklight is flexible, but not ""floppy""  You set the light to the angle you want, and it stays at that angle!",5.0
"Bought this for my kiddo- perfect fit.
My 9 year old likes to read.  The first reading light I bought didn't have a timer or auto-off, which meant we burned through a battery's charge pretty quickly.  This unit has an elongated oval button.  One side works like a traditional on/off and the other side of the button is for the timer.  Each click of the timer side adds 15 minutes of light, up to 4 clicks for an hour.  Each click is shown as a small red led light on the top of the light.  Works like a charm and has been relatively durable.  My kid has knocked this light from the top of his loft multiple times.  The only noticeable effect has been the clear plastic cover popping off.
This was the reading light I wish I had purchased this first time.  I bought the silver one, which is much much cheaper than the other color options available.

"Bought this for my husband who a) loves to read at 3 am when he wakes up stressed about work yet knows he can't turn the light on, and b) he's on an LED kick lately, so all new lights must be powered by LED bulbs.
Clearly, a win-win for him and for me. The adjustable capability allows him to switch to a lower output (nice for me), and it's small, lightweight, and the clamp-on system works perfectly.",5.0
"So far so good with this little light.  I love to read in bed at night, but it's difficult to do that when my husband just wants to sleep!  This little light is plenty bright, and I can aim the light right where I want it, so it doesn't light up the entire room.  It was shipped with batteries, so it was nice that I didn't have to search for them before use.  The only (slight) complaint I have is the bulkiness of the 'clip' end.  It's a little large / heavy, but given that this is battery-powered, I don't know how else it could be designed to be smaller.  Love this little light!",5.0
Used by our grandchildren nightly. Nice to have the charging cord with it so don't have to keep putting new batteries into it.,5.0
The Mighty Bright is great!!,5.0
I have used this with both hardback and paperback books and it works great. Batteries last a long time too.,5.0
Very bright!! Love it! Great color and price.,5.0
"it clips on to most anything and holds light in place. It is very adjustable. I really love it for late night crocheting and needlepointing. I am confined to bed and have poor vision. Not only can I see even dark colors when I loop in my crochet, the bright light shines on my work and not in my eyes and does not disturb my husband who sleeps in another bed next to mine. I am in a hospital bed. (in our home)",5.0
Excellent little book light.  It provides lighting that covers both pages of a standard hard cover book without having to move the light.  It's bright and works better than expected. Now I can read into the wee hours without disturbing my husband.,5.0
"I bought this for my boyfriend as I work early in the mornings, and he likes to read while I'm falling asleep. He absolutely loves it!! It has definitely transformed our night time routine, and I can say with confidence that this is a high quality product.",5.0
Super awesome. It is bright enough for my bible reading in the dark when my baby is in sleep. It is very flexible to adjust the position of light and makes very easy to focus on the page.,5.0
Best book light I've found! Lights up both pages at one time. Very bright and easily clips onto the book without adding much bulk. Highly recommend!,5.0
It has taken a lot of abuse from children and has not broken!! The batteries have lasted a long time even though the kids have left it on overnight several times. The brightness settings are good too.,5.0
"Bought a couple of these and they've all been great. The light is focused enough so you're not keeping everyone awake, but broad enough so there aren't dark spots on the pages. Sturdy feeling too.",5.0
Love this light. Two settings for brightness. Strong clip on and bendable . Battery usage lasts awhile. Good price . Happy with purchase,5.0
"Just what I was looking for! Two levels of brightness, LED, clip on, flexible. Perfect!",5.0
Pure awesomeness!,5.0
"Best reading light I have had so far. The flexibility and dual light options really shine the light exactly where needed for my night time reading. Bit pricey, but has been worth it to me. In fact ordered a second one for another family member!",5.0
Just as expected.,5.0
"Wonderful little light. I only wish it was a warmer shade rather than so cool, but it's to be expected with LED.",5.0
this thing is a lifesaver. works great and very bright,5.0
Works perfectly at night! Really bright!,5.0
perfect for reading kiddos bedtime stories,5.0
"It's great.  I've had it for several months now.  Batteries last a long time in it; I haven't had to replace them yet.  It's very bright, even on the lower setting, but as long as I keep it close to my book, it doesn't bother others trying to sleep.",5.0
this is my second one. Had one I purchased about 7 years ago and the clip finally broke. The best book light,5.0
My 9 year old son loves to use this when reading at night.,5.0
My daughter loves this! This is a perfect little light for all of her books.,5.0
"I have been using this light for a while now and whenever I use it to read in the dark, it's sturdy and bright.",5.0
perfect for reading in bed in the dark.,5.0
It works well it's bright and it does what it's supposed to. Hate buying batteries though.,5.0
Worked great for a reading light in our RV,5.0
Just what I expected!  My daughter loved the purple color!,5.0
bright light. little difference between the settings.,5.0
I already had one for some time.  My wife tried it recently and wanted one like it.,5.0
"After 2 years of use, no need to change battery yet.  Used for long road trips for my little girl and myself.  Sturdy, well made and worth every cent.  I like the 2 settings and it's not too heavy.",5.0
"I got this for my 7 year old who loves reading in bed. He uses his overhead light & nightstand but still does not have sufficient lighting. This uses LED lights, came with batteries & provides him with the lighting he needs. It casts over both pages of his book evenly. He can attach it to his head board or the book he's reading (it's notably much easier with hard cover books). Overall this is a great light, now I'll have to buy one for myself!",5.0
Wife loves to read in bed and this works great.,5.0
Just what I needed for reading in bed at night!,5.0
"Perfect little book light, for my purposes anyway.  I love the way it has two light levels and covers both pages of an open book.  The clip works easily, even on paperbacks although I recommend using a clipboard to hold soft paperbacks.  With a hardcover you can just clip it to the back cover.  I have had other book lights but this is my favorite so far.",5.0
"I bought this for 3 1/2 year old son and it works perfectly! It provides sufficient light so that he can comfortably read before falling asleep (he had previously been using a flashlight!) and I love that it has an automatic adjustable timer on it so when the light goes off, my son knows it's time to put his book down and go to sleep. It clips securely to his head board so that it's out of the way and he never has to touch it but the bendable neck allows me to position it as needed so the light shines down perfectly on his book.",5.0
"I've been using this for nearly 2 years for paperback, hardcover, and Kindle classic (unlit) reading almost every single day. I also use it for extra light while I am crocheting. It has not let me down once.
The most common reasons I've been disappointed with other book lights I've used: The LEDs die way too early, the batteries die too quickly, and usually, the neck isn't bendy enough for the perfect fit (or it just breaks from being moved too often). This hasn't had any of those problems.

- Bright, with two brightness level options
- Light is enough for a large book

- Can sit free-standing on a flat surface without being clipped
- Neck is super adjustable, doesn't lose flexibility over time
- Neck is relatively long
- Can open clip pretty wide for large books and tables/desks/etc
- Clip is padded so it won't damage anything
- Relatively lightweight (batteries are heaviest part)

- Battery life is good, better than most
- Can buy an optional AC adapter for it to use without batteries!

- Long-lasting quality, at least for the two years I've been using it so far... I'll update when something finally goes wrong ;)

- Overall, really happy with it and I recommend the brand to anyone who asks.",5.0
At least there are 2 different light settings.,5.0
Super versatile and convenient. Purchased for a road trip for my toddler to see his toys and not have to worry about using the car light and now he uses it as a nightlight.,5.0
"Works great.  Has two settings, one brighter than the other.  I use it on my treadmill since I workout in the dark before everyone gets up.",5.0
"Just what I needed for a book light.  I tend to wind down at night reading OLD books that I don't want to clip something onto and weaken the binding, and this one will clip onto my bed covers, and the flexible neck lets me just point it at my book like a little lamp.  While the blue casing lights up, it isn't enough to be annoying or distracting.  I've been through several books with it, and haven't had to replace the batteries yet either.",5.0
Excellent!,5.0
"Love this thing, I stay up late reading all the time now and can get much more done when I need to cram for homework assignments. The double settings make sure that I don't hurt my eyes with overbrightness, or wake my sleeping wife next to me. And at other times the brighter setting helps when I need that much more light for the specific book that doesn't have the whitest of pages. Its battery life seems to last really well and not suck through batteries which is great.",5.0
Adjustable brightness and flexible cord,5.0
Works excellently!,5.0
"works pretty good, it is quite bright but did not disturb my wife's sleep",5.0
Use it with my older unlighted Nook when reading in dim light.,5.0
great product and the light is nice and bright.,5.0
"This is absolutely perfect for my needs, although not what it was made for. I have a table top drill press in my garage, it doesn't have a light. It seems I do a lot of drilling after I get home at night. That or the lighting in my garage is not bright enough so I can see well enough. I'm tired of strapping on a headlamp to drill. I saw this and it was a no brainer. I just clipped it onto my drill press and problem solved. Plenty bright enough for what I do. The flex wire is extremely flexible and moves wherever I put it. I couldn't be happier.",5.0

I've loved these clip on lights forever. Such a simple and easy way to read in virtually any lighting situation,5.0

Works great!  Good price too!,5.0
"Perfect for reading after my husband has gone to sleep. I also bought one for my mom, and she loves using it as a small-area light once she's in bed and doesn't want to get up to turn off a light at night.",5.0
This light is fantastic! I use it on my textbooks and it's been a tremendous help. I was constantly struggling to get the right amount of lighting and now I no longer need to have several desk lamps on. The room light plus this work perfectly.,5.0
"I love that there are a few brightness options, works wonderfully and is the perfect tool for travel, or just reading in my chair at home. Great purchase.",5.0
"My wife said it was one of the best presents I have ever given her. It gives off tons of light, and you can click again for only one LED on. It is a lot lighter than expected too. Thanks Mighty Bright for making my wife happy.",5.0

Bought  3 for Christmas gifts.  Light so fantastic purchased another 1 for myself,5.0
"At a ""certain"" age, it is hard reading finer print (or even regular print).  This book light works like a charm--easily clips to a book and the flexible arm allows me to angle the extra bright LED lights where I need them.  I highly recommend!",5.0
Works really well and gives plenty of light. My wife doesn't keep me up at night anymore.,5.0
"Nice bright light. Wide enough for a book, doesn't disturb anyone else close by.

This little lamp is excellent!!! Perfect for reading while your partner is falling asleep.,5.0
Works fantastically for nighttime reading!  Highly recommend,5.0
"Lights up just like its supposed to.  Pretty durable so far after being man-handled by both elder and tiny human.  Decently drool-proof, but don't want to press that too far, luckily it snaps out of reach.  =~D",5.0
Love this little book light.  It has two settings - one bright and one a little dimmer.  Totally enjoy using it!,5.0
I use this all the time on my music stand. Bright as hell and runs on 3xAAAs. Chews through batteries particularly if you're an idiot that leave it on overnight once a week.,5.0
Love this light. Has a large clamp that holds on to books and stays there. I use this thing all the time. Probably will but another here soon.,5.0
Awesome little book light. Super bright for such a tiny light. Adjustable brightness is a great feature because this is a very bright light.,5.0
Works great.  Batteries last a long time!,5.0
I bought this for my grandmother. She reads over 65 books a year. The light works pretty well.  She seems to like it.,5.0
This is a great little portable light for reading in bed or a place you can't plug in a lamp. It has two brightness settings - bright and brighter and a strong sturdy clamp.,5.0

Works great,5.0
"(And the price keeps dropping! Other colors are cheaper here on Amazon, take a look!)  How can I say it.... I've fallen in love with a tiny spark of LED brightness! My Mighty Bright has kept me company for several hours a week during the dark, chilly winter, while I wait in the van for my kid's after-school activities to be done. I use it for reading and drawing (haven't tried hand-stitching yet but I'm sure it will work for that, too). For reading, I don't clip it on the book itself but instead onto the cup holder, then straighten the neck up to full height and bend the light over the book. That way I can turn the pages, set the book down, eat, drink, move around, use my cellphone, all without having to mess with the light. For drawing, I use a clipboard anyway so my Mighty Bright grabs the clipboard edge nicely, like it was made to do that. The first time I tried it and I saw how well it lit up the whole surface of a 9x12 inch pad, I almost cried! It's a cinch to reposition, providing near-infinite flexibility for every possible angle. The gooseneck is thin yet quite sturdy, well-attached to the base and the head, with a smooth metallic feel. I wasn't sure a single brightness setting was going to work for me, so I was delighted when the LEDs turned out to have the perfect hue /tone and perfect brightness for my tasks. Having won my heart with its awesome performance, my Mighty Bright stays in the van in its own special place in the overhead console, safe from being yanked on, smashed, twisted, stomped or tangled up in backpacks and headphone cords.

But here, in my opinion, is the main reason I wanted to write this review, and to me, the real test of whether a book light is a good investment:  Once it's set up and I get started drawing, or I get into my book, I forget all about the light itself. The Mighty Bright becomes unnoticeable; it blends into the background, doing its job in the most unobtrusive, intuitive, and efficient manner of any device I've ever owned. So far no battery change has been needed and I've used it 10+ hours. I am ravishingly happy with this little thing and intend to use mine forever and give them as gifts. They are *that* good.",5.0
Use to read research articles after hubby goes to sleep. Works great. Stays in place,5.0
Very nice quality. Like that it has two settings .,5.0
Great little night light. I use it all the time. Not just for reading but to illuminate the bedroom in the evening without disturbing others. It is so light and portable that I can carry it as I walk from with me from room to room if I need to without turning on overhead lights.  Highly recommended. Thank you.,5.0
"This light does everything I had hoped plus....
sturdy base....excellent light expanse...actually uses regular AAA batteries...holds in place yet flexes easily...
This model is definitely worth considering if you are in the market for a book light",5.0
Good light,5.0
Very cute and compact. This is the 2nd one of these I bought. I keep one in the car for my daughter to use when she wants to color and it's dark. The other I keep by my nightstand when I want to read at night. Love this little light.,5.0

Very happy with purchase,5.0
"Compact......good lighting....easy to use.  I can now read at night in bed w/o bothering my spouse.  Convenient.......batteries comes with unit.
The neck is also very flexible and clip will secure even on a magazine.  Light is very good and will illuminate an entire book, magazine, or Ipad.",5.0
Super bright yet the light is directed in such a way as to not disturb the person next to you!  Perfect!,5.0

Use it quite ofter and batteries seem to last forever.  A bit of a harsh light. Would buy it again.,5.0
"I bought three of these in blue (a spare for me and one for my brother) after thoroughly reading all of the comments on competitive brands. I found the comments praising this model to be right on the mark. When I read it lit up both pages at the same time using dual lights where all other brands required constant repositioning for each page, that was all I needed to know this was the best reading light for me.

I can't say enough nice things about this product. It has dual lights on a flex shaft which you can position to fully illuminate both pages of a large hardback book. You won't need to keep moving the light around to light your pages with this one and the pages ar well lit for easy reading in the dark. But the light is centralized on the book and not the surrounding area so others can sleep while you read.

You can also switch from dual lights to a single light. The flexible shaft on the light is sturdy and stable enough to firmly hold its position over the book even while you move around and turn pages. You can either clip it on the cover or use the clip to hold open the pages. It operates on AAA batteries. The higher quality battery, the longer it lasts. I use the Duracell ultra digital batteries with the blue band.

I cannot think of any negatives about this product. I'm not associated with any seller. I am just a customer who was happy to find a great product. Definitely a good buy.",5.0
Got this to replace an old broken book light.  Have had it for several months and after heavy usage am just now replacing the batteries.  For light readers I would expect the batteries to last even longer.,5.0
"This is my second mighty bright, as I broke the first one. Have had several book lights, as I read alot after my hubby goes to sleep, and this has worked the best as far as illuminating pages and not disturbing the hubster.",5.0
These lights are great.,5.0
Purchased this book light for my daughter and she loves it ! This book light is bright but is easy on your eyes. You can click it on your book  If you're sitting at a table or desk you can stand it alone like a miniature desk lamp it projects the right amount of reading light .,5.0
worked great and clips easily on hard cover or paperback books,5.0
I love this item.  My previous book light did not emit as much light as this one.  I also like the two levels of lighting.,5.0
"This is a great little book light. Plenty bright, with the option of two different levels of brightness. The snake-like cord makes it easy to read even lying down in bed. It's perfect for my 7-year-old who likes to read in bed. She can even clip it onto her teddy bear's hand and adjust it to read her book. Love this book light!",5.0
I like that it has two brightness settings. Good quality.,5.0
Awesome book light. Wife uses it on the regular. It came with batteries and has variable settings. The dim setting is perfect for night reading and it has a nice long flexible arm. The clip distributes the pressure nicely without clipping too hard on the book. It's honestly awesome.,5.0
"Very good book light. I enjoy that with it's size and flexibility, it often doubles as a convenient flashlight around our room as well. Will purchase again.",5.0
"These are great! Two brightness settings that are just right. The clamp is strong so the light stays put on your book. The neck is sturdy but flexible, and easy to adjust. We bought these for our kids, and I'm going to get myself one now! Best book light I've ever used!",5.0
"Love this book light, I use it all the time. It is lightweight and easily clips to any book or magazine.",5.0
Love these things and have them in almost every room in our house. Perfect for road trips or when my husband is trying to sleep and I am still reading or working on homework in bed.,5.0
Great for nighttime reading,5.0
Lights up the pages nicely. I think I'll order another for my niece.,5.0
"Great light, every member in my family ended up getting one after seeing mine",5.0
"My father loves to read at night and this was exactly what he needed to be able to continue reading late at night without disturbing my mother, therefore making it the perfect gift!",5.0
"Does the job - and without any other lights on, using this makes you feel sort of like you're camping in a tent with a flashlight!  Sturdily made, and the clip hangs on to books just great.  As long as you treat it with relative care and don't step on it, it should last a good long time.

Just wish that the light was warm rather than the cold/blueish LED stuff.",5.0
"LOVE! I bought 2 of these lights for my daughter's to use at night while reading in bed. These little Mighty Brights throw off plenty of light to read by. I could see this being useful on an airplane or a long train/bus ride. It's small enough to slip into a book bag/back pack. My kids have been using them for about 6 months (off and on) and I still haven't needed to change the battery (I actually don't know how many batteries this takes. lol)
I gave these lights to my kids at Christmas. I think they are a great gift idea to any avid reader!",5.0
"after reading the reviews for this sander i bought one and have a few comments. first the good, it's quiet and easy on the hands, that's all. the bad is the pad is so soft that sanding out saw marks, planer nicks ect. is about impossible, the pad is for sheet paper or psa paper, be aware that if you use psa paper like i do if you are not really careful the covering on the pad will tear and you will be buying a new pad. i also bought porter cable psa paper for this sander, it's ok but if you are going to radius a square edge the paper just rips and is useless, and forget about sanding the edge of a board, the pad is so soft you will not have a square edge when you are done. i talked to porter cable about this and there is no hard pad for this sander. if you want a sander for sanding between coats of varnish on a flat surface this may be your sander, otherwise if you plan on sanding the edges of that new dovetail box you made, forget it. i am going to try to make my own pad and if that is not possible i am going to sell it at the next garage sale. i've been a woodworker for 40 years and will be using my old dewalt random orbit with a hard pad and psa paper until i can find something better.",1.0
"This is one of the best guides I have owned. Perhaps its unfair giving this low a rating; but, I would never use it without the router it fits on. I do a lot of normal and advanced router work. When I saw this jig and envisioned easy adjustments I ordered it right away.

I never use it.

I have several Porter-Cable routers that this guide will fit. The problem is that it mounts with the handles in the wrong orientation to the way you work. It is the routers problem.
With the guide mounted on the router the handle orientation is wrong (at least to my way of working). I have other routers and guides which present the handles in the way I usually hold them while working. I think Proter-Cable made a major design flaw which they never addressed. Beware.",1.0
Won't even go through 1/4 ply without burning.  The only thing it's good for is masonite and honestly the blade that came with the saw does just as good of a job.,1.0

".
PROS.
1.  Liked the speed settings.
2.  When it ran, it ran very quietly, very low noise.
3.  Makes a great $214 paperweight, just be sure to dust it  every so often, since it tends to gathers dust. Cons: l.  Difficult to make height adjustments.  2.  On/Off Switches make it difficult to turn on and off.  Plunge mechanism slips and is awkward to use. Makes a great paperweight.",1.0
"This router is a piece of [poor workmanship].  You can take my word for it or waste your money.  First off, the brake stopped working almost immediately.  The clear plastic chip deflector does not fit and is worthless.  The depth rod locking knob stripped rendering the depth rod useless.  The micro plunge locking mechanism does not stay disingaged making it a major hassle to use micro plunge adjustment knob.  Also, it is very difficult turning the micro plunge knob to raise the router - It takes quite a bit of muscle.  When plunging, the router has a lot of play.  A small amount is understandable, but this router has way too much play.  The plunge itself is not smooth - Its jerky making it difficult to make smooth plunges.  And if you can put up with all of these problems, there is the problem of power.  This router simply keeps bogging down and at times will completely stop.  I can not use this router any more.  It has ruined my last project and unless I can get it fixed under warranty, I will have to buy a new one.  I own a lot of tools and this router is by far the worst investment I have ever made.  Take my advise and stay away.  Buy the Dewalt, Makita, or Bosch.  The Dewalt 621 in particular is a very fine router.  If still want to buy this router, I would be happy to sell you mine real cheap.",1.0
"This is the worst tool that I have used from Porter Cable.  I have tried to fix a depth and it would not stay where I wanted the depth of cut.  This is really a problem when using your Leigh Dovetail Jig or a router table.  There are two mistakes in the users manual that I told Porter Cable reps about a year ago and they are still there when I called them about two weeks ago.
I only have one good thing to say about this router it is very quiet.",1.0
"This is a very heavy constructed piece of equipment. It feels good in your hand,although it feels twice as heavy as my Bosch,which means that you don't have to apply any pressure to sand as the weight of the machine does a good job of that. The vibration is substantially less than my Bosch,but it gets so hot that you can only use it a few minutes before you have to let it cool down for 20 minutes. I tried to use it longer, thinking that it would reach a peak and I could bear that,but that is not the case ,it just keeps getting hotter and hotter and hotter. It would be good for frying eggs,and making coffee.",1.0
I used the flashlight 3 times. The bulb burn out and the replacement also fail. I smell burning material . should I contact dewalk for replacement,1.0
"This kit came with seven different sized guides and two threaded rings to attach the guides to the router's base plate. The guides seem to be sized correctly but the general quality of the guides is rather poor. The pieces are advertised as ""MACHINED"", but are obviously NOT machined as the threads on all the pieces are showing signs of either casting or stamping. While the locking nuts DID thread onto each guide easily, it was discerning to see something with PORTER CABLE'S name on it with such obvious flaws. (...)",1.0
"I purchased this product, specifically, to use with the Leigh D4 Dovetail Jig because I wanted to use half-inch router bits to cut the pins and tails in a through-dovetail operation.  When doing this the end of the board to be routed rests at a 90-degree angle against the underside of the dovetail jig.  What I discovered is that the templete guides are too long for this operation -- they descend lower than the dovetail jig fingers.  Of course, the board can be lowered to accomodate for the difference, but then there is no support for the finger assembly, resulting in unevenly-cut dovetails.  This set of template guides is not the answer if you are looking to route dovetails using the Leigh D4 Dovetail Jig.  You will want to find template guides that complement the jig without having to make unneeded adjustments.
This is in no way meant to criticize this product for normal routing operations.  Again, I purchased this product for a very specific task and subsequently found that it was not the right tool for that task.",1.0
"Router seemed to have problems out of the box maintaining speed. I would describe it as hunting for the proper RPM. Being as this is my first router which has a load sensing feature, I wasn't sure what to expect. I am not impressed. I wound up setting the variable speed faster than the bit recommended to finish the project. It has now degraded to no variable function, no load sensing, and slow to start. This router has less than 1 running hour on it. I will update how Porter Cable intends to handle this warranty item.
Update: I shipped the router to an authorized service center on my own dime. They replaced the speed controller and it worked fine for another hour or so of light operation. It has failed again. My one star review remains.",1.0

"I just have no idea what all the rave is about.  This has been one of the worst tool purchases I've ever made...

First off - I like P/C tools.  I've got 4 routers, dovetail jig, 2 pneumatic nailers, 2 sanders, etc. and am happy with all.  I wanted a small, lightweight, precision circ saw for clean x-cutting cabinet sheet goods.  I'm using the Freud thin kerf blade...

Pros:  nice light weight, and feels really well-balanced.  You could wield this all day.  Sightlines are OK.  Quieter than a full-size circ saw.  Minimal torque at trigger startup (helps to keep blade from moving uncontrollably when starting saw from mid-cut)...

Cons:  extremely under-powered - even with a new Freud blade, it takes a good 30+ sec or so to cross cut a 3/4"" sheet of plywood.  Go too fast and you can stop the blade.  This is the kind of torque you get from worm-drive?  Also, the base is nearly worthless - absolute piece of crap.  Bent steel that can be easily warped with moderate hand pressure.  2x6 tipped over and fell onto the saw - bent the base virtually beyond repair.  Was never flat.  Bevel adjustment is virtually impossible to set precisely.  Arbor was not perpendicular to the guide edge.  And, NO aftermarket upgrades are available...

I wish somebody would make a trim saw that was truly rugged AND precise.  The 314 DEFINITELY doesn't fit the bill.  I've owned it for 2 years now, using it occasionally for light remodeling and furniture construction and have been very disappointed.  I would not recommend this tool - especially for jobsite conditions...",1.0
"I don't know who is reviewing this saw but I make my living with these tools and I purchased 2 of these based on Porter Cables reputation to replace my Makita trim saws. I live in New Jersey and these saws are filled with gear oil which in the winter means unless you heat them up, they burn themselves up trying to turn the gear oil in the cold weather. After I realized this I put light weight oil in the other one which helped but it still burnt up with a fine cut high tooth count blade due to low motor power. I don't need a trim saw to turn a rough cut rip blade, I need it to turn a trim blade which this one does not! 2 burnt up saws = bad review!",1.0

"As soon as the Model 314 trim saw arrived, I went through the short-on-information manual, and looked the tool over.

When I tried to set the depth of cut to less than 3/4"", the inner guard contacted the blade.

I went over the manual again and again (I even read the Spanish and German!), but could not figure out a way to make this contraption work.

The guard is riveted to the bed of the saw, and therefore must move with the bed.

Since the radius of the guard  matches the radius of the blade, it stands to reason that when the depth of cut is adjusted, the alignment of the axes of the blade and the guard will change and at some point the blade will contact the guard.

Is this a recent modification, or has this saw always been ill-conceived?

Porter-Cable isn't saying.

They told me to take it to one of their service centers. Not bloody likely.

Amazon came through by making it easy to return this unused tool.",1.0
"I have 35 routers. I owned and regulary used 7 Porter Cable routers, including 3ea. 7518s. All of the Porter Cable routers created a chattered result. The collet run-out vibration sometimes caused bits to loosen in the collet while routing. The motor arbors were fine, but all 7ea. 1/2"" collets averaged .007"" run-out at the top of a 1 1/2 double flutted bit. The bit was turned 180 dgrees and the collets retested at 180 dregrees, but the run-out remained the same. The worst had .015"" run-out, so it was thown out. It's a shame the collets were so short and gripped bits so poorly. I'll be replacing them all.",1.0
"The dust collection doesn't work. Take the side cover off and see for yuorself, Porter Cable blocked the rear dust collection port with a strip of metal. They put the port onthe top which is useless. Remove the strip and the fanand use a vacuum or buy a different sander.",1.0
"I have a cabinet shop with 17 employees. This belt sanders quality has gone down to near 0, much like most of Porter Cable's tools have over the past few years. We once used mostly Porter Cable portable tools in the shop, and they lasted well and worked well, I think I even have a couple old Rockwell sanders in the shop that still work (before Porter Cable took them over many years ago) . I could not really guess how many 360 sanders I have bought over the years, but NO MORE, there quality is just gone and they don't last anymore. We went to Bosch sanders quite a few years ago, and they were a very well built sander that was balanced similar to Porter Cable, but they quit making them a few years ago for some reason, so now its Makita or Porter Cable only it seems for a 3x24 sander. Makita seem to last well and work well, but after using porter Cable and Bosch it seems the balance is different, and takes awhile to get used to them, but they are a far better sander than Porter Cable.

first of this thing is all Plastic!!! second thing is balnce is weird and hard to get used to  but the saw hook is a plus the main reason i rated this saw bad was it got droped off a plank that was no higher than five feet and craked in two and it wasn't even a week old so i geuss i will stay with a mag for now one star for the hook,1.0
"i bought this saw because dewalt rep. came by the job site and showed it to my crew . i liked the facted that it was light it had built on skyhook it beveled up to 50 deg.i liked that it had more power than the skil.it felt different than the skil but i got used to it.my first week using it i found out that with rip fence that cost more than the skil rip fence , you could not use it while you were in bevel more than 18 deg. the knob for rip fence was to big and bulky and was on left side of table .skil is on the right side of table and you can max 45 deg bevel with fence .the saw was so powerful the gears could not take it and failed under warranty so i had it fixed and it failed again rather than keep making trips back to get it repaired i dumped it in trash i bought it for second saw so i still had my model 77 skil and bought a mag for second saw i do own a lot of dewalt tools but i will not buy the dw 378g again if they fixed the problems with it they will have to give me one before i would use it again",1.0

I have since purchased the new Hitachi 12"" and the difference is incredible.  I really thought the Hitachi would be similar to the Dewalt since they both are 12"" models, but I wanted to try it out anyway.

"I purchased this saw expecting it to replace my radial arm saw.  I discovered a manufacturing defect after using the saw.  The sliding rails are not aligned with the saw blade.  Whenever, I used the slide feature for boards wider than 4"", I'd get chipout and/or burned edges on the wood. I reported the problem to DeWAlt and they suggested that I take the saw to one of their authorized repair centers for evaluation.  After 3 weeks and 3 trips to the repair center they decided there was no way to adjust for this problem.  The manager said he would recomend to DeWalt that it was a manufacturing defect because the yoke was machined inproperly and see if they would pay to repair the defect.  Guess what?  Not a word from the repair center or from DeWalt.  I'll never again buy anything with the DeWalt name on it and if you are considering this saw look further. If you are gong to use this saw for anythig other than cutting 2x4 for home construction you won't be happy with this saw.",1.0
Amzn shipping took way too long for me to give this product a positive review- I recommend purchasing elsewhere.  Many eBay sites ship same-day.,1.0
"My rating is a resounding thumbs down.

The first problem is the power on-off button is reversed. My router operates with the power button on the off position.  This machine obviously never went though a quality inspection at the factory.

The second problem is the router continually locks the bits in the collet.  I tried every lubricant imaginable without success.  Once the bit is locked in, plan on keeping it in place for a while, a very long while.  I have been forced to use pliers to pry the bits out. The freezing complaint is repeated numerous times by other users.  I incorrectly assumed Porter Cable (PC) would have resolved this by the time of my purchase.

I must be missing something here.  For the $160 price the PC 310 cost, you can buy the PC 690LR ($125) with more power and still get some router bits for less.  The PC 310 is a dinosaur doomed to extinction.  We can only hope PC either re-engineers this product or stops production before it further tarnishes its reputation.",1.0
"I see a lot of reviews that owners are bragging because they are trying to justify the price they just paid for this saw.  In terms of overall value (actual benefits and quality versus price) I give it a 1.
I have been a DeWalt fan for a long time but their motto ""Own the User"" isn't backed up by this tool or their poor customer service.
Read the reviews and look at the problems, they are for real.
1. Highest price with fewest accessories. C'mon, DeWalt, even your cheaper saws have an extension. Stops and hold downs would be nice (cheaper that the other tools that you throw in for promos).
2. Base quality issues.  I have read complaints about the base not being flat.  I haven't checked mine yet for flatness, but I can believe it.  Mine had so much casting slag that needed to be trimmed that I believe the other reports of base problems.  It took an hour with a die grinder to trim all of the burrs on the casting.  For $600 you'd figure that DeWalt would hire someone on the line to deburr their products.
3. Tool quality is the most important issue when purchasing items of this price.  Second comes customer service.  Read the reviews, DeWalt's customer service does not back up their motto ""Own the User"".  Their customer service is just flat poor!  They put the wrong blade on the saw and won't exchange it.  They had a promo and won't back it up.  All big tools have pluses and minuses but customer service can overcome some of the problems and really let a company shine.  DeWalt, you missed the boat on this one!
For a company that spends so much on brand image advertising, they drop you like a hot potato after you purchased their tool.  I plan on returning this saw and getting the Makita.  It's the same price, customer service seems to be better, and they have a great promo going on now (Buy the saw - get a cordless impact.  Also, enter the sweepstakes for a new truck).
While it looks nice, I will be putting less yellow and black in the shop.",1.0
The shipping was as much or more than the product. I ordered it with other dewalt products but it is shipped from a seperaye company,1.0
I couldn't get the saw to cut square.  If I got a 45 degree on the right to cut it would be off on the left.  I couldn't fine tune it because it would fall into the postive stops and not allow me to adjust a quarter degree one way or another.  There were some good things but I had to take it back because after several hours of adjusting it didn't suit me.  Due to DeWalt's excellent return policy it was no problem to take it back after 3 weeks.,1.0

"Like so many others, I went with this Dewalt light because it uses the same 18v battery as my other cordless tools. Like so many others, I am very disappointed with these lights. I also own the DW908 and hate that thing too because you can never get the beam aimed where you want it. My buddy sprayed brake cleaner on that one to clean it off and the cheap plastic fused the power switch to the casing so it's toast. The DW919 is a whole other mess of poor design and even poorer usability. The head is too heavy for the flexible neck so its always toppling over or moving out of position. You have to constantly move the head back and forth to position the beam. The beam is very weak and dim even on a fully charged battery. After it moved for the hundredth time while working on a brake job, I threw it out of the way and the flexible neck broke where it attaches to the head. Good riddance to this piece of junk. I love my other Dewalt tools but I'm going with another brand for my work lighting.",1.0
"I am a big Dewalt fan - I must have a dozen or more battery powered tools (drills, circular saw and reciprocating saw) as well as several plug in tools (grinder and plate joiner) and like them very much.

In the first place, the light it produces is very poor, particularly considering the fact that it runs on 18v.  It uses and old fashioned incandescent bulb.  Second, it won't shine up from the floor or from any other useable position except straight ahead when resting on a flat surface.  The goose neck is too long and won't support the light head in any useable light position when extended.  It constantly falls over. Several months ago, I bought a Starsea led work light from Amazon.  I paid about $20 for it and have found it extremely useful.  They are now about $13 according to the website.  It is much more versatile and produced a tremendous amount of LED light -
and it is battery powered.  Personally, I think this Dewalt light is not worth the money even if you have 18v batteries - which are becoming extinct  due to the advent and popularity of lithium ion batteries.",1.0

"I've seen some off-shore poor-quality product sold by Delta in the past - I know it's what you need to do to compete in this market, but this out-feed table is the worst.  Besides the enormous amount of time that it takes to install, adjust, re-adjust etc, the quality of the table and laminate is garbage.  The shipping from Amazon left minor damage around the edges.  Laminate peeling, cracked, etc - but parts missing is no excuse.  I knew that my options were to return it or exchange from Amazon, so I decided to call Delta directly who told me it would be several months until the new part was released and on top of all that - I had to pay for it.  When they sent me to the warranty call center, they simply sent me back to the general info number.  I can now see that Delta is no different than any of the off-shore clone woodworking products that are out there.  You are for sure better off building your own in this case.  It's not close to the quality of the machine that it couples up with, in my case an older Unisaw.  Sorry Delta!",1.0

"It is a light and as such, does what a light is supposed to do except for one thing...The black ribbed flexible stalk that holds the actual light bulb head on broke somewhere near the base by the battery attachment.

Unfortunately, out of the 100 or so small driver sockets I have, none seem to fit the base to even get the job started without it being a major headache. I take very good care of my tools and am quite frankly very disappointed by this DeWalt product. All of my other DeWalt products have been fantastic.

"Right now I am giving it one star. It arrived today with the rods sticking out of the manufacturer's box. There were gaps and holes in the box. It would have been a better idea to have put it into an Amazon box. I have a DeWalt 618. When I started to put the 10 mm rods into the edge guide, only one rod would go through the opening of the die cast. The other opening was defective, thus the rod could not pass thru. I thought of filing it, but the defect was significant. Don't they have quality control at Dewalt?
Generally I like Dewalt products, so I am returning this one and ordering a replacement. If the replacement is okay and works well, I will have something positive to add and change the rating. However, right now I am very disappointed with Amazon in regards to the packaging of the item, and especially with Dewalt for not having quality control in detecting a defective product.",1.0

"While the parallel arm concept on the Dewalt is unique and got great reviews at the time I bought mine, it is a flawed system. I was constantly breaking blades which often stabbed and gouged my work piece and once, my hand. Worse yet, the top arm tip, which secures the blade, is made from cast aluminum. After yet another broken blade, the casting shattered thereby making the saw inoperable. When I went to buy a replacement part, no local store selling the Dewalt saw would help me, referring me to Dewalt itself. The Dewalt website did not list any replacement parts for the arm tip. I couldn't get through to human on their phone system. I ended up putting the entire thing on the curb for the scrap metal collectors.",1.0
The guide comes with two sets of rods to accommodate various DeWalt routers' rod spacings and rod diameters. The thicker rods could not insert into the guide. Obviously this was not checked at the factory. The brass screws that hold the rods in the guide would not retract enough to give clearance for the rods. Rendering the guide useless.

"Unfortunately, the three holes provided in the stand do not match up with the intended bolt holes in the saw base. With the front two bolts inserted through the base and stand, the rear bolt slides off the opening in the rear of the base to a 45 degree angle, and does not give a firm grip, even after adding large washers.

"I purchased the DeWalt DW7080 Extension System for my new DeWalt 706 Dual Compound Miter Saw.  While I was very impressed with the tolerances and quality of the 706, the extension system will not work properly.  The 7080 system is made for the 708 saw but DeWalt said in their product brochure and on this site that it is the right one for the 706.  This is incorrect, as the extension system will not store under the saw.  It seems the saw lacks the proper clearance under the saw table to store the system. The base casting needs to be modified by DeWalt to make this work. This means that every time you use the system, you must take it on and off and store it somewhere. I called DeWalt and after some research they agreed with me.  In my opinion, based on the lack of ajustability for short stock, this makes the extension system worthless and diminishes the Model 706 saw.",1.0

I know that I can shim the extension plate a 1/2"" to make it level, but I feel for a $ 350.00 mitre saw I shouldn't have to do that. I can't believe that Dewalt can't make an extension that is flush with the base.",1.0
"The very first time I used this saw the depth of cut adjustment locking handle made a ""pop"" noise when I pressed it down and would not hold the adjustment. It is a black nylon handle on a metal shaft.  I unscrewed it and rotated it backward then reassembled. Seemed to work ok.

Today when I adjusted the depth and pressed the handle down I heard another ""pop"".  This time the fix did not work.  I wound up removing the handle and shaft and putting an aircraft nut on the machine screw that locks the depth of cut into place.

It fits loosely to the bottom of the hole.  In addition the stud is about 3/16 of in to long and will not allow the saw base to sit flat on the table.

Very bad design from Dewalt. I liked my miter-saw until I saw this ""design-flaw"". This accessory piece is also a pain to assemble and if one plans to remove it to save space or to carry the saw around, has to be sure to have a wrench to loose the locknuts.

"Looks and feels great, out of the box.....but, when installing on my DW713 the nightmare began.  Mounting is very sloppy, and impossible to level with the saw base.  Although listed as compatible, it just doesn't work.  DW7080 and DW713 = JUNK.  Trying to return, but mail order return are costly...my costly mistake...don't do the same.  I suggest you find another support system or saw.

Added Comment....I found a second hole on my saw base.  It wasn't indicated in the instructions, but looked like it could help the situation.  This hole needed a special size hex head screw (I found at home Depot) it did the trick.  I now have my extension mounted solidly, and functional.  I still won't change my rating or previous comments, because DeWalt failed in its' instruction and their support help.

Nice item to have on your saw.  I don't think I can live without after using.  You just need to have strong mechanical aptitude to figure out the special installation method and special parts, when required.  Still not changing rating.  Great item, but very hard to install on my saw.",1.0
"The rods of the DW7080 Extention will only go into the bottom of the DW718 saw base several inches before they hit against metal.  The extension does not ""telescope"" in and out as Dewalt describes.  Storing the saw will take up more space unless you take the extention off.

The holes that the screws to secure the support rods in are not threaded from the factory.  I used a large flat head screw driver to push down really hard while the screws created initial thread.

You need to be careful that you do not strip the thread when screwing them in the first time.

Probably need to take care when securing the extention later as the base of the DW718 seems to be some kind of cast metal.

"I purchased the extension kit for my newly purchased DW716.  I've been borrowing my father in law's DW705 and he has the extension kit for that model which is great - it stows neatly under the base of the saw.  Not so with the DW7080 extension kit and the DW716 (both are advertised as being compatible).  I couldn't believe that it doesn't slide under the base more than a few inches.  This is practically useless since I don't always want 20"" sticking out the side of the saw.  Others noted the same issue with their model saws.  If it stowed it would be perfect, but it doesn't and I'm dissapointed.  Also, the screws are self tapping which explains some issues other people described in their reviews.  I didn't have any issues, just a little annoying but not a big deal since the instructions explained this.",1.0
"Ok I admit it, I misread the advertisement and thought I was buying a pair (set) of extensions.  For the price, I feel one extension set is a rip-off and DeWalt should consider selling a set at a price somewhere between $32 for 1 set but certainly not $64 for 2 sets (list price is $88 for 2 sets).
One set is useless when, for example, sawing crown moldings or similar instances.  Nobody wants to keep switching the extension back and forth.",1.0

I got scammed by dewalt and I don't know why with all the coin they are making in profit of people they cant make some proper accesories. Yes it does suck that my 706 saw came with ZERO accesories, but i don't mind paying extra for accesories I want and need, if they are made right, they were hitting the crack pipe when they designed this, and It looks like it won't even work on a 708 saw as the holes are spread further apart. All I ask DEFAULT, I mean dewalt is you fix your website so that the 706 is not listed as compatible with this piece, and then make me one that will work, and WILL slide under the saw.

I like apparently several other people have received a damaged stand box with missing parts. My box is missing the rear adjustable leg, the bolts and the instructions show a rear leg plate that I assume the saw is suppose to attach to.

"This really isn't about the stand, since having received 2 shipments thus far, I haven't gotten a usable one. Just wanted to add my (disappointed) voice to the others who have gotten damaged boxes and missing parts.
These stands were part of the discount bundle Amazon has with the DEWALT 788 Scroll Saw. In both cases, the boxes I received were beat up badly and retaped. The first box was virtually empty, all that remained was one leg and a cross brace. The one that arrived today had a crisp 5x5 inch square hole cut in it through which someone had reached in and removed the bag of fasteners. The hole had been taped over with transparent tape, so it was obvious that the box had been tampered with. My experience has certainly made me a believer in the theory that Amazon is recycling returns. You can draw your own conclusions as to how much quality control is going on there. Hope you have better luck with the stand than I did.",1.0
"In my initial review, I rated this product one star because it arrived as an incomplete package -- two legs and all the hardware were missing. I ordered a replacement from Amazon and it arrived after about 4 days. Out of the box, I noticed that all the finished parts were enclosed in a plastic sleave, which wasn't the case with the first shipment, so what I received was probably a canabalized return.

The stand was fairly easy to assemble, but, like another reviewer, I was perplexed that there were so many pieces. Every bolt has a nut, washer, and lock washer, and there's a lot of bolts. Deft fingers, a half-inch socket, and patience are needed to complete the assembly.

But, when done, the stand is sturdy. One confusing point - there's an adjustable (vertically) foot for the rear leg that tilts the saw downward back to front. I may take it off - anyone have any idea why it's there?

When placing the DW788 saw (which arrived broken, see my separate review of that) onto the stand, I was surprised that the saw base has little surface area contact with the stand, and that the mounting bolts go upwards from the stand top into the saw base such that the nuts and washers are visible (and snag-able). Not a big deal, just surprising given that the saw and stand are made for each other and all other stand nuts/bolts fasten with the nuts/washers being hidden.

($315 Cyber Monday deal)  I quickly discovered that the same two problems others had commented about, made my saw not usable.  The table alignment placed the blade right on the metal of the table opening.  This alignment could not be adjusted away.  I could have ground away metal where the table was attached and made the saw workable, but the warranty would have been voided.  The second issue was vibration.  It was smooth and quiet at lower speeds, but after the #4 setting it shook violently.  It is sad because this is a heavy duty tool with poor quality control over production tolerances.  I know I got this saw at a great price and suspect Amazon was ""blowing them out"" on-line hoping folks would keep them and make do with the problems.  I know scroll saws, I have had 39 years experience using scroll saws in my middle school wood shop. This saw was a ""lemon"".  On the brighter side, I was very impressed with Amazon's return.  I downloaded the free shipping label for the 73 pound box, dropped it at UPS, and received an email from Amazon 6 hours later saying my credit card had been refunded!  With this kind of service, I will continue to use trust Amazon knowing that the risk of a bad purchase will be taken care of.",1.0

"This is a very poorly made accessory for the lower end Delta table saws.  The mill work done after the casting is poor at best .  My does not fit the table saw the way it should.  When the extension is leveled to the work surface, the fence needs to be coaxed past the joint due to the poor fit.  Delta does not seem to spend much time or money producing a quality for their low end power tools.  My next power tool purchase will be from another company.",1.0
"When these saws were made in Canada they were a very good ,very dependable,JOY TO WORK WITH. Things have gone down hill dramatically with the quality control aspect of this saw since the manufacturing was moved to Asia. The blade holes of the majority of these saws are misaligned. The table surfaces are crudely machined. Two very important things that need to be addressed. This saw now leaves much to be desired as a mid priced scroll saw.

"This edge guide is designed to fit routers from 1.25 to 3 HP.  The hold down screws are thus designed to secure attaching rods from different widths, thus, they screw down on the edge of the rods rather than directly on top of the rods.  The result is that as they are tightened, the torque causes the fence to flex out of alignment.  So it takes several attempts to get it in proper alignment.  The desire to make this fit such a variety of routers makes a piece of junk to me.  I am very disappointed in this accessory.  BTW, I have been a woodworker for 35+'years, so I'm not a novice.",1.0
The framework of the saw prevented it from being adjusted to cut square.  It was incapable of being adjusted.  I returned it.  I then went to a store where I could actually test the adjustment and bought the same model off the shelf.,1.0
"Out of the box this is cutting almost 1/4"" to the right of the 0 degree line (and two people tested it).  I used up all of the shoe adjustment and can only get it to cut within 1/16"" of the line on test cuts.  Debating return if the local recommended DeWalt service center can't adjust correctly (and without it costing me extra).  Beside that... looks good, feels solid, operates quieter than previously owned saws and love the electric brake.  Just a shame its so out of alignment from the factory.

To add... local service center would send saw out to DeWalt (estimated turn around was a few weeks), so I opted to request an exchange through Amazon (who has been great dealing with).  Second saw arrived in two days and I was excited again, but only for a short time.  The second saw also cut to the right of the guide line, but this time it was only initially 1/8"" out of alignment.  I attempted to adjust (COME ON!!! ADJUSTING A NEW SAW!) The adjustment only adjusts the shoe from the back.  Now the saw is measured 5 1/2"" from blade to edge of shoe near the rear, but remains 5 5/8"" from the blade to the edge of the shoe in the front.

This one is going back too!  Done with DeWalt tools, its a shame I have so many of them.  Running to the local Home Depot.

To finalize...  priced saws and Home Depot and Lowes.  To my surprise Lowes had the same saw!  My curiosity burned and I grabbed it.  Once home I measured the distance from the left edge of the blade to the left edge of the shoe, which the instruction manual emphatically states should measure 5 1/2"".  The saw is precisely 5 5/8"" when measured from the front and rear edge of the blade.",1.0
"I had this light for about two months. Its handy because it shares the same battery as my other poorly thought out Dewalt tool investments. The light is just barely bright enough to work with and drains the battery very quickly. The light fell out of my tool bag and the swivel head broke off. When I took it apart to see if I could fix it, I found why it broke and was surprised it hadn't broken before. The swivel head is held on with a thin lip of brittle plastic. This is not an industrial grade tool!

When I started out the Dewalt tools seemed like a more affordable option over ""real"" industrial tool brands. Sadly after some time in the field I have learned Dewalt is nothing more than home owner hobby grade crap. I am done with them and will slowly begin replacing my Dewalt tools with Milwaukee.",1.0
"Purchased this item as an extension to my router table and am very displeased.  The Item was packaged sufficiently. The Directions were also sufficient.  The main body is a stamped steel edge which is connected to the rails via a cast aluminum piece that needed to be finagled  to accept the rails.  The holes on the router base that accept the rails were too large, and the rails had lots of play until they were tightened.  And the worst part of it all is the edge of the ""Router EDGE guide"" was not straight!! held up to a straight edge, there was a 1/16+ gap on one side, which would cause it to rock during the cut.
  This is not a tool for woodworking at any level and makes me consider getting rid of the router as well!!",1.0

"I ordered this saw for its desirable features--namely the electric brake, convenient blade height adjustment, and a slot to hold the cord out of the way.  This saw is one of the worst tools I've used in quite sometime.  It arrived with a bent shoe due to manufacturers cutting corners nowadays using die struck plate instead of ribbed castings even on higher end saws.  The sight line cutout on the shoe lined up with nothing.  It was supposedly designed to place the kerf flush on the right side of the line.  When sawing exactly on the line, the distance between the kerf and the line was almost an eighth of an inch. The worst part of this saw is its incredibly bad balance.  It wanted to naturally heel at the beginning of cuts, and I found myself always fighting it to enter the cut with a level shoe.  This is important if one wants to make a series of shallow cuts that get chiseled out (faster than a router for rough work) The saw is heavy which is tolerable.  Heavy and unbalanced make for a tool that one is always compensating for--it gets tiresome in a hurry.  Pick up a circular saw that is well balanced being neither front heavy nor rear heavy and feel the difference.  The Dewalt would also bind in certain situations due to the heavier than necessary spring on the blade guard.  I have returned this saw, and bought a Bosch instead.  I would have considered Porter Cable also, but could not find one like my old one with the ribbed diecast shoe that stays flat. The Dewalt's blade brake and easy rear pivot blade height adjustment just do not compensate for a badly designed tool with poor quality control.  Has Dewalt become nothing more than another great company in a long line of quality manufacturers prostituted for its brand name?",1.0

"I found this drill unusable and I returned it. The first time I used the drill I squeezed the trigger slowly, but it seemed to jump from no power to almost full power. I used the side handle and two hands as recommended, but the drill spun uncontrollably and caused a large bruise on my right hand and a bruised finger on the other hand. Fortunately I didn't suffer any permanent injury. The manual warns, ""Always expect a stall. Grip the drill firmly with  both hands to control twisting action and avoid injury."" But even with both hands I was not able to control it. This drill may be fine for experienced construction professionals, but I would caution novices from buying it.",1.0
I have two of these saws in the junior high where I teach.  Both had endless electrical problems.  The saws only had light use before they began to break down.,1.0
"The drill worked OK at first except that the chuck is eccentric -- it wobbles,so the hole you get is bigger than the drill bit you're using. After about an hour of drilling time (not, of course, non-stop drilling), the trigger developed a dead spot wherein when I squeezed with gradually increasing pressure (so as to gradually increase drill speed), a few seconds into the ramp-up it quit -- just stopped cold. When that happened the first time, it just would not run again. The next day I tried it again, but except for one burst of full-speed running, it would not come on. (Outlets and cords checked out fine.)
So overall it rates as very poor quality. I would not buy another.",1.0

"I bought this saw less than a year ago. With less than ten hours on it, the motor burned out.  Dewalt told me to take it to a service center which I did. They replaced the motor, but after getting it back I have problems with the saw stopping in mid cut! To make matters worse, I t will not hold a #2 blade in the bottom blade holder. I use Olson blades, and after ruining a dozen, I called Dewalt again, and once again they told me to take it back for repairs. Since the closest repair facility is 50 miles from where live, this is an uneeded time and expense to me. To make matters worse, the service person I talked to told that was "" A fragile machine ""!

"I used to demo these seven years ago and was really excited about getting my own.  They were very close to Excalibur then and were more than half the going price.  After taking it out of the box I noticed the extremely poor job of milling on the table top.  I was going to deal with it latter but after setting it up the variable speed control was not variable at all.  No matter what I did it would not change speed (it looked to be stuck at at the low setting) and it is going back.  On closer inspection the seam of the casing also seemed to be off and I could see clear gaps (1/32 to 1/16).  The box was not dented and was in perfect shape so I don't believe it was done while shipping.  If the next one is milled in the same manner I am going to go with an Excalibur, I have seen Dremel and Craftsman with better milling and finishing at half the price.  Very disappointed and would never buy over the internet or without examining it at the store first, including turning it on and playing with the variable speed dial..",1.0
"If you are a hobbyist, and you don't have plans to ever cut anything thicker than 1/4 inch, then you don't need this saw anyway. If you want to do quality work, you don't need this saw. If you want to pay a high price for extremely bad quality control, then this is the saw for you.

Older models of this saw aren't so bad, older as in over 6+ years old. I purchased mine about 4 years ago, and the arms aren't even the same length. You can't get the blade square to the table. The top arm is literally longer than the bottom arm. How do you possibly miss something like that during manufacturing? Complaints from others includes a non-flat cutting table, too much distance between the arms making blade insertion difficult, or in some some cases, preventing it all together.

The original design of this saw was excellent. Too bad that Dewalt can't figure out how to successfully manufacture it.

If you think your saw is okay, you might want to tension up a blade and check it for square, side to side and front to back. You might be surprised at what you find.",1.0
"After purchasing this saw, I read a review written recently by Jay. I had the same problem with the table screw holes not tapped in the correct location causing the blade to hit the table(only off by about 1/8th""). I called Dewalt and the service rep. told me that he wasn't aware of any problems with this saw. After speaking with the rep, he told me that I could file the holes that support the table. I asked if this would void the warranty and he said no. I filed the arm screw holes, however I am not happy with Dewalt. The saw seems to run good, but I just can't recommend it to anyone until Dewalt does something to resolve this issue. The only way I would buy it is from a local store so it can be checked out. Sorry for the lengthy review..GOOD LUCK!",1.0
"Sometime in the recent past, DeWalt moved the manufacturing for this saw from Canada to Asia.  I recently ordered the saw for my father, and the one he got (and TWO replacements) all had problems due to poor quality control or manufacturing or both.  I am a woodworker and own and have used many quality DeWalt tools over the years, so I was surprised at these problems.

There are two bolts which hold the table in place, and on ALL THREE SAWS the bolt holes were apparently drilled off-center and mis-aligned, causing the blade to hit the side of the table slot (on the same side all 3 times).  We spoke to the scroll saw manager at DeWalt and he was very aware of the problem but didn't offer to do anything to fix it other than return our money. (He even admitted to have several saws in his office that had been returned from customers with this problem.) He said he had ""reported the issue to management"" multiple times but nothing had been done for several months.  Apparently this affects a large portion of the new saws coming from the new manufacturing facility in Asia.  Buyer BEWARE.

I am not totally surprised at the fact that DeWalt is having the manufacturing problem.  I *am* surprised that they are doing little or nothing to fix it.  At the very least I suggested that they put a quality check in place at the factory to check for this problem before they shipped out the saw and reject the ones with the problem.  They have NOT done this, but instead tell their support people to ask the customer to ""drill out the holes to allow the bolts to move over"".  Not on a brand new $500 saw thank you!  We even asked the product manager if he could have someone in his distribution center open a box to check a saw for us and ship us a known good one; but he declined saying ""he didn't have anyone who could do that"".  DeWalt is a better company than this and they shouldn't be allowing this kind of poor quality.

UPDATE: Several months later after I wrote this review, we decided to give this saw one more chance and ordered a FOURTH one.

I still bought them because you really must have them if you do any anount of crown.  The real disapointment is that for that much money you'd think they would at least be square.  Mine are not (out of the box).  When dewalt sat down and designed this thing there were only two basic requirements - it must attach to the side of the saw with a slot that allows adjustment and then turn square so as to be parrallel to the fence.

The blades advertised next to the item do not fit. Its not a 10mm arbor.  It is a 1/2 inch arbor.  And you have to attach the blade with the writing facing the inside as this is for a left hander.

"I own multiple DeWalt products (Drills, Table Saws, etc.) and have had great experiences with them all....that is until I purchased this light during a recent purchase of their Scroll Saw.  Love the saw, hate the lamp.  The lamp is not very flexible and tends to drop towards your work in progress due to the tables vibration.  Further, unless you are working in pitch black, the provided light bulb doesn't provide ample work light, that is if you can screw it in.  The space allotted to screw in the light bulb is so tight, it is almost impossible to change.  What a let down.  I would offer that is it a pretty effective back scratcher.....",1.0
"This DeWalt light came with a scroll saw/light/stand package deal at another website.  The light looks great and mounts quickly, but that is where the excitement ends.  The gooseneck is far too weak to support its own heavy head weight given the mounting location on the saw, and how horizontal the light needs to be to reach the work area.

We ended up supporting the light halfway down the gooseneck by using two zip ties to secure the gooseneck to the upper saw arm.  We used a piece of foam between the gooseneck and the saw arm to prevent vibration and paint damage.  Taking this weight off helped, but is tacky looking.  Considered mounting it to the saw stand for a more vertical mount, but then it would be in the way of large work pieces.

The on/off switch has a nice snap and weight to it, so it feels like it will last.  We are using this saw/light in a room with poor lighting.  The bulb is plenty bright.  The head/bulb gets pretty hot.  In the right position to prevent shadows, your forehead is pretty darn close to the light, but its fine.

If you bought your DeWalt scroll saw without a light, and you're looking for a light now, look elsewhere until DeWalt finds a better Chinese supplier.  The current light is not up to snuff for this application.

To my astonishment the reviews have not changed in 10 years.  DeWalt, that is just pathetic.  How many more of these lights do you need to sell to get rid of the batch you had made in China 10 years ago?  Enough already, do your customers a favor and throw the whole lot away and find a better light.  Is this why I got the light 'free' in a package deal with the stand (nice stand), so I can't complain because I got it free?  Well, this product number still has your name attached doesn't it?  It is obviously a problem, you know about it, manage the issue.

"Does not fit the DWS780 properly.  You'd think if you buy the most expensive miter saw, that it would be well designed.  Well, think again.  The stops work, but they DO NOT fit the DWS780 because the holes are NOT threaded on the saw base.  Dewalt thinks it's okay instead to ship these stops with a ghetto-fabulous nut that you can barely thread as you have to reach under the saw.  Which you have to do EVERY time you want to use the stops.

Removing them is also difficult - you can't just flip them up to the back - you need to remove them all the way...and that awesome non-threaded hole in the DWS780 makes removing them frustrating because the nuts spin, and usually you drop one at least once so that's fun too.",1.0

"Dewalt lost their minds with the dws780 they made the holes for the crown stop, but thought it would be a good money saving idea to not thread the holes. They must've realized their stupidity and tried to remedy the problem by including nut clips that are supposed to fit into non existing slots behind and under the saw...only problem is there is no slot on this saw for them to fit into, so the nut clip must be held with you hand while tightening.
Lots of fun trying to tilt the saw up and maneuver this hokey setup. Bottom line, does not work well on the dws780",1.0
"Absolute junk! I wanted to use this with my delta 14"" band saw but it's easier to move without this thing. The castering wheel doesn't turn when you put it down so you can only roll it in a straight line. And it wants to tip over if you try to rotate the wheel. It's a design problem because the caster is at an angle when the foot lever is pushed down. I can probably modify it so it's at least usable, but I shouldn't have to do delta's design work for them. Another problem is that the hardware is too short. I had to squeeze some of the parts just to get a single nut thread on the bolt. And some didn't have full thread engagement when fully tightened. But I was worried they would strip if I tightened them any more. They really cut corners on this thing. This was my first delta purchase in a few years but it will probably be my last.",1.0
Would not support itself,1.0
"Wasn't very well thought out as far mounting the light bulb. Could not get my fingers around the bulb to screw into socket.
Had to have 12 year old grandson put the bulb in and his finger were almost too big....Come on DeWalt have your engineering people try to use stuff before you market it.....
Update: Found an LED bulb that will fit right here on Amazon..... https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OB8K1C4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1",1.0
"About the best you can say is that the light does light up! The flexible arm is so weak it can't even support itself and runs very hot! Recommend you DON'T purchase this lamp if you plan to mount it on your scroll saw. There are other better solutions including a magnet mounted lamp designed for a sewing machine that works better, is brighter and is cooler running--oh, and costs less.",1.0
Completely useless. Duct tape and a flashlight would be far better. No matter how you position it the light will not stay in the same place. You also need fingers the size of a toddler to get the bulb in and out. Thankfully I received it free with the saw and stand.,1.0
"This light doesn't stay where you adjust it, making it useless.",1.0
"I bought a used saw with this light on it. It is way too heavy for the type of mounting. It won't stay where you put it because of the weight. The point where it bolts to the saw has worn out and I don't see any way to fix it without returning it to DeWalt and if it's out of warranty as mine is, it will cost more than it's worth. I will make my own light using LED technology. Don't buy this light. It is junk.",1.0
"Light will not stay in place, wobbles and falls, waited too late to return, good idea, bad performance, not a good value.",1.0
"It costs about 80 cents to ship these anywhere in the states via postal service, yet RFBDirect seems to have a flat rate of $7. They must be Lunar based. Also, these are garbage bulbs anyway. For the price of a Dewalt tool, you would think they could make a better bulb!",1.0
"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.  It had the wrong bolt sizes with it, the holes did not line up.  I had to purchase the correct hardware from HD to get this piece of junk together, and drill out the metal.  Don't waste your time, DELTA should be kicked in the teeth for selling this.",1.0
The light arm is not stiff enough to keep the light in place.  I have to prop it up at an awkward angle to make it useable.,1.0
i won;t recommend it to any one I will tell them to get a clamp on light like i did I would like to send it back,1.0
"I GOT THE FIRST LIGHT AND THE METAL THAT HOLDS THE LIGHT WOULD NOT HOLD THE LIGHT UP.  I RETURNED IT AND GOT ANOTHER ONE AND THE SAME THING. I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING. TIGHTENING THE NUT ON THE END AND BENDING IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.  AS SOON AS I LET GO THE METAL SHIELD ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE LIGHT CORD JUST LETS THE LIGHT GO ALL THE WAY DOWN  TO THE TABLE ON THE SAW.  I HAVE TWO FRIENDS WHO HAVE THE SAME SAW AND LIGHT AND THEY DO FINE.  COULD I RETURN THE SECOND LIGHT AND GET MY MONEY BACK.
THANK YOU",1.0
"rather get the DW272.  I don't know if it was an isolated instance, but I couldn't keep the nose assembly tight.  I believe the threads were stripped, and it wouldn't stay tight.

The DW272 has not had the same problem.  When I purchased it, my instinct said ""plastic isn't durable and it looks like it could be weak at the nose"", and well in this case it proved to be true.

I certianly wouldn't rate the DeWalt tools based on the quality of this drill/driver...they make better products, I own many...and will continue to buy them.",1.0
"Bought this item new, never tried it because the nose piece was so cheep!!!! Could not adjust tip for drywall, could only set screws to deep. Plastic tip wouldn't even stay on screw gun and never used, what happens when if you used it at all the time. Big trouble if you ever dropped it by accident. I'am sending it back. I love all my other tools from Dewalt, would back them all up, but this one. I hope this isn't the way Dewalt is going with there products.",1.0
This light is useless. The goose neck will not support its own weight. My fault for not reading the reviews before I bought it but frankly I had faith in the  Dewalt name. Live and learn. It's going back.,1.0
"light housing too heavy, hard to set at optimum position. needs to be updated to LED technology. Junk, junk, junk!",1.0
The adjustable work light does not adjust. It has one position. Down. Waste of money and an embarrassment for Dewalt.,1.0
Just sent this light back. Didn't even get to the plug it in and turn it on part. The flex neck is so weak it can't even hold the fixture up. Might as well use a table light. Searching for a new fixture now.,1.0
"SO disappointed in this light.  It is not DEWALT quality that we have come to expect.
Once my scroll saw arrived we attached the light to the saw.  It immediately fell straight down.  There was no way to bend the ""neck"" to keep it upright.  Once we THOUGHT we had it where it would stay put, I turned it on, the lightbulb popped and that was it!
Poor, poor design.

Would NOT recommend!",1.0
"I don't think this was worth the effort putting it together. Good thing I had a drill press to get good alignment or it would have never worked.  The biggest disappointment was how little it actually raised the table @1/4""  Not nearly sufficient for my needs as I like to move my stuff out of the shop to the deck.  Clearance was't enough to make it over door frame on the floor. If you have lots of time and like projects and only have to shift the table around a little then this might work for you.  Personnally I think I could move the table over just as easy without this thing.  I have a scroll saw on the table in question.  My other table with the miter saw is equipped with locking casters that I afixed myself.  This works quite nicely.  Got the $7 dollar ones from Amazon. Quite pleased.",1.0
"When I bought a Bosch power tool I thought now I have the best.  After the first cut with my new sliding compound miter saw I realized I had real clean up problems.  Bosch's dust bag absolutely does not work at all.  I mean NOT AT ALL!  I'm very disapointed with Bosch for putting a saw on the market that blows saw dust and chips everywhere except in the dust bag.  The design is the real problem, chips don't stand a chance of going into the dust bag.  Bosch has got to know this, but why they continue to produce a dust breathing monster is beyond me.  I have over $[money] bucks in this saw and hate to use it.  Buyers beware...",1.0
"This light sure doesn't meet Dewalts normal standards. I bought one set it up and the weight of it caused it to drop, completely useless. Sent it back and they sent me another, same problem. Very disappointed. Don't buy one.",1.0
Tension on arm won't hold light up!  Ordered second one and it was worse. Not worth trouble to order again. Dont sell this!,1.0
"when installing lamp on scroll saw found screws were too short  -so off to Home Depot for longer screws.(M6-1.0 X 12MM)
next found the goose neck will not hold the lamp at position needed to light up the scroll saw work area- lamp drops down to table-then you have to lift the lamp up.
when i need to replace the lamp- what is the lamp number and where may i find one? why is the this lamp a appliance lamp and not a LED. we live in Phoenix Arizona area we do NOT need any thing that make unneeded heat. do you want to work under a heat lamp?
i will NOT recommend to any one",1.0
The light would not stay in place as it is not strong enough to stay in a fixed position.  I had to use string to hold it upright so that the light would show on the work.  Very poor design and would not recommend anybody purchase it.,1.0
"I purchased three of these Delta Mobile Bases, model 50-345.  Very disappointed at the poor quality control of the hardware included.  Each of the 16 bolts for each base were too short for the nuts to engage the threads of the bolts.  I had to go to the local hardware and purchase 48 bolts (at a cost of $17.55) that were longer in order to be able to assemble the bases.  If you purchase these Delta Mobile Bases, model 50-345, be prepared to purchase additional hardware at your own cost in order to be able to use the bases.",1.0
"I'm dumbfounded that after all of these years, DeWalt still hasn't corrected the ongoing problem with the flexible neck being too wimpy to hold up the light for very long. I thought, jeez the most recent review looks to be 2011, there should be an improvement by now... lol, nope. I finally removed the thing, got one of those magnetic base work lights with a stiffer goose neck, stuck it to the DeWalt metal stand, problem solved for now. I may try mounting the Dewalt light directly to the stand by drilling two holes, bolt it down and orient the goose neck vertical instead of horizontal... it might possilbly bear the weight of the lamp better and not sag.",1.0
"I wish I didn't buy it the light doesn't stay in place.
When you turn on the scroll saw the light move down next to the blade.

"I would give this minus 5 stars if I could.  The blade broke after about 10 minutes of use cutting straight lines in thin plastic.

Since I was changing from a 1/4"" blade, I had to reset all my guides, tracking and tension.  The upper blade support was about 1/4"" above the surface of the plastic. I've been doing this for 25+ years so I know how to set up a saw for a particular blade.

This blade broke after about 10 minutes.  And it was probably less than 5 minutes of actual cutting.  The job at hand required trimming a stack of 3/8 x 1/8 plastic strips to length.

An extended fence was used which supports the plastic strip on both sides of the blade.  A cutout was placed in the fence at the blade position and a stop was placed in the T-Fence slot so once the blade got through the plastic it never touched the extended fence.",1.0
The machine base was so poorly manufactured I returned it as unusable.,1.0
"As of this moment in time the 50-274 gets a single star because I cannot fit my Delta 28-206 bandsaw into the mobile base, rendering the base useless to me!  My saw is 5 years old and is definitely a 28-206.  I cannot find any info on the web commenting on this problem.  I will update as this saga unfolds.",1.0
