I like how this game really makes you think and be thinking of new strategies. It is a fun and social game.,5.0
I did not want to part with my unopened 3M origional and my grandson asked for it for Christmas. He played it several times with me and won several games. I believe he will enjoy the new version!,5.0
"Family board games are back. And unlike all those Parker Brothers and Milton Bradley games we grew up on, they're actually fun, playable within and hour or two, and have balanced gameplay.

This 1960s classic has been cited as the inspiration for game designers behind modern classics like Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride. Acquire is kind of like Bingo meets Monopoly, but with stock speculation. Each game evolves differently and it never gets boring. I remember one vacation with friends we must have played this game 25 times over the course of a long weekend.

It requires 3 players to play, but really comes into its own with 4 or more players. In a 6 way game, you'll never be able to remember who owns what!",5.0
"Although not as well known as Monopoly or The Game of Life, this is a game for the money-game fan.  It is so popular that there are rare and valuable sets being sold on eBay and people are VERY protective of their original version they were lucky enough to get 10 years ago... It's a club.  But the game is worth every dime.  Do yourself a favor and make it a tradition in your home to play this game.  Even though the new version isn't as ""cool"" as the older versions, the game is the same and will not disappoint.  Enjoy!!",5.0
"I highly recommend this board game for those who enjoy the idea of Monopoly, but don't want to actually play it.  Although this game has many forms, this version involves investing and building hotels.  Players found hotels, merge them with others, invest in stock, and cash out their stock and acquire bonuses to reinvest in other hotels.  It takes, on average, around 60-90 minutes to play with 4 people and does not get any less interesting from game to game.  I haven't regretted this purchase unlike other boring board games.",5.0
"Excellent game. If you are looking for stock market strategy, this is the game. Enjoy it during a 2-3 hrs",5.0
I enjoy playing games and I have only played this one a couple times.  However I can see that there is more than one strategy that can lead to success in this game.  I am glad to place this one in the rotation of games.  The game arrived quickly and as expected so I will happily deal with Wizards of the Coast again in the future. Now if only I can get more free time to relax & play games.,5.0
"It is a fun game.  I enjoyed playing it because it is a fun game.  I will play it again because it is a fun game.

PS - it is a fun game.",5.0
The game is a 5 star game...the game board and pieces are cheap imitations of the original one and pretty much suck.,5.0
"We were thrilled to find Acquire finally; my husband grew up loving this game. Ordered it for my brother.  The game requires strategy, planning, and never ends the same way.  It is a classic, must-have addition for any game closet.  It's a little more time intensive, and the board isn't as flashy as newer games, but hey -- it is exciting to play.  It's all about the acquisitions.",5.0
"Game came as ordered.  Great expierence! Would recommend to others.  Game is first rate and is challenging, bought it for my son who is an Accounting Major in College.",5.0
"Great game. takes some time to learn how to play it, but once you do, you'll love it. It does take some time to finish it, however.",5.0
"My husband and I really enjoy this game. In some ways it has a similar feel to Monopoly, but instead of one person making all the money and slowly sucking everyone else dry, everyone makes money the whole game, just some people end up with more money than others by the end and that's how the winner is determined. It's pretty fun. It's a little more complicated than Monopoly to learn, but after playing through the game once you'll have a pretty good grasp of the strategy.",5.0
"This particular version of Acquire is made very cheap, this is only paper and cardboard. I had this for over a year now and I use the game a few times a week. I doubt it will last more 7 years, but it is still in like new condition.",5.0
"great game, not stale... kept us busy and entertained. No two games is ever the same... We enjoyed it for sure.",5.0
"I have always loved this game. It is as much or
more fun than Monopoly. Love building my
Hotel Empire. : )",5.0
Adult children came for Christmas. We spent hours playing this very intriguing game. It requires mostly skill and some luck.,5.0
This is a fun game of strategy that pays uniquely different each time.  Great family game for teens and adults of all ages!,5.0
"Put your thinking cap on for this one.  Takes a little time learning the game but once you do, its great.  I really like that you don't know who is winning until the end.  Keeps the uber competitive people in the dark...",5.0
"This is a fun game!  It's more of a strategy game, so you'll only want to play with people who enjoy these sorts of games or are smart enough to figure it out.  I would put this game in the same genre as Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride, Puerto Rico, etc. but it's not as long or intense as say a Settlers or Puerto Rico game.  It's still strategic and fun... but different than the others.  Everyone we've played it with really enjoys it!  It's our new favorite game to teach people because it doesn't take several hours to learn like some games, so it's reasonable in length, but it's long enough to still be fun and use some skill.",5.0
This is a great strategy game that never turns out the same.  It is usually the first game we play when we have game night.,5.0
This is a terrific board game.  Unlimited options.  Been playing it for 40 years and it's never played the same way twice!  Simple rules to follow.  Great for 4 -6 people.,5.0
Played for the first time yesterday with 4 players.  Took a few minutes to get everyone up to par with the instructions but flow picks up quickly.  Many levels of strategy involved such as when to buy shares in what chain and whether or not block mergers to prevent competitors from cashing in on appreciated stock values.  Kept everyone engaged throughout and the intensity picks up at the end when trying to decide whether or not to initiate the end of game play.  My one complaint would be that previous iterations of Acquire had grooved slots on the board so that the tiles would not shift when others are being placed.  Minor complaint but newer versions need to address it.  Overall it is highly recommended.,5.0
"This game is addictive! More fun and much more sophisticated than Monopoly, yet similar premise. Faster paced and each game is completely different than the last. Highly recommend this Acquire!",5.0
"My family and my wife's sister's family play this game regularly.  It's even generated some ""family-isms"" we use on a regular basis.  (""Don't poke the bull!""...I'm a Taurus.) We have the older game with the plastic tiles and locking board, and my sister-in-law has the newer cardboard version.  It's a bit confusing to switch between the two since some hotels with the same name have different values, but it's not too tough to make the adjustment.

One thing we do to hold our tiles in the older game (which doesn't come with its own holder) is use the tile holders from Scrabble; they work great for holding the plastic tiles.

This is a great game for anyone high-school age or older.  It requires thought, planning, strategy, and the usual bit of luck.  Some of our best moments have come when one person's plans are unwittingly destroyed by someone else, a common occurence.  Sometimes we even have a surprise ending (i.e. the person who seemed to be ahead the whole game gets narrowly beaten out).

The one drawback to this game is that, if you are not involved in the first few mergers, you have a high risk of sitting there the rest of the game with nothing to do and no chance to win.  In our group, this happens to someone about once every three games.",5.0
"This is a game that my grandmother had when I was young (age 10 or so).  From what I remember it was so much fun to play and I am not sure what made me think of it after all of these years (now age 40) but I did and bought it again.  I did give it as a gift to my mother but do plan on purchasing it again for myself and family.  It does take quite a long time to play....not a fast game.  It also does not have any bells, electronic noises, or anything fancy.  It is truly a board game and if you like the idea of being able to ""acquire"" or basically control the game with your property, then you will love this game.",5.0
"I love this game, as does my family, including my 8 year old sister.

The mechanics are excellent but you can find that out elsewhere.

The product was received in great condition, factory wrapped and everything.

The stock cards may wear with age so I laminated them. Note to possible followers, buy the proper sized lamination cards. Laminating 8 or so cards at a time in an A4 sized sheet is not fun and neither is cutting them down to a standard size.

The 'stock rate' cheat sheet may tear when erm.. tearing them from the book. Go slow and you must laminate afterward.",5.0
"Great Game, but cheaply made.  Still worth while.  If you can get a vintage set go for it.",5.0
This is a great game that changes every time you play it.  We are big Settlers of Catan and Ticket to Ride fans and think that this game is every bit as fun.,5.0
This game takes the best elements of Monopoly and Risk and combines them into one awesome game. I used to thoroughly enjoy Monopoly and Risk but now I almost always insist on playing Acquire.,5.0
"I was advised to get the older version because it had contained spots on the board so the pieces can't shift, but I read the reviews of each game and went with the cheaper of the two.  I'm not disappointed, and I loved the game.  I've introduced it to several different family members and they all have loved it.  It takes a few rounds to figure out, and by the end of the game, you're ready to play again.",5.0
"I have played all the versions of Aquire, from the 1962 3M game to the latest, and the one thing in common is that the game always is a blast.  My college friends and I own a total of 15 sets.  There is no other game out there that is this fun, and this fast to play (45 min/game).  This edition kinda sucks for the reasons listed in other reviews, but get ANY copy of the game and it will be worth it.  The 1960s version is the same game and rules as it is today.  50 years of playability and going strong.",5.0
"If you have never played, don't let the reviews turn you off. This is a wonderful, mind working game.

Many people liked the version with the 3-d peices because they don't get bumped... but if you play on a table and aren't trying to hold a baby at the same time or have a cat that likes to jump on games (which are valid concerns), then this version will do fine. I'm not really certain why some people keep buying each version, unless they collect or their old one is worn out from many a good time.

I personally have been waiting for a ""flat""version. I found that the 3-d version was unnecessarily bulky (they could have made a better ""locking system"" if they wanted a bump free version), the pieces were too big to throw into a drawstring bag and draw from (I'd rather not have to turn them all upside down and then make room for all the bulky upside down pieces to take up half my table), and the peices were too bulky to easily conceal from the other players.. we had to all get shoe boxes, or keep them upside down and remember exactly which pieces we had.

So all and all, I actually prefer this one. You will have a distinct advantage if you have the type of mind that can keep track of how many of what each player buys.

Not the best to play with young players because decisions they make can effect everyone else... which is good if they fully understand why they are doing it and what effect it will have, but if they don't, then it really is a bummer when they mess things up for you (and it doesn't even help them).",5.0
Great game and great replay value.  Play alone or with up to 4 friends (5total players).  Takes from 30mins to 120mins tops so not all night and if you want to play longer u can play another adventure.  Clean-up can be a bit of a pain but not a big deal.,5.0
"Wrath of Ashardalon is a fun game.  If you like dungeon style board games that use cooperative play mechanics, then you'll really enjoy this.

Unlike many other games in the genre, this game is fully cooperative.  There's no solo player controlling the dungeon and the monsters.  Because of that however, there is going to be a bit of reading involved in any play session.  Players end up controlling monsters on their turns as well as acting for their hero character.  The monsters however follow a set of instructions located on each of their cards, sort of like a simple AI computer program.  It works out fairly easily and is a lot of fun.

There's an adventure book which outlines the different scenarios for the game and it can combine with the other game(s) in the D&D Boardgame series for more play options.  There are many unpainted miniatures in the game along with a ton of cardboard chits.",5.0
"I was skeptical about 'Castle Ravenloft' despite it having received mostly glowing reviews so I decided to skip it when it was released last Fall. Having played a lot of Dungeon and Dragons Miniatures 2.0 [DDM 2.0] 'til it died in 2008 [and kept alive via fans and members of the design team, some of whom worked on CR and Wrath of Ashardalon [WoA] and enjoyed D&D and AD&D from the original Gygax offerings thru 4th Edition, I wasn't sure if this self-contained boardgame would offer enough entertainment variety for me and my fantasy RPG combat-heavy loving friends. Having read all of the positive reviews on Amazon as well as other sites including ars technica and mtv.com of all places, I felt as if I was duty bound to acquire this game for some reason. The main draw for me was that it contained additional elements beyond what was offered in CR [which again, I hadn't played].

Once I received WoA, I couldn't have been happier that I took the plunge! The quality of the gamepieces and punchout tiles and tokens are top notch. The last time I purchased a boardgame was September of 2009 when Games Workshop re-released their latest anniversary edition of Space Hulk; that was an exceptional product overall and cost $100. D&D: WoA felt nearly equal in quality once I removed everything from the confines of its ginormous box; pretty good for something that cost less than $50 via Amazon.com!

I've played several of the included adventures with people whose ages ranged from 8 (my eldest son) to 38, some with boardgame or RP/miniatures skirmish based experience and some with none at all; it was very easy to introduce the rules to all of them and in every instance we all had a great time. Some of the people I 'snookered' into playing this were sold on the concept that they would essentially be playing a tangible, 3-D ver. of the classic game 'Gauntlet' or Rogue-like dungeon crawlers that are still popular today [on phones or the DS/PSP, etc.]. It's greatest strength is probably due to the fact that it's a co-operative game; we all definitely enjoyed the pressure of meeting the required goals and succeeding at them, yet also each having the ability to deter us all from completing those goals due to every Encounter card draw or Monster/Villain action per player's turns.

I've since received D&D: Castle Ravenloft as a gift, and have come to enjoy that tremendously as well. I look forward to future game sessions where we'll mix and match the components of either game. D&D: The Legend of Drizz't can't come out soon enough....",5.0
"This game is a lot of fun and a good improvement on the Castle Ravenloft game. So far I've only played a few hours solo, but it's been very enjoyable. The new monster tactics, chambers, and doors add a lot to the system started with Ravenloft.

If you're looking for a fun co-op or solo game, this is what you are looking for.

The game works by drawing interlocking dungeon tiles randomly to create a new dungeon each time. Most adventures have you place an objective tile in your tile deck. Then when you lay down that objective tile, the adventure rules tells you what happens (usually a boss battle).

The game comes with 13 adventures, but it's super easy to make your own. Or if you just want to kill some monsters, throw a chamber tile in your dungeon tile deck and when you explore to that chamber tile, draw a chamber card to see what happens.

The components all seem very high quality. There have been complaints of warped cards, but I haven't experienced it yet (even after spilling beer all over my cleric's ability cards). People who have complained to Wizards of the Coast about warped cards are reporting that they have received replacement decks.

Great game for friends, family and for yourself.",5.0
"Wrath of Ashardalon gets everything right for a dungeon crawl board game. I'll break down all of the great highlights:

Set-Up
------
You divide out cards and characters. You put a start tile down, then you're ready to go. Super easy and fast.

Rules
-----
If you are familiar with playing Dungeons and Dragons, then you'll know that an encounter can often take more than an hour. Not so here.

The rules have been laid out to make encounters very brief. And you won't feel cheated. All of the rolls are with 20-sided dice. Damage is 1, 2 or 3 hit points. Almost everything has between 1-12 hit points. So creature die fast.

Each player adds more of a challenge. So if you solo, it's just as hard as with 5 people (more or less -- I think it's just a tad harder with more people). So as you add more people, their ability to play their role becomes crucial (fighters fight, clerics heal, wizards blast from afar, etc).

The rules roughly follow the 4.0 version of the Dungeons and Dragons rules. You have daily, utility and at-will powers. Swinging a sword is at-will, blasting something with a powerful fireball is daily.

You collect experience as you kill creatures. If you kill something with a roll of 20 and you have 5 experience points in monsters, then you can level up your character to gain more hit points, less chance of being hit and more powers.

Quests are found in a quest book that tells you how to set up the game and who the boss is. The end of most quests have a boss that will take a lot to kill.

Durability
----------
The game is very well made. The plastic is hard enough to not break after thorough use. The cardboard pieces are very dense and thick.

Our cards warped a little one a humid night, but it wasn't horrible.

Nerd-Factor
-----------
This game had far less nerdness than regular D&D. But it also doesn't have some of the fun aspects of role-playing (like a long, emmersive and interactive storyline). You can feel safe to invite people over to play who are not Dungeons & Dragons addicts.

Minitaures
----------
All of the pieces are very detailed. Some look identical to the D&D 4.0 creatures and characters that are sold for the miniatures game. However, none of these pieces are painted. They are all one solid (or translucent) color.

Fun Factor
----------
Since the game has no need for a Dungeon Master or someone to play the enemy, everyone can enjoy playing on the same team. And you'll rarely have mathematical discussions of how to absolutely maximize every turn in order to survive (a common occurance in many other dungeon crawls, e.g. Descent:  Journey into the Darkness).

So, overall, it's just a good time with a bunch of friends. Win or lose, you'll enjoy the comraderie of tearing through baddies and collecting treasure.

Replayability
-------------
The game offers tons of quests and there's practically in infinite number more online. You could also just make up your own quests. The randomization of encounter and treasure cards keeps things changing. And you can add more heroes, treasure cards, encounter cards and quests by purchasing Ravenloft or the coming Legends of Drizzt board game.

Overall
-------
This is the best dungeon crawl game I've ever played. I find it difficult to imagine something working out better.

Admittedly, I enjoyed this game even more when I played with the cards from Ravenloft added into it. Some of the skills in this game don't synergize very well together, but they do with the Ravenloft game. I have a feeling that Wizards of the Coast did that on purpose.",5.0
"Let me start by saying,""This is a great game"".I recomend it to anyone who enjoys board games or role playing games. It can be a family game also,for ""Game Night"",because it encourages cooperation with all players to win.(actually it forces cooperation in order to win).There are some things I would change,but I think everyone will have opinions on different ways to spawn monsters,events,etc....I just hope they develope it with every new edition.
  My game was missing the 20 sided die,I sent Wizards of the Coast an email and they responded right away and sent me one within a few days with a letter of apology. You can't ask for a better response. Keep up the good work. Bakis.",5.0
"I got the chance to play this board game last night, and I found it to be a much polished follow up to their earlier board game, ""Dungeons & Dragons: Castle Ravenloft Board Game"".  You do not need to own or have plaid Ravenloft to play and enjoy this game.  In fact, I consider this a superior product.

First and foremost it comes with a wide variety of plastic miniatures, these are the same soft minis they release for their separate miniatures line meaning they won't chip or break, but also are unsuitable for traditional miniature painting.  They are unpainted, but the plastic color for each is chosen to denote the power and theme of the monster (red for demons, grey for duergar and so forth).

The artwork on the tiles is well done, and the tiles themselves are solidly constructed.  There is a huge variety of tokens and cards for all situations in the game, these are all competently put together.  If I had to pick 1 complaint, and it would be minor, it is that there are too many different varieties of tokens, and unless you put together some sort of sorting mechanism (plastic baggies work fine) it's easy to get the things you are looking for lost in a pile of tokens.

Gameplay starts by choosing a scenario from the included booklet, which includes everything you need to know to set up this particular adventure.  The scenarios increase in difficulty as you go along, but do not require continuity to play, so if you have a favorite you can jump right there.  Everybody plays, there is no person running this game for the players, it is entirely player driven.  Exploration occurs by drawing random tiles, which are accompanied by monsters and random encounters.

One fun touch are environment cards which are ambient effects that remain in play until another is drawn.  These range from an increase in the number of monsters drawn to walls of magma.  Players control the monsters they place, which are driven by simple scripts telling you what they do in clearly defined situations (if they are far away, move them up, if they are near attack, etc, etc.)

The rules system will be very familiar to anybody who has played 4th edition D&D, but simple enough for newcomers to grasp.  Once the game gets going, it quickly cascades giving a real feel of desperation without becoming unmanageable.  The random encounters and events are fairly well balanced, and I found this to be a solid game.

Plays between 1 and 5.",5.0
Awesome,5.0
Great game. Struggle at the begging on how to play but once we learned our family had a great time.,5.0
This is a GREAT way to get minis and an awesome dungeon crawl system to boot. It has inspired me to get into the world of DnD more thoroughly and I have been having a blast painting the minis as well. The Dungeon cards are great for assembling into just about any sort of underground encounter you could imagine.,5.0
"Good price,Game is fun can't really complain.",5.0
"My husband bought this so we as a family could play a cool game together, well its a hit in our house. I'm glad he bought it!! Quality is very nice, and my kids love the figurines that come along with it.",5.0
"Many hours of fun have been had. This is good for those nerdy friends who just want to get together, throw back a couple, and start up a game",5.0
"I bought this game as an impulse buy at Barnes and noble and I couldn't be happier with it. The entire product is just so well put together, and a great value for the money. This is one of those rare cases where quantity and quality both coincide. The miniatures are really nice and detailed, and I appreciate how they're color coated to help distinguish the heroes from the monsters. Plus, if you decide to move into playing actual D&D, you've got a kickass start to your miniature collection, as these work perfectly for table top role playing. (You get 6 orcs! Very useful!) The tokens and tiles included are also top notch, very durable and don't feel flimsy. Aside from that, the game is just an extremely good time with friends. The rules are simple, but the gameplay never feels mundain or boring due to great monster design and the awesome encounter system. This is a game I'm always excited to come back to, and one I'm proud to have in my collection. For 50$ here on amazon, this is one of the best deals I've seen in gaming.",5.0
Lots of awesome miniatures and dungeon tiles included.  Very high quality.  I would like to get the other games in the series,5.0
My kid love it,5.0
"While it IS fun to play the traditional D&D tabletop game, when you can't get a DM, a larger group together to play, or you only have 45-60 minutes for play, any of the D&D boardgames will give you your fix!  Wrath of Ashardalon has great adventure storylines, quality pieces, and plentiful minis!  Well worth the purchase not only for the gameplay, but for the minis, too!",5.0
A must have for beginning D&D players! My sons love using this as a stand alone and will be adding more to it.,5.0
"A great gaming set for beginner GM's. If you are just looking to buy minis themselves this boxed set can be a good value.

The minis do come unpainted. But they can easily be painted to match the pre painted WOTC models for a fraction of the cost.",5.0
Best Game EVER!!!,5.0
Fun game with LOTS of options.  Good way to get started with D&D!,5.0
Great game! All set,5.0
Bought this because I wanted it. All these D&D games are great.,5.0
"Great game, but very difficult to learn.  It took us two hours just to read through the manual, so like other reviews said, you have to be patient.  My son wanted this game, and he's 10.  I wasn't sure it would be good for him, but he's smart as a whip and helped the rest of the family figure it out!",5.0
"the box is very high quality was amazed how huge it was all the miniature are of very good quality (though unpainted) but even bettre that official D&D/Pathfinder miniature, kinda makes you wounder whats under the paint of the official D&D prepainted minis.",5.0
Awesome. Totally worth it!,5.0
This is a great game. If you don't feel like reading the instructions you can Watch it Played on YouTube. I decided to paint the miniatures which was also a lot of fun. I am thinking of buying the other DnD games to go with this one.,5.0
Fast shipping great game well worth it,5.0
"We have collected all of the D&D board games, and this is among our favorites. Stand alone games can be a few hours or you can do campaign mode which can last several sessions, much like a standard D&D campaign. Highly recommend for groups who never seem to want to DM but still want to play. The minis can be painted or left plain. They are excellently detailed, as are the player cards and other components. There are so many components we ended up having to use ziploc bags to keep everything organized. Great addition to a group who doesn't mind long winded games like Risk. We did end up having to implement our own house rules for things like traps which can sometimes bring the game to a grinding hault. Groups who are used to house rules will have no problem adapting the game to fit their group dynamic.",5.0
"Other reviews cover the game play aspects quite well so I will not go into that. This (and the other products in this line) are an excellent value for the content that you receive; you simply cannot find an equivalent deal on the number of miniatures, tokens and dungeon tiles that are in this box.

I use the components for DM'ing 5e D&D games and am extremely satisfied. The game itself is also great for introducing new players to a D&D lite that serves as a gateway for pulling them deeper into full role playing. I highly recommend for those looking to build out their collection of miniatures for tabletop gaming and for those looking to get a taste of D&D is about.",5.0
"Brutal. Awesomely brutal. The mechanics were simple to learn and the card effects were easy to understand. Which is great because it allows you to focus on how you're going to survive. It definitely encourages co-operative gameplay. The solo play-ability is also excellent. I especially like the ability to add elements from other sets (Castle Ravenloft, Legend of Drizzt, Temple of Elemental Evil) to create new scenarios.",5.0
"The sheer amount of stuff you get in this game is a great deal and the quality is great! I played the 2nd adventure with two friends last night, and it was intense and very fun for all 3 of us (granted we are D&D fans).",5.0
"Unfortunately I haven't played the game too much do to lack of willing participants, though the few times I have we've all had a blast.  I wish all those who buy better luck. Fairly easy to understand and plenty of YouTube videos demonstrating play.",5.0
"Great Game!  If you're interested in a board game style D&D adventure, this is a great start.  It also includes great miniatures and room tiles that are great for proper D&D adventures too!",5.0
"A fantastic purchase. 40 Miniatures for just under 50 dollars is a steal anywhere, and because the box is themed, I can run a RPG campaign outside of the board game. The game itself is easy to pick up, a great way to introduce curious gamers to the RPG world, though there is little imagination left up to the players.
The game is not played like a traditional RPG, there is no DM, everyone is both their character and draws traps and enemies from a deck for the whole group to face on their individual turns. A little confusing but probably easier to grasp for people who have never played a traditional RPG.",5.0
This game is engaging even for those who have little interest in D&D. I have used it as a stepping stone to get friends interested in further gaming.,5.0
"Worth the price for the wealth of plastic miniatures alone (see attached photograph). The box also includes some nice, thick punch-out dungeon map tiles that lock together like puzzle pieces. The 4e-based board game's a nice bonus feature as far as I'm concerned.",5.0
Great Game,5.0
"Loads of fun. If you've played any of the other D&D boardgames, this is more of the same. This set (Wrath of Ashardalon), in my opinion, is the most well-rounded among them all. It includes gold tokens which you can spend on buying treasures between adventures, a balanced set of heroes with memorable and unique abilities without being overpowered so as to make the game too easy, and the most relatable setting.

For those of you who haven't played the other boardgames, you don't have to own them all. Each one is a standalone game, but the rules, board pieces, cards, and characters are all interchangeable with each other. This game is a dungeon crawl, where each turn you explore a new room of the dungeon and deal with the things you find there - be it a monster, a trap, an encounter, or any/all of the above.

It's fully co-operative; there is no need for one player to be a dungeon master who plays by different rules from the others and acts as the ""villain,"" so you can even play this game solo if you really wanted to. The ""AI"" or rules for each of the monsters that you encounter in the game is determined by its card, so you don't have to worry about making people feel like they're being singled out (i.e. this game won't break friendships unlike Risk or Monopoly).

It's very approachable and you don't have to have ever played a game of Dungeons and Dragons to understand or even appreciate it. On the other hand, this could actually be a great way to introduce people to D&D if you're so inclined, as the rules are distilled and simplified versions of the actual tabletop roleplaying game.

A typical round of play, including set-up and pack-up, could last anywhere between 45 minutes to 2 hours on the extreme end.",5.0
"We have Drizzt and enjoy playing it. Even our younger kids are able to join in. (They are ages 7 & 5). We haven't cracked this one open yet (Father's Day gift), but expect nothing less than an amazing fun time.",5.0
"Be careful ordering this. My disk 5 was corrupted and scan disk couldn't fix it! Had to get Wizards to send another, which they did right away.

Graphics: excellent VGA graphics. Make sure you have at least 8mb of ram, because when Ashardalon appears during the final chapter it WILL freeze up your system!

Sound: will not work. Have the latest SoundBlaster card. Can't get any help on this one.

Gameplay: as long as you got the system requirement you'll have a great time. Light dnd gameplay that certainly satisfies the itch, especially if you can't get your dnd group together. Much better game than Menzoberranzan",5.0
Wonderful game!,5.0
"Tough game to learn just out of the box. Went online and watched some videos which helped A LOT. Played it first time though and ran into all sorts of things that weren't covered in the video so I was lost. After just playing a couple times though and having the manuals with you to reference, it became a lot of fun with no need to reference the manuals. All in all, it's a fun board game. Not just for ""nerds"" either. All can have fun with this game.",5.0
"Tons of replay value (due to randomized boss encounters) not to mention more than a few adventures in the book already. The only downside being that technically speaking, you can't ""carry over"" your character from one adventure to the next, but that's what house rules are for.",5.0

"If you, like me, used to play D&D, but now you and your friends ""growed up"" and can't be together because all the responsibilities and bla bla bla... this game is for you! Come to the Dungeon!",5.0
"With tons of replay value, this tense, cooperative adventure has quickly became one of my favorite casual games. You would think that, without a DM, the pacing wouldn't flow, but the designers were clever in forcing you to keep exploring to avoid hazards and traps. You never know what could be slithering around the corner.

What I love is how customizable it is. Yes, you should follow the rules to a T, but you can also shuffle in pieces from other D&D board games like Castle Ravenloft and Legend of Drizzt. Doing so can create massive mazes of randomized monsters. If you're getting even more invested, create your own heroes and villains from scratch by rolling in Reaper or other mini figures. You also get a horde of miniature figurines that would otherwise cost $50 so the value is well worth it.

I only wish I'd found out about these games sooner.",5.0

"This game is very fun and all of the materials in the game are nicely made. It isn't just cheap toys. I also loved the shipping, came very quickly.",5.0
Great game if you like dungeon crawlers. My biggest complaint is that the rules are not very clear on many aspects especially monster movement and placement. Do these monsters walk right into our caltrops?! Of course they do there is nothing specially stating how they move. The game also could be a tad harder as we usually have little to no trouble beating it so I decided to include a picture were we were smashed into the ground by our enemies!,5.0
"As a disclaimer, one of my villain cards came with a factory defect where the machine burned into it but that should be a rarity. As far as the rest, these are the BEST miniatures I've ever had. The Cave Bears are my wife's favorite, while I LOVE the Otyugh! The insane number of Orcs, Duergar, extra Kobolds and devils is frickin' AWESOME!!! Seriously, this is more well balanced with even more new game features that stand to be even better than the previous Castle Ravenloft game.",5.0

"Brutal. You have to really plan out and strategize to win. Just the first adventure alone is already a meat grind, meaning monsters are grinding your flesh every step. The game is unforgiving. Make sure to read the rules on drawing Encounter Cards. Rulebook clearly says that if you didn't draw any dungeon tiles or you drew a dungeon tile with a black arrow, that you must draw an Encounter card. Translated to: If you stand around doing nothing, you will get either be Cursed, Trapped, Ambushed, Sniped Upon, fall into a Lava Pit, and be chased by Boulder all over the map, not to mention, Magwa walls where your Hero ends up adjacent to a wall, you lose 1 point of damage. Would I recommend this game? YES! The game is frustrating to a point that you wonder how do you ever complete a scenario. And that's the beauty of this game...it's not a walk in the park. You roll a D20 on this. Tons of monsters, loot, and encounters, beautifully made miniatures. It's a great game that requires patience. And yes, close the door when you're playing this if you have any kids around. The amount of expletives and dirty words will surely come out of your mouth when you are so close to killing a monster only to roll a ""1"". Highly recommended.",5.0
"Great game!! It is like playing D&D without all the overhead of a DM (everyone is a DM in a way).

"Include all items ,  got the package quickly",5.0
"Other reviews go into the specs of what's in the box, so I'm gonna keep this review opinionated.

I'm extremely happy with this game.  High quality, not very high, pieces: the minis look great, the tiles are wonderful, the cards are great.  It's a very fun game, and I enjoy it just as much by myself than when I play with a full group.

A couple negative things, but not too big, in my opinion, are due to packaging, some of the minis with swords or objects that stick out away from the mini can be bent when you open them.  This doesn't bother me that much, but I could see it bothering people who enjoy painting minis.  Another negative remark is the rulebook leaves a lot of gray area in certain situations during gameplay.  This isn't so bad if you can improvise a way around it, but it can definitely slow down play, and creates a lot of confusion.

Overall, this is a great value buy.  I don't think you can 30+ minis of this quality anywhere for this price, and the Ashardalon mini is beautiful.  I love this set.",5.0
"A simpler take on Dungeons and Dragons. No need for a DM, the game plays it out for you. Do you just want to dungeon crawl? Hack and slash your way to victory! Solo missions are available and this game can be mixed easily with other editions of the games! Tons of cards and miniatures. Worth every cent.",5.0
"My husband and I have been playing RPGs since, yes, the late 70s. I stole my brother's Basic D&D set, when he left it on his shelf and didn't touch it for over six months. He never missed it. I state this to let the reader know that I do, indeed, have a hefty background in Dungeons and Dragons.
My son just turned 11. He's been gaming with us since last summer, so he's getting the hang of this cooperative roleplaying thing.
Last night, we sat down to play this, with our partner, so we were a group of 4. It took some head-scratching, and re-reviewing the rules, and on-the-spot house-rule-making, but we had a blast.
We had a BLAST.
We won the first scenario, but lost the second one (ran out of Surge markers). We'll be painting up the miniatures over the next few weeks, and definitely going into our Family Game Night rotation, with Talisman, Ticket to Ride, Risk, Monopoly, and Fluxx.",5.0
"Before I purchased and played this game I had absolutely no idea if I would be able to defeat a dragon in real life. I wanted to believe I could, for love, for power, for gold, but I always felt in the back of my mind I would probably just die really fast. This game proved to me that I do indeed have the skill necessary to slay a dragon in real life, It has bolstered my confidence in such a way that ladies are now hanging all over me. I am no longer afraid of a dragon. Now my only concern is that the stick I use to pry women off of my confident form will one day break I will will be suffocated by passion.",5.0
This was given as a gift and the recipient was thrilled. The game play is perfect for both advanced players of D&D and those who are just beginning.

I have enjoyed playing the other two D&D board games with my kids, I am sure we will enjoy adding this one to the mix.

"Lots of fun for family game night, for kids and adults.",5.0
"I couldn't be happier. This game is worth the buy for the minis alone. It's also great when your gaming group is just too tired to RP fully. Sometimes the group is distracted, or the DM is out of it. Break out any of the D&D board games, and play D&D lite. Plus you can still RP a little.",5.0
"In a nutshell... this game is slightly more challenging than Legend of Drizzt. So if you're a first time buyer from this series, I definitely would recommend holding off on this installment. That said, the classes are varied, the miniatures are exceptionally detailed, and the amount of content is unparalleled for a casual boardgame. I'm not exactly into table top games, but I do enjoy these because they are accessible and different from my usual go to games.",5.0

"If you are a fan of Dungeons and Dragons or other adventure/exploration games, you should definitely give WoA a try.  My two kids (13 & 15) and  I have not been able to stop playing since we got this.  The game requires no ""Dungeon Master"" and it pits you and your friends against the dungeon beasts.  Several scenarios can be chosen to launch the game, and these varying in difficulty and duration.  We found that the first two scenarios were more about learning the flow of the game, but things really got fun in the third scenario (first one that used the chamber tiles).

The game comes with predetermined heroes, from which each player chooses.  Each has unique abilities, with cards to remind you of the damage, healing or characteristic of abilities.  The dungeon is created from tiles that are randomly selected as the game progresses.  Each dungeon tile explored has either a random monster, random encounter, or both.  Monsters are ""handled"" by the player that drew them, but they come with an attack strategy.  While the monster cards are not that great to look at, they do give a fairly detailed attack strategy that allows the player to determine which hero the monster attacks or other actions a monster may do (ex. Kobolds love to go looking for help from their friends).  The monster and hero figures are high quality, but are unpainted.  If you desire to paint the figures, do some web searching and you will quickly find a vast community of gamers willing to help you.  My kids and I were ecstatic to find that our monsters from the Dungeon Command series were compatible with WoA.  Mixing our monster cards from Dungeon Command into the monster deck from WoA makes things even more challenging.  There's nothing more intimidating than revealing you chamber monsters and realizing you have to face an Ogre and a Dracolich, along with the baddies already in play.

I do have a few minor complaints.  The box is IMPRESSIVE and high quality.  The choice of heroes is a bit strange, and I wish they'd included male and female version of both.  The instructions manuals are printed on thin paper, and given the extremely high quality of the other components, they definitely should have made the manuals more durable.  The artwork on the monster cards is boring compared to those from the Dungeon Command series.  I wish they would have made the treasures that Increase Armor Class or Attack ""stackable"", so that they were easier to keep track of (as in Dungeon Command).  I may mark my cards along the bottom edge to serve this purpose.

Overall, this is a GREAT game, and well worth the purchase price.  It has given us hours of enjoyment and quality time together, untethered from our electronic devices.  The game lends itself to customization of monster sets allowing the utilization of monsters from other D&D sets (i.e., Dungeon Command).  Although there is no true character design, as the heroes are a predetermined group, with some imagination, there is no reason that you could not design your own hero cards.

Buy this game!",5.0
"I bought the game expecting that if I didn't enjoy the game, it was still a good price for a box full of mini's to use with other games.  But the game if a riot to play.  It's a random draw system based around a few key structures to provide a point to each dungeon crawl.  You could play the same run over and over and it'd probably be a few hundred times before it came up exactly the same.  A sense of desperation, but still not to tough.

It can combine with Castle Ravenloft and The Legend of Drizzt board games, each a stand alone set as well as this one.  A lot of online game modifications if you ever get tired of the main rules.  A few rules to learn, then most of the rules are given on the cards that are used in play.

One nice feature, 1-5 players.  If combined with the other titles, you could potentially play 1-15 players, though that's a lot people for this type of game.  Each player is partially running the game and playing at the same time.  The more players, the more monsters and traps and such, so it scales nicely in difficulty with however many players you have.

The mini's are unpainted, but still really nice looking.",5.0

i haven't had a full chance to play with it yet but it is pretty cool. all the figures (even though unpainted) and neat and well sculpted. im getting in to the hobby of painting figures so the fact they are unpainted does not bother me. they are also very useful for any type of d&d campaign you are trying to do,5.0

"I play this game with all 3 of my kids and they love it (ages 13, 10, 6...2 boys and a girl).  The mechanics are fairly easy to understand and don't take long to get in to.  Even if you don't totally understand a rule, you can make it work for you in whatever manner.  We've done that before we totally understood certain aspects and the game was still not a cakewalk.  We have lost many missions which makes it all the more fun and challenging.  That way you don't win every time.

I especially liked the more challenging Encounter cards in this game in particular.  Very fun and relatively easy to learn.  There is a bit of reading but once you get though that it is very simple and once you ""get it"" you don't need to really re-read the instructions.  Maybe we went back for clarification once or twice in the first few games, but that was it.

"I own this and Castle Ravenloft, which are the two I would always put together. WoA is what most recommend as the one to get if you just get one -- it's difficulty is average (unlike CR which is cruel) and the heroes are good. These D&D games are so much fun because it truly is a ""system"" of sorts. You will end up having a ton of little figurines (sadly not painted the way some other games have them, but then again you get so many of it it only makes sense!), a bajillion little tokens, and an amazingly well illustrated rulebook, along with a really good collection of scenarios to play (a lot of 'em!).

This game, when you have the 1-2.5hrs needed for some of the scenarios with friends, just plays so well with the whole group. It's truly cooperative, every character is different and everyone can contribute into the fun.

I do suggest that if you buy this game, play it for a bit w/ the base rules, and if you ever start feeling like you are finding it ""a bit mechanically repetitive"" then pause, go to boardgamegeek and find the variants (one I published in fact) that allow for an ""Initiative"" system - it will change everything and you'll be back to enjoy this game in no time!

Absolutely worth every penny when it is ~ $40.",5.0
"I bought this game as a cheap introduction to what D&D world would be, and to introduce my GF and some friends to a boardgame with a  little more RPG Elements than just rolling dice and killing stuff, the game was a real success the gameplay is easy to learn and the game may seem to be very straight forward but it will depends of the people playing it how fun can it be

I really recommend it, I'm 100% buying the other 2 games",5.0

"I would recommend this game to any fan of fantasy themed board games. I've always enjoyed the dungeons and dragons universe and this game is no exception. While it may seem daunting to some, keep in mind that the game contains outlines for different adventures with varying difficulty levels.

There are a lot of pieces but not all of them will be used for each adventure. Also, the rules can be flexible. Its kind of like landing on free parking in monopoly.  Depending on the house rules you may or may not get $500. Not everything is black and white where the rules are concerned. Let your imagination run wild. You can also use the pieces available to custom make you're own adventures. Or combine the other adventure system board games and dungeon command skirmish games to this and get even more creative. They all interconnect.

The miniature figurines are not prepainted so have some fun painting those as well. If you dig deep enough you can find user generated content online to add to your game. There are additional themed cards for monsters, heroes, encounters...etc. You can even find user created adventures.

Now if only I can find friends to play this game with. I'm only kidding. My wife enjoys playing and I've even played a few games over FaceTime with my brother and his family. That takes some extra preparation though. All in all this game has brought us hours of enjoyment with a lot more to come.",5.0

I purchased this game after playing Castle Ravenloft.  I will have to say Wizards improved on the game without changing the dynamics of play.

The varying scenario options that come with the game, combined with mechanics that easily lend themselves easily to customization and adding new material will give you a ton of re-playability.",5.0
"Who am I:
Middle aged married guy who loves Sci fi, video games and fantasy novels. Used to play D&D and then AD&D around twenty years ago. Haven't been involved with any serious groups since then so I have no experience with any editions of D&D that cause such a rift in the community. This means that I am not hopelessly in love with any specific Edition of D&D.

-Note for various D&D Edition FanGirls and FanBoys- If you are a 4th Edition Hater and can't get past that, you most likely will not enjoy these games as they are based, in general, on the 4th Edition rule set. If you don't know what that statement means, or if you are capable of enjoying what each Edition has to offer, you should have no problems.

Why I love the D&D Adventure Systems:
Castle Ravenloft(CR), Wrath of Ashardalon(WoA) and Legend of Drizzt(LoD): They work as a stand alone product and offer a dungeon crawling, limited leveling, monster slaying experience with no previous knowledge of how D&D works. And all in sessions that can be finished in an hour or two. The minimal time commitment involved is fantastic.

Or, if you find yourself filled with nostalgia and desire a fuller, longer campaign with further leveling options or new characters, these games can be tweaked to allow for that. Especially with some of the user created content online, the photoshop templates on boardgamegeek.com in particular are wonderful. Also this [....]
address has a plethora of new content. The extra leveling options are definitely my favorite. The truth is that I screamed in happiness when I ran across them. I sounded like a ten year old girl getting a pony. A unicorn pony. with wings. A Unicorn Pegasus Pony that appeared in a shimmer of rainbow colors. And now I am deeply ashamed...........*sigh* I am such a nerd.

The game system totally allows for expandability in many ways. It's kind of a gateway drug for D&D honestly. I find myself consistently wanting just a bit more of the actual RPG experience. We tweak the game a bit and suddenly our experience is just a bit fuller and more satisfying. Not nearly as detailed and time intensive as an actual D&D or Pathfinder game though. Such a great balance for us.

They don't have to be expanded upon though, to be immensely enjoyable. Any of the three games are enough in and of themselves to be hugely gratifying and offer much re-playability. The expandability is just something that makes them extra cool and versatile in my opinion.

All three systems use totally interchangeable materials. Some of the cards may be context sensitive and not seem to fit in a particular environment but other than that you can use everything in each of the games. This provides Awesomeness Bonus of +2.

The map tiles and figurines both are an unbeatable value and can be easily incorporated into a ""real"" D&D session.
Everything in the box, other than the manuals, is of superb quality. The figurines alone would easily cost you double what you pay for the set here. And if you paint figurines, which I do, you will have just gained around forty new minis to paint. Joy in and of itself there.

Possible Cons:
I saw in the review for one of the three games that some dude was just totally disgusted with how these games ""punish"" the players for almost every activity they engage in. The guy was totally a Hater. However, he wasn't necessarily wrong. The game does seem to be constantly throwing things at you that often don't feel fair. Notably, the Encounter cards. Which brings me to the next con and a solution to the ""punishment"" issue....

The instruction manual will not answer every question that will come up. It is left up to the players to decide how certain things should work. Which is how a ""real"" D&D game works. Your group plays the game the way they want to play it. If you simply cannot function without every rule spelled out for you, this may be a problem. Otherwise you'll be fine. And in terms of rule tweaking and the punishment issue- we decided to change how often we draw encounter cards as well as a couple other minor aspects of the game. This has served to make our sessions a lot more fun. Don't be afraid to tweak the rules in order to play the game how you want to play it.

The manuals are pretty cheaply put together. They may not hold up well to use by younger players or spilled drinks. I took ours apart and put the pages in plastic binder inserts. We now have all the material for all the games in a single, sturdy, custom decorated notebook. Which is awesome btw. (Disclaimer for claim of awesomeness: I created the custom artwork:)

Space. With all the cards and map tiles and bags of monsters and tokens that get used in a typical session, you may find you need a bit more space than an average board game. All of the aforementioned items can quickly end up being a mess. As a solution we have everything securely contained in varying sizes of ziplock bags. Including the map tiles in a 1 Gallon size bag. Perfect for storage and during play.

There is no actual role playing or in town scenarios. If you want to get into a brawl over the serving wench's honor at The Yawning Portal Inn in the city of Waterdeep, then you should just find a gaming group and play Pathfinder or D&D(any Edition). Or perhaps, after stumbling into a gathering of Dirty Orcs in the Gloomy Forest of Gloom and Terror, you want to attempt to use an illusion to convince them you are a deity and sell them into slavery in the Land of Thay. As opposed to just killing them. Again, just go find a full-on game of D&D. These systems can be worked to allow for things like that to some degree, but they aren't designed to be open world or allow for anything other than a dungeon crawl with combat and a final, combat based, objective.

So:
If you want ""real"" D&D, then you may be more satisfied finding a group and getting involved.
If you want a game that allows you to engage in D20 based combat, with figurines, that represent a character with minimal leveling capacity. And that can be played by anyone. These systems may be just the thing for you.

Also of note: The Dungeon Command games have interchangeable map tiles, monster cards and figurines that can be used seamlessly with the Adventure Systems. I love this as it ads even more expansion options.",5.0
"This is simpler form of D&D to be sure, and it isn't ever going to replace real AD&D adventuring, but as an introduction to role-playing, it is terrific.  My twin 9 year olds love it and have declared it their favourite game.  I like the way the random elements of dungeoun tiles, monsters, encounters, etc. make the same adventures replayable numerous times.

I can also see that when there are only 2 or 3 of you available for that regular D&D night and you can' play your normal adventure, you can still have a game of this in an hour or 2 with all the fun of spell combinations without the need to do any set up.  Just choose a character and an adventure and start playing.

And even if you don't get excited by the gameplay (which I find perfectly good), there is more than enough value in the dungeoun tiles and figures to make you want to buy this.",5.0
"Overall I love this board game. I haven't played castle ravenloft, but I have played drizzt. Overall I like that it is more laid back than the DnD rpg because it is much more simplistic. Anyone that loves complexity and continuity to games will not be satisfied with this. This game is more: get your friends together for a night and kick back. I even started playing adventures with my wife who hated the rpg, but we have a good time going through these adventures. Because of that it is probably a good introduction game if you are trying to get your friends into DnD in general. I like that there isn't interruption from rule searching although it does take a few games to get the flow of the game. I also love the versatility of so many different quest scenarios I haven't even done the Ashardalon adventure and feel satisfied. If you play a two player game one of the players needs to be the cleric since it seems harderto survive than the drizzt game. Right now my wife and I are going through the three linked clan adventures doing well as the dwarf fighter and human cleric. Enjoy!",5.0
I got this game from a local shop and I must say I wish I would've known this was on amazon because its way cheaper. The game is super fun and to anyone that is even just a little bit interested in buying it DO IT! Wrath of Ashardalon is that fun and even more so when you have a full 5 people to play.,5.0
The components to the game are very durable thick card board stock. The miniatures are nice. However keep in mind this is not D&D this is a board game but it is very fun. Let's say your into D&D and you have a night where the DM isn't available. Why waste time setting up a new game with another DM that could take awhile? Just put this bad boy out and everyone should have a good time. I play it solo a lot as well which is just as fun too. I love it!,5.0
"This game has grat mechanics. I think many get it expecting to have the kind of experience you have within the standard D&D RPG, but this IS a BOARD GAME! Albeit; the play is great, but there is just so much you can do with randomization. That's randomizing tiles, treasures, etc.

All these cards are not as awful as several people have said in negative comments. It uses actual 4th Edition D&D and it plays well for people who just want a casual night of gaming with family and/or friends. It's nothing extravagant but it will keep you in D&D without having to be a DM(Dungeon master). That is plus for me, since I have been a DM all of my life and never had others who could DM but once or twice.

So yea, if you love good boardgames that the family can enjoy or just to have a casual night of gaming, this is the game for you.

I would suggest watching Rodney Smith's ""Watch it Played"" series on this game which he has on Youtube.com You can see it taken out of the box, set up and played and make a more accurate decision on whether to buy it, it helped me a lot!

Got this for my son and he said this is an AWESOME game and he has enjoyed it over and over again with friends that meet and have games weekly.,5.0
"I just bought this game with my 8 year old son and we're completely happy with it.
I haven't played D&D since I was a kid and I really wanted to try a table top game with
my son. It's a big bonus that it's from the D&D guys.

My son was actually cheering and jumping up and down at time as we played. He was
definitely taken with this game. At one point he said ""This is better than video games!""
I agree.

It took us about 45 minutes to get the tiles popped out and read and understand the
instructions. I figured out most of the rules while my son geeked out over the cards and
figures.

Once we started, it was amazingly fun and the rules that we didn't quite understand at the
beginning became clear as we played. We actually played 2 games over 3 hours and can't
wait to play again tomorrow

The thing that's nice about the game is you can easily customize it to your tastes. It's a bit
like poker where you can play multiple variations on the similar sets and rules. I imagine that
the other two sets in the collection can be mixed and matched as well.

It comes with 13 adventures you can play from the adventure book or you can make your
own pretty easily.

Super fun and my 8 year old son took to it easily with only a little help. The guys at the store
I bought it from were saying it's too advanced for an 8 year old. They're crazy or don't know
any young kids. This is right up my son's alley.

I highly recommend this product!",5.0
"What this game is:  A rather simple, fast paced, dungeon based fantasy board game, that emphasizes team work.

What this game is not : A replacement for D&D Role Playing Games.

Like many of the adults who purchased Dungeon & Dragons Wrath of Ashardalon, I grew up playing fantasy board games such as Hero Quest, Dragon Strike, and Talisman.  I also played Dungeons and Dragons role playing game when I was younger.  Unfortunately, now my group of adult friends are not into role playing games so I picked up Wrath of Ashardalon with hopes that it'd be enjoyable to both experienced gamers and those who aren't.

Success.  Last night I played my first game with a group of my friends and we all had a very fun time, even though we lost.  This game is easy to learn, and fast paced so there aren't a lot of complex rules to have to remember.  One thing that we all enjoyed about this game is the fact that everyone works together as a team (as opposed to most board games) which I believe makes it an even better choice for children and younger gamers.  One thing to keep in mind however, is that the game can be difficult.  There are optional rules for making the game less challenging, which should be considered if you are playing with younger children.  For us adults, we still had fun even though we lost.  After losing we would discuss our ""tactics"" and how to do things better.  We would then generally setup the board and immediately try again.

As I said before the rules are pretty simple, but there are some situations where the rules might be unclear.  Usually we solved with with common sense, and deciding as a group what should happen.  But these situations were rare and didn't effect our gaming session in a negative way.

One thing to keep in mind however, that this is a board game... not a D&D role playing game.  So at the expense of depth and freedom of action, you have simple and easy to understand rules.  Perfect way to have fun with more casual gamers, children or those who are just getting into the D&D/RPG world.",5.0
"I recently bought Wrath of Ashardalon for my son's 10th birthday.  He's been wanting to play pen and paper RPG for a few years now and I thought this would be a nice entry way into that, it's not only that, it's much more.  The sheer volume of pieces that are required to play were are their own form of treasure.  The rules took a few hours of going over, but once we had it all figured it out the the games were going fast and furious.  He has to do his own math in determining if he ""hit"" a monster or not and I have noticed that this making him much quicker in calculating simple subtration in his head.  This is definitely a family game my wife and 12 year old play as well and we have a great time.  We are firm believers in the saying, ""the family that plays together, stays together"".  I am an old school pen and paper RPGr as well as computer and everything else in between, I love this game and always have a great time playing.  The designers have really created something unique and excellent here - I highly recommend to anyone that calls themseves a gamer and enjoys gaming no matter what the medium is!",5.0
"I play traditional D&D and have tried to teach friends how to play. Most of my efforts have been frustrated by the amount of time needed to prepare a proper character. This is D&D for the uninitiated. I taught several friends the rules in about 10 to 15 minutes. They had no idea they were learning the d20 system. The game is very similar to 4th ed. rules, but much more manageable.

The one-hour game also provides enough time to learn without being totally overwhelmed. The lack of a DM also serves as a nice bonus, especially for someone who ends up on the ""wrong"" side of the table from time to time.

This preserves the flavor of D&D much better than any video game and yet provides a good amount of accessibility. Plus, there are minis to paint.",5.0
"I've only played full D&D adventures a few times, and although I loved the concept, my main problem with D&D was the time investment and my noobish lack of understanding of the exact mechanics of the rules since I never had the opportunity to play with seasoned players.  Wrath of Ashardalon streamlines the entire process, simplifies the rules, and makes the game mechanics very clear.  Although I did need to look up a few rules clarifications on a couple of FAQs, it was easy to dive right in with a couple of friends and start playing immediately.

I can completely understand why veteran D&D players might be disappointed with this game, but I would propose that a veteran player could simply change the rules and add in whatever elements from the core D&D rulebook he or she wanted to use (including a DM) and simply treat this as a dungeon building/scenario pack with options for streamlining where desired.  That's my plan at least as I have a fun time using this game to ease myself into full-blown D&D at my own pace.

I'm more of a video game player, and to use an example from the video game world, take the classic game Civilization and its sequels.  You could play a full game that could take more than one day to finish, and sure it was a lot of fun.  However, Civilization Revolutions was later released as a streamlined, faster paced version of the classic, and I really enjoyed it as much as the original because sometimes I just didn't feel like committing many hours to a single game.  My impression is that Wrath of Ashardalon is to D&D as Civilization Revolutions is to Civilization.  One key difference of course is that you can adjust the amount of streamlining in Wrath of Ashardalon to make it as involved or not as a full-blown D&D adventure based on your personal preference.",5.0
"its amazing, actually. Wrath of Ashardalon has taken the basic themes and source material of the new edition of Dungeons and Dragons and distilled it into *something better*. not only is this a must own gem of a board game, i'd even say its the best thing Wizards of the Coast has released in years. highest recommendation.

Regardless...

Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of Ashardalon Board Game (WoA) is a fantastic value at $65 (list). You get 42 (plastic, unpainted) minis (1"" scale), you get a nice set of cardboard interlocking(!) dungeon tiles, and you get a fun, very random, board game playable either by yourself or with up to 4 friends.

What it is:
WoA is, in gamer terms, a roguelike in tabletop form. In layman's terms, WoA is a dungeon crawler. You start at the entrance, and have a specific goal (rescue the villagers, survive the dungeon, destroy the altar, slay the dragon). The adventures are built randomly based on shuffling the tiles, and they are played individually as you explore. You can go for a massive linear dungeon based on a little luck and careful planning, or you can attempt to condense yourself in a larger swarm interconnected tunnels.

Some of the adventures feature ""chambers"", special larger rooms that are all placed at once and filled with enemies and a specific goal that the team must complete to win the adventure.

It's a great way to introduce someone into tabletop roleplaying gaming, it's the perfect medium between a board game and an actual pen and paper RPG.

It's a fun, quick* game to run a quick adventure for some friends taking anywhere between 20 minutes and an hour per adventure.

What it isn't:
A deeper roleplaying game with a full interconnected series of quests over a grand campaign.

A completely accurate representation of 4th edition Dungeons & Dragons rules.

Overly complicated (as most roleplaying games will seem to be for most people.)

What's in the box:
* 42 plastic heroes and monsters
* 13 sheets of interlocking cardstock dungeon tiles
* 200 encounter and treasure cards
* Rulebook
* Scenario book
* 20-sided die

Miniatures:
The game includes 42 minis, including 7 villan, 5 hero, and 30 monsters. The minis are of nice quality. They're clearly just mass produced, but they put some effort into modeling them, just not so much into trimming the leftover plastic in places. Some of the swords will be bent from being in the box. And they're unpainted. However, I don't mind the unpainted state, and I plan on using them during D&D Encounters I'm DMing at a local store. The Ashardalon figurine is very detailed, my *only* (and the only real) gripe is that none of them are painted.
4/5
Cardstock Dungeon Tiles:
They're one of the nicest parts of the set. They're very high quality, the art is nice, and the interlocking design can't be beat. Purchasers of D&D Dungeon Tiles will know how hard they are to keep together without tape, these lock together like puzzle pieces. Wouldn't be hard to use them in a real D&D game, except for the fact that they're somewhat limited, and they're not large open spaces. There are a lot of tokens and HP markers and other things all made out of the same cardstock (including cards for the Villans, your big bad guys, and the Heroes)
5/5
200 Encounter, Monster & Treasure cards
These are drawn during the different phases of the game (there are 3), and they certainly add to the randomness of the game. Everything scales nicely so that you can attempt to run the party adventures solo and it'll still work nicely.
5/5
Rulebook:
The rulebook is the only real downfall I've seen of the box set. It does an alright job at conveying the basics, but other questions I have are just non-existant. Can I spend a healing surge without being dead just to heal? The book itself has card errata on the back page, which is crazy. Other than that, it's not a bad rulebook for being only 15 pages.
3.5/5
Scenario Book (""Adventure Book"")
This has 13 adventures to run using the set, each of them varying based on how things shuffled, what magic items get drawn and if there's a chamber, what chamber card gets drawn. The adventures essentially play themselves as you follow the turn orders. There's very little fluff for each of the adventures, but that's what make it D&D, you get to set your own motivation for the adventure, your own background. It's enough to get you going, and you let your imagination take it from there.
4.5/5
20 sided die
AKA, the d20. THE iconic D&D symbol. You roll it, add a modifier and compare it to a set number. That's pretty much it. It's just as nice as the D&D Red Box dice or any chessex dice I've bought. But it's just a d20, nothing special. Nice if you don't have any, throw it in the bag with all your others.
5/5

Overall, I would have liked to see more adventures (that's not to say more aren't coming, the official ones available at time of review require Castle Ravenloft as well, which I don't have yet.) There's only one ""solo"" adventure, but I played through it and adventure 5 solo. Not sure if a single player could take on Ashardalon himself, but half the fun is seeing how well you can do.

I actually wouldn't mind running a full D&D campaign with similar designs; it's a perfect format for a Megadungeon delve, it's fast, and it's exciting due to the randomness. I'm glad the cards aren't collectable, there's 200, that's all there is.

All in all, if you're into RPGs, or if you've ever wondered if a Roguelike could work in a tabletop format, it can, and it's called Wrath of Ashardalon.

*Edit* I forgot to mention, the initial setup (punching out the cards) takes a considerable amount of time. Like close to 20 minutes. Setup per adventure doesn't take nearly as long (maybe 2-3 minutes)",5.0

"As a long-time collector of Dungeon Tiles I can say without reservation that this is the best collection yet published.  True, most of the tiles are recycled from old sets (all of them as far as I can tell), but with such a low price, a full ten sheets of durable double-sided tiles, and the incredibly handsome and even useful box, the new Essentials line of Dungeon Tiles outshines every past edition.

What is this thing?:
Dungeon Tiles are handsomely detailed pre-printed heavy cardstock 'pieces' that you can use to cobble together a map for wargames.  In this case the tiles are sized for D&D miniatures (~25-30mm), with the grid spacing hovering around an inch.  The Dungeon Tiles sets include a whole pile of tiles representing rooms, corridors, furniture, traps, and the like.

The Tiles:
The Dungeon Tiles Master Set - The Dungeon contains a smrgsbord (a lot!) of tiles collected from previous editions, enough to build a respectable multi-room dungeon out of.  With a full ten sheets of double-sided tiles this is the biggest single collection published.

The Box:
In addition, the oversized box the tiles ship in provides superior protection to the tiles within, in addition to being a giant tile itself (the box is printed like a dungeon plinth and made from the same materials as the tiles themselves).  The box is easily big enough to store any loose tiles you might have collected from previous sets too, at least twice as thick as necessary for the product within.

The Value:
There has never been a better value in dungeon tiles published by Wizards of the Coast, between the number of tiles for your money, as well as the very handy box, this is a fantastic way for new DMs to build their collection of handy tiles.

Altogether this is a wonderful product for new DMs, or for those who wish to expand their collections.  If you already own several copies of every other Wizards produced Dungeon Tile you will not find anything new here beyond the box.",5.0

"This game is terrible. I don't get all the positive reviews it has received. Being a huge GOT fan i had high hopes.

Took forever to figure out the rules. If you like other board game players like well defined rules, not rules that leave gaps on what it is or isn't. So the rules are not controversial. DO not buy this then. Several times had to look up online what other people thought was the definition of several rules.

The game-play is terrible. Takes far too long to do anything, however since the game ends in set number turns this doing anything quickly ended with us giving up as there was nothing we could do. It is too easy to block a player from doing anything with defend chips.

Several houses are WAAAY too powerful with the hero cards or w.e cards they get cant remeber now. Others are sooo gimped its pointless.

As a stroke of genius, Fantasy Flight quickly released a game based on the famous books.

The game has six factions, quick method of resolving combats, cards to try to add flavor of the book to the game. But nothing works. Heck, this game is much worse than the classic BRITANNIA.

The map board is beautiful, but It could be about any fictitious land ever written about.

This is a very common war game ( a simple one), extremely unbalanced when played with less than six players, with an annoying ""sudden death"" mechanism to end the game. The components are awful (both ""boats"" - what are that??? - and armies). Why spend time playing this when you have DOMINANT SPECIES, TERRA MYSTICA, BRITANNIA, ECLIPSE, well, a whole lot of things better?

I understand there is a public for everything, but this is just a terrible game, that does not work at any level.",1.0
"I was super excited when I saw the reviews... I thought this would be as good as the show.  My girlfriend and best friend have both been reading the books, and we've all been enjoying the series.  The three of us sat down to play, and as we /worked/ through the RULES, our excitement turned to disappointment.

Too many pieces
Too many different types of pieces
Too much on the board - with not enough contrast (what's where?)

We gave up after 42 (timed) minutes of setup... and I just confirmed with said friend that it wasn't clear we had entered game play yet.  I believe we had, since we'd flipped over our tedious BS order tokens and then sat there wondering what the heck we were supposed to do after... Ahhh... the INSTRUCTIONS, indicated some nonsense about subparagraph C of part 32 chapter seven of the code of INSTRUCTIONS on page 11...  I'm pretty sure we owe the IRS, but I'm going to check with HR Block tomorrow... maybe they can sort this mess... what's the depreciation on a used castle?",1.0

"This game falls into the ""Extremely Lengthy + Almost Completely Random"" category.

Highly recommend for those who like monopoly play-style and want a fantasy theme.

I find games like this a waste of time for me though.  If I'm going to invest countless hours into a single play, I want my decisions to have a large impact on the outcome.  This game does not provide that.",1.0
"I'm writing this review in hopes that someone finds an objective point of view about the game helpful. This is NOT a review colored with nostalgia or overly influenced (and blinded) by the games artwork.

Roll the dice, choose whether to move left or right, draw a random card or roll the dice again depending on where you land. I'd write more, but that's all there is to the game. Talisman is no more than the recycled mechanic from Monopoly with a fantasy theme tacked on. Oh sure, there are stats (health, manna, strength); there's good artwork; there's a plethora of expansions that can potentially suck your money in faster than it takes to play this 5 to 7 hour game (seriously: a game this simple shouldn't take as long or longer than a game of RISK. If you play this, be prepared to spend an entire afternoon or evening, and the time it takes to play increases with expansions).

Don't believe the hype; don't get distracted by the artwork; please please consider that there are better games out there for your hard-earned money (like Thunderstone Advance or Mage Knight or Stratego or the Space Hulk Card Game). In short, don't buy this game. If you do, be prepared to leave your brain at the door.",1.0
"I have played this game 3 times. I did not enjoy the game after the first play, but decided to give it a fair chance. The #1 issue with the game is the poor balance of the different races. Some of the races have clearly better combat cards than others. I understand that the idea of playing a combat card blindly during combat is supposed to allow for mind games, but some races have cards that simply cannot lose to one of their neighbors if played optimally (at least for 3 or 4 combats in a row), so mind games are irrelevant because optimal play wins.

That leads to the #2 problem with the game: making any sub-optimal move in the game causes you to lose. I have played several types of games where the main interaction is blindly playing your move, then resolving it after everyone has revealed. The mechanic itself is fine, especially if there is enough room for error to make a feint with a slightly sub-optimal move, then capitalize on your following turns. The problem here is that there are at most 10 turns in the game and it's arranged so that a lot of things can happen in one turn. So any attempt at a feint will turn into a game-losing sequence of events. Because of this, the only way to play the game is to always make the statistically optimal move. That means you realistically have very little choice of what to do during your turn. The essence of the game boils down to ""decide what your strategy is before the game starts, always play the optimal move, and hope that your alliances hold and that no one is using a strategy that happens to exploit the weaknesses in your strategy."" If you find that someone has decided on a strategy that your strategy doesn't cover, there is almost no way to make adjustments after the second turn to change your plan. Oh well, you lose. But you're still expected to sit there and go through the motions for another 2 hours.

Since there is almost no way to adjust your strategy effectively once the game begins AND some races are more powerful than other races AND the only viable moves to make on your turn are the statistically optimal moves (giving you very little choice as to what you can play), most of what determines the winner of the game is out of your hands one the game begins. The game feels like everyone made their decisions before it started, then everyone tried to execute their plans more efficiently than everyone else, and everyone hopes that they chose the best plan. Anyone who does not play like this will lose to players who do play like this. Among the players who play like this, the winner is determined by everyone executing their predetermined plans.

Comebacks are not a part of this game. Neither are brilliant tactical decisions. Once a player gets far enough ahead of another player, he continues to get stronger while the other player's strength is reduced by the game rules. Yes, the game rules are designed so that players who are winning will continue to win by an ever-increasing margin as the game progresses.

There is a subset of people who enjoy games that test their ability to decide on a highly optimized strategy. Those people would like this game, because that's the most important skill required to win. I don't like that because it shifts the most important game decisions to a time before the game begins, when you're thinking before you make your first move. I prefer games where your ""in-game"" decisions make the difference.

The secondary skill required to win the game is alliance making. That's fine, but there are many many games that do this part better (and they don't have all the other frustrations that this game has), so I prefer to just play those games.

In addition to these complaints, I will include that the rules are overly complicated, there is a lot of down-time when you're sitting and waiting for other players to do stuff, and the game board was warped out of the box.

As an aside, I'll give you an example of a set of rules that I think feels the same as this game:
- Each player writes ""rock,"" ""paper,"" or ""scissors"" on a piece of paper.
- Each player then chooses either the player to his left or to his right to be the target of his choice.
- The pieces of paper are then revealed.
- Sit around a move a bunch of plastic and cardboard for 20 minutes.
- If you beat your target, you get 1 point. If someone else targeted you and beat you, you get -1 point.
- If you get -1 points 2 turns in a row, you lose, but you can't leave.
- Repeat these steps until all but on person has lost or it has been done 10 times.

If you like that game, you will like A Game Of Thrones. I don't think it's a good game.",1.0

The missing cards make this set a non-starter.  I've found that my kids benefit from the reinforcement of reviewing both sides of a problem.

To make things even worse, the game tries too hard to use computer terms and often adds to the confusion by making them mean the opposite of in the real world--for example using the computer memory term ""heap"" which is where actual active data is stored IRL as the term for where things are discarded.

"I play tested this at PAX, and based on that experience I'd have to say that XCOM the board game totally misses the point of the original. No longer about deep strategy and careful decision-making, the board game is a mad frenzy of everything happening at once where you are actually timed by an app. And the timer is short - like, 15 seconds kind of short. There is absolutely no way to communicate with the other players and formulate a strategy in that amount of time, so the game is really about making a series of bad decisions during a frantic 15-second shouting match, and then seeing how badly you screwed yourselves over. Yes, it builds tension - but in the exact opposite way that a game titled ""XCOM"" should. This is an XCOM game in the same way that a first-person-shooter with thin men would be an XCOM game. You're getting the theme, and ONLY the theme in this box. The overall experience has nothing to do with XCOM.",1.0
"These are high quality dices and although you will have to buy customs dices (and if you are a RPG player you probably already have tons of dices) the Edge of the Empire dices are worth.

What is not worth is to buy these dices for $12. For $23 you can get the beginner game boxed set that already includes the same dices, plus adventure, small rulebook, maps and tokens. And if you already have the Edge of the Empire beginner box you can get the Age of Rebellion beginner box that will be available in March 2014.

"I bought this in November, anticipating I would run the experiments with my kids during the summer vacation.  Well, summer vacation is here and I opened the box.  To my surprise, there is no book to explain what to do with the various components.

Unfortunately, the components are quite cheap, and you'll wind up throwing them away and substituting higher-quality stuff you have around the home.  The components are a lot less expensive looking than the packaging -- so it's entirely possible to throw away nearly then entire kit looking for the materials, not realizing, oh crud, that that part is supposed to be an experiment; it's not packaging waste.

Most things in the kit are stuff the average scientifically literate person has around the house in higher quality for his kids anyway -- the included prism, magnifying glasses, and motor are poor-quality jokes.  And alligator-clip wires?  Seriously, if they included that they should have included the crayons, too -- which the box says you need to run at least one experiment in the nonexistent book.

"I don't yet this game.  I've played it several times with family, but I find the independent game play very odd. You don't interact with the other players at all. It takes away the point of a family game for me. I didn't find it at all fun and I'm confused at at why people like it.",1.0
Cheap,1.0
"These are fake, knock off Bananagrams. They are hollow and dirty and grey. Don't buy them! They stuffed a bunch of very low quality letters into a Bananagrams pouch. It took me months to finally open the bag and notice - otherwise I would have returned them right away. Jerks.",1.0
"Buyer beware: these are not the real deal. Cheap, plastic, hollow tiles inside the pouch. Returning.",1.0
"Well, you get what you pay for. Not the real bananagram game, in case you are wondering. Pieces are super light with a hollow in the back.",1.0
"Do not buy from this seller, this is a copy of the game. It has hollowed out tiles. Go to a store if you want the real one.",1.0
I received a cheap knock off rather than the patented Bananagrams. The tiles were smaller and made of a cheap plastic with even a hole cut out of the back of each tile; I guess to conserve plastic. The letters on the tiles were off center. Even the pouch was made of an inferior fabric. I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED since this was a gift and I was embarrassed when my son in law opened it.,1.0
Several tile pieces had letters that were only partially printed. Horrible quality and game is unplayable due to printing issue.,1.0
The tiles are hollow and the letters are painted on.  Was going to return it but I had to pay the postage $15.00 That is more than it cost.  RIP OFF!!,1.0
"I've played Bananagrams with my family for years and loved it- now that my husband and I are on our own I wanted to get a set for us for Christmas- I ordered from Amazon and just received it and I am dismayed to find that I got a counterfeit set- I didn't read the reviews before purchasing because I knew I liked the product, but I feel let down that Amazon let sellers sell a counterfeit item.  I feel like I'm going to pay more in shipping to return it than I paid for the item to myself. Such a waste of money- the tiles are cheap plastic (probably made in china with all sorts of chemicals in them), hollow on the back and the printing of the letters is horrible. I am so very disappointed right now.",1.0
"We have Bananagrams and love the game. We bought this for a gift for friends. It took about 10 days to get here because it was shipped from China. It is a complete rip-off of the actual game and the seller should be shut down. The product is inferior - cheap hallow plastic tiles, the sack is too small and over-packed. The shipping was a joke - basically shipped in a #10 envelope wrapped tight with no foam. Amazon.com should be ashamed to carry this product.",1.0
This was a knock-off and NOT the real Bananagrams game. What a disappointment. The tiles are plastic and cheap. Ugh. Do Not Buy.,1.0
The item I received was a counterfeit Bananagrams. The customer service did refund me what I paid for item and told me to keep item. Disappointing when you order an item and it does not match the item in pictured!,1.0
"Banangrams is a great game and I love it, but the one on Amazon's site is a COUNTERFEIT!  This is NOT the REAL game.  It has very cheap tiles that look like someone's kid drew in the letters.  The tiles are very light and do not feel like the real ones.  The bag is clearly inferior with a hole in the seam.  I returned this immediately and bought the real game from Target.  Also available at Barnes and Noble.  It is really a fun game, but you want the real one and not the fake one that is sold on Amazon.  BEWARE and DO NOT BUY THIS!!!",1.0
This person did not even give real bananagrams. The case is real but the pieces were all fake. DO NOT BUY.,1.0
"I actually give this a NEGATIVE 10 stars.
Tiles are hollow, cheap.
Guess you really do get what you pay for.
Buy from the company, not from amazon!",1.0
"I should have carefully read through all of the other reviews first because then I would have known that this is an imposter and not the real game of Bananagrams. It may not matter to some but these tiles are much lighter, a bit smaller and have a weird sort of indent in the back. I returned it and just paid the small amount extra to buy the real deal at Target.",1.0
"As a lot of people have stated before, the game coming from Amazon is not real but counterfeit.  I was hoping the new seller would be more reliable but apparently not!  The tiles were light-weight and hollow on the backside.  I returned the product and ordered it off the Bananagram website so ensure I do not have this problem again.  Amazon was very nice about returning the product.",1.0
"This is the second time I have purchased bananagrams as a gift from Amazon and received a fake product. These are cheap plastic tiles with holes in them, not the real thing. This is a pandemic.",1.0
"The item received was a knock off. The person I gifted this to, received two of them. The one from me was made from cheaper material, did not have the ""registered"" symbol after Bananagrams where the other one did. The other one also had the Patent number printed on the bag and this one did not. There were multiple other differences that she could tell the one I sent was a much, much poorer quality then the other she had received. Buyer Beware!",1.0
"My wife and I enjoyed playing Bananagrams at a cafe, so I thought I'd surprise her by ordering a set via Amazon. She had a similar idea in mind and purchased a set at our local independent book store--for the exact same price I paid. When we compared the two sets side-by-side it was clear that the one I ordered was a shoddy imitation being passed off as the real deal. The bag has a plain zipper and the logo screenprinted on the side, while the real set has a branded zipper and a trademark sign on their logo. The letters in the set I ordered are printed on lightweight, hollowed plastic; while the pieces on the real game are also on plastic they feel heavier and are centered in each piece. Plus the real set came with actual instructions and pieces in a sealed bag. I hope that I get a full refund, including shipping charges, and caution anyone who reads this review against purchasing this shoddy and inferior product. Lesson learned!",1.0
"Received what I thought was this as a gift turned out to be some kind of Japanese honey lozenges, needless to say my sister who purchased this for me will be getting her money back",1.0
What I received was a cheap knock-off. Photocopied instructions in a fake banagrams bag fill with hollowed out tiles. The backs have a hole in them. I sent them back. Picked the real thing up at Walgreens for $10.99,1.0
"Well, even though it what I ordered, I didn't get the Squirrel Poetry set. I got Edgar Allan Poe instead. A bit bummed because it was a gift, but turned out well because my sister likes Edgar Allan Poe too. Also, a bit smaller than I had expected, next time I'll read the description closer. Oh well.",1.0
"Ordered it 2 different times, got something else each time.",1.0
"This item/seller(ExSavings) is NOT for the official Bananagrams with the high quality ceramic/clay tiles. These are cheap plastic knock-offs stuffed into an official bag. All literature shipped with the game indicates the original tiles, so I'd put this firmly on the distributor.

The official Banangrams is still made with the ceramic/clay tiles that you may have seen before and is under a different item name/number.",1.0
"Just got this for my wife who loves to play it. We borrowed it from my sister and had to give it back. Very disappointed in the quality of the product, seems to be the cheap imitation that others have written about. We are sending it back. Glad that Amazon has such an easy return policy. After reading many other reviews we have decided to keep trying to find it locally. The trouble is that everyone is out of stock. Very popular!",1.0
Tiles are extremely thin; therefore the magnets have very little sticking power.  Fall off refrigerator easily.  Too bad.,1.0
"This is an imitation product with cheap hollow-backed plastic pieces.  The real Bananagrams has smoother, heavier pieces with slightly rounded corners.  I'll be asking for a refund.  Stay away!",1.0
"I bought this to add to my other Banagrams game. I was expecting nice glass-like tiles (like the one I have), but instead got cheap plastic, hollowed out backed tiles. Very Dissapointed.",1.0
"I purchased this hoping to get the great game I played with my sister, instead I get some cheap knock off! Hollowed out backs, and crappy plastic tiles. BEWARE!!!!",1.0
"Although this listing claims to be Bananagrams by Bananagrams, this game does not have the  (registered trademark) on the Bananagrams pouch, the tiles are not solid and easily flip because they're so lightweight, and the instructions have typos (for example, ""lerrers"" for ""letters""). Walgreens sells them for $10.99.",1.0
These are cheap tiles with letters poorly printed on. One of the Ps didn't have half of the letter (maybe it's a B or an R...Who knows). The zipper on the bag broke within the first 2 days. Now I can't get the letters out of the bag without cutting it. Brutal.,1.0
"I bought this banangrams, excited to help teach my child how to start spelling words.  I thought this would be a fun way to do that.  But when I received the package, this was not the original banangram game.  The peices had holes in the back and were cheaply made.  The bag looked like it was ready to fall apart.  I immediately returned and bought the 'original' version elsewhere...  Extremely disappointing...",1.0
"So the product arrived on time and as expected. I carefully put it away so my daughter didn't spot it before Christmas, and I've just got it out to wrap and I discover that this is definitely the counterfeit product. There is no Registered Trademark next to the logo on the bag. The tiles are poorly printed. And the instructions on how to play the game are faded and badly photocopied.
I'm going to try and find a way to return this providing it doesn't cost more than the actual game itself. Very disappointed.",1.0
"I gave one star because of the condition of the box.  It just arrived. The kit itself is fine.  It is for a gift and the box looks like a dog chewed it and dragged it through a pile of dirt.  The inner seal is not broken and the magnets are intact, which is good, but the box is mangled and ripped on the corners and the little seal on the end flap was previously cut through.  And you want the little box because it's cute and you don't want to just give a little plastic sleeve of magnets without context.  I think someone returned it but the vendor did not replace the box.  If it was just for me, I would not care but it is for someone else.  Now, I don't have time to return it and order another because the event is coming up so I'll have some 'splainin' to do in my book club grab bag.  Kind of embarrassing--at least I'm with good friends so I can crab about it and we will laugh it off eventually.  But, grrr.....c'mon...it's the holidays.  Don't they realize a lot of these purchases lately are for gift-giving???",1.0
"The game Bananagrams is great. But this is a cheap fake of the real thing. The real Bananagrams comes with wooden tiles. This one is plastic. I've only had it for a month and already the letters printed on the tiles are coming off.

Disappointed!",1.0
"Bought this item from seller. It was cheap thin hollow plastic. I called Bananagrams, they verified it was a fake. Bought real Bananagrams from local store. Great quality product, enjoyed very much. Amazon credited my money back. It was a quick easy transaction. Amazon is a great company.",1.0
"Buyers should be aware that if you order this game on Amazon,  it is likely you will receive a counterfeit product,  a cheap knock-off from China,  not the original, trade-marked Bananagrams game.  The one I received was absolutely inferior to the ones being sold in Target and other stores.  The tiles were hollowed out on the back,  cheaply printed (the letters seemed like they would get scraped off with any play)  and came in a cheaply made bag with a wimpy zipper.  I sent it back and am hoping for a full refund.  I went and bought a replacement at Target,  and it is of such a higher quality, it's disgusting.  The tiles are like Scrabble tiles,  heavy,  with recessed printing,  and there is a trademark on the brown label on the bag.  The one I received from the Amazon seller looked like it came from a gas station,  cheap garbage.  Shame!",1.0
"I don't understand all the hpye this game has gotten.  I bought it for my 14-year old daughter for Christmas, we played it once, and we both agreed to return it.  The problem is that you can create the bigest ""crossword puzzle,"" use the most tiles, and then lose if the other player happens to run out of tiles first.  I suppose we could have made up our own rules, but it didn't seem worthwhile.  We'll stick to Scrabble, Taboo, Pictionary, etc.",1.0
"If I could give negative stars I definitely would.  I purchased this game here first and loved the concept, but the tiles seemed poorly made.  They were made out of plastic and it was hard to handle them.  I didn't think much of it, just thinking that the company opted for cheaper materials.  I grew more suspicious when I noticed the directions and tags seemed scanned and cut out.  My friend has the game as well and her tiles were NOT PLASTIC, and the directions didn't seem like a paper cutout..and the bag had the ""R"" on it..and mine did not.  Not satisfied with the workmanship, I gave my set away.  At Target, I saw the game again and decided to buy it.  This time, the tags seemed more legit and the tiles, were heavier and were easier to handle!!!!

Note: I purchased this game on Amazon in October from a different vendor.  The tiles or the quality of the game sold on Amazon could have changed since then.  I recommend you check first that you are purchasing a legit bananagrams game and not a counterfeit!!!  Good luck!!",1.0
"This is NOT the real Bananagrams. I was excited to find one of my favorite games online for this cheap, but was very disappointed with this product. It is a cheaply made copy and not worth spending anything on. The bag is a thin canvas material, nothing like the soft, durable bag of the real set, the tiles are hallow plastic and the paint on the letters begins visibly rubbing off as soon as you touch it.",1.0
"I have just spoken with the people at Bananagrams, and I found out that the set that I bought last year from Amazon was COUNTERFEIT.  The tiles are cheaper-looking than the ones in another set which was bought from another source earlier.

The reason I checked was that I am preparing to buy several sets as gifts, and I wanted to give the sets with the better-looking tiles, if possible.  The Bananagrams company say that they are making the tiles the same way today as they always have.  They are solid heavy plastic with rounded corners and edges.  The ripoff sets have cheap hollow-back styrene tiles.

The Amazon vendor who sold me the counterfeit item is NOT the same vendor being used today.",1.0
"I was sent a game that looks like Bananagrams--it even has the name on the bag and tag--but is counterfeit. The tiles are cheaply made with holes in the back instead of the Scrabble-like solid tiles that come with the genuine game. The Bananagrams logo on the bag is missing the registered trademark symbol (r). The patent number isn't printed on the bag like with genuine Bananagrams. The stitching on the banana bag is already falling apart. I'll be returning this counterfeit product.

***AMAZON*** was WONDERFUL in dealing with the return: I was on hold for just a few seconds before my call was connected, and the customer service rep politely and efficiently sent me out a return label so that I can get a refund, plus an Amazon credit code for my trouble. Amazon: 5 stars; Vendor: 0 stars.",1.0
"Apparently they've changed how they manufacture the tiles for this game from earlier versions. What was once more substantial, heavier quality, scrabble-style tiles, is now CHEAP, light, poorly-printed versions. A real shame to down-grade such a previously high-quality, fun product. I was embarrassed to brag on this game and open it up to this.",1.0
"I was really expecting this game to be awesome, but I was majorly disappointed. First of all, when I play a game I enjoy the social intereaction of it. This game is very, well, solo. You don't communicate, there is no competition, and there really isn't much educational value because you are only working with the vocabulary you already know. If you like games that have no competition and you don't have to speak to eachother, then by all means, this is the game for you. Maybe with a large group it would be a little better because you feel more rushed, but I still don't see the appeal in sitting there by yourself making words. I love word games and educational games, but this game is just blah. I'm sorry to those of you that loved the game if this offends you, but we are each allowed to have our own opinions. I personally won't play the game again and just wanted to give that viewpoint so people can see a more complete review of the product. However, I do encourage you to try the game multiple times with different groups of people and try the different rules before judging for yourself. But I wouldn't waste $15 on it, so be sure to play with someone else's set before making a commitment to purchase.",1.0
"I bought this for my verbal eight year old based on the reviews.  We have had it one year now and have played it 3 or 4 times.  For us, the negatives are: 1) you are essentially playing alone, building your own crossword without even needing to know what the other person is doing.  The only time you pay attention to them is when they take a tile and you have to take one too.  2) the child (at least mine) sometimes needs help fitting in awkward letters or reconfiguring her board, but she's on her own in this game.  Handicapping the adults by having them pull more tiles doesn't even this out so overt help is needed, which makes it less fun. 3) the child is not learning any new words since they don't need to pay any attention to any board other than their own, so the educational value is less.

If you are like us and think the above negatives are deal-breakers, then I would recommend the game Catch-Phrase which is interactive, educational, fast-paced, and kids can play even with adults if you let them skip phrases they don't recognize . (They still learn the phrases when they hear them defined on other people's turns.) We have the card, rather than electronic version. It's a blast.  Kids over on playdates always drag it out, and when we have family over everyone wants to play. This has never happened with Bananagrams.",1.0
"This is the most boring game EVER. I wish I had read the reviews first, I wasted my money. No point value, no competition, you play alone. Hated it. Play Scrabble, Upwords.......both fun. Wish I could give it a negative rating. And yeah Midwest GUY, I know it's for more than one person, you totally missed the point. You don't play against someone. You do all the forming of words for yourself, can't even play off of someone's words. Boring.",1.0
"It isn't very fun, and definitely not social. You aren't really able to talk to one another because you are so focused on the game. It isn't very competitive since there is no timer, turns, or some sort of score. There is almost no rush until the end which is almost coincidental as to who just so happens to have the last piece. There is no educational value considering since you aren't learning any new words, just repeating the same words to finish the game. I would NOT recommend this game to anyone. I would highly suggest SCRABBLE, much more fun for a game night.",1.0
"I honestly cannot believe that this game has so many good reviews!  We got it two years ago as a gift and my whole family (a family of game players) tried it.  Oh my goodness!  This is the most antisocial game of all time!  You don't talk to anyone or interact with anyone.  You just work by yourself until someone is done.  I guess in the age of facebook, e-mail, and twitter, this is the game for America.  You don't actually have to be social, yet you can feel good because you are sitting next to someone under the pretense of playing a game ""with"" them.  This game should be played by one person who has nothing better to do.  Don't waste your family time playing this game.  Find something that encourages your family to talk to each other.  That's what we need.",1.0
"Perhaps it is just what others have liked about this game - freedom from scrabble's tyrannical board - is what I disliked about it the most in the end.
I am a huge fan of word games but I think the crucial ingredient in making this particular one fun is the presence of kids/teens. Just adults will find this pretty much a waste of their time even if they are big on word games/crosswords/boggle/scrabble etc.",1.0
"I just bought this item tonight, not at Amazon... it's going back tomorrow.  You can't see a thing in the scope.  Great toy in theory.  Save your money and time and look for another lab kit.  Thats what I'll be doing next!",1.0
The packaging and description are incredibly misleading. This toy is as cheap as they come. It works better as an LED flashlight than a microscope. I would attempt a return but it was given as a gift. I was embarrassed that the child could not resolve an image whatsoever.,1.0
"I let the salesman at the store talk me into buying this although I had low expectations.  I bought this for my 7 year old son for Christmas.  It was so incredibly useless.  I put it all back together immediately to return for a refund.  However, I had lost the receipt and I had paid cash.  So we still have it.  My son keeps getting it back out to try to play with it, but then he remembers it doesn't DO ANYTHING!  It is virtually impossible to get the slide to hold steady enough to see anything at all under the microscope.  It is uncomfortable to push the button to hold the light on while you're looking at the slide.  I understood that this was $20 and wouldn't work like an expensive microscope, but I'm telling you, this microscope is the same quality I would expect from a $1 microscope from the Dollar Store.  It is practically unusable because you can't hold it still and it's too hard to find your object under it.  My son plays with the little vial and the tweezers.  Was that worth $20?  No.  Trust me.  Do not waste your money on this.  You and your child will be disappointed.",1.0
"The title tells it all. My husband put it together for our grandson. By the time he had it together, the little boy lost interest. It is flimsy, not easily held and not very appealing. It was a waste of money!",1.0
Wouldn't even classify this as a toy. It's more like a model.  Once it's taken apart it's hard to put back together and both the hand and the foot completely broke.,1.0
waste of money lol,1.0
"Too difficult to reassemble mainly because the pieces stick together as you try to place in proper order...plastic frame wonderful, but base it sits in doesnt stabilize the body enough when putt8ng back together.",1.0
To squishy for the parts and easy to get dirty,1.0
"Missing many parts of the kit. My box did not include the forceps, tweezers, body part organ-user or anatomy book. Therefore I cant help my son learn about all the parts. The product itself is neat, although the rib cage is hard to keep in place. Disappointed.",1.0
how can you sell a replica of the human body and leave put a vital body part!  ???? thers no pancreas on the organizer or in the replica.  so disappointing!!!,1.0
USELESS thing. Fell apart in a day.,1.0
"This is garbage. Do not waste your money. Yes it's cool for looking at but kids cannot play with it. It's hard to put back together and the organs fall out. The organs are also sticky so the first time they hit the ground they're full of fuzz and whatever else is down there. My kids are 8 and 10, this thing didn't last much more than a week",1.0
Very disappointed with this item. Pieces made of flimsy plastic and it was upsetting when the plastic forceps broke while just taking them out of the packaging. The children were less interested in the reading material because they could not relate it to the cheap/junky body parts/skeleton.  They quickly moved on to other gifts and never came back.,1.0
"Terrible product.
The 'organs were dry, the  body doesn't stay together at all, mine of the organs stay in place.
It's awful and I would never ever recommend this product",1.0
"Absolutely horrible !!! The box not "" a little smudged"", but really damaged ! And it is obvious that it was opened and not once! It's missing 6 organs!!! Not 9 as in description but just 3!!!!! It was a gift for my son. And he was so happy when it was arravied...((((",1.0
"I love everything about this toy except the actual toy. The plastic body barely holds together and the innards constantly fall out of the abdominal window. Wonderful concept, practically disappointing.",1.0
Product will connect to Bluetooth but will not play sound. We have checked everything on it to make sure we weren't doing something wrong but after taking it to someone else's house to check on their phone we figured this is nothing but junk. Reviews looked good and that was our reason for purchasing.  I'm disappointed because we gave a defective product to our daughter.,1.0
It didn't fit together!,1.0
"MADE IN CHINA.  Worthless and does not even stand together like shown. The picture on the front cover with the nervous system is misleading as well. Waste of money.

I will remove this review only if the buyer refunds me the money including shipping.",1.0
Great idea but product was missing parts. Came with two femurs and was missing the tibia and fibula.,1.0
I actually needed this thing asap and was mailed half of the kit.  Complete waste of my time.,1.0
If constructed well would be an incredible teaching model for kids.  However....... I am terribly disappointed at the quality and construction.  The skeleton and muscle parts do not snap in place and the rib cage doesn't either.  When standing the model looks disembowled.  Wish it would have been made correctly.,1.0
Falls Osrt easily And difficult to put together,1.0
"Awful product...the plastic case didn't snap shut.  The ""organs"" didn't fit properly.  We promptly returned it.  Very disappointing.",1.0
"What a disappointment.  The concept is wonderful, but the quality is severely lacking.  I got this as a congratulatory gift for a friend and co-worker.  We work at a health insurance company, and thought this would make a cool desk display.  She loved it...when it was in the box... When she attempted to put it together, nothing fit, the front side clear plastic exoskeleton was cracked at the crotch, and the feet didn't even come close to fitting on the base.  While the $30 price tag was a little on the high side for this type of gift, I was so appalled by the poor quality that it led me to believe that Amazon misplaced a decimal point ($3.00 would have been an appropriate pricetag).  This product was of the same caliber as a chuck-e-cheese prize counter trinket.  Gotta go, she needs another kleenex...",1.0
"I hardly ever leave reviews but this product is so bad I had to write in. The pieces are  pain to click together and the tabs that attach the pieces to the frame break easily. I thought it could be a product for the kids but even the adults had trouble getting this together. It's an interesting idea but if you really want to put this together, it's just useless.",1.0
"Probably the worst item I ever bought on Amazon. The pieces don't fit properly and the box is misleading on the pizza part. I watched the video several times before purchasing. Really disappointing I gave this as a gift. If you read reviews, please don't waste your time or monoey.",1.0
Some parts won't fit correctly so it won't close properly. That was disappointing because the rest of the product is pretty interesting for me and my son.,1.0
