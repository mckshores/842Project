"Se nota la diferencia de inmediato cuando usas este cable y lo mejor es el precio que tiene. Me costo mas el envio que el mismo cable, pero vale cada Dolar que pague.",5.0
love the price and i saw a big change on my wii. everything is more clear on the games and on netflix movies.,5.0
"I have a Wii and a 1080p TV, but I don't play the Wii often enough to spend $30 for component cables that should have come with the system.

These work wonders. My boyfriend plays Monster Hunter and now the monsters are defined and colorful.

For the price, these are fantastic. I was skeptical when I read reviews about the sound quality, but I have not noticed any problems whatsoever.",5.0
"If your looking to upgrade from the standard belive me it's a big differance. Atleast on my LCD with the wires nintendo gave the screen was blurry and so unattractive :) I ordered these (because the price was unmatched...how do u beat 5$) and can honestly say it was one of my better purchases. Really ""changes the game"" for me!! Very pleased",5.0
"The Wii wasn't meant for Hi-def, but the 480p with the component cables makes the picture much crisper. It definitely worth the value.",5.0
"Works perfectly, exactly as advertised, and I can tell the difference on my 40"" television.",5.0
"...that Nintendo (or Sony, Monster Cable, etc.) can ask so much for things that don't cost nearly so much to manufacture; the name brand cables are probably made in China right alongside these third-party counterparts. $30 was out of the question for me right now, so I figured I'd take a chance on this. 5 or 6 bucks, WITH shipping. It does come in a clear plastic bag with no labeling or instructions, but it's a high-quality cable that performs perfectly. No problems whatsoever (grant it, I've only had it a day, but I don't forsee anything changing as sturdy as it is). The colors are noticably brighter, and to my surprise, everything does appear crisper! As mentioned, just remember to go to Wii Settings and change TV resolution to 480p.",5.0
"I agree with other reviews that the video for gaming is not improved in ""HD"" using a component video cable with your Wii console.  I looked at the bowling game before and after switching, and it looked the same.
I got the disc from Netflix for watching movies on the Wii.  I compared by starting a movie with the original video cable.  The video was fuzzy and just blah on my HD TV.  Paused the movie and switched cables.  Restarted the movie and it looked the same.  Then I realized that I have to go to the Wii set up menu to change from 480i to 480p.  After that the picture was much better.  Netflix ""Instant"" streaming movies now look as good as playing the DVD.  The image is sized to fill my wide screen HD TV.

The cable itself has full sized plugs for video and audio.  On my TV the jack spacing leaves no gap between plugs, making plugging it in tight.  Make sure every plug is fully inserted if you have picture or sound issues.",5.0
Works just as well for $3.02 as the component cable that WII sells for $27.99.,5.0
"for the record, ive only had these cables for about a months or so.
just to address the immediate concern:
the cables are of a quality physical build
they give a much more crisp picture than composite cables, and the quality is just as good as expected.
there are a few problems i have with this item though...
the heads of each wire are FAT. the component ports on my tv are spaced pretty close together, so its hard to fit all the wires into each port. (thats what she said!)
my final gripe with the product is that the packaging it came in was pretty cheap looking. it came in a white box that totally said ""hey...were third party and we know it."" its not that i really care what the stupid packaging for cables looks like, but it just sort of made me question the quality of the product right out of the box.

i will not take off any points for the things i don't like, because i know that peoples real concern when buying cables is picture quality.
YES, these cables are very sufficient in that aspect. i just hope they STAY a good quality and not deteriorate over time. oh and they where affordable too! ;D",5.0
Awesome game... been looking for a game comparable to Cool Boarders (play station) so that I only have to have my XBOX plugged in.,5.0
Pretty fun would defiantly recommend it but the radio and some sounds are a little glitchy like the radio randomly cuts out but not for every song and its not a disc issue still one of my favorite series of all time,5.0
Brings back a lot of memories from my childhood. But it's apparently harder than the PS2 version. o.o Thanks for the awesomeness anyways :3,5.0
"Wanted this game for a long time, controls are tricky to get used to be soooo much fun once you get it down",5.0
"SSX 3 is still such a fun game, despite the fact that its getting a bit old. It works perfectly with the 360, and once you get used to the controls (if you had the ps2 version previously), the gameplay is fun, fast, and challenging. The game has excellent replay value, the collectibles, cheat characters, unlockables, and opponents beating your high scores in game keep you coming back.
The soundtrack is great, highly eclectic and mixed together.",5.0
"i played this once on my sons x box and went out and bought the system and all the ssx games i could find thier all great i.if you love the mountains as much as i do this is the next best thing to being there the grafics are awsume,exquisite,fantastic you name it. you get to snow board down the hills a break neck speeds and and not worry about smashing your brains or anything else on some tree or rock and nevermind frost bite too .the caracters are great  plenty of attitude. i'm 53 and stuff like this brings the kid out in me luv it",5.0
"Tricky was great, and this release is (amazingly) even better.
Prior reviewer is spot on.",5.0
"It's you against the mountain. SSX 3 challenges gamers to drop in and conquer a massive, living mountain rife with ego-crushing challenges and gravity-bending thrills. Sporting an all-new open-ended gameplay structure, gamers are free to ride anywhere gravity takes them, seamlessly boarding from one event to the next as they begin their assault on the mountain's three larger-than-life peaks.

Gamers will need to overcome everything the mountain throws at them-from fierce lightening storms and breathtaking vertical drops to serpentine slope style courses and earth-swallowing avalanches-on their quest for the ultimate adrenaline rush. The mountain presents gamers with a world of open vistas and fresh powder for out of bounds exploration, filled with trick venues, rail parks, racecourses, and half-pipes with new tricks to master and new competitors to leave in the dust.

More than two years in the making, SSX 3 is a massive sequel to SSX and SSX Tricky, the games that started the EA SPORTS BIG brand. Buckle up your bindings as a returning veteran or fresh-faced rookie. Get ready to take on other riders-and the biggest challenge yet-the Mountain itself.

Key Features

Conquer the Mountain: The larger-than-life mountain is your playground, your racetrack and your launch pad. Three massive peaks offer thrilling new opportunities for exploration, competition, and good old-fashioned showboating. Beat all three peaks and you're in for an epic half-hour ride down the face of the entire mountain.

Go Anywhere: No menus. No restrictions. The mountain is an open canvas for gamers to explore-seamlessly ride from event to event, with no load times and no set path for gamers to follow. Hundreds of collectables, secrets, and shortcuts await.

More Tricks: Gamers will have access to a massive arsenal of new Uber Tricks and special moves-from handplants to board presses. A new three-tiered Uber Trick system now includes one-footed Ubers, rail-based tricks and signature moves for each character. A new combo system allows for nearly endless combos that can run the length of the entire mountain.

Characters: Four new characters join six returning favorites. Mac, Elise, Zoe, Moby, Psymon, and Kaori are back, and they're joined by the crazy Swede Viggo, mountain man Nate, 12 year-old phenom Griff, and the talented and sexy Allegra.

Rich, Natural Graphics: A team lead by an Oscar-nominated visual effects artist has created the most immersive, stunning visual SSX experience to date. Capturing moments of both sublime scenic beauty and heart-pounding natural disaster, SSX 3 blends subtle environmental effects like glistening snow and swaying trees with the trademark SSX graphic flash and attitude.

Soundtrack: An adrenaline-charged soundtrack delivers bleeding-edge tracks and tomorrow's hits from artists including the X-Ecutioners, Felix Da Housecat, Queens of the Stone Age, N.E.R.D., and many more.

Big Challenges: Gamers will find 150 unique hidden challenges, designed to test their speed, skill and style as they explore untamed backcountry areas.

Customization and Rewards: Win BIG and you'll be rewarded. SSX 3 let's players level up character abilities, win killer gear, stock their trophy room and buy mp3s for personal play lists and much, much more.",5.0
SSX3 was the best fo the series.  No SSX before or after has been as fun to play.  The graphics and overall fun of this game are incredible.,5.0
Works great.,5.0
works as GREAT as the original did..,5.0
"Scary the first time you repair, but is a very simple process especially if you use youtube so don't be scared!",5.0
Exact fit great price,5.0
Works as intended for a s*** ton less than Nintendo wanted to charge me.,5.0
Good quality at a good price. Itbwas exactly what I needed.,5.0
This is a great product when you are needing to repair your Wii U screen.,5.0
works perfectly with my wii u game pad,5.0
This is exactly what I needed and works perfectly!!!!,5.0
Worked perfectly with no issues.,5.0
Worked,5.0
Product as described and fixed the un responsive screen like I wanted. Saved $100.,5.0
"The product itself is not a problem, just don't expect this to be an easy job to do.  You have to be very technical and there are a lot of tiny wires and many things that can go wrong during the replacement.  I do not recommend this if you do not know what you are doing.",5.0
"My 5 year old son decided to murder my gamepad, and this is EXACTLY what i needed to repair it. The damage appeared to be from a red ink pen which he furiously scrubbed into the screen after he removed my screen protector(not a good day for anyone). The touch screen and its hard cover were both damaged.

Before you buy this part, look up some youtube videos on how to replace it, and decide if you're comfortable doing this.. It took me about an hour or two, to cautiously tear apart, and replace it. You will also need a special tri wing screwdriver to open the casing. It's nothing overly complicated, but you will be tearing your gamepad down to its bare bones since the screen in on the ""bottom"" of the device.

The screen i received had black trim on the front, which matched my black gamepad. Your mileage may vary on the color since it didn't specify in the item listing.

In the end, I replaced the screen and saved myself the pain of buying a new/used/refurb gamepad for $150-$180. If done properly, no one will ever know you opened the gamepad. There are no seals to break, or anything that would tip off Nintendo or Gamestop that you've tampered with it, in the event you send it in for warranty or trade it in.",5.0
Great still working today,5.0
"Very difficult to replace, but after following a youtube video and some patience, it works!",5.0
"the installation took a bit of work, youtube video's help quite a bit.
but what the video I watched DID NOT MENTION, is that if you replace your touch screen with this, then you'll see a very noticeable silver boarder around your screen, that is from the LCD panel it's self.
you'll need your old screen, SO DON'T TROW it out yet, you'll need to pry off the plastic black square (carefully) and place it on your new touch screen.
With this installed, the black square will cover up the silver boarder, and make your tablet look just like when it was fresh out of the box!",5.0
EXCELENT!!!,5.0
"Work's great, no problems",5.0
"Works just like the original, just don't forget to purchase the digitizer as well",5.0
"This is the second time we have had to order this because I have children who continually ""DROP"" the Wii U game pad. I youtubed how to put it in and then made my husband do it. If I attempted, it would probably be backwards and able to listen to alien spacecraft in our galaxy.",5.0
Fantastic.  Controller is like new again.,5.0
It was exactky what I needed.,5.0
It works!,5.0
id been stuck cuz my first disk wouldnt read and five years later i got myself another expensive copy of this game and it was totally worth it. the game itself is quite short but it has alot of options for after you beat the game theres a lot of extras and cheats .  you should definatly buy this one if you are a fan of Silent Hill like i am.  the soundrack is amazing too but what would you expect from Akira?  anyway you shouldnt regret buying it,5.0
"Great game, In my mind the best in ther series....easy to play not too hard,puzzles are easy to figure out, grat replay value. The soundtrack is a most for fans of ther series!!",5.0
"I have played every Silent Hill game and can honestly say that Silent Hill 3 is the the best looking, has the best presentation, and is the scariest of the series on the PS2.

Visually, the game looks pretty amazing, (even for being 7 years old).  Tons of shadow effects, hi-res texture maps, and some really cool ""crawling"" textures throughout the game.

The story, while not quite on par with the drama of SH2, is still quite interesting (though you may want to start with Silent Hill 1, at the stories are pretty closely linked and make more sense in sequence).

The sound is, as always, amazing.  It is what creates the majority of the fear and panic you will experience.

While the game is on the shorter side compared to the others, I would also argue that it has the most variety.  You will never be bored with/comfortable in any of the environments, (as happened occasionally in the previous games).

The gameplay hasn't changed significantly from the previous 2 games (save for some new weapons, a block move, and substantially fewer bullets and health items than were in SH2), and it isn't particularly ""fun"" to play, but the constantly oppressive atmosphere will steal most, if not all your attention, form this.

My opinion:  Silent Hill is not about fun, it's about being scared, (and you WILL be scared playing SH3)",5.0
"Great graphics and fun to play. At first, playing on a keyboard was a bit challenging for me but I got now. If you like flying combat games this is it.",5.0
Excelent,5.0
excellent,5.0
"It's a good flight simulator. I have played the earlier version and novalogic F22 before. I am enjoying playing this game. I haven't yet completed this game. This game focuses on dog fights and air support to ground targets. Landing is not properly taken care of. I do not enjoy landing planes in this game. New buyers should always keep in mind that it needs a high speed internet connection to play this game.

Enjoy",5.0
"The graphic on the planes are nice even though some of the planes have incorrect features.  The game is good old fun, no intensive brain power required.  I wish there are more operations available but for a few bucks I guess I maybe asking for too much.  You need to look online to find out how to achive the challenges (and scores), there is minimal information in the manu come with the box.  Also, I think they can improve the third person view because right now I have to hold down the C or D key for locking on emermy or self rotate, which is inconvenience while using the joystick.

Update:  My original review is for H.A.W.X. only, not H.A.W.X.2.  I don't know how Amazon mixed it up!",5.0
He order this product. So I guess he is happy with product for his game. Never complained about it at all.,5.0
"Does what it says it should do! I don't use it much now that I have a PS2 again and a Nintendo 64, but my little brothers and sisters use it, and it works just fine. Toodles!",5.0
"Although I haven't tried the Playstation jack, I have been using the N64 Jack to play N64 ROMS on my PC and it works great once you can figure out how to get it set up with the Emulator. The only negative is the lack of software to install or help, or anything resembling support but I also bought mine used.

Very simple and plug and play.",5.0
This adapter works perfectly with my MacBook Pro and SixtyForce. I have also had success using this adapter running parallels with Windows 7 and Project64. This is highly recommended if you want to play single player N64 roms.,5.0
"I really wasn't expecting much when I bought one of these. I mean, does this even have a brand name? I don't think it does... Anyhow, I wasn't expecting a lot. I figured I'd be lucky if it worked and maybe kept working for a bit. About 4 years later... I'm still rocking this thing and it's still working just fine. Definitely worth a try if you've got an N64 controller around and want to use it as a killer PC gamepad.",5.0
"Works great. My only complaint is that the red light broke. I've used it on Windows 98, XP, Vista, and 7 without any issues.

To the people complaining about low range - make sure you calibrate your controller in Windows first. Also keep in mind that the N64 control stick is notorious for wearing out quickly and that the problem may be with your N64 control stick rather than this converter.",5.0
"-- Product works just as if it is plugged in to the console --

Syncs up exactly, even tested with a SNES emulator just for kicks works fine on there.

-- There is a switch on the side that allows you to choose EITHER Ps2 or N64. --

Very important it does not allow two controllers to be used at the same time with just one box.

Even recognizes pressing of the analog button on the controller to switch from d-pad to analog stick.

-- Great product, probably going to buy a second. --",5.0
"I bought this adapter about 10 years ago in 2000 when I got my first PS2.  I purchased it from [...] before it was shut down by Sony.  I used the adapter to play FFXI on my PC with a ps2 pad for over a year and had no problems.  I have a ~$150 Mas Systems Fighting Stick for Playstation that I bought at the same time as the adapter (i.e. almost ten years ago), and have recently used both to play SFIV on my PC, resulting in what I perceive as an [well run] arcade-quality experience.

I've also used it over the years for arcade emulation, specifically MAME32.  Ever wanted to play all the great Neo Geo games like Metal Slug with a PS pad, or the great fighting games like The Last Blade or Samurai Showdown series with your playstation fighting sticks?  This adapter made all of those possibilities easy and like I said I've enjoyed the adapter for almost a decade.

I have never hooked an n64 controller up to it but I only wanted the PS adapter and for $15 it has worked for over 10 years.  I've used it for 10 years now, everything from playing FFXI on a PC with a PS pad (imo the best way to play the game) to MAME32 to SFIV in 2009, and the thing still works perfectly.  I have zero complaints.",5.0
This little piece was purchased to enhance my gaming experience. It work like a charm. It's a very great device that works compatibly with Vista and works with any emulator you wish to use it for. Very great product. AAA+++,5.0
This product is intended to be used with a down loadable program called Xpadder. The program allows the keyboard keys to be used by the N64 controller. :),5.0
"Before I start, this is compatible with Vista! I've been using it with Vista (32bit) for over a year now. I also wanted to clarify that this adapter does exactly what it's supposed to do and it's not anywhere near as fragile as people are making it out to be!! Like I've said, I've had it over a year and no problems whatsoever! I strongly recommend this product, it's as easy as plugging in and playing! I'll definitely be buying a second one later on!",5.0
"OK First.  This thing works.  100% (With Windows XP and Windows 7, not sure about Vista as I do not have that).

Unfortunately.  If you are not computer savvy, you might not want to buy this product.

What you need:

- Original N64 Controller.  As I write this review, I have ONLY tested the Grey one.
And it works GREAT.  Small note, you might want to clean up your old controllers for them to work their best).

- From your Control Panel, go to Game Controller.  Set up your Original N64 Controller in there.  To do that, Make sure your controller is plugged in, then go to Properties > Settings, then click the ""Calibrate"" button.  Follow the set up.  Remember Up&Down are on the Y Axis and Left&Right are on the X Axis).

- Then you want the newest release of NRage Input Plugin:  [...]

- Take your time reading the NRage Setup page. Really read it.

- To make the Joy Stick work (In the NRage Control), just go to the ""Analog Stick"" section.  Then Up for UP, Down for Down, etc...  Remember to input your other buttons as well.  Finally save your control settings!

If you think this is complicated, well, it can be.  There are lots of forums out there to help.  The best bet though is to go to the link I have posted above.

Good Luck!

UPDATE 9/29/2011:  It has been a few years and it is still working great.  I now have it hooked up to my new Window 7 Desktop computer (which is running through my HDTV).  I just followed the same steps as when I had it hooked up to my old comuter with Windows XP.

It is great playing Mario Kart and all the other classics on a big screen tv.  I could not be happier with this product.

..",5.0
"This does what you'd expect; it works with Project 64, and I do use it on Vista (64 bit).

You'll have to fiddle a bit with the settings, use the N-Rage plug-in and set Analog Stick range to 100% and click on ""Real N64 Range"".

I think it's obvious, but I'll mention... you need an actual Nintendo 64 controller to work with this.",5.0
"I have a MacBook Pro and not many n64 controller adaptors were for sale. I purchase this product and it works great. I didn't even have to use a installation cd, it worked right away. I'm satisfied with my purchase.",5.0

"Nothing much to say, really, I needed something that would let me use an N64-controller on the PC - and after a round of calibrating the controller, this did just that.
I'm on XP at the moment so obviously making it work was no ordeal, just plugged it in for instant recognition. Good stuff!",5.0
"I was a bit skeptical to buy this product after reading some of the negative reviews about this, but I had no choice but to try it because this was the only of its kind that I could find on the internet. And after purchasing it, I have no regrets. This package does not come with a manual, so it may be initially difficult for people who are unfamiliar with gaming controllers to use this.

Overall this gets the job done.",5.0
"This is a great product. I have tested both n64 and ps2 sides. both work great. I ordered it on on a saturday.
Got an email that said it was mailed monday. And it was in my mail box that friday. Everything works great. Great for any gamer. Plus you can use your ps2/n64 controller to play snes nes etc. Great product and service. I have had no problems.",5.0
"I only used this for the N64 port, and it worked perfectly without any configuration.",5.0
This product does exactly what it says it does ( even on Vista for those non-believers out there ). Five Stars all the way.,5.0
My son sayes he is still learning how to customize the levels and is having some trouble changing ships. He liked 2006 better as it is easier to use. Will get in there and read the book..,5.0
This game has so many options that you can play for DAYS and never finish all of the missions.,5.0
"I've played ship simulator 2006, and for me as marine engineer is very good simulation with some real ship maneuvering characteristics, but the 2008 demo version is even better, with very good sever weather simulation and how the boat response on it.

Excellent ship simulator.",5.0
So I got this and first it was kind of tedious but then I added weather and well the titanic in a hurricane can be a hoot I got 08 cause my laptop is horridly slow but when I get my hands on more computer power I'm going to get ship simulator extremes you tube gives you a good idea what to expect check it out there and see if its for you,5.0

This game is awesome It's everything I expected it to be the controls to game are good and graphics are good as well I advise you to buy this game you won't be disappointed.,5.0
"The most amazing graphics you could see! If you own a flight simulator yoke and/or throttle quadrent you can make your gaming experice easier.

"I have not used all of this simulator's features yet, but I am very pleased.  I think that it is a good buy.  I have had lots of fun just cruising around in the different boats and have only scratched the surface.  I have not attempted any of the missions yet, but there seems to be a good variety of them.  I think that this is a very cool product.  It would be even better with a joystick, which I do not currently have, but is not too hard to control with the keyboard and mouse.  It gives you both a cockpit view and a birds-eye view, which is nice.  I think that it is a good investment if you wish that you were behind the helm of a boat (or ship)!",5.0
"I think this game is awesome. I like the detail of the waves, and the water splashing on boards. However, I do think that they should have put a big cruise ship and a yacht and a fishing boat in the classic Ship Simulator 2008, instead of in an expansion pack (New Horizons) that costs and extra $48.00. Overall I think it is a good game though.",5.0
This game is a good way on getting at the helm of the RMS Titanic and I am very well satisfied with it. I do hope that any of you who does decied ot buy it will also enjoy it.,5.0
My 14 Year old son is having a blast and lots of fun with this Game.,5.0
"finally a game the grown ups and young adults can enjoy. You have the chance to play with near real simulations under a number of variables. Until you get the hang of it, though, you feel like you need six hands.",5.0
"This RPG gaming system has become my favorite, I still love AD&D 1e and Call of Cthulhu, but this system combines both of what I love about both of those.  The book is a little smaller than I thought it would be, the artwork is beautiful, this book is written for adults 18 years or older.  I will still play AD&D and Call of Cthulhu as well.  Here is a quote I have taken form the Lamentations of the Flame Princess website that shows that you can use this rpg gaming system with a lot of different gaming systems.  ""Rules-wise, LotFP belongs to the ""Old School Renaissance"" family of games that uses the Open Game License to recreate game rules of the late 70s/early 80s, with LotFP's particular twisting of those rules flattening out the power level a bit and emphasizing a more horrific and go-for-the-throat attitude. A PDF version of the full rules without any of the game's artwork is available here for you to use for your own purposes. (The full-version PDF includes all of the art, while the physical version is a beautiful high-quality artifact in its own right.)
Being part of the Old School Renaissance also means that every LotFP adventure and supplement is readily compatible with over 100 other RPGs, and their support material is readily compatible with LotFP.""",5.0
Well worth the price.,5.0
Great Product. Very fun.,5.0
"This is an excellent and streamlined take on Dungeons and Dragons, with a weird horror vibe- which is mostly conveyed by the beautiful and horrific artwork.  Much less fiddly rules to get in the way of your gaming experience, yet it has everything you need to make a great game.  Highly recommended!",5.0
"Strange, weird, violent, inappropriate for children, old-school, fabulous art especially of powerful female characterizations of the Flame Princess of course, the others are just weird.

Would recommend getting at least one introductory adventure to go with the rules. If you want the fully intended impact of the gods awful vibe intended.

Otherwise just roll your own and make your own genre riff off these dark and occult rules.",5.0

"I really like this product especially for the price! I didn't expect it to be all that great for the price at first, but it fits the bill just perfect. It makes the controller very grippy so sweaty hands is no longer a big issue!

I have 3 of them over all, 2 black and one yellow, and the black looks much better than the yellow, you cannot see the case as well on the black unlike the yellow, the yellow is semi transparent so the black of my controller is visible still, but that doesn't bother me;

"I bought this from amazon seller likeelectronic Ship FM Hongkong for under $3 shipped.

The one I got fits the controller excellently! Smooth rubber, it feels very comfortable while playing games, you don't even notice it.  My hands sweat a LOT during Call of Duty hours sessions without this case on it, adding this onto my controller pretty much has eliminated that.  Great Case from seller above.",5.0

fantastic item. gives a real gamer edge. eliminates blistering on hands. It can be removed for cleaning. Highly recommend product.,5.0

"This has to be the best thing I have invested in for my Xbox gameplay.  I ordered this quite afraid that the product I was going to receive was going to match the price I paid for it and that it would not work at all! I have never been so wrong... As soon as I slipped the extremely easy silicone case over my controller I noticed a big difference. The A,B,X,and Y buttons were noticeably lower to the controller before. This instantly turned me off of the case because I thought it would lessen my ability to press these buttons. As soon as I started playing borderlands 2 everything changed, I could no longer feel the difference between the button height and instantly my horrible gaming palms (my palms get quite sweaty when gaming) started to sweat up the controller. I noticed the silicone, unlike the controller, did not slip move from my grip, somehow it let the moisture from my hands evaporate and my sweaty palms were continuing to play the game effortlessly. About 2 hours through the best gaming session of my Xbox carrier, I noticed I hadn't slipped, moved, or wiped my palms once! This is such an amazing product and I just now bought 2 more for my friends to use. I cannot believe that such an amazing product could be sold for such a small amount of money, if you play xbox and do not have this case, you are seriously missing out and need to buy this right now!",5.0
"I really like this skin. It makes the controller nicer to play with, and looks nice as well.
Yes, i would recommend this to a friend.",5.0
very cool case for controler it keeps it from being icky and keeps it clean....non slip and very confortable for the hand and very easy to use.,5.0
The price isn't bad for a great silicone skin that fits your xbox 360 controller. It streches so it would fit perfectly and it keeps dust out. If your hands get sweaty while playing a game this silicone skin has an awsome grip so the controller won't slip.,5.0
"I bought two of these for two of my Xbox 360 controllers, and I'm certainly glad I did. They look great, reduce the buildup of dead skin cells in the grooves around the controller (which always bothers me), provide grip and comfort. I can't say these will improve your gaming skills, but they certainly don't hurt them.

I was concerned that they might get in the way of my KontrolFreeks: FPS Freeks VIPR stick extensions, but they are just fine and require no modification. They fit the controller quite snugly, and provide just a small bit of cushion for your hands.

The excess silicone seam around the skin from the molding process is just the slightest bit more uncomfortable than the groove that is already in the controller, but this is easily remedied with a hobby knife blade (X-acto). Just carefully trim off the excess material until it's smooth and then enjoy the comfort!

I have more controllers and plan to buy more skins for ALL of them!",5.0
I like that give lill more grip cause I have puppies and they ruff house arond me always knocking the controler out of my hands ... I was afraid the brake the controler but now its lill more secure ... it does cling lill to there fur but brush it off your ok ... but this was not the reason I got it I bought it cause my consoul was blak and all of my controlers were white and it was bugging me this was perfect solution,5.0
"I play Xbox almost everyday, and frequently for hours at a time. For the price, you can't beat this. I find it easier to hold onto the controller, especially during intense COD matches. It's easy to slip right on and after about 1 1/2 months of use, it's still holding up well and stays in place with no issues.",5.0
"There is nothing fancy or even necessary about having this skin for the controller other than added comfort, but my son (who I bought this for) liked it.",5.0

"This is a good buy but... if you get the thumb grips for the xbox 360 controllers they will get stuck on the silicone so its not like the picture and it shows at the joystick the silicone is way back its really up close to the sticks and you will have to cut it back IF you get the thumb grips, now it could just be only my silicone case but I don't know.",5.0
I'm revising my earlier review. i had only rated my transaction 3 stars previously due to shipping problems. After the seller contacted me to do what they could to help with the problem I have to reconsider. They contacted me promptly and went above and beyond in their effort to make me happy. Thank you. This was the second case I've purchased and would recommend it to anyone. Thanks again.,5.0
"This thing is so inexpensive and makes the controller much more comfortable to hold for hours on end. Item is very well manufactured and fits like a glove. It also helps your hands breathe a little bit if you have sweaty hands. For less than the cost of a gallon of gas You can't not afford to get this thing! Better grip, looks sharp, and is thin enough that it does not make the controller more bulky in anyway.",5.0
"Every place I looked compared the PS3 Turbo Fire Wireless Controller controller to the 360 controller. I figured this skin would fit no problem. After a few modifications to it, it fits the controller, although not perfectly. Very smooth feel, and helps prevent sweaty palms when playing. Highly recommend for the 360 controller.",5.0

"So I ordered this because I just felt that I always got my controller ""dirty"" and I felt that I should buy  a very clean case.

This case it absolutely AMAZING!

It's just what I ordered and is very sleek and clean but not only that! I also got a nice coupon for five dollars off for a purchase over 25 dollars and that is always nice to have.

"Awesome sillcone cover for my xbox 360 controller. Fits well, but collects dust sometimes.",5.0
"Just plain awesome! Yea, it's a lot to say for a simple piece of silicon but what a difference it makes on the feel of the controller. The controller feels more stable in my hand an less (in fact not even) prone to slipping, dropping, etc. Definitely worth purchasing.",5.0
"Great buy, and even better for the price.  I ordered 2, and paid just under $6 shipped.  The covers are a bit slick to the touch right out of the package, but once you use them for 10 or 15 minutes take on a very rubbery, grippy feel.  The cover fits very snug to the controller, and doesn't seem to shift around inside at all.  Also, the cover doesn't block the battery, headphone jack or charging cords at all.  I would have liked this cover at the $10 price other places charge, but for just under $3 it is awesome.",5.0
"The silicone case fits great and is comfortable.
If you share a controller with others, you will like the cleaner feel of this case. It doesn't get ""clammy"" felling.",5.0

"this xbox controller cover is great. its feels great on my hands and adds additional grip. its also easily modified if it doesn't fid just right because you can just cut off pieces with a pair of scissors. it also protects the outside of your controller from the dirt and grime that builds up. my friends always comment on my controller when the pick it up. they always say ""why does you controller feel so good"" I would definitely recommend this cover",5.0
"Easy install and feels great. The skin fits really well and functions properly. I did have to trim up around the triggers because they moved around while I used them, but after that it was perfect.",5.0
"Feels much better than the controller itself, and protects the controller well. I initially got 1 of these and used it for a few months then got another one for my other controller because it was so good.",5.0

"I use this on my white wireless 360 controller and the grip it adds is phenomenal. My hands usually sweat during long play periods, but not with this on. It feels great and is fun to play with while your waiting for your game to load. Installation is VERY easy and took me about 10 seconds. Outstanding grip!",5.0
"Grips the controller amazingly, great for long gaming sessions as your hands get sweaty and hot during those times. The cover literally wicks it away, feels very rubbery, yet thin enough to be really comfortable!! I simply love it, it can get dirty since it catches dust rather easily, nothing a little simple green and a wipe can't take care of. 5 stars, this product is absolutely needed, wish the consoles came with it, out of the box!",5.0
"This is a surprisingly great product for the price. Although I do not know how it would look on a white controller, it is nearly invisible with my black controller. Furthermore, it gives you a really comfortable feel as well as great protection for the controller.",5.0

nice skin for xbox controllers makes them more slip free and smooth softer too good deal and nice stuff try one,5.0
Love the holder! Each holder has slots for 16 games. Very compact. It's only about a 4 inch square and about 1 inch thick. Best thing I ever bought to house all my kids games. They snap in and out easily. Great organizer to make sure all the games get put back when not in use.,5.0

Fits well and the price isn't bad. I constantly had to wash hands with Dawn because i hated the way the controller would feel after a few rounds of Call of Duty. Now it doesn't matter. Low profile and doesn't bulk up controller.,5.0
"I love this thing, It makes your controller look badass and is so soft.  It has a great feel to it, way better than plastic, even if you have a Black controller this will improve it.  The seams on the side are my only tiny concern.  Add this with the Grip-it, blue analog covers and you have a great controller for cheap.  I can`t say enough about the comfort.  fantastic!",5.0
"Considering its just a rubber cover for the XBOX 360 controller, actually, it's made well...and the price--not bad at all. Excellent product for an excellent controller.",5.0
"This product is great not only does it protect the controller from getting dirty and damaged but it also gives it a new look. The fitting is not perfect(the pre cut holes are off by a really small fraction)but then again it is an aftermarket piece ,it still stays in place in place during game play which in my opinion is the most important thing. I would recommended this product to any 360 owner",5.0
This is a nifty skin for the 360 controller. I really like the feel and grip of this skin.  I've been using it for a few weeks now and it doesn't show any signs of wear. I did have to cut a little of the skin away around the analog sticks because I use stick extensions.,5.0

"I just wanna review out something no ones said yet.

If you still ever play this game, it is a great game, it's 5 stars, provided your into this sort of thing.

But recently when i played the playstation version, i noticed they jibbed out and didn't include certain things that the PC version and better version had.

First off - There is no train. The PC version has a fully working train that you can hijack and even put into reverse.. sure, it may be useless to crash into another train, but it was entertaining. The PS version doesnt have a train.. but yet, it has the tracks for it, so go figure that one out.

Next, lack of vehicles. The PC version doesnt have spots where cars just disapeer and it feels like your walking around a ghost town.

And something no one can say wouldnt be better... you can edit the PC version, not only can you put whatever car you want into the game by downloading a simple quick device them importing a car you can download or make yourself, but you can also change everything in the game with simmilar tools. You can not just add cars, you can add missions, put more cars into things, edit the exsisting map, or hell, make your own city from scratch.

When I play this game, i like to ride around in Knight Rider, or maybe the General Lee, try and eulude cops driving lambourghinis... gouranga!

Convinced the PC versions better? Makes you feel like the PSX you played was lacking, huh?",1.0

"To this very day I still cannot understand why everyone loves Tomb Raider so much. Aside from the odd improvement here and there, the games haven't changed vastly (I think Doom to Quake is vastly) at all. I find controlling Lara very clumsey, the 3rd person view not help. Plus, Lara does all the aiming so the satisfaction of blasting something's head off from a distance is non-existent. I found myself fart around half the time. Where's the fun in climbing up a rock face? I'm all for puzzles but I find these games boring and labourious. Oh, and Lara Croft is not fit because she's not real and if she was she'd fall forwards due to her massive mammaries. So stop ogling at your screen, you sad people!",1.0

"Even when it first came out I tried out this game but could not get into it and I hate the n64 old style 3d graphics where the camera angle ends up getting you killed every five seconds, espessially in pits.

"I guess I'm the first one to say this, but - this game is drab. I've played and loved all Miyamoto games, eg Super Mario I, Zelda I, Zelda II, Mario World, Zelda III, Star Fox, Yoshi's Island, Ocarina of Time, Lylat Wars, and still do, so I should know... Mario 64 is only 'worthwhile' because it's free with the N64 (in the good old times you got Super Mario World!), it looks fab (""Look, it's Mario in 3D!"") at first and - well, that's it, I'm afraid. The levels are mediocre, the control method is awkward, especially compared to the likes of Zelda 64 or the 2D Mario games, and there's a serious lack of depth in the gameplay department. But it's not just Mario 64; it's the trend in videogames at the moment I resent. Everything has to be three-dimensional, graphically amazing, crammed with special effects and cinematic stuff, and it makes me sick. The only thing I care about is  D E P T H  O F  G A M E P L A Y.

I called the technical support about the situation and was told that it  was my computer that was having the problems.  Heaven forbid there game  have the problem.  Isn't funny how everything else on the computer works  great except for when that game is loaded.  He told me that it was most  likely a problem with my CD-ROM drive.  I asked if there was another CD-ROM  drive that I could get to run this game, and his answer was that they were  having problems with all types and that he could not recommend one.
I  was basically told that I am out of luck and in the meantime, I am also out  the $30.  I guarantee that this is the last time that I purchase a product  of this manufacturer.  They will not stand by their product and when you  have problems; it's, thanks for your money, now don't bother me.

I  exchanged it immediately and got another copy of the same game, only to  find after the first time this one had the exact same flaw. Other than  that, this is a really fun game.

"I'll admit right now that I hate all of the Simcities that came out, with the exception of the Super Nintendo version of the first Simcity.  I'm more of an action person, not a sit-back-and-watch-my-city-grow person.  Sure,  Simcity 3000 is good for a while with it's catchy graphics and innovative  approach to buidling a city, but a few hours later, you'll either want to  fall asleep or put your fist through the monitor, depending upon whether  the income for your city is positive or negative for each game year.  I  turned out to be one of the latter people.  No matter how hard I tried, I  could never get the income to come out positive.  So, I did what any  distraught and stuck person would do...go online for cheat codes!  An hour  later, I was bored.  If you're a thinker, by all means try Simcity 3000  out.

"The game is very addictive this is true, It has the potential to be great, however don't expect to do all the things it claims.  Yes you have the option to buy houses in the game but the land space is limited and there is  simply no more room for them.  Yes you can use a meriod of skills but you  are limited to how many and how high you can get them.  Skill gain is slow  and mindlessly reparative, yes some skills can be raised while adventuring  but most are raised by siting there and performing the same action over and  over. You'll spend long periods of time building skill.  Skills points are  raised in increments of .1% 100% being the goal and at the higher levels it  can take many hours to gain just  .1% and you can be banned for using an  outside program to macro skills.  The mechanics of the game change from  month to month this is due to the constant tinkering by the administrators  at times it'll be like playing a beta.  Grand improvements are slow  (they've been promising necromancy for two years) while minor changes are  added and removed at an annoying rate(things like the way skills are gained  and weather offensive magic can be used in town ,that one changed 3 times).  Finally in-game support is there for only the most miniscule of problems  (you get stuck in a server crack and can't move) but for most anything else  the game masters are useless and right down rude.",1.0

"Without a doubt one of the worst games I've ever played. There is no creativity or excitement, nothing that makes you want to play more. You fight the same, boring enemies over and over in large numbers. All they do is bum rush you or occasionally throw a snowball. The AI in this game is a complete joke. Music is horribly forgettable, overall sound is okay. Graphics are bland and level designs look like they all were developed and programmed in a weekend. Each main character has a bit of in-game dialogue, and it quickly becomes repetitive and stale. AND DO NOT GET ME STARTED ON HOW ANNOYING THE TURKEY SOUNDS ARE.

Once you peel away the South Park appeal, there is very little left to stand on its own. I endured playing this for maybe 20 minutes before shutting it off out of extreme boredom. I can see why nobody ever talks about this game. Let's leave it that way.",1.0

The game was bad because they said alot of bad languge. They say lots of swears. Sometimes they fliped the bird. If you are younger than 18 maybe you shouldn't get this game.

"I don't get why so many people rate this a high game. There's nothing special about it at all. I got this game awhile back and thought it was pretty lame so the game went into retirement, until I decided to pull it out for the first time in many many years and play it and my thoughts remain the same.

For WCW's first video game made during the Monday Night Wars, this was pretty terrible. For starters, this is more of an arcade type of video game then a game you'd expect. The game came out in 1997, yet looks and feels like it was made in 1990, transferred to Playstation discs and called a video game.

WCW vs The World was developed and published by Japanese companies, Asmik Ace Entertainment and The Man Breeze, which would probably explain why there are only 13 WCW wrestlers in the game, while the rest of the roster is fictional Japanese wrestlers. That's right folks. Only 13 WCW wrestlers, while the rest are made-up Japanese wrestlers that have never even remotely been heard of. It's kind of a waste of a game if you're not going to include all of the WCW roster and have a bunch of created wrestlers take up space.

The only arenas you can play in are house show like arenas. There's a WCW house show like arena and the rest are Japanese arenas. To add on to the Japanese theme in this game, there's cheesy music that loops throughout the matches that sounds like it would've been acceptable in a 1980s Japanese action movie. There are 7 different modes you can play in this game that are: League Challenge, Best of Seven, Exhibition Match, Elimination Match, Tournament, League Match, and Double Title Match.

It goes without saying that the move-sets in this game are also very limited. Each wrestler only has about 6 to 7 different moves for you to use until you begin getting bored. Ultimately, once you've played one match, you've played them all. Overall, this game is just horrible. It gets boring within the first 10 minutes before you want to cut it off. A similar WCW game, made and published by the same company would come out later that year; WCW vs NWO: World Tour for the Nintendo 64. It was slightly better than vs The World, but that's not saying much.

Basically if you want to play a better WCW game than vs The World for Playstation, buy Thunder, Nitro, Mayhem, or Backstage Assault. Nitro and Backstage Assault weren't all that good but any following WCW game is 1000x more fun to play than this abomination that is WCW vs The World",1.0
"I get it, it was one of the first games from PS1 but sincerely, this game is horrible. Looking back on it, the gameplay is stale, the graphics look okay, the action and moves are lame. Miracle is that this game didn't get bashed as it could have been.",1.0
"After reading these reviews, i had to scroll up to make sure we we're talkin about the same game. This has to be the worse wrestling game ever made. 3/4 of the fighters are just some random people, which from their names and faces, i thought was hilarious. But when you fight, you can pretty much only punch and kick and do one special move occasionally. However, the opponent doesn't seem to have this problem, whereas they kick your ass 20 different ways. I'm sure I'm not getting the strategy of this game, but i don't need strategy to put this game in and tell it's the worst game my playstation has ever tasted.",1.0

"Wasn't the very first Crash Bandicoot game supposed to become one of the all-time greatest Playstation games?  That's what Sony thought would happen back in the day.  After all, they promoted the game to death.  Well look at that... didn't happen!  And with good reason.  The game is horrible.  I can't believe ANYONE would prefer this junk over Sonic the Hedgehog or, especially, the Mario Bros. series.

You have to give Sony a LOT of credit for all the attention they put into Crash Bandicoot in an attempt to put the game on the same extraordinary level as Mario and Sonic, but gamers never really caught on to Crash the same way.  When you think about it, the Playstation already HAD a huge selection of games to choose from around the time Crash was released, therefore Sony didn't even NEED a mascot.  People were buying Playstation games like crazy anyway!  Crash Bandicoot never even had to exist.

You'd think for a debut game (a BIG debut, considering all the advertisements on TV commercials) Sony would have made the game a *little* easier for younger or inexperienced gamers to play.  Instead, Sony started off the Crash series with impossible bonus levels (impossible to complete AND find- I didn't even KNOW the game had bonus levels until I looked it up in the instruction booklet!)

Even if you ignore the bonus levels, the challenge overall is pretty high anyway thanks to all the difficult stages (such as the one where you're crossing a bridge way up in the sky and continue falling through the wooden cracks- a NIGHTMARE of a level!)  All the lives you earned up to this point in the game will go away.  A mascot debut game shouldn't have the difficulty THIS high because the idea is for players of ALL ages to enjoy the game.  Children will not like the nonstop frustration.

I think the biggest reason Crash Bandicoot isn't remembered today the same way Mario and Sonic's debut games are is because Crash is basically just a blend of Mario and Sonic, but featured in a 3D world.  Think about it.  Crash collects berries throughout the game (Mario collects coins, Sonic collects rings).  Crash has a spin attack (Mario and Sonic already had spin attacks YEARS before Crash's existence).  Sony just didn't have enough creative ideas to come up with something entirely different, and that's why most gamers tend to ignore Crash Bandicoot.  When you already have the best (Mario and Sonic) you don't need imitations.

Crash Bandicoot may have improved later on (not enough of an improvement to earn its mascot reputation, however) but the series certainly did NOT start with a bang.  I will always remember the very first Crash Bandicoot game as being this uninteresting, frustrating experience.  Heck, just the fact that only 62 reviewers have submitted reviews for the game right here on amazon goes to show Crash Bandicoot's first adventure was meant to be gone and forgotten.  Add to the fact that right now in the year 2006 NO ONE is talking about ANY Crash Bandicoot game anymore.  This means you can ignore Crash Bandicoot entirely, and not really miss out on anything.",1.0
"DIDN'T WORK. So pissed, bought a whole PS1 setup to play this game and it didn't work :( It was too cheap for me to waste my time returning it but I was so mad (the 2 other games I bought did work).",1.0
"Augh! I found the first few levels of Crash 1 harder than the 3rd world levels Crash 2 and 3. It also uses a system of having to pass one level to get to the next. This becomes frustrating because I found myself having to repeat the same level over and over again because I either died or... hell, I don't know. I just had to repeat the level because it wouldn't let me continue.
Also, there is no giant screen where you can save. You have to find the bonus platform, and make it all the way through the bonus part to save. Happen to fall through the cracks on the bonus? Sorry! You're just going to have to hope you don't die or else you'll have to repeat EVERYTHING. OVER. AGAIN.
A little kid is going to get frustrated and give up on this game if you get it for him. Be nice to your children. Buy them Crash 2. Or 3. Or games from the Spyro series, that would work too.
If you really really want to play all the games in the Crash series just rent it.. even though it's dirt cheap to buy.. (haha) Put the money towards something BETTER.",1.0
The game was completely defective. They offered me a $2.00 refund for a game I spent almost $15.00 on. The game was described as acceptable but it was a complete waste of time and money because it was so scratched it wouldn't play at all. Will not buy from them again.,1.0
"Though the game is very appealing in regards to its visual style, the controls are abyssmal.  In level 1-3 at the end of the level, you are required to perform a ""whack-a-mole"" type game in order to get the last gobbo.  Since the controls (or uncontrols) are glitchy at best and unplayable at worst, the game begins to not be a game and more of a nuisance.  The analog versus digital controls have no bearing to eachother and you find yourself toggling back and forth just so you can have some margin of control.  A game to avoid by any standard.",1.0

"As a child I adored the Croc game, so just the other day I picked it back up to have another go. Oh my goodness, no amount of nostalgic fondness can save this thing.
The graphics aren't great but you really can't complain about that as this game dates back to the 90's, but by Playstation One standards it does pretty well. The story is sweet and the characters are endearing (Croc makes cute noises and the fuzzy little Gobbos are adorable). The levels and puzzles are simple but of an appropriate difficulty for a child. The music is probably the best thing about this game as it is light, catchy and matches the atmosphere. So with all that it has going for it why am I ranking Croc so low? The gameplay. Oh dear God the gameplay.
The controls for this poor game are so terrible that it's nearly unplayable. In the very first area I died several times simply trying to jump over a small pit. Even walking poses a serious and frustrating challenge. The controls go from being unresponsive to overly sensitive seemingly at will meaning that Croc will more than likely not jump when you tell him to or completely overshoot his target, usually resulting in a death. The enemies regenerate in under 30 seconds, and considering that it takes you about that long just to turn around there is almost no point in killing them.
This game could have been great, it has all the elements of a charming and worthwhile children's game, but when even walking around is a serious problem there is little to no enjoyment that you or your child will derive from this game. Save your money and stick to Spyro.",1.0
"Unless you still have a PS 1 and like it, the game sucks. Bought it for my Son(5) and playing it on a PS2.

It may be a very nice Game but the controller use make it suck. Comon, we are in 2011. It may be my bad do not know more about PS1 use, still, if I had read a review about that I wouldnt had bought the game. My Son played TY2 all the way trought with some help of me. We are not big gamers but like jump n' run games.
So, please be aware of the controller use limit. The game will en up in the corner. Very sad, shipping and the item it self where very good. Hope the TY1 is better(is in the Mail). LOL, yes, lots of old games but my son is 5, so let him scratch or kill the game on accitent, same as the PS2, it's not a big Deal.

"Who created this game and why? I get the concept and it's a really good one. Then why did I give it one star? This game is created for people who find Call of Duty and Halo so easy they get bored and refuse to play them. The mini-games must be beaten absolutely flawlessly or you don't get any points whatsoever. Sometimes you even lose points for not absolutely mastering the mini-game. If you're 99% perfect, sorry no points. The biggest flaw in this game is that it has to be four players. If you don't have four players then the computer will take over the rest. Be warned, the computer always wins every single mini game. There's a choice for computer skill...easy, normal, or hard...huh? What is hard skill? Does that mean the game is hard for the computer player or the computer player is hard for you to beat? No explanation whatsoever. But, it does not matter, Ive tried all three settings multiple times and it makes no difference in the computer's amazing flawless skill at mastering the game. The point of the game is to get 20 coins, by absolutely mastering the mini-games as flawlessly as inhumanly possible, then randomly landing on the space where Toad is selling stars for 20 coins. Watch out, there's also a space where, if they have 50 coins, other players can steal your star. They should call this game Star Stealers. The only real trick to the game is to be the one who lands on the star stealing spot the most times...and thus steal everyone else's stars. There's no friendly competition here...it's all about bing underhanded. If you don't have 50 coins to steal a star you can, for zero coins, steal coins from other players. this game always leads to everyone ganging up on the player who is doing the best. There's no skill involved to winning the game over all because it's all about who's lucky enough to land on the star stealing spot the most times. One turn your in first place and the next your in fourth, but when you're in fourth you're stuck. Whoever happens to have the most stars when the game ends wins the game no matter how poorly you played the game. Oh, and don't forget they the shortest version of the game takes 45 minutes minimum. The longest version takes 3+ hours. Ridiculous and frustrating to no end. Its a game that takes a minimal of an hour to lose. No thank you! You should try Chef's Luv Shack, it's based on the same concept but you can actually win the mini-games once in a while.",1.0

"I bought Mario Party used for nearly twenty bucks, and it was a total waste (I've since exchanged it for two games I love). The favorable reviews here were what suckered me into buying Mario Party, by the way. Whether you're playing solo or with a group, there is NO skill required in this game. The game rolls the die for you each turn, and the steps you move on the board are obviously based on those rolls. Traditionally, a player plays a game. In Mario Party, the game plays you, and therefore, you have little to no control over how the game unfolds. A game without skill is a game best left unplayed. At least, that's my belief. This game spawned at least six sequels; I'm sure it's because people wrongfully assume that everything Mario-related is heaven-sent. Avoid this game. I'm not too keen on N64 games in general, but there were a few nice ones. Laugh if you want, but Pokemon Puzzle League was one of those few. It has some beautiful FMV scenes in between each round beaten, hand-drawn anime backgrounds during the in-game puzzle portion, and tons of side games. I'm not a big fan of the show, but I do recognize when a game has a lot of time and effort put into it. Mario Party isn't one of those kinds of games.

"...in more ways than one.  Besides the overall poor quality of the game, there was that camera!  Honestly, whoever designed that thing needs to be smacked with a wet fish.
I played levels 1 through 10, and then had to stop just before the end of the game because I was nauseated and had an eyestrain headache.  I am not exaggerating.
The camera has a tendency to swirl around when you need it to stay still, and to sit still when you need it to move.  The grainy, pixelated graphics and complete lack of distinguishing features in the levels make it not only very easy to get lost, but also very hard on the eyes.  When you need to jump across platforms or walk AROUND something, that's when things really get bad.  Flik leaves almost no shadow on the ground when he jumps, so your jumps will usually be blind leaps of faith.  The other problem is his feet.  He dangles his feet so low when he jumps, that 9 times out of 10 you will miss a platform because his feet won't plant on it.  And, when he does land, he won't stop running, which will send him promptly stepping right off the other end of the thing and forcing you to do the jump all over again.
The other problem is the camera angles when walking around something.  When you walk around to the other side of a large object, for some idiotic reason, the camera does not follow you.  As a result, you are sitting there with your entire screen filled in by this object while you can't see Flik on the other side.  Now, as if that situation is not bad enough, picture yourself having to do a platform jump while your view of Flik is completely blocked by a large rock on the screen, or being hit by an enemy that you can't see because the camera won't move.  Instead of turning with you, you must stop for about 5 seconds after turning to allow the camera to ""catch up.""  At the same time, the camera has a tendency to turn even while you're just running straight ahead in a single direction, which results in you being completely reversed.  It's completely disorienting, and with the bland, nearly identical levels, you can find yourself lost and irritated very frequently.
It's all fun and games, until you've developed a tension headache trying to look at the bad graphics and camera angles, and flung your controller across the room because you just don't feel like attempting that same jump for the 89th time.  Please, stay away from this one.  Don't become an accomplice to anymore game companies trying to cash in on a movie franchise.",1.0
"This game is one of the worst games that Disney Interactive ever created. When you first put it in and see the movie you think that it will be great but then you have only 2 level choices Training and Anthill. I like Training better than Anthill but it still stinks. Also the game freezes too often. When I was on the 5th Level the one where you hop on the dandelion and get across the Canyon without the bird killing you. I was across the canyon and then the game froze and I had to start over and that was the level that I always have trouble with that level.
Another thing that bugs me is that the stupid worm takes about 100 red berries to kill and only 4 blue berries 2 green, and purple berries. And it still takes two gold berries to kill it!!!
Same thing with the one bug that guards the fence takes 100-150 reds 6 blues 3 green 2 purple and 2 gold and that ticks me off really bad. This game stinks and you definetly DO NOT want to buy this game.

"The product arrived in its original case with game booklet. The case was cracked and the CD had minor scratches on it. The gameplay controls are very confusing and difficult. It takes some getting used to. The image was very dark, not sure if it was my TV but no other games have ever had this problem. The in-game options did not have and actual brightness setting to help me with this. The sound during gameplay will randomly crackle and or stop all together. Overall i was not happy with the game itself. I had no problems with the provider or the arrival of the product.",1.0
"I don't really like this game at all.  The game play is choppy, the plot is lacking (basically there is no plot) and it is borring.  There are many more shooter games out there that are much better.",1.0
"This game is so stupid like one of the revier's said all you do is find stuff and haveto find the exit door. And the last three levels are impossible to beat because they all look the same and you keep finding the same door you went through before. This game is like doom, you know the one where you just see the weapon. Dont' get me wrong the graphics were cool but it just sucked and the only way to beat it is if you cheat.",1.0
"Let's see, in this game, #1. no multi player #2. no hidden cars, this was the appeal of the first game in my opinion. Don't waste your money, even if you find it used, like I did.

"I love puzzles... I mean, I LOVE PUZZLES.

But I don't love this.

Not only is this game boring, the graphics aren't too great either (even for PS one... my other games look better than this).

I think I'm better off playing puzzle games online for free...",1.0
"Okay I'm not totally lowbrow, I can get puzzles (I got near the end of this game called Lighthouse). I couldn't get this at all when I played it, not even a bit. You roam around this island getting fragmented information, and at least on the computer the puzzle hit-detection seemed weak, so trying to access the puzzles themselves even with a guide was a frustrating endeavor. The puzzles themselves were bad enough, but the fact that solving some of them didn't seem to change anything discernible (at least in the early stages of the game) meant I ultimately gave up in frustration.  Not to mention it wasn't even fun.

Instead of this, I'd recommend Okami or any other hybrid puzzle-rpg.  If you can't figure out the puzzle with the tools possessed, you can at least take out your frustrations on a hapless creature in battle.",1.0

"I purchased this item so I could play Donkey Kong 64 after receiving an N64 from my girlfriend for Christmas. After opening my package, I was a bit disappointed to find a second hand, knock off, non Nintendo licensed product. However, I decided to give this product a shot and was delightfully surprised when the game began to play normally, tthat is until I began to hear a strange buzzing sound coming from the system 5 minutes into playing the game. Ignoring the sound, I continued to play and finally, 10 minutes into playing, the game froze. I tried this about 5 more times all with the same result. First the sound, then the game would freeze. Please save your money and go to eBay or anywhere else to purchase this product so you do not receive this knock off product that DOES NOT WORK.I feel cheated and am extremely disappointed.",1.0

Products offered by many marketplace sellers are not original Nintendo Brand. Often they are unlicensed third party knock-off expansion packs. Ive personally had these damage a system and ruin games.
