"this is not what I expected, I wanted a shorter reel as far as height goes, it is hard to store and heavy, I hardly use the stuff I wanted the paer to be not so tall.",2.0
There were way too many sheets of very dark colors. I have to throw away quite a bit. I would have preferred mostly light shades.,2.0
tissue paper squares are too small to use for most wrappin projects,2.0
These are small squares of tissue paper.  Just be warned.,2.0
"Super thin, tear very easily.",2.0
I thought this was tissue paper to wrap with. The colors are beautiful but the sheets are small if using for wrapping,2.0
"The colors of the tissues are very vibrant.  They are so small though, you have to use several sheets to do the job.  Not good for a gift bag where you want the tissue to stick out the top.  These tissues are too small for that so you have to use a bunch of them.  I did not want to pay a lot, so I guess you get what you pay for.",2.0
"This was a very disappointing set of tissue paper. If you are looking for nice tissue to line gift bags, please note .. Do not touch the paper with even slightly wet hands or the dye will come off onto your skin! The paper is soooooo thin, nothing like the tissue I normally use for gifts. Also, it is half or less than half of the size of tissue paper I normally buy.

For this price, totally NOT worth it!",2.0
They crumble when you try and make solid areas of color. :( Kinda like cheap crayons or something. Not smooth and greasy like they should be. Super disappointing.,2.0
"These are more accurately described as vibrant oil crayon, these do not blend well and you cannot layer them.  Those are the two main reasons we got oil pastels to work with. I'm going to stick with the Pentel set from now on.",2.0
these do not miss well nor do they move on the paper to blend.,2.0
"These sticks do not color smoothly, and they don't cover completely.  My hands were a mess after using, and there were flakes of color all over, that smeared.  I have other oil pastels that are flat and not sharpened so we tried these.  Too messy so we will stick to crayons and colored pencils.",2.0
Grainier than I expected,2.0
Color payoff isn't very good.  Hard to color or anything with.,2.0
"Not that great, even for beginners.",2.0
"for me, these don't work well, leaking is not acceptable, but maybe I didn't know how to use?",2.0
The crayon count is never accurate. The only reason why I keep reordering is because I need a lot of crayons and Amazon is the cheapest.,2.0
"I didn't get a yellow marker, instead I got 2 black ones. Didn't notice until my student brought it to my attention. That's why I gave it 2 stars.",2.0
Missing a fine point marker,2.0
My 20% gray pen arrived almost dried up.,2.0
"I have bought Prismacolor markers for decades but this last time, OMG what did they change that makes them so hard to open? Seriously have to
struggle taking the caps off almost every time!!  The markers ( once the caps is off ) seems to be the same good quality but when my husband has to fight removing the cap, well that's just a nuisance. This is why I only gave the review 2 stars. If you have trouble with your hands I wouldn't order these.",2.0
"Very disappointed to see that 4 out of the 72 markers are not ""double-ended"" markers. Feels like it was an open box filled with ramdon replacement items. That was so not acceptable! And some of the markers came already dried (or almost dried) out.",2.0
Love the selection of colors but many of the markers came already dried (or almost dried) out.,2.0
The caps are ridiculously hard to get off!  Expensive too.,2.0
All the colors are already a bit dried out. A couple of colors are completely dried and even the tip is falling out. Poor quality and I am so disappointed. Hoping to get a refund...,2.0
"I am not a fan of these markers because they bleed terribly.  The colors themselves are great, but these suck for art because the precision is terrible.",2.0
"Alright, so not impossible, but three of us of different ages tried by hand and no-go! Had to use pliers and not just the first time. This is an obvious quality control issue and incredibly easy to fix at the factory, but that something so BASIC actually passed QC does not bode well.

They are essentially unusable. Due to other happennings in Life, we missed the deadline to return/exchange but, looking at other reviews, that might not have helped!

 Why did they not track the batch with the fault and have a corrected batch ready to go to handle complaints? Why did they, according to their other reviews, ship replacements from the same defective batch! Unbelievable and a smear on their brand that will cost them more in the long-run. So, poor QC, poor customer service and poor logical thinking in the handling of the whole mess. Perhaps avoid all this company's products?",2.0
"I gave these markers two stars, because they are way too saturated for me and don't have a fine tip which is something I need. I ended up giving them away to someone who makes posters. I can see where the saturation would be good for posters. I've settled on the Copic markers because they are good for layering, shadowing and painting people. Prismacolor makes good quality art supplies, and I own a large assortment of their colored pencils. These saturated markers might be what you're looking for but they're not for me.",2.0
Streaks.  Some pens didn't want to work at all.  I was unhappily surprised.  Colors spread over lines.,2.0
"At first I thought these markers would be the trick to my satisfaction since their manga kit pleases me BUT I WAS WRONG.
First being I had a few colors missing the nib of the marker, but finding out today was the least of my worries.
I keep my rooms temperature right around 60 - 65 degrees (Fahrenheit), today I opened my dry sealed marker box to color a picture. And found a thin sticky substance coating my Copic markers. It was coming from one of the gold paint pens provided in this prismacolor box. Which managed to ruin about 12 of my Copic markers (which will cost about $60 to replace) the leak seemed to start from a screw point in this marker WHICH I NEVER USED.",2.0
"I love the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prismacolor-Premier-Illustration-Markers-Brush-Tip-Set-of-8-Assorted-Colors-1736674/dp/B0038D97AA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prismacolor Premier Illustration Markers, Brush Tip, Set of 8 Assorted Colors  (1736674)</a>&nbsp;ones by Prismacolor, but they didn't have the expanded color palette I needed. So I branched out and got these double-ended ones. I did NOT like them at all.

For clarification, I am NOT an artist - this review is solely based on my use of them for Adult Coloring Books. Specifically, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secret-Garden-An-Inky-Treasure-Hunt-and-Coloring-Book/dp/1780671067/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt and Coloring Book</a>.

BUT, I do NOT like the Double Tipped Markers. I DID like that these markers come in TONS of colors. I even went and bought some that were the single markers just to get some extra colors - like the light blue in the photo. Unfortunately, they don't write/draw/color at all like the 'brush tips;' which are awesome. These are firm and clumsy for fine detail coloring. Additionally, I didn't like the thickness of these in my hand - they're really wide.

Most importantly, I was SO DISAPPOINTED to realize these big fat markers by Prismacolor BLEED. On one page, I used all brush tip markers EXCEPT for some spots of light blue. It was a lighter color than all the others, and made by the same company, so surely (I thought) it wouldn't bleed. It did - see photos. The first photos are a page colored with the standard brush tips by Prismacolor. They didn't bleed. I used ONE of the Double-Ended Brush Tips (THIS type of marker), the light blue, and it DID bleed. The owl image is the backside of that same page. So sad. I hope this review is helpful to others considering these markers for the same purpose. Now, if you're an artist or designer, you may have a completely different experience. I found these inferior to the single-ended brush tip markers by Prismacolor... (The ones I  DID like are shown in the last two photos)",2.0
Many of the markers came dried out.,2.0
"I purchased these to use with an adult coloring book, and this was a mistake. I know that it's awesome to use fancy markers and fancy colored pencils for detail in those books, but this product is not compatible. They bleed through regular paper and cardstock, much worse than Sharpie markers. I think this was made for some sort of special sketch paper. Do not make the same mistake I did, and attempt to use them on adult coloring books. Stick to colored pencils or whatever else you can find for that.",2.0
"Pay the extra money and buy yourself a set of Copic markers. These do not blend at all, making them terrible for hand rendering. Don't make the same mistake I did- Copic is standard for a reason.",2.0
They dry out rather quickly... I only had 4 posters to do and one of each of three colors was already drying out and two of the blacks I couldn't use.,2.0
I found them to be a bit dry. The black one was already dried up.,2.0
"When I received the markers, half of the markers were dried out and unusable for my work. I have messed up my art because of this. And also, the colors for skin tones, are severally lacking. They have paint markers, (Metallic silver, and Matallic gold) for what?? Instead of giving me something I would never use in my art, why don't you give me some more skin tones I could use? A lot of the skin tones are too transparent or they are too dark to make realistic skin tones. I am not satisfied with the product in general, it is okay for students and people who want to do this a hobby and downtime. But for people that want to create works of art, it is not worth it. Not buying these markers in a set like this, this set is completely useless, and it is my fault. You must buy them individually or in a smaller size to get what you want. Please do not be lazy like I was, I wasted money because of this. I'm investing in Copics next time around, more expensive however I will get the results I need for my art!!!",2.0
"I received the 12pk. Of chisel/fine tip markers today. The chisel tip on the blue marker is not correct, it looks like it was cut off or something, and is unusable. These markers are not cheap and I expected them all to be usable.",2.0
Too expensive--can do the exact same art work with cheaper product,2.0
"Out of the twelve markers, three were completely dried on delivery; all three black markers are completely useless. The rest of the markers are of high quality but I won't be ordering these, or any other markers, again.",2.0
"Most of these markers are great, professional level art materials, however, there is a serious flaw that has never been addressed as far as I know: Yellow markers, and anything with high levels of yellow pigment, bleeds over time.

The other colors do not have this problem, and work great, however. If not for the yellow pigment bleeding, I would give Prismacolors all 5 stars.

These marker sets will last a long time, and until Prismacolor fixes their yellow pigment issues, it is worth the extra money to upgrade to Copic markers.",2.0
Three of the markers where dry,2.0
Disappointing as the colors are to solid and dark. I was hoping for more transparency. I probably bought the wrong type of markers,2.0
"I purchased these for my boyfriend, but then ended up using them myself. I only got a few  (like 3 small ones) really great drawings out of them before they were almost unusable. Some of the brand new ones were almost dry from the get-go. I love prisma color and Im not sure if this is just because they had been sitting in a warehouse for too long before I got them, but they weren't worth the 80$ I spent and I won't buy them again off of amazon.",2.0
"I really love the markers that work! Out of the 12, 6 worked well, 3 kind of worked and 3 didn't draw at all. I love Prismacolor products, but this was very disappointing.",2.0
"The choice of colors is not optimal, the lid requires a professional wrestler to pry open and the ink is so fluid tat it maes the paper act as a blotter that makes it spreads beyond the area it is intended to cover.",2.0
"The photo shows a gray scale needed and I get another palette. They need to update the sample photos.
But are excellent",2.0
"As an industrial design student I use markers often. These were the first Cool Grays I purchased, but not the last I needed. The shades are not uniformly spread across a gradient. For example, the 20% is much darker than the 10%, and extremely close to the 30%. It won't matter about the 10% though, because it will dry out within a couple of weeks, and you'll need to replace it. After 4 months, and two dried out 10% markers, I stepped up and bought the other leading brand (see my other reviews). I am much happier with the performance of the other brand, and I won't be buying the Prismacolor again. Spend a little more now to get the best, or a lot more later replacing these.",2.0
"I remember when these markers were much better, with a fine point on one end and a thick slanted point on the other. They've always been expensive, but I justified their price because they last such a long time.

The entire marker has changed since I bought them many years ago. The fine tip is no longer fine. It is a like a regular sharpie point. The ink standard has gone down too. The color is not rich like it used to be and the markers do not last AT ALL. I know all alcohol markers bleed through but the deep reds and purples bleed heavily the first few uses then Poof! the ink is gone. And with some of the other colors, they barely color at all, like the pen marker has dried out already. For 150+ dollars, these won't cut it for me, I returned them within hours of receiving them. I was practically waiting by the door for them too.

I did some research online with the help of some of the reviews on Amazon for these Prismas and I saw that the Copic line was recommended. I ordered a couple of Copic original markers (singly this time so I wouldn't have to bother with a huge return) and the quality is much, much better though you have to pay a lot for it (if you get lucky, around 4 bucks a marker which is pretty steep!) But if you're already willing to shell out a buck and a half on these, you might as well just go for it and just get the Copic original markers which you can refill and change the nibs out for, they'll last forever. If you're missing the prismas of old, I highly recommend the Copic Original Markers. I didn't like the Copic Sketch or the Copic Ciaos, I do a lot of detail work, and those markers tips are much too broad for me. Plus I like having 9 different nib options, that's awesome.

I am very impressed so far with the few Copics I've ordered. The color is rich and addictive, like any good marker should be. I look forward to using them and have already used them quite a bit. For the sophisticated artist/sketcher/designer, the Copic website even has a full color wheel to access so you can make an informed decision on which ones will best suit your needs. Don't be swayed by the droves of stampers loving these markers either, they are great markers for sketch artists too.",2.0
"do not order from TCP Global, the condition mine arrived in is unbearable! it was supposed to be part of a christmas gift but i was too embarresed to gift it the way it came from them... contacted seller nothing was done!",2.0
"While the price is great, I'm really disappointed that out of the first 25 (out of the 30 I bought) boxes I passed out in class, every box had at least 1 broken crayon in it.  My kindergarten students were very sad. They love perfect, new crayons. To have each student have something broken in the box was a real let down.",2.0
"Just like another reviewer, when I ordered these, I expected classic colors (red, yellow, blue, etc). I don't like these colors at all and this set does not have a black marker so I will have to purhase an additional set. They do wash off like they say, but im not happy with my purchase.",2.0
These markers seem to be good but I haven't let my 2 year old use 'm yet because they are rather large and with the extra big tip its probably gonna me very messy!,2.0
when arrived in mail some of the caps were off and those were dried up and not useable. expected better product,2.0
"Yea, they lasted a few days. They are ok'ish for the price but break very easily.",2.0
The crayons a great but the item is advertised incorrectly. I ordered 2 sets of these (24 packs in all) and both sets only came with 11 packs. This product is advertised as a 12 pack but I only received 11 sets of crayons. Make sure to count your packs when you get them.,2.0
Overpriced for these small eight crayons. Three came broken.,2.0
Too waxy.  Not like the crayons of my youth.,2.0
Works on colored pencils but not good for gel pens or markers. Was disappointed.,2.0
I am disappointed with the quality of these erasers. It is not what I expected. I don't like it at all. The material used on it is cheap and low quality.,2.0
These erasers leave a smudge and don't erase clean,2.0
"I bought these for my daughter who is 6 and starting to do algebra (!!!!) in the first grade. I had forgotten just how ineffective these can be. They wiggle and wobble and don't do a satisfactory job.
I get more results with an eraser at the tope of a pencil. (If only my son wouldn't eat them....)",2.0
"Erasers are fine, but description says that there it is a quantity of TWO packages of 3 erasers. It even says it on my order. I only received one - where is the other one?",2.0
"This product appeared sturdy, however I returned it since the fine print at the back of the package indicated that it is made out of a plastic known to cause cancer and genetic defects. Beware!",2.0
The quality of these scissors have gone down considerably. I always bought these for cutting fabric to reduce the fatigue of my hand. But the last 2 pairs I've bought have been terrible. They dull instantly and one pair got stuck so they don't pop open anymore. Very disappointed.,2.0
"I've used these scissors for almost eight months now and wish I could give them five stars.  But I can't.  The scissors enjoy all the usual excellent Fiskars attributes.  They seem to be excellent.  But for me they have a design flaw that is almost fatal.  There are no loops on the handles to enclose my fingers.  That means when I'm cutting my hand slides freely out of control on the handle.
What this really means is that on almost every cut I pinch my thumb at least once and usually more than knce.  I don't like it!",2.0
Not the quality of previous generation. Newer side slider can really pinch your skin. Product arrived in different color than shown,2.0
"I have used Fuskars scissors in the past, and they were always just fine. This there were no good after five months of light use. It's like they spread apart cutting through paper, like those ultra chap ones in elementary school.",2.0
Doesn't hold an edge.,2.0
I ordered these and they were black on the screen. They came and are white and orange.,2.0
"I've had these for two or three years.  While they used to cut really well, over time the locking mechanism has loosened so the scissors jam mid-cut.  It depletes the purpose of having spring loaded scissors.  Would not recommend these if you're looking for a long term investment.",2.0
"the scissors work well but the do not stay locked at all, open up as soon as you set the lock on them, so that leaves the blades open all the time and not safe.",2.0
"These scissors worked great for the first week for cutting fabric.  However, the scissors now get stuck whenever I cut down all the way. I can kind of work around the problem by doing small cuts and not cutting down all the way, but it is very annoying.  Overall, I'm very disappointed, and I thought it would work well for longer than a week.",2.0
"OK for everyday craft use, but a poor shadow of the original Fiskars made in Finland.

While this current model does ""cut to the point"", both of the pairs I received do not do so as accurately as the originals. These have points that overlap/overshoot slightly - typical sloppy Chinese manufacture - and the tips are slightly blunted. (In one pair, one tip is even slightly longer than the other.) As a result, there is a slight tear at the end of the cut using either pair.  Also, unlike the original, they only taper as viewed from the side (as in the product photo), but are the same thickness as viewed from the top (90 degrees from the photo view) up to within close to the tips, then are coarsely ground off at two steep angles. The originals were smoothly tapered in both planes, giving a precise tip for accurate cuts and ease of seeing exactly where you are cutting. This makes these new models clumsy at cutting anything but straight lines and not for very short or curved cuts, so they are not really good for applique or cutting intricate or exact paper shapes. The original scissors were perfect for these uses, and so I am now conserving them, and use the new ones just for simple cutting.

This is disappointing; sad to see the decline of what was a brand of outstanding quality and utility.",2.0
"This used to be my favorite small scissor, but I've tried ordering a new pair twice and the product has simply changed. Don't like them any more. The handles are visibly a different material, and the blades feel crunchy when opening and closing.",2.0
"I've had Fiskar scissors in the past but it seems their quality has diminished. These are too thick, and they work too hard.  There's no screw to adjust the tension like on most scissors.  My 45 year old Wiss works better than this one, and I've never sharpened it!",2.0
"My kids (currently 4 and 6) have been using these scissors for a year.  They are sharp enough to cut paper, seem appropriately sized, and look like new despite consistent use.  They serve their purpose very well.  Still, when my daughter needed a pair to start first grade, I hesitated to buy them because they were all labeled Made in China.  I work really hard to limit the amount of stuff I buy from China. I was thrilled when I found these on Amazon labeled Made in U.S.A, and disappointed when I recieved them.  They are made in China.",2.0
Dried up after 12 months storage.,2.0
Colors are too Light can't really touch anything up with them,2.0
Not a good product at all...Tips fell out after first use. You get what you pay for with paint markers and i should have known thats why these were so cheap,2.0
"Easy to use and wipe off while using. I used on coffee mugs to decorate for gifts and made myself one. ended up with a clean slate after a few handwashes. (I did bake the mugs after using to ensure it would stay, but it didn't work)",2.0
I found that these leaked all too often,2.0
"I bought these based on reviews, but they were kind of a waste of money. When they work, they're great. However, the paint inside is corrosive and eats through plastic and acrylic which limits what I can do with them. The pens themselves don't flow well, I had to resort to dumping the paint on a plate and dipping the pen in, quill and ink style. A few pens randomly lost the tip and dumped paint all over my project, which was a real bummer. I definitely won't be buying again.",2.0
The paint did not come out well.,2.0
"Not fine, more like medium",2.0
"the pens are small and light.
some points feel dried out and i think i wasted money.",2.0
Only BLACK worked properly. One color did not work at all. All the others took a lot of shaking before they worked at all. I think these dried out in a warehouse for a year or two.,2.0
Paint runs out quickly tho,2.0
"These oil pastels are very smooth and waxy.  They're very cheap and work fine for sketches. Not for a serious work.  The case came with one of the containers missing.
Maybe it's a returned item. They should ship a brand new item if they advertised it as a new product.",2.0
The paint is kind of thin and has a tendency to run.  Would likely not buy these again.,2.0
What a great product!  I can now get a watercolor effect without lugging a ton of stuff around! The colors are vibrant and blend beautifully.  You can create pale washes or lay down intense vibrant color.  You can use the pen type water brushes or a regular paint brush.  These are fast becoming my favorite medium.  I am very pleased with these crayons,2.0
"overall I was not too impressed with these pens. They were not too bad but I ran out of paint fast. Also some of them seemed to have paint still in them but they would not work. Another thing that bothered me was that the white was not opaque enough. If these were cheaper I would say that they are worth it, but not at this price.",2.0
"I bought this set of pens to paint some rubber ducks and these were less expensive than the Scripto Fine Point Oil-Based pens. The Sanford pens are just a little less fine than the Scripto pens; but it was ok for what I was using them for.
The real issue I had with the Sanford pens are that the tips start drying out as I am using them so I have to keep pumping the points to get more paint out.  Also the paint does not seem to cover as well as the Scripto. So, I have just ordered a set of the Scripto pens, even though it was $29.99 plus S&H &tax.",2.0
"Only good as beginner student grade,  not really all that water soluble",2.0
Good fun but not pro quality in my opinion. The crayola look is not pleasing.,2.0
"I don't like these, will probably give them away.  !st of all, they're very stiff.  Secondly -- it didn't occur to me from the pic that this would be a problem, but I find that it is -- the fact that the larger (finger) loop is a straight extension of the blades with the thumb loop off to the side makes me have to work harder than I want to to pull my thumb away from my fingers. I guess I could go down to the basement to get a philips head screwdriver to loosen the screw that make them tight, but i just don't like them enough to bother.  I have an ambidextrous pair (also by Fiskars) that are designed with a little more symmetry that I like a lot better.",2.0
"Maybe it's because I'm used to using right-handed scissors with my left hand, but I kind of hate these. I was hoping I would really like them, but I just don't. I keep looking over the wrong side of the scissors to 'see' what I'm cutting, they aren't really any more comfortable (still hurt my hand) and so far my ability to cut with them is even worse than it was before. Maybe I just need some lefty scissors that don't have reversed blades, I dunno, but these are stuff and clunky and difficult for me to use and don't seem to be that great at cutting in general.",2.0
"very stiff, uncomfortable",2.0
"ergonomic design doesn't perform the same as it promised,
1. hard plastic handle and sharp edges at where the fingers contact to when cutting stuff
2. the relative position of the two holes is bad. There is no way to put only three fingers in the larger hole to make cuttings, but there is no room for four fingers in the hole either.
3. it is very lightweight, but I have to use more energy to open this scissors

Pro:
1. lightweight
2. making crisp cutting edge on fabrics
3. inexpensive",2.0
Although they are packaged as LEFT-hand scissors; the grip is clearly slanted for RIGHT-hand users.,2.0
I got these for a fellow lefty but ended up keeping them and it's a good thing. These are left handed but the blades or scissor jaws are backwards and do not cut well. May be returning these. Disappointed.,2.0
I ordered these because they are advertised as Left hand scissors. The scissors that came are most definitely right handed scissors. Annoyed.,2.0
"I bought these for a left handed person. I tried to use them at first, and had a heck of a time lining them up to cut a straight line. I thought it was just me since I'm a righty, but the left handed used them and had the same issue and results. I don't know if it just takes getting used to or what, but the lefty ended up going back to right handed scissors.",2.0
"The Fiskars brand used to be tops, but the ones I've purchased lately, via Amazon and box stores, have been of very poor quality.  How come Fiskars doesn't make the excellent scissors they used to?",2.0
Not so great,2.0
"I thought it was time for new scissors around my house so I got these.  I was mostly disappointed.  They aren't comfortable to use, they don't cut well and they were not near as good as the ones I got them to replace.  So I kept my old scissors and tossed these into the recycle.",2.0
"The scissors are left handed. Sharp. Came with no nicks or gouges. But the are - and have remained - stiff and a bit sticky feeling, making them hard to use. The price is good and they're useful if you don't use scissors often. If you want something good for daily use, you might be better off paying a bit more for a different brand.",2.0
"These were a replacement for an ""identical"" pair that I purchased in 1970, the handle of which had finally broken. However, the quality. although okay, isn't identical. The new ones don't have the same solid feel as my old ones, and they don't cut as smoothly. I'm disappointed, but don't know of an alternative.",2.0
Very disappointed in the quality.,2.0
My left handed son could not use these scissors... I don't know if he is so used to right handed scissors...but he can't get them to cut (kind of like when you were a kid and tried out the left handed scissors in the school box because all of the right handed scissors were in use...you just can't  get them to work).,2.0
"If you want right handed scissors with a grip contoured to your left hand, then buy these. If you want true left handed scissors, then stay away from these. I have a pair and they cut OK, but the whole point of them is that they are supposed to be left handed scissors. These will block your view of what you are cutting when the top blade goes up, among other things.

Right handed scissors, when used in the left hand, require an awkward grip. I'm not talking about the hand grip or loops. I'm talking about having to hook your thumb around so the pressure from your thumb is lightly pulling instead of pushing, and the pressure on the lower part is pushing instead of pulling. Perhaps you've used right handed scissors often enough that you've gotten used to it. With this particular pair, at least when new, that's not a big issue since the blades contact each other tightly. As time goes on, I don't know. That's probably because I've had them for more years than I can remember but seldom use them.

I wouldn't mind it they marketed these as standard scissors with a lefty grip. But they don't. For users who never had left handed scissors, they might even be conned into thinking that this is how left handed scissors work. But the reality is that Fiskars has plenty of machines for making right handed blades, so it's cheap for them to mold different handles and use blades of a size they already make. That's just plain dishonest.

There are plenty of pairs of left handed scissors, so you should have no problem finding real ones. Shame on you, Fiskars.",2.0
"These will cut okay, but feel very awkward to hold and maneuver.  Rate them just somewhat adequate.",2.0
Bought this for my mother to cut fabrics. But this scissors has uneven edges does not cut fabrics properly. Not a very impressed from a company like Fiskars.,2.0
"Started to fall apart after just a month of light use, pretty disappointed.",2.0
Cuts well but kills your hand.  Really should have returned it but I needed it right away.  Made for a right hander.,2.0
The scisssrs are too tight and not as good as a 45 year old pair of Wiss scissors that I have.  I bought them as a second pair because I have another Fiscars scissors that I love.  It seems like the scissors were better before they changed the handles from a shiny orange to a flat color.  Would not recommend.,2.0
"My previous pair of Fiskars held up wonderfully for years!  This new pair was very sharp and worked well for a couple of months.  Now they are dull and feel like they are about to fall apart.  WHAT HAPPENED?  Was the company purchased by someone else?  Are they under new management?  Whatever they did, they seem to be in the ""disposable scissor"" business.",2.0
"The scissor is alright, but nothing to rave about.  Its a scissor for gods sake.  Its just not that high-tech.",2.0

"Wish I read the reviews before I bought this product.  Could have saved money by buying the large box of 64 crayons and just pulling these 8 colors out:  white, black, apricot, peach, tan, sepia, burnt sienna, and mahogany (it's like an orange/rust color).
The crayons are also skinnier than I expected.  The photo made it seem like these were jumbo crayons.  They are 4"" long by 5/16"" wide.",2.0
"In this pack you get 8 crayons of various skin colors.  There's really nothing magical going on here except that they've grouped together the various colors from a regular crayon box that might be used for skin tones into this mini pack.  It's not a good value.  You might as well just buy a regular 64-crayon box, which will include these 8 colors anyway.",2.0
I purchased these crayons for a multi cultural project I was doing with my kindergarteners. I thought the crayons would be bigger and thicker. Had I known I could have picked these colors out of my box of 250.,2.0
"I am traveling and it is a smart tool to have for quick
 jobs. Although, I have misplaced the instructions to fill
 the bobbins with higher quality thread. I believe all the
 attachments are here with me. Unfortunately, there isn't any
 bobbin coding system or marks on the machine to indicate the
 process for threading them. Someone with no experience wouldn't
 be able to figure it out. I will not give up. I'm sticking
 parts in the various holes to test which way works. Oh, by the

I bought a euro-pro machine for my eight year old.  The foot pedal is not in the box and I have been trying for two weeks to order a new one.  The number for the product is busy always and they are not very helpful.  She can't use the product without the accessory that is missing. Someone please help me.  The internet is not helpful either.  Please give me some useful advice on where to get this missing part. thank you cathy yerbich,2.0
The only thing thats good about it is the small size. Its cute but gets stuck really easily..,2.0
"I got this over 2 years ago, and stuck it in my closet after i couldn't get it to work. I decided to give it another try, and took it out. Finally after messing with the bottom bobbin, it finally operated. I was so excited! So I tried using it today, and somehow the needle bent while I was sewing a pillow case - nothing too thick. I saw that the needle broke. So I took that off, and read the instructions to ""clamp"" the needle in. Did that - while I was tightening the needle clamp, the cheap plastic clamp cracked! I wasn't exerting much force. I didn't notice the crack until I began sewing with the 2nd needle they give you, and then it got jammed again! Since the needle wasn't broken, I don't think there is a way to get the needle out, that is stuck in the bottom bobbin, other than to break it. So I broke it, and have a broken needle clamp as well. Any suggestions to get a replacement part for this thing?",2.0
Too thick,2.0
"Locking mechanism is plastic, broke second time using them",2.0

This was not what they sold. It is not for construction as it is not dense enough. I am very dissapointed.,2.0
About a third of the sheets are warped; looks like water damage. Not too pleased.,2.0

These stars just have glitter glued on them and don't give the illusion of twinkling at all.  Glitter is easily rubbed off.,2.0
"Yes, there were 40 glowing stars, but they were not glitter, my 3 year old daughter was very disappointed when they arrived because we had picked them out together!",2.0
Like my title above that is how I describe this product. It does glow like the other stars but the glitter on the stars makes no difference. No sparkle while they are lit up. It would have been cheaper to get this so called effect by buying regular glow in the dark stars and covering them with your own glitter. Don't waste your money on this set. Use it to buy a regular set with more stars in it. They do however glow pretty well. I am happy about that!,2.0
Messy,2.0
"Dried up rather quickly, would not recommend window marker white.",2.0
doesn't go on very nicely!,2.0
"This works fine, but it is REALLY light! When I was using this and I put it down, it tipped to the side so the hot tip was on my desk. I had to use a heavy roll of tape to keep it from going over. So just beware when you are buying this, it works just fine, but it's not very sturdy.",2.0
This glue makes paper buckle.,2.0
"I have an older version of these, but other than one area on the new one being black and mine being chrome/steel, they are identical.  I have bad arthritis in my hands and as a writer and artist, my basal thumb joint has taken a terrible beating (just had a steroid injection into the joint which has helped immensely). I read about these on a site discussing equipment for arthritis sufferers.  The spring return of the handles is a great idea and does diminish force on the thumb joint, so kudos!  Most companies could care less for anyone with arthritis/ vision/ hearing and other problems such as they apply to the product (why, when no doubt a majority of the population has such problems?). Another good idea is the little catch at the bottom that keeps the handles closed when not in use. So, why am I unhappy? The catch, unfortunately, opens when the scissors are in use and then prevents closure without jiggling with it, a frustrating waste of time and effort. Secondly, if these were ever sharp, the edge did not last long.  They are dull as butter knives. My frustration just reached the saturation point during a small object packing session (cutting  paper, bubble wrap, etc.) and then the catch at the bottom failed to close as it always does.  Solution?  I threw the suckers away and found another pair of scissors that actually cuts.  The two stars are for thinking of arthritis sufferers.  The empty three are for the inexplicable high cost and the dull edges of the blades. I'd love to recommend these unconditionally, but Oxo (a brand I frequently rely on)?  You let me down.",2.0
I won't be buying these anymore.  They lasted about a week.  I am looking to find a reusable version to make popsicles.,2.0
Item arrived broken into pieces and out of the wrapper.  Not sure if I will consume any of them.  There are a few left whole.,2.0
Slightly above a toy but definately not a sewing machine for anything serious. I ended up hemming my sleeves by hand. Bobbin is loose. Doesn't pull the material through very well. Not at all what I had hoped. I will end up giving this away and buying a real sewing machine. One that will handle a hem.,2.0
"I was disappointed with the size of the actual product because it was like a toy for my younger granddaughters. Kayla and Tarra are 13, and they love my sewing machine so I thought I would buy them one for their birthdays. I wish I had paid more attention to the actual measurements because I would not have made this purchase! They both had problems getting it to sew because the thing would not make a real stitch!",2.0
"I ordered this item fully understanding that it was a beginner's sewing machine. I know it's not the heavy duty kind with bells and whistles that costs a pretty penny. So when I tested the machine on the test material that comes with it I wasn't expecting it to be the only stitches I would get out the machine. When I lifted the foot and took the sample material out and placed my material in (cotton, not a heavy material) it didn't work. I checked the plug, nothing. It simply stopped working. I sent it back in about a month ago and just got it back today. It works now, but not a highly recommended product.",2.0
"The foam brushes were to soft, didn't hold  up long.",2.0
"Very poor foam quality, fails very quickly.  Only good for kid projects, not real work.",2.0
These are really really flimsy and not good for staining.  They may work for crafts though.,2.0
Quality of brush design given wood handle not ideal vs other brands,2.0
"These are poor quality brushes. You get what you pay for with foam brushes, that's why the ones at the paint store are more expensive than anywhere else. The density of the foam, the support piece in the middle of the foam, and the handle material all add up to either a great or a horrible product. These aren't the worst I've used but they aren't the best either. The handle is made of wood which is great. There is a plastic center to the foam which is also a plus as it provides the necessary stability when using foam brushes. The foam density is where the problem comes in. Upon arrival I immediately opened the box and compared them to my remaining stock to see how the quality was. The foam has a large amount of pores which makes it soak up more material without laying it down quickly and also increases the chance of the foam breaking apart during usage.

Sadly I'll be using these are primer or prep products that I will then be sanding back due to the quality issue and that I can't use them on a clients home or product without worry that they will break or fall apart and ruin the finish.",2.0
They're flaking apart more quickly than the ones at my local hardware store do.,2.0
Poor quality for staining. Very soft foam that comes apart easily and is to lumber.,2.0
These were made with very low quality sponge material. They work for stains but paint makes them fall apart.,2.0
"Great price, however, these brushes are very low quality.  They sort of hang off the top of the handle which makes them floppy instead of easy to brush with - especially the 1"" size.  In addition, with the polyurethane I was using they basically just fall apart - I only made it around 1/2 of the room's baseboards before I had to grab another one.  Next time I will spend a little more and hopefully get a better quality.",2.0
Lite duty. Handles break off easy,2.0
"I saw the deal and jumped at it - I am restoring our 1930s craftsman and have a lot of staining to do. I usually pay .49/brush at the hardware store so this seemed like a good way to get cheap disposable foam brushes. One is as good as another. Yes? No!

These things come apart FAST. I can do maybe 2 1x10 planks with a brush before it comes apart. And they come apart every which way - the plastic handles snap (these are not your usual wood dowels). The brush heads come right off the brush paddle. Not good.

If you have tiny touch ups to do and the brush will be used for 5 minutes or less these will work. Otherwise, pass on these as more frustrating than worthwhile.

Two stars for value and FAST delivery.",2.0
loosens when you least expect it. Spend more time tightening it than cutting with it.,2.0
Could not tighten enough to keep the blade in place.  Al threads eventually stripped and one unit is ruined.  Do not know if I will use the other.  Definately NOT to the standard I expect from X-Acto.,2.0
Handle keeps twisting around so then the blade keeps coming out. Add to that the cap is practically useless because it doesn't snap or lock tight and it's useless. Not sure if I have a faulty blade but I think it's more the fact that I'm testing it in a production environment for trimming plastics. For very light crafts it may be ok but heavier duties I think you'll be very annoyed.,2.0
"I thought all foam brushes were the same. Not so with this product; the foam is not as dense and is very porous; therefore giving out in no time.  I used it to apply oil stains on wood so  after destroying the first 2, I had to lighten my strokes dramatically( the plastic frame is so close to the foam at the tip, you don't have much choice anyway). I wouldn't recommend applying thicker matter like paint, nor applying it on rough surfaces. Thought I made a good purchase, but I'll be visually inspecting those at the home center first. The only positive aspect is with so many brushes on hand, you should have enough to complete a small to mid size project, but with a lot going to waste.",2.0
I was urethaning a rocking chair I made and before I was half finished the form wore down to the plastic base that holds the foam.  Foam is too soft and porous.  Will not buy again.  Would not recommend.,2.0
I guess you get what you pay for.  These fell apart within minutes (sometimes seconds) and didn't hold up well enough to do the job I purchased them for.  Lesson learned.,2.0
"I know the purpose of these brushes is to be a cheap, single use product, but I regularly can't get through a single project using just one brush before it falls apart.

My only other experience with foam brushes are the single sale ones you can buy at Home Depot/Lowes for under a dollar, and they are significantly better.",2.0
I am changing my review on these brushes. I started using them more often while staining and sealing my wood projects. These things are garbage. The plastic insert that is glued to the foam comes off after a few semi hard strokes. And on two of them the wooden handle clean snapped off from the plastic with hardly and pressure. These would be good for kids arts and crafts if you throw them out after one use.,2.0
"Once you open, you never can fold it back as it instructed.  Waist money!",2.0
"Really it was too big for my bathroom, and hard to fold back into shape. They thought of having to go through refolding that every week makes me never want to use it again.",2.0
I use it but it is difficult to hang and you have to balance the clothes just right or it tips.,2.0
"it's large enough for one women's size 20 sweater and lets the sleeves hang down at that. I'm disappointed since it arrived curled on itself..not flat.  Once uncurled, it was still bent up and not that great. Flimsy.",2.0
Just like others have commented the compartments are way to small. Rolling your underwear up in a tight little ball and then they still won't fit in. Socks don't fit in either unless you wear a size 4 and they no show sports socks.,2.0
"On a positive note, it delivered very fast before the due date.
However the organizer is in very bad shape. The plastic covering it was torn and taped together when I got it. The cubbies are small for the socks and look like they will barely hold a pair, definitely won't hold a think pair of socks. The plastic was very horribly made. The sides are warped and bend in. And the larger t-shirt cubbies, the bottom caves downward and is warped to where it won't even sit flat in a drawer. The quality of this is very poor, but for $10 what else can you expect. I just hope I can make it work and it's not a total loss.",2.0
The divider is warped. It is overpriced for what it is. I would not purchase this again. It should cost 5 dollars max.,2.0
Not strong enough to stick to anything.,2.0
"Super fun idea, poor quality magnet. My projects won't stick to the fridge.",2.0
Wasted more than we used. Doesn't last long and very expensive.,2.0
"I bought this for use with a magnetic whiteboard. At first I thought the cartridge was a total dud, the magnets don't stick to the whiteboard at all, but it turns out they're just very weak -- they barely stick to my filing cabinet. Definitely make sure that the surface you plan to use is strongly ferromagnetic!",2.0
"I expected for the magnet coming off automatically, instead you have to fussy cut.",2.0
Makes really cheapo looking magnets. Good for kids and crafts though!,2.0
Loved the idea of doing own magnets for friends and family.  Problem is the cartridge bubbles in the beginning and end. I lose at least 2 feet of cartridge. The last cartridge I used I am yet to get a magnet without bubbles. It is great product when it works the way it is supposed to be.  Right now it is an expensive hit or miss.,2.0
"I had tried the little rubber adhesive backed feet and the sandpaper dots, but I was still searching for the perfect solution to the slippery backs of the quilting rulers. For me, this doesn't seem to be it. In a class I took 2 or 3 years ago our instructor told us about this product and how wonderful it is. I bought two packages to make sure I had enough to cover the backs of all my rulers--I have more rulers than I really need. The application didn't go quite as smoothly as the instructions indicated. It just didn't want to stick to some of the rulers (all of which were the same Omnigrid brand). It is supposed to work on the principle of static cling, I guess, but I ended up having to dampen some of the rulers to make this product stick. There is no adhesive involved. This is a plus when it comes to removal if you decide not to keep it on your rulers--no sticky backs--but then, maybe that would be the solution I am looking for.

I found that when the product was new it did seem to lessen slightly the tendency of the ruler to slide across the fabric as you apply pressure and cut. However, it didn't seem to last very long. The more I used the rulers the more it appeared that the film had less and less of its nominal at best gripping power. I haven't taken the time to tear it off of all of my rulers--it isn't hurting anything where it is, even if it isn't greatly helping. But as edges start to curl up I peel it off and I have about half of my rulers with it and half without. I admit that as I work with them I have a hard time telling which have it and  which don't.

If anyone has a recommendation about something that has really worked for them I would be interested. My complaint about the little rubber feet is the fact that the ruler doesn't sit flat on the fabric and the fabric can shift a little as you cut--especially at the edges or folds. The sandpaper dots grabbed the fabric too well at times, making repositioning of the rulers difficult, and they are not transparent, so wherever you apply them they obscure the lines on the rulers. This is especially bothersome on the smallest rulers. I had hoped this product would solve my problem, but I will keep looking.",2.0
I love my xyron for laminating and making stickers. I don't like it for making magnets.  Everytime I try to make a magnet the top sticker film keeps on making big bumps.  It doesn't go on smooth. I'm so disappointed with this product. I would not recommend it.,2.0
"The magnent is great and it laminates the top of your images too. Unfortunately, mine had issues with laminating properly but after a good number of trys and fails, I learnt how to use it. The magnet is weak and thus only for small projects like fridge magnents or calender sheets. To summarise it best, its exactly like magnetic tape.",2.0
"I was badly disappointed.  The top film was stuck to the frame.  Everything I did came out wrinkled.  I wouldn't advise using this on anything you don't want to ruin.  The magnet isn't very strong either,  It will barely stick to my fridge.  For the price I think this is a total waste of money.",2.0
I was hoping for a solution to slippery cutting rulers. This did not do the trick.,2.0

"I struggled with this for a year before I gave up.  I have a ruler rack, resulting in constant battle of trying to get ruler in rack with film scrunching up, just didn't work.  I really didn't see a lot of difference with regards to stopping or reducing slippage when cutting fabric, especially on the long and large rulers.  I have RA and cutting and ""firmly"" pressing down on ruler was frustrating.  So I switched to little silicone dots! They work!  I've removed all the film from all my grids and the dots don't hamper rack storage!",2.0

"The blades and the knives seem to be okay, but the box feels very shoddy.

The magnetic strip that holds all the blades falls out every time I open the box.  While it is nothing that double tape can't fix, still really takes away from the usefulness and can be dangerous.

The plastic tray for the knives holds them too tightly and sinks into the box way too deep.  Add to the fact that the surface of the box is rough to the touch, taking out the knife isn't entirely pleasant.  I added some bubble wraps to push the tray up, helps a little.

The box should be convenient to the user, but the engineering behind it is sub par.  I grabbed this mostly for the three knives and the blades, so I didn't take away too many points for the box.",3.0
"I used to have one of these sets 15 years ago. Back then, the case was bigger, and held all the bits better. This case has been shrunk so much that the handles barely even fit.

"I'll pile on.  While the wood in the case itself isn't bad and seems decently manufactured, the box hardware (hinges, clasp, etc) is mediocre.  Mine was in good shape but I can see where others might not have fared as well.  The plastic inserts to hold the items in the case are worthless.  Shame on X-acto for that cost cutting measure.  The silver lining there is that I will have to manufacture my own inserts so I'll have another project to use the kits contents on.  The magnet included to hold the blades in place is the weakest magnet I've ever witnessed.  I'll probably replace with rare earth magnets that will actually hold the blades when the case in closed. The quality of the tools seems lower than what I remember in the past, still decent but not the pinnacle of cutting tools they once were.  I will likely need to source a higher end vendor for future hobby knife purchases.  Sad to see X-acto toppled from their pedestal.",3.0

The swivel knife is also worse than an other version I bought many years ago. Blade its very loose, the hole in the tip being a bit too wide but the blade doesn't turn as freely as my old version. I'm hoping I just got a lemon with manufacturing defects, but my impression is that these are no longer manufactured to the quality standards I'm used to with x-acto.

"After I received this item I compared it to another store bought X-acto Brand tool. Now I am questioning the authenticity of this item. The cheap look of the box and the material used to hold the items into place as well as the quality of the blades is leaving me to believe that I may have been hoodwinked into buying yet another Chinese made knock-off of another American Made product that I love. Amazon, can you tell me, no US, the consumer that the products being offered here are legit? It is there any qualifying process that your vendors must go through prior to selling on Amazon?

This whole issue of authentic vs. knock-off should be of concern to every single consumer. The lack of concern for basic rights for factory workers is the biggest issue if you want cheap goods to keep rolling into your home. Selling out your neighbors job to another country should be more of a concern if you don't mind paying a couple dollars more. If the environment is your hangup, then definitely stop buying Chinese made products. Especially since Chinese manufacturers have a very open lack of concern for the environment. I don't know anymore... I am down to save a buck like the next guy, but I am not okay with selling out our own economy by giving away American jobs in the process.

some of the other blades are dull but it was cheap. overall pretty good.,3.0
"I had an xacto set as a kid and needed to do some intricate carving recently, so I knew what I wanted to buy.

The reason I'm rating this 3 stars is due to the inside ""storage"" plastic to keep things together. There's a small magnetic strip used to keep things in place, and on the back of it is an adhesive....but the adhesive on mine failed as soon as I opened the box, so then I had to fiddle with a row of incredibly sharp knife points while trying to get things back where they belonged....and it continues to fall of. No issue with the actual knife/points themselves, but you'd think they'd invest a few more cents into some adhesive that wouldn't fail for this as it's a safety issue.",3.0
"I wanted a set of xacto knifes and this fit the bill.  The knifes are exactly what I was looking for.  The box does suck though.  More specifically the cheap plastic holder inside the box.  It is very flimsy, falls out easily, often comes out with the knifes.  I ended up making my own holder from extra foam.  Not the best but 500x improvement over what it came with.",3.0
ok,3.0
Blades and handles are good. Plastic liner is cheap and flimsy.,3.0
"The knife set is ok, although it hasn't been put  to use yet.  It was disappointing to have the top black cardboard with all the blades attached to it fall out when we opened it (we have to glue it back in) and to see the box is unfinished and splintering on the bottom corner.  We kept it for the price as the knives look like they will do what they are supposed to.",3.0
But oh man this is not what i was expecting from xacto knives. It doesn't cut very well and is horrible for crafts. But it'll do until i find something better. But the decoupaged box looks adorable on my desk.,3.0
"Xacto really needs to examine this product and their heads. I have had to tape the plastic insert that holds all the extra blades into the box since at first it simply fell out dropping blades everywhere. Fun, right? When I taped it in I also put a rubber band around it thinking it might help the blades stay in the plastic mold since they do not fit in there snugly however this really doesn't help a whole lot as you can see in the picture they tend to simply fall all over the place. I love the handles and blades but the box is absolute garbage. You might as well put everything that comes in this kit in a plastic bag and shake it around. That is pretty much what you'll find once you unpack this little ditty.

Epic fail on keeping extremely sharp blades from being strewn about very close to your fingers when opening and closing this thing.

The only reason this gets any stars at all is because of the handles and blades alone.

Don't say I didn't warn you!",3.0
"I like Xacto products and decided to buy this wood box because I thought it'd be nice quality.  The magnetic strip that holds the blades is held on with low quality double-sided tape.  I peeled it off and used a hot glue gun to fix it to the plastic insert.  The plastic inserts also feel low quality and I am not sure how long they will hold up.

When they fail, I'll look at gluing in some rubber grippers for the knife handles and just put a magetic strip against the wood top.  I wish xacto had thought of that.",3.0
"The reviews are a bit inflated IMO.  The set is ok in general, but I saw the same blades and set for $8 after I bought it at a box store.  So I guess we pay another 8 for the crappy wood box (it really is crappy tbh).

The machining of the blades themselves is bad and you can see jags and edges on the non-blade side.  The blade sides are great within themselves, but the tip of on my blades already broke.  Still functional, but a lot more fragile than I expected.

The magnet for the multiple blades is not glued properly to the black plastic containers.  You need to do it yourself.

Also the two black piece holders that hold the blades and handles come out too.  Super glue them.  I recommend Gorilla glue since it expands.  Don't do it in the corners, just the bottom and it should hold in place.

Besides that, it'll get the job done.  But crappy gluing along with a crappy box and fragile metal sucks.",3.0
"Good knives, but the plastic in the case was deformed. Not a deal breaker, since I could fix it, but not great either.",3.0
Is it me or are these things not nearly as good as the older exacto's?  Blades come loose too easily and they feel cheaply made. Meh.,3.0
Mediocre set at best.,3.0
plastic that holds blades is pretty junky and they keep falling out.  Not the same quality as when I was a kid (30 years ago) and had this same set.  I still have that set in fact.  It is just missing some parts from 30 years of use.,3.0

I don't know if this was the fault of Elmer's Products, INC or of Amazon's, but I still rated the item 3 stars, because it's still functional and a good product, it just was not what I ordered.

"The actual blades and holding tools are very useful and seem pretty well built. The twist-locks don't seem to hold the blades as securely as one would hope for such sharp blades - the red-handled tool is especially bad about this.
The storage box is pretty nicely built but the blade holders and tool holders are just flimsy plastic which does not seem to want to stay in the storage box. This is particularly worrying since one of the blade holders happens to hold a dozen blade tips and likes to fall out of the top of the box.
Additionally, the magnetic strip on the blade holding plastic is very poorly attached to the plastic.
With these two flaws together, you end up opening up the box and having either the blade holder and blades fall out on you, or the magnetic strip with all of its blades fall out on you, and I'm honestly not sure which is more terrifying given how well these blades can cut.",3.0
"The hobby knives and most of the other tools are great but the packaging is not so good. The cheap plastic in the wooden container leaves a lot to be desired. It was already broken when I received it. Once you remove the plastic wrap that covered the tools the were glued to the lid, there was nothing to hold the plastic into the lid short of gluing the plastic to the lid. Since it was broken by the weight of the tools that were shipped in the plastic within the lid, I had not yet decided if I could repair the plastic before I tried to glue it to the lid. I should have opted for one of the basic kits.",3.0
"As the title says: The knifes are what you'd want. Sharp, decently sturdy. Good variety of them. They seem like they'll do whatever job you expect of them. However, the box, while very nice looking isn't very good at keeping them in. If I close it the ""correct"" way (handles on the bottom of the box) when I open the box back up (after no jostling, mind you, just sitting on the desk) the plastic that holds the replacement knifes will be face down on top of the handles. Upon picking it back up to put in place, I will discover further, that the little magnetic strip taped in to hold the replacement blades will have also fallen out, letting the little blade scatter all over the inside of the box. From that point, I get to carefully re-stick the magnetic strip in place, and then place each little blade in it's own little spot. This isn't as fun as I make it sound. So I just close the box with the replacement blades on the bottom. When I open it now, I only have to put the plastic holding the handles back into its spot, but the handles stay in the plastic holders.",3.0
"Pros:
 The box is really nice
 the blades are really sharp
 the xacto's don't feel like cheap plastic
Cons:
 The plastic in the box that holds the
  blades and xactos is very cheap

 the lable on the xacto knife could be wiped off with soap or hand sanitizer (cheap)",3.0
"There are tons of blades, which is nice. They started to get dull on my pretty quick, which is weird because I was using them to cut paper. And the black portion that holds everything, it's made of super cheap plastic and the sides fall out when you open the box. There is a magnet holding all of the blades in, though, which is safe.",3.0

"Seems to work fairly well, but my small diameter knife constantly needs the blade chuck tightened to keep the blade from falling out.  Maybe it's the way I hold the knife tho.",3.0
"The kit is a great idea, I can't think of a safer way to organize all of these deathly sharp little pieces of metal. However the plastic tray is somewhat fragile and can pucker and rupture if you press too hard. Also, there are no plastic tip guards for the three handles. However I see no better alternatives.",3.0
"This is a prime case of you get what you pay for.  I wanted to screw around with a little carving so I bought this set.  I was carving soft wood and managed to really ding up one of the chisel blades.  It's a little awkward to change the blades at first but once you realize whats going on its very easy.

I've since upgraded myself to a knife set that costs about 8x as much, but if you want to mess around and see if you'll enjoy carving this isn't a bad place to start.",3.0
"I use this for doing weeding/cutting vinyl for lettering of my racecar, its everything you would ever need the smaller ones are a little flimsy,  I have already snapped one,  their is only 1 replacement blade too...but overall a good set to get you what you need with many options to see what you like best as far as blades .",3.0
"Overall it's a nice set and comes with a number of handy tools, but mine arrived missing the mini screwdriver.

Also the tools are held in by plastic molds, that aren't glued or attached to the wooden box. The plastic wrap on the top piece was glued to the lid, but that is useless after you remove the plastic wrap in order to get to your tools. So the top portion falls off everytime you close the lid. I'll have to take the time to glue it to the top of the lid myself.

It's not really worth it to me to return just because of the screwdriver, but it is annoying that it was missing and because of Amazon's website I would have to return the entire thing just to get a missing screwdriver.",3.0

"I should first mention that I live near the beach, but these rusted over in less than a month. I did enjoy using them, but the fact that I'll have to either sharpen them or buy new ones after such limited use is a tad bit upsetting.",3.0
"The knife handles and most of the blades in this assortment are good for those working in balsa wood, building model aircraft and other very light structures. But for carving and sculpting- not so good. Xacto blades are, for the most part, meant to be disposable, not re-sharpenable. They original blades are actually scalpel blades. The classic pointed X-acto is a #11 scalpel blade, a very common size familiar to those in the biological sciences.

The ""carving"" blades aren't as sharp as a real carver would like like, and are difficult to sharpen. If you're looking to carve basswood or harder woods, do yourself a favor and spend a few more bucks on a set of Flexcut or Mora or other knives that are designed for carving, can take a real edge, and are sharpenable.",3.0
"Reading the reviews on X-Acto Products like this one, makes me think others are making the same mistake I did. I over expected!  While X-Acto may not be the quality it was, it is pretty good for what it is built for and that is cutting BALSA wood, not hardwood or even softwoods like pine. These products are more for the model building hobbyist and not the wood carving community. That is what X-Acto built their name on and we as consumers need to be reminded about that.",3.0
If you want razor knives and multiple choices for tips this will work fine for you.  If you expect the little wooden box to close correctly this isn't for you.  I would have much rather preferred ordering a knife set inside a black box that closes etc.,3.0

"I know this is a wood carving kit, not a pumpkin carving kit, but I thought that surely if this could carve wood, it would be a piece of cake to carve through much softer pumpkin. I was wrong!

I was disappointed and I assume the same would be true for working on wood, however, it could be these just aren't meant for pumpkins.",3.0

"I liked this kit simply because it gave me three awesomely useful x-acto knives in one place. However, I couldn't get real utility out of the majority of the non-standard blade shapes. The glue that holds the magnet on the inside of the lid for the blades also started to give after a few months, so I'd get the whole strip of blades when I wanted one.",3.0
"The Xacto knives themselves work great - just as advertised.  The only issue I have is with the case.  The outer wood section is great and seems like incredible value for such a low price.  But the inner plastic liner is a major major pain.  The plastic is so tight around the knives that you have to wrestle them out, with a considerable amount of force.  It's a difficult process, and it seemed like only a matter of time until I cut myself, so I'm actually looking for a different case/stand/holder for the knives.",3.0
"I ordered this set because it seemed to be the best one available from Xacto. I have had a Xacto set since I was a kid, and wanted one for my daughter, as she loves using mine. Looking at the photo, it did not look as good as my old one, and I was right. There are less tools, less handles, and the box is smaller and not as cool. Seems like it will do alright for what she wants, but you're better off finding an old one in good condition.",3.0
"Received item very fast. Packaging was great as usual. Now the bad part. I purchased this kit for a shadowbox project and based on all the great reviews this seemed like the perfect choice to cut everything from paper to thin cardboard. The ergonomic handle holding the standard blade actually fell apart (more like flew apart as one piece landed about 3 feet from me) when I had only been using it less than 5 minutes to cut around some photos. (that didn't work all that well--seemed like a dull blade) When I couldn't get all the pieces back together I gave up and asked my husband to look at it. Now this guy is mensa and it took him awhile to figure this out and he had to jury rig the thing. There appears to be a piece missing as the blade itself has a notch to hook on but there's no corresponding hook in the handle???? We did find what we THINK may be another piece later on, but it was only a metal ring which didn't help the problem anyway. Hubby managed to get the entire blade squeezed in there by tightening up way past what it should be, but this isn't exactly what I had in mind. I need to be able to change blades frequently and by myself. I know this sounds as if we must be dolts, but both of us have used xacto knives before over the last 30 years or so, and this is the first problem like this we've both ever encountered.

As for the other handles/blades-The small rotating blade is great for delicate cutting of photos, notecard paper. The straight blade appears to be handy to have around, but I haven't had the need for it right now.

The wooden box is very handy. Nice storage for the knives and extra blades.

Still don't know if I should return this because of the #11 blade/knife problem or not. I really need to use that one right now...",3.0

"Everybody knows that when you see the name Xacto that you're going to get a high quality, durable, and very sharp set of knives.  They make plenty of knives so there are dozens of sets to choose from.  Since I own a worn out, knockoff set almost identical to this one, I was seriously trying to determine if I should go for something different.  But the wooden box totally sealed the deal.

I keep my knife set on my desk in my bedroom and was excited about receiving my ""functional decoration"".  Then I opened the box.

Plastic?  Flimsy plastic holders?  You've got to be kidding me!  Yes, it's great to look at from the outside, but now I'm never going to want to open it!  It's kind of like the plastic you'd find inside a box of chocolates. Every time I look at the set I get angry.  Every time I open the box I get that sinking feeling of disappointment all over again.

Now, I didn't expect to open a felt covered, gold lined knife chest.  But this vulgar display of cheapness really lowered my opinion of the Xacto company.  If you make a quality product, you should at least give it a quality case.  The picture doesn't show why you're getting this wooden box filled with sharp blades for so cheap.  It's so ridiculous, it's such a mismatch, it's aaaarrrrrgghh!

I had purchased a beginner's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Easy-Woodcarving-Simple-Techniques-for-Carving-Painting-Wood/dp/1565232887/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Easy Woodcarving: Simple Techniques for Carving & Painting Wood</a>&nbsp;on wood carving wherein the author stated to buy the highest quality tools you can afford. When I saw this at the store, I noticed that it had blades, gouges and chisels all in one decent-looking box. When I got home and tested them out on a block of basswood, I quickly found the author's advice coming back to haunt me!

The set only has one handle, so you need to constantly switch the blades. That handle is too small for my medium-sized male hands. The base of each blade is supposed to be flat so as too fit into the tightening mechanism of the handle. Unfortunately the bases on some of the gouges were misshapen and would not fit into the handle at all! Some of the gouges were also fairly flimsy, and bent quite a bit even with shallow cuts into the fairly soft wood. The included saw blade appears to be fairly useless.

I should say, in fairness, I'm a total novice to woodcarving. It's possible that I'm completely misusing these tools, though I sincerely doubt it. Personally, I'm going to return this set to the store tomorrow and order a set of carving tools that are of higher quality, where the blades do NOT detach from the handle, etc.

I was pleasantly surprised to take it out of the box and immediately begin serging. It came already threaded and ready to go. I had no serging experience and it took less than 2 minutes to figure out how to start. After a week or so of regular use, a thread broke. I figured, ""Here it comes. Here comes the part everyone is complaining about."" I looked at the manual and it took just a few minutes to rethread the broken thread and start serging again. Again, I cannot figure out what everyone is complaining about.

For a final test before I wrote this review, I decided to unthread and then rethread the whole machine. It wasn't that it was that hard, it was tricky to thread the needles, but really it wasn't that big of deal using the tweezers that the machine came with. Honestly, I found threading my regular sewing machine for the first time more challenging when I first began sewing than I did puzzling out how to thread this serger. So I'm very pleased with this purchase. It serges well and is easy to use, so I'm happy.

EDITED 1/13/12
The tension got wonky after a few months, and I haven't been able to use it. I had a friend who is quite experienced with sergers look at it, and she wasn't able to adjust the tension to get it working properly again. So it's just been sitting on my sewing table collecting dust. I will probably take it to get serviced, but I hate to shell out the money to have it serviced when it is still so relatively new. However, I haven't come up with any better options. As a result, I'm knocking off a couple of stars because it only really functioned well for a few months.

EDITED 12/9/12
I did take it to a repair shop and spent $65 to get it serviced. It has worked fine since then. If I had to do it over again, I would have bought a different brand, but that being said, after servicing, this serger has worked fine again.",3.0
"I bought this Singer serger as a back up machine,it is good for what it can do, but you get what you pay for. I would recommend going up to the next model.",3.0
"Bought from WalMart in 2005 and have used it a lot.  Just replaced with Brother 1034D which is quieter and easier to thread. Singer vibrates a lot and walks all over the place even with suction cups and I use a rubber sink mat under it.  I do use regular sewing machine needles with it and have not had a problem.  The tension is extremely difficult to adjust and it won't hold.  Even if it does hold, it will sew differently from one session to the next.  That has frustrated me a great deal - plus having to re-thread frequently.  But, it has held up through many hours or sewing.",3.0
"I just received the case, very basic indeed. That is not the issue. It will NOT fit my Singer Model 66, which is in dire need of a new carry case. The measurements are fine, but it does not have the attaching hardware it requires. Bottom line, I am slighty disappointed and am returning it.",3.0
Does the job that is intended for.  Not the best looking cover but functional.  Keeps the sewing machine well protected.,3.0
"What can I say, it's a case, it works just fine for your sewing machine.  It's not top of the line but it will do the job.  For everyone asking if this case will fit your machine... look at the measurements for this case and measure your machine...then you will know if it will fit!!!",3.0
it is difficult to put under the end table where my other one lived forever. also i wish the machine would mount to this case but it doesn't. the handle could be far more compact. but its a sturdy case.,3.0
"This case is great for storing at home but if you're traveling or moving it a lot, it may be a good idea to get another one.  It doesn't hold the sewing machine in place if knocked over.  Still could damage the machine.  Overall, a good product especially for the price and protects against things falling on it.",3.0
The case is wel built. It is much to large for the average size machine but it has plenty of storage  so you can pack things around your machine so it will be safe.,3.0
"It's a bit insane that sewing machines no longer come with covers.
This particular case is a little on the cheapside material-wise,
but will probably hold up if you're not putting the cover on & pulling
it off constantly, as the clasp seems a bit flimsy.  The handle, seems
fairly solid & sturdy enough to last, but is not the most comfortable
one I've ever used.  The case is roomy enough to fit a machine & a few
extras.  This could also mean that your machine will be clunking back
& forth inside if you aren't very careful to hold the case upright, or
don't 'pad' it a bit.

This product deserves only an average rating.  If sewing machines
can't automatically come with their own covers, then the ones
available for purchase should be a little bit better in quality
& made to last...It's very sad they aren't.",3.0
"I'm a digi-chick and even so, I don't think I would buy an electronic sewing machine. Computerization is just still too buggy and I don't want a sewing machine that crashes! So I chose this mechanical model to replace my 1960s era Singer. I've been quite pleased with its performance. It sews easily through heavy or layered fabric, buttonholes like a dream. For the price, I think it's great.
The main problem that I have with it is the visual design -- it has a stars and stripes, red, white and blue motif on the front! Why? It seems immoral to me to use patriotism to sell a product that has nothing to do with the concept. Like putting Jesus on a box of breakfast cereal. Really, I almost sent it right back. Also, it's called the ""Creative Spirit Plus."" Plus what? Nowhere was it told. Just a meaningless ""Plus."" What do they think we are, idiots, to fall for such a stupid thing?",3.0
The automatic needle theader did not work. I have to thread needle by hand. I'm using the machine anyway.,3.0
"14 Years Later:
I've continued to use this machine sporadically, and it's been generally reliable. My biggest frustration was always the sketchy speed control. Press a little and it groans and barely moves, press a little harder and it's suddenly zooming through the line.

I just almost finished my first quilt, but when trying out the decorative stitches to finish my binding, the drive train was periodically binding up, even without fabric. I took the machine cover apart to try to see why, and while I was poking around, half a plastic gear fell out! Now the needle won't move sideways at all. I found a parts diagram book on Singer's website in hopes of fixing it myself (a shop visit would be nearly as expensive as a new machine!), but it seems they no longer make the part I need (disc driving gear). Phooey. Guess I'm buying a new machine.
*******
Hm.  I thought I'd written and submitted a review for this, but it never showed up.  I'll try again.
This machine and I got off on a bad foot, but overall it's OK.
The bad:
- included oil bottle leaked all over the accessories compartment during shipping.  I took apart and dried off everything I could, but it all still reeks of oil.  I'm leery of putting the bottle back in the compartment, 'cause it'd have to go on its side again.  This then becomes a storage issue.
- bobbin loading didn't work like I thought.  I assumed it would pop over when full as other machines I've used do, but instead the ""stopper"" just sort of almost stops the full bobbin from turning.
- drive belt came off during shipping.  I was able to remove the small side panel and wiggle my fingers in and get it repositioned (which was relatively easy, thankfully), but opening the plastic casing any more would have required removing all of it, which would have required a very long thin screwdriver that exceeded the contents of my decently-stocked toolbox.
- needle threader doesn't line up if the needle is fully seated.  However, the needle can be pulled down a fraction of an inch before tightening the screw, and the threader will line up properly.
I haven't yet watched the video, but the manual is good and the operations are fairly straightforward if you've used another machine before.  Changing stitches and stitch widths is pretty easy and straightforward.
The machine isn't very fast even at full speed (my old White was faster), but it gets the job done and there are some handy accessories, including button sewers and buttonholers and a few different specialty feet.  I had no problems with the variable-speed pedal control (it's more sensitive than that old White, at any rate).
Other people have complained about the plastic body, but it's really just a plastic shell over a metal body, so the core of the thing is sturdy enough without all the extra weight of an all-metal machine (like my old one).  The bad thing in my eyes is that the case Amazon recommended to go with this (Singer 611 - you can read my review of that on its product page) is little more than a sturdy dustjacket.  I'm used to a case that allows the machine to be integrated in and only the top has to be removed to use the machine, but this combo doesn't get that privilege.  The integral carry handle on the machine is pretty nice, though, and actually more comfortable to carry than the case.
Overall, not a bad machine.  Not a great machine, either, but for the price you get a pretty good amount of functionality.",3.0
"My daughter bought this item with her b-day money. She loves it. Plays with it all the time. We have reorder replacement parts a couple of times all ready with the easy form that can with the item.

"The quality of these scissors is great just like all Fiskar scissors and the price was great; however, I was not able to choose the color.  If they had been blue, red, or green, they would have been perfect (5-star), but an 8-year old boy is not about to use purple scissors in front of other classmates.  I ended up buying another pair where I could choose the color and donated the purple ones to the classroom.",3.0
"These are terrific easy-to-use scissors, but useless to my 3rd-grade son for whom I bought them -- he refuses to take them to school because they arrived in magenta, instead of the blue shown.

I know that there are ""no boy colors"" however, I am not willing to send my 7 year old boy to school with hot pink scissors.

Really wish I could have asked for a particular color. These were for a boy and we got pink. I misread the title and thought it said 5-pack not 5-inch. Guess that's what I get for ordering in a rush. Too much trouble to send them back. I'll just have to go buy him another pair.,3.0
"Very nice item but did I need it? Probably not because the kid tossed it aside already, got bored. Nice item though!",3.0
"I suppose this could happen with any make and model, but my machine quickly began to jam, almost breaking the needle. After I researched the problem, and making sure everything was set up correctly, all to no avail, I called tech support. The man was very helpful, and we went through the process of mounting the bobbin correctly. The problem seemed to be solved, and I joked that as soon as we got off the phone it would start up again.

And that's exactly what happened. After about 3 inches of stiching, the machine jammed once again. The tech had told me that if making sure the bobbin was mounted correctly didn't solve the problem, the machine's needle-bobbin carriage timing needed adjustment. At this point I decided to return the machine.

I give EuroPro high marks for having an accessible customer support line, and a friendly rep. The machine itself was more ""manual"" than I had anticipated - no auto threading, etc. I liked the hard case, but the detachable work deck didn't line up well when it was installed.

I think in my case I need to go up to a computerized model for a little more money. I'm now considering a Brother and a Singer. The thing that keeps me from the Brother, though, is there is no telephone support number, AFAICS. It's either use email or bring the machine in. If I have the kind of problem I just had, I can see this becoming a multi-day, affair.

Dealing with Amazon was good. The machine came quickly, and returning a defective unit is about as painless as one could expect it to be.

So I'm happy for all the rave reviews here - and I place a lot of weight on user reviews - but in my case it didn't work out this time.

Happy sewing! Put a lot of love into it, and may you get rich rewards from it.",3.0

When I tried to do the backside after doing the front the front side transferred onto the pillow case the instructions tell you to use.

Packaged well and easy to use instructions. The transfer started to peel off the shirt by the end of the day. It's hard to say if it was the transfer sheet or the user.

"You have to understand these aren't going to offer vinyl, heat pressed quality results.  I bought these transfers to make shirts for a trip.  I didn't expect much more than a wear or two.  With that in mind, they served their purpose ok.  Some of the shirts turned out great and some still peeled regardless of pressure,  heat,  or time.  The shirts that turned out well also held up better to washing obviously.  So far 2 washes and no peeling or creaking.  The shirts that peeled or cracked from the start just got worse with washing.  After initial application, prior you washing, the images felt papery.  After washing,  they are still a little stiff, but softer than before. From a distance it's hard to tell the transfer is an iron-on.... maybe more noticeable prior to washing as the transfer has a slight gloss to it.  Overall, I'd  say you get what you pay for.",3.0
This product can not be used ink jet printers.,3.0
"Is okay, but doesnt hold up long",3.0
"Okay, over half got gunked up in the printer and were unusable.  Followed all the directions. After three washes, they've peeled off. Good for maybe a one wear thing, but these are not a viable solution for frequent use.",3.0
"I finally got a chance to try these. The paper did not absorb the ink well, so the colors were not as vibrant as they should have been. Yellow looked great, however. I cut my design on a Cricut machine, which worked beautifully. The transfer to the shirt also worked well, and I had some sharp corners rather than rounded ones as the instructions suggested. This transfer paper will work fine if you want muted colors.",3.0
With the first laundry the image is damaged. It is required to apply heat for longer on the image so that it adheres well to the garment,3.0
"Product is good, and only works for light colored shirts.  and the it does print clear (see through).  However, 1-2 washes and it started to peel.  Also, make sure you use a really good iron for it and make sure it's really hot.  Because it definitely does make a difference.",3.0

"I'm disappointed in the quality of these iron on transfers when it comes to clothing. Despite following the instructions that came with the sheets, the transfer did not hold up well in the wash. Only parts of the iron on remained in tact so words are missing and pieces of illustration are just ripped right off.

However, for what I purchased them for, they look great on patches! But even still, I eventually noticed they begin to bubble over time. And don't even think about putting them in the wash.",3.0
"Bought to make t-shirts for a weight loss team, easy to print on, didn't ever get to try to iron the image on to the shirts though, so can't honestly state my opinion on them.",3.0
"I couldn't find any other easy, inexpensive way to get a design onto a tee-shirt, so I appreciate these for what they are. Now, you have to keep in mind that they do not provide professional results. The reason for this doesn't have much to do with the printer. The reason these are not the ""coolest thing in the world"" is because the texture under the iron-on is different from the rest of the shirt. I've seen people mention it losing stretch in that area, and that's an accurate description in my opinion. Mine has held up to a wash or two without a problem, but I could see it ripping or cracking after a few wears. To be honest, these can be nice f you're in a pinch, but I wouldn't want to wear it like I wear a ""real"" tee shirt.

The question I was wondering before I tried this is; is there a background behind the print? The answer is YES. It's clear, but it shows like you put a transparent coat of something firm and shiny underneath. Whatever shape you cut, you will have the background under. They say to cut close to the edges, but of course with text, it is going to have the shiny area between the letters. I would think smaller things that have no empty space, would work much better, like a small circle or a knocked out logo.

I included a picture of my shirt. As you see, the clear background is visible (look between the hand and the text). I dislike the way it feels with the whole front of the shirt being stiffer - but yes, without a lot of materials, you can do this and it's fun. I only made the one shirt and I didn't love the outcome so i haven't used any of the other transfers. Perhaps I will find a use for them one day.",3.0
Hard to get onto the shirt had to press super hard and took forever.. But we eventually got there,3.0

"The package we got was very old, and the transfers did not work.  We have used the same exact product countless times over the years, and never had a problem.  We went and bought the same thing in store and it was fine.  Normally a great product. Think we got one that was bad for whatever reason.  Literally, wouldn't transfer.  Heat did not affect it.  But it printed out fine.  When we got the same thing in store, it worked perfectly.  No idea what happened.",3.0

My son came home with a wind energy project recently and his school had asked him to build a windmill. I had some piece of wood in the basement that was left by my carpenter when he made the window sill for our home. I wanted a decent tool kit to cut wood into various shapes and sizes.

Only downfall that I saw is that the packaging of the item and the instructions don't give a clear idea of what each tool tip does.  They are in their own little compartments which then has descriptions next to them; however, if you don't keep the product in it's packaging after each use, you will have no idea (unless memorized) as to what each tip does..

It is sometimes a little difficult to get the accessory tips securely tightened into the Dremel, but with some fiddling, they do get in there right.  For the price, this has a million uses and is of reasonable quality.",4.0

"The tool works as expected, but the stencil is not very useful. It takes a lot of practice to achieve good results with or without stencil. The stencil allows the tip too much play with bad results. The stencils and tip should be designed to guide the tip with no play. With this stencil you are still effectively free-handing the tip with the stencil providing rough positioning and size guidance. Having said this, the stencil is really an add-on and not advertised as a precision tool, so my fault for assuming it would force good results. This is a free hand tool and it needs practice to get good results.",4.0
"Works well, but is really really noisey",4.0
"Good price, great delivery!",4.0
Nice product. work good. recommend,4.0
worked as designed...only complaint the letter stencil that comes with it the letters are excessively small,4.0
I love this product as an artist. I am constantly using it on plexiglass to do intaglio dry point etching. It really produces light or thin etching depending on what you want. My only problem is that it's way too loud! I have to go into a studio space where no one is and put my headphones on.,4.0
"It's okay, just wasn't good for the project I was working on",4.0

"Great little tool. Powerful and effective in etching and egg blowing crafts. I did buy additional drill heads to make this more universally applicable to my craft needs. Holding the drill and turning it on and off are difficult while multi-tasking in craft work so I cannot give it 5 stars. Also, it is difficult to adjust the changing drill heads due to the very deep and small screw that is the sole means of holding the drill heads in place. A good starter tool for craft jobs.",4.0
I think this thing works great BUT requires artistic talent AND steady hands.  It's rather difficult to use if you lack either.  I can do initials on things but nothing beyond that.,4.0
Good product,4.0
"Once you get the tip into the engraver it works well. PROBLEM, there's no way to get the tip into the engraver.  They should put the tool required for assembly in the packaging.  It takes a small flathead screwdriver.",4.0

"This was my first dremel tool, and I was worried that it would be difficult to use.  This thing is surprisingly easy to use and put together.  I bought some metal blanks and recorded a message, printing out the image of the wavelength.  I then taped the printout onto the blank and traced over the image with the dremel tool.  It transferred and etched the image into the blank quite nicely and made cute little gifts for family and friends.

I love that this tool can be held like a pencil, which makes it very easy to control.  It comes with a stencil for small lettering, which is helpful, too.  I have used this quite a lot for about 6 months now, and it has held up quite nicely.

The tip insertion point doesn't seem like it would hold up well, and it never seems to be tight enough for my taste.  I was worried that it would come out while I was using it, but that hasn't happened yet.  Also, it is quite loud.  I am sure this is normal for a dremel, but the noise and the vibration do take some getting used to for a newbie.

It is a very affordable and simple way to get started with using a dremel tool.  There are lots of bits that can be purchased that will enable you to do more, but the one it comes with is a good size for a beginner.

All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase.",4.0

"Over the years, a lot of my tools have grown legs and seemed to have walked off by themselves.  All surviving tools and new tools have been marked.......not sure if that will keep the survivors becoming wanderers but at least if one goes AWOL, at least I can help it finds it way home.  It gets the job done.......should have done this years ago........would not have had to make new friends with so many new tools.",4.0
Have been using this to sign my wood bowls. Works okay and easier to use than a regular dremel. I go over it with stain to darken the writing and then sand it back off. Looks much better than using that black sharp type pen that would end up all over my hands and face.,4.0
"It's a Dremel and I have never had a problem with their products.  Fits well in the hand, is easy to change burrs and I can easily adjust the speed to fit the task.  Good price also.",4.0
"DOES THE JOB,GOOD FOR NAMING OR MARKING THINGS.",4.0
"I obsessively write my name on all of my possessions. All my tools, electronic devices, and other possessions. Until my purchase of this engraver, I did all of this with permanent marker, and dealt with the marker getting rubbed off or fading over time. I wanted an engraver, but I assumed that they were expensive because I'd never looked at the prices for them before. I guess the word ""engraver"" just sounds expensive to me... I don't know.

Anyway, one day this was in my recommended items list and I was surprised that it was under $20 dollars. Yes, this was a total impulse purchase and amazon's advertising algorithm works really well. Well done.

Since receiving the engraver, I have used it to write my name on everything that I can. My tools, my phone, my laptops, everything. It is the same urge that you get to write on everything with a permanent marker when you have one in hand, or the urge you get to label everything you get with a label maker, only this thing amplifies this urge because it's a power tool, and who doesn't like power tools?

The engraver itself: My one complaint is that it is super loud. I'm very protective of my hearing, I don't use this thing without hearing protection. It works well, and is dead simple to use, and after about 30 seconds of practice on a piece of scrap aluminum, I was proficient enough to use it on something that I value.",4.0
I like this product it was as described by amazon and I am very happy with the product.  I will buy more if I find that I am in need of them.  Great for arts and crafts and for the novice experimenter in anyone.,4.0
Works good enough for me.,4.0
ok,4.0
Works like I expected it would.,4.0
"Works well on softer material, soft steel, aluminum, glass, brass etc.. I needed to engrave some dies and it worked to some extent. I am going to try the diamond bit and maybe I can get a little deeper penetration. Overall this is a good product, easy to control and the noise level didn't bother me.",4.0
Didn't come with the letter and number template as advertised.,4.0
Used it to engrave a couple of metal object and engrave a belt. Works well. easy to handle and use. it was a little difficult to install the bit but it worked when installed.,4.0
Very handy and usefull for any shop,4.0
Works really great but it's pretty loud. Has a plug which is useful in my opinion,4.0
"No problems, had a while.",4.0
This Dremel engraver works great! Came a day early which was great as well. Template it comes with is tiny. I bought more templates just in case of unforseen engraving projects. The only con is that this thing is loud!!! Which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I assume the louder the better but if you live in an apartment like I do you might want to buy it and test it out to see if its too noisy for you.,4.0
I use this for my builds and I have to number them by hand this make it so much easy.,4.0
"Works fine, but very loud and construction isn't of the greatest quality.  But for the price and occasional use it's fine.",4.0
"Basic drill to engrave items. Only thing is it's LOUD and vibrates. It goes the job and comes with a small plate to follow the letters and numbers to make it look professional. VERY easy to use!

Put the tip on, set to how deep you want to go and plug it in, turn on and away you go!

Great to protect items from theft so nobody can say it's not yours! Put the last four #s of your SSN, or last name, initials, or anything relating to you to engrave.",4.0
"very nice little tool for engraving on almost anything.  It is a bit loud, but does a good job.",4.0
"Here are three issues, one the included tip was so hard to find, (it is in a slot in front of package) that I thought mine was missing so I order two more.  Next issue is the size of the set screw, I have a screwdriver set with tons of bits so I had the small enough size but most people don't, you could perhaps switch to a philips and then most would have a bit or include a screw driver. Or an even better idea, WHY NOT SEND IT WITH BIT INSTALLED?  And I had a difficult time trying to use the letter template, I just got frustrated. The bit that is included is great and I was able to lable my tools but when the DIAMOND BIT, I was very pleased, I am able to mark my tools no matter how hard with my last name in a nice clean cursive with out fighting the bit bounce from hardened steel.  The instructions are also sorely lacking in detail.  Had those issues been not been there I would have given it five stars.  How about a little compartment on the tool to store extra bits?",4.0
"Good amount of power, but would be nice IF it could be more compact ALSO. Not needing a screw driver to change bits would be nice too.",4.0
Works well for price but VERY loud! You won't be able to do projects at night! Haha,4.0
a good handy size to use any time,4.0
"Works as promised, and engraves keys wonderfully, which is why I bought it. The only reason I give it 4/5 stars is that you cannot use it with the provided stencil, so why even bother adding it to the product?",4.0
"It works great, used it immediately. If you want your tools to be your tools when working with someone else this is a good way to do it.",4.0
Well worth the money.  Perhaps I'm being too hard only giving 4 stars as I'm comparing it with a pneumatic etcher I used before so it's probably not fair.  I would still highly recommend this.  I used it on tools. Didn't try it on glass so I can't speak to that.  I would still count on the Dremel name as I have other quality tools they make and am happy with.,4.0
"If you have problems with this item you might be a one who ordered for second time, so i discovered this and i will debrief you for your feedback awareness and benefit:
IT is important to know the watt to use the transformer.
if the volt is 120 and the A is 0.2

you deduct the wattage by multiplying the volt into the ampere !
so 120 (0.2) gives me 24

I've tried the dremel in engraving letter it worked quite well!

so these specs is applicable to the dremel engrave letter!
so 24 volt can go with 100 voltage or 200 voltage transformer which transfer volt to 120.

If you use low volt with high volt immediate the thing will burn so safety is a transformer.
If you use high volt with low volt, it won't affect!

The stabilizer varies form 1/2 kilo v to kilo  v to 5 kilos v, etc.

But i haven't tried the 200 v transformer yet.
will inform you of the results in another customer review, but this might be beneficial to you.
~Hope this helps!~
Love fully, live vibrantly and smile~~~~~~~~~

I have tried it it is good! but i don't how many years or duration it will bear!
i just increase the Gage gradual and lower it gradual to turn on and off the power! Hope this helps",4.0
"As other reviews mention, the small screw is hard to get out- you may even think it's stuck. DON'T GIVE UP!!! As an arrogant trumpet player, I had the unwarranted confidence to assume that applying a drop of valve oil would work. I ran the engraver on its highest setting after oiling the small screw, and after some steady pressure twisting the screw, the vibrations worked it out. One of my issues was that I was using a weak flathead eyeglass screwdriver. I'm surprised I didn't break the thing.

After a couple of times falling out from the lube, I wiped it off and it hasn't fallen out since. I love this little thing- I'm engraving EVERYTHING. Every tool, flashlight, camping dish, trumpet mute, music stand, glasses cases, toys... it's fun to use. I just wish I had a second one so I could engrave my engraver.",4.0
Very good,4.0
"This product lists that it Engraves on metal, glass, wood, plastic, and ceramic. I found that this product does all that exceptionally well except for metal. I bought this for engraving metal so when I received it I was a little disappointed. For the price though you can't be mad it is a very inexpensive item to add to my tool collection. It does engrave metal but it is very hard and takes a lot of practice to make it clean, even with practice the lines it makes aren't perfect and doesn't go deep. I am still happy with this product and it deserves its 4 out of 5 rating. Dremel products are always the best. I recommend to anyone that needs a cheap engraver. If you want to engrave metal you might want to look elsewhere at a more expensive option.",4.0
Worked great to etch 6 lines in a 6 gallon carboy (for beer brewing) to show the level of each gallon.,4.0
It's good but makes alot of noise,4.0
"This thing is really cool.  I agree with another reviewer that the template is pretty useless, but if you can hold a pen and write, you can use this freehand.  I bought it to engrave stones for pet grave markers, hoping they'll endure better than Sharpie-on-spray-painted-wood-cross markers and have only practiced, but I learned that you definitely want a smooth surface.  I've engraved stone and metal (hand tools) for practice.  I look forward to finally working on the markers.",4.0

"UPDATE:

I gave this a one star at first because I felt a little cheated because I didn't see the free 9924 engraving point that was supposed to be included,  then felt really bad once I found the missing 9924 so I'm updating it. This might  have happened to others who bought this item and complained about the same thing. The product does come with a free 9924, but it's a small piece. They placed it within the plastic packaging. Therefore, if you unwrapped it and threw away the plastic, you also threw out your free piece. See the picture for more details.

I tried it...it works great! It's a bit difficult to switch out the engraving points. The screw holding the piece in place is very small so you have to be careful not to drop that sucker. You sort of need a special, small and strong screw driver to remove it, so be aware of that. Also, I suggest to remove it on a table with a cloth on top so if you do drop the screw you can find it... I'm calling it a screw because that's the only name for it...But that this super tiny...can't stress that enough. I'm new to this game, but I have a feeling I'll be using this thing a lot! Great for the price!

I just received it, therefore I haven't tried it. However, how can I try the machine when it is missing the tip. ""The included 9924 carbide engraving point ensures precise result."" > NOT INCLUDED

I plugged it in and it makes a very loud noise. I think this is normal...but its my first engraving tool so I don't know.
There is no way of contacting Dremel so I hope they see this review and contact me because I'd like the tip please.

I won't change my review until I receive the piece I was promised.

Thanks...and for the rest of you fine people out there..beware or at least know to buy the tip separate.",4.0

"I love this for wood work and it works out okay for hand engraving tags but it is a little unsteady for the tags. Great for the price though! It has worked out for sales because I have good penmanship and a lot of my customers like the handmade look because I work on etsy, doesn't produce consistent enough results for a jeweler to use or anything, but I didn't expect it to :).",4.0

"Easy to use.  The only improvement I can suggest is a metal alpha-number template.  The plastic one is showing signs of wear since I use the same 2 letters repeatedly to engrave initials on plastic items.  Still, not bad at all for the price.",4.0
"Just bought this and I love it. The only thing I would wish was different is the on-off switch. It is located at the top. I wish it had a button down by your fingers. A push button that shuts off when you let it go, with a lock to lock it on.",4.0

"This is a very good instrument. I would like to give it five stars, but I think the grip could be a little better. I'm not sure if you can turn down the vibrations anymore without sacrificing the power you need for penetrating the wood, which I mostly use it for. For the price this tool is more than worth it, and I would recommend it even to a novice...just make sure you get some practice if you use free-form.",4.0

Purchased this as a gift and my son-in-law really liked it.  Great to engrave tools!,4.0
"This engraver is very easy to use. Only trouble I had was it did not come with an extra tip, as your description said. The tip was unattached. I had to install it. It kept falling out until my husband was able to get it to stay.",4.0
It works fine. The letters engraver is uselless. Engraving glass or ceramis is difficult. Perhaps I have to change to a diamond tip,4.0
to secure the engraving point don't do like I did and try to remove the black collar thinking its underneath it. The end piece of the dremel I received was turned so the screw slot was not visible in the cutout. Use pliers and pull and twist the end piece until the screw appears.,4.0
"The Dremel Engraver is pretty nice and does what I expected from it. I have one small issue with it and that is the set screw is counter sunk which makes it very hard to get to even with a small standard screwdriver, design flaw I'm guessing. Bought this engraver for carving on acrylic which it does nicely. I've always liked Dremel products. Would recommend.",4.0
"I have one of these at the job and bought another for home use.  I use it to mark tools, reloading equipment, just about anything that I need to mark.  The tip is replaceable and is available at almost any Walmart or just order replacements from Amazon.  I've only had to replace the tip once on the unit at work.  Great little engraver.",4.0

"Just got my Dremel engraver in today. The packaging was fine, and the installation instructions for the engraver tip seemed pretty straightforward - however, there was a small bit of metal burr blocking the engraver tip from sliding all the way down into the engraver.

I used one of my jeweler's files to gently remove the burr, and the engraver tip is now sitting right where it's supposed to.",4.0

Gave this as a gift for our future daughter in law.  She's very crafty and an engraver was on her Christmas list.  So we liked the fact that Dremel put one out.  She was greatly impressed at all the features it had.,4.0
"I feel like I'm running Santa's Workshop when I pull out my Dremel to do engraving.  Though I have worked through counter balancing the very strong vibrations by resting work on a surface that will both absorb some vibration, yet provide resistance, It is very weighty and noisy!! Still, very glad I have this tool and look forward to tweaking its use.  Also, cord is a bit short, so keep an extension cord handy too.  One last thing, not much variation in the output, despite the many bits we purchased.",4.0
"When I turned it on for the first time, I thought it was broken; it makes a quite loud noise even it is set at the lowest speed. The sound startles my pets every time. Otherwise it is a great engraving tool.",4.0

"Great engraver for use on any material. Easy to use, just plug in and turn on, with 5 different speeds. The only problem is that it is extremely loud.",4.0
"In terms of quality and performance, I'd say it's a five star product.  So far I only used it to engrave names on plastic products.  It's fairly easy to use.  I can write letters fairly neatly with it.  I owned another engraver many years ago.  My old engraver created dotted lines even when I wrote at normal speed.  This Dremel engraver does not have that problem.

I removed one star because it is VERY noisy.  Also, it would be nice if it is a bit smaller.",4.0
"I've used this engraver for a week now, and it's a good engraver.  This has the same draw backs as any other mechanical engraver.  It noise and the letter are never perfect.  I've used a lot worst engravers that cost a lot money.  Bottom line, this is a great buy for the price.  The template is worthless though.",4.0
I've used this tool for a few hours now so I can't attest to the durability of the the carbide tip of the engraving tool but I can say safely that it can engrave well but it takes a very steady and precise hand together the results that you desire from the dremel engraver. It also has the problem of digging in while using it. And on any setting it is loud enough to cause a call to the cops if used at odd hours if you live in an apartment complex. Also the engraving point has no locking or way of securing.so if while using the tool you lift up from th item you're working on the tip will fall out and most likely get lost.,4.0
"I like this engraver with interchangable bits. Minimal vibration in hand. IS NOT 1.15 amp, it's 2/10 amp. I don't know the quality of the Dremel bits yet but they seem ok. Great price too at $15.",4.0
"I am a department chair of a math department at a middle school.  I use this to engrave the back of graphing calculators in my classroom.  I engrave all the class sets we have been adding and any of my own students who want to have it done.  It is really loud and after you have been doing about 10 calculators my hand starts to be a little sore.  All that being said, it does get the job done nicely.  I would order it again and recommend it to others.",4.0
"I used the engraver on a few cameras which I loan out to clients for table cameras. Reading through the instructions I was surprised to find no mention of what setting to start with for different surfaces. Something like plastics, setting 1, metal, setting 2, etc. It just said use the lowest setting speed which works on the surface.

The lowest setting worked fine for the heavy plastic. I did find the shape of the device a bit awkward to free hand for small engraving and I have big hands. You'd want something with a better design for detailed engraving. But for putting your name/driver's license number or whatever on something, this is great.",4.0
"The shipping was great. The tool itself I find very nice. I only have 2 problems with this as a whole. First was that it did not come with a key to loosen and tighten the bit. That was a bit of a pain. But if you have a pair of tweezers or something like that you don't need you can easily bend them and get the screw out. The second problem I had was the misleading recommended products. The flex shaft and bit sets ARE for engraver but they ARE NOT for this tool. They are meant for the dremel rotary.

As for the quality of this tool, I like it. It is a little loud but you can't expect it to be to quiet I suppose. Sounds like a pair of hair clippers. The bit seems rather thick at first but once you actually engrave with it you realize it is pretty fine. And it works well on glass, metal, stone, and plastic. You will want to do plastic on a lower setting though so you don't melt plastic on the tip of your bit.

If you are going to do some standard engraving I would definitely recommend this. just make sure you don't buy all the stuff that amazon recommends with it.",4.0
"The tool works well, but it is very loud.  The template is not that great because it is hard to hold the tool within the lines.",4.0
"I use this to engrave my name or initials on some things for identification in case it's stolen or would get mixed up with someone elses, like my garmin running watch.  I also engrave the back of my marathon medals with my time.  I didn't find the template usable, and I don't have the skill to make the numbers look professional, but it's good enough for me.  I practiced on some scrap medal and pretty quickly gained confidence that it would look decent.  Just grip it like a pen and don't be in a hurry.  It works best for me to lock my hand and wrist and move my arm--less likely for the engraver to slip that way.",4.0
for the price this is an excellent product. Definitely lives up to the Dremel BRAND. It makes it easy to add my name to my metal art projects. The Letter stencil is a bit awkward but that is not the reason I purchased this.,4.0
It was delivered on time.  The tool works great. It came with a template with letters and numbers. But they are somewhat bigger size. I am doing free hand engraving mainly to scribe identification on metal specimens. The engraver makes lots of noise which is normal for this type of tool. May want to use ear plugs for safety. I am happy with its performance.,4.0
"I bought this product engrave the name of my children in the things that they bring to school or friends' homes. Previously I wrote the names with a soldering iron but it was very difficult to handle and was not very good results. With this tool I can easily write on many materials, especially plastic and aluminum (It's what I use most). The only fault I find is that it makes too much noise, but friends have told me that is normal in this type of tool, but I still recommend it for simple jobs.",4.0
I could not figure out how to use the letter and number template so i called the manufactor and he said to hold ingraver straight up and follow the guide . It's really to small to fool with .I purchased the diamond tip to use on glass and only use it to hand engrave things around the house with my ss no. on them for theft.,4.0
"I bought the Dremel Engraver last year and used it to create gifts from my daughter for her grandparents. She had just learned how to write the alphabet so I had her use a permanent marker to write their names on key chains that had a metal plate that was intended to be professionally engraved. I just traced over her shaky handwriting with my novice shaky engraving. It wasn't a flawless copy of what she did but there was no doubt that it was her handwriting. The permanent marker just rubbed/washed off. Everyone loved them.
This year I bought some vases from I k e a that were made from very thick glass. For a wedding shower gift she drew pictures and wrote the names of the bride and groom around the vase. Once again I traced over the marker and her pictures and writing were preserved. Once again, a huge hit.
So, I have found this tool ideal for preserving art work/writing done by my 4yr old.
My only question is this...on the photo for this product the person is engraving a glass plate with beautiful leaves on it. How is the finished product so beautiful? I am only beginning to use this tool. I could improve with practice but am I missing some accessories or tools? I really don't know anything about engraving so I would love to hear any suggestions.
Thanks",4.0

Put the tip on, set to how deep you want to go and plug it in, turn on and away you go!

Great to protect items from theft so nobody can say it's not yours! Put the last four #s of your SSN, or last name, initials, or anything relating to you to engrave.",4.0
But you probably won't use it as much as you think you will...,4.0
"4 stars instead of 5 because I know there are better scribers out there - but hard to find for the home hobbyist. This one is a little noisy but quieter than most inexpensive models. Yes, it is easy to adjust, and easy to control. I am amused and pleased at the inclusion of a letter and number template. I wish the AC cord were a little longer, by a foot or two.",4.0
"For the price, this is a good model.  I'm sure I'll have to replace the tip soon, but it has worked for over 50 engravings so far.",4.0
"The metal ring at the junction of the wood and the awl shaft came off--not glued on well enough? Still, this is a great tool and it works well. I use it to punch holes in book board (about the same thickness/strength as chip board) and it works like a charm.",4.0
"This awl does not have the horrible secondary bevel that a lot of awls do that makes them useless for boring tapered holes. For that reason, I like this awl.

The handle has varnish, gross, but an easy fix.",4.0
These were not as I expected but they worked well for bookmaking.,4.0
Does the job.,4.0
"Good high quality awl for lots of applications, but not good for book binding.",4.0
Simple tools.  Nice.,4.0
It is a quality tool but it is slightly more blunted on the tip than the picture makes you think.,4.0
