"I purchased this as a gift two years ago for a weekend wannabe car guy in my family. Because his cars were all new, he only had a chance to use it one or twice. I ended up borrowing it a couple times, as did some others in my family. The last time I borrowed it about 6 months ago, it didn't work. Now, granted, it probably spent a year in his garage doing nothing, but shouldn't it still work? And word to the wise, 2 years ago I paid $75 for it so wait for a sale. I contacted Actron to see if they offer any sort of repair or service and I hope that they are reasonable about that.

But when it did work, I really liked the item and recommended it to countless friends and family. Now that it is not functioning, I have to go to Advance Auto or AutoZone to scan, but luckily there is no short supply of them. I'm at a loss if I should replace the gift since I was the one who discovered it broken, I guess I need to find an etiquette book.",2.0
"The manufacturer does not support this product. There is no info on Actron's website related to this model. The software included does not cover anything after 2002. An email sent to the address on Actron's website came back undeliverable. If I had known these facts, I would have bought a different brand. The unit does read codes, and displays a short description of the definition of the code. But since the software does not cover my 2005, I am wondering whether the codes are correct and complete for my vehicle.",2.0
"I owned mine for 13 months (one month past warranty) when it scrambled it's messages. It probably was less than 13 months, but I procrastinated. At any rate, the repair cost quoted, with shipping, was $10 less than the original purchase price. After telephoning twice, e-mailing the same, Actron wouldn't budge. Half that might have worked for me, but not full price.
In other words, it works for a year and then they want you to buy a new one. I will be looking elsewhere.",2.0
"For those to whom it may be important, and it is to me: though the Amazon description says this scanner is made in the USA, and so does the description on the manufacturer's website, the scanner I received clearly says made in China on the packaging. I know I jumped at this purchase when I did partly because of the Made in the USA statement. So I'm a little disappointed. Also, the CD requires Windows and Internet Explorer to read it. No Macs need apply.",2.0
"This battery charger is much better than a standard manual charger in so much as it properly charges a battery through stages.  It will not charge a battery that is ""dead"" without faulting.  Best to give your battery a boost from a manual charger, then switch over to the Smart charger.  The battery clamps are very poorly made and will easily break.  Replacement parts are not available through the manufacturer.",2.0
"Battery clamp broke in only 4 days. The clamps were plastic and one snapped, probably due to the spring tension of the clamps.  Vector suggested I ship it back to them (at my expense)and they would send me a new unit.  I suggested they have their Chinese suppliers design a more durable battery clamp.

Otherwise, the VEC1093 charger appears to be as advertised and does a good job.  I would buy another if they ever redesigned the battery clamps.",2.0
"Upon receiving this charger I though it would prove to be quality product. Unfortunately not the case.

I have had this charger for a year.  All of the labeling has come off the unit.  The lableling is barley better than a soup can.  The worst thing is that both of the clamps broke at different times.

Called Vector and they said to send the unit back to them. I asked if i could just send the broken clamp back for a new one, the girl on the phone said no.  If I changed them myself it would void the warrenty.  Bogus !

Pay $15.00 to send the unit back for a broken clamp.

Very poor customer care policies on such an expensive charger.

The charger is still charging but would not spend the additional $$$ it costs for this unit.  There are many other 3 stage chargers that would perform equally or better.

I have yet to get the 100 amp quick start to work.

Hope this is helpful",2.0
"I am kinda surprised by all the 5 star reviews as this product has ""no grit"" feel to it at all.  Seriously I could use this and pleasure myself, that's how smooth and buttery it is with no grit at all to be felt.  I am not trying to be funny just don't expect this to remove anything but the finest finest of scratches and hazes.

This is nothing like the rubbing compound I remember from years ago where the slightest mistake could be costly.  I even used this with a drill and pad with almost no real results.",2.0
"I didn't work me, It's hard to polish the car with this product.
Although I got it to wax the dashboard and everything inside the car,but it wasn't the proper item for inside .",2.0
works like compound,2.0
"Turtle wax, 40/50 years ago was great. It would compound scratches out and remove stains from
car paint. I bought it, shipped it over to Vietnam and it would not take gas stains off of my motorcycle.
Live and learn.
No, I would not recommend this product.

flimsy product. didn't like it,2.0
I do not recommend.  Used about 1x per month for portable DVD player in car.  Stopped working after about 12-15 uses.,2.0
"I used it for a couple months for my daughters dvd player in the car. from day one it got really hot, and i replaced the fuse several times, now the plastic broke so you cant even plug it in. The heat really made me nervous, i will not ever buy or use this charger again.",2.0
"the bad thing is that this item shuts off unexpectedly after 30-40 minutes, and you have to wait for several minutes until plugging it in again. the good thing is that it naturally restricts kids from watching the DVD for too long.",2.0
"Had to return the 1st one which did not work.  Good thing it was easy to return at no cost to me.  Amazon quickly replaced it. Just tried to see if it's working.  It is,but haven't really used it yet.",2.0
"I bought this to substitute for batteries (2AA) for a small low current device in my car. I read the various negative reviews and they sounded as if people were using it for devices that exceeded its abilities. Turns out there are other issues besides limited current capacity. When I started using it there would be random losses of power. I found that the center contact is not designed correctly. It bottoms out in the plastic housing, so when pushed in it can easily lose contact intermittently, then get it back. Not good for use in a car. I modified the contact so it behaved more like better CLAs and things improved considerably but there were still random losses of power.

I continued to play around with it using a 12V DC brick that had has a CLA socket as it's output. I could not reproduce the problem when everything is sitting still. The connections I made to connect the coby to the camera seem solid and work just fine in the car using a remote battery pack instead of the coby. I am still unsure what is wrong with it, perhaps I was unable to improve the center contact enough or there is something inside that doesn't like the vibrations of driving. It works nice sitting still at home plugged into the brick, just won't work that well in a moving car.

If I decide to go further I'll probably modify it by wiring it to one of my better CLAs. This will eliminate the CLA part of it from use and I'll find out if it's just a mechanical contact issue or something in the underlying electronics.",2.0
"The unit works, but doesn't have enough mA to power my DroidX phone.  With today's bigger batteries a small charger such as this one isn't very useful.",2.0
will not fit Cadilacs,2.0
THE ALERT BEEP IS VERY LOW,2.0
DID NOT WORK GOOD,2.0
"I have used these before and been happy with them, but this one didn't work when I first got it out of the box.  I tapped it a few times on the tailgate and then it started to work.  I'm sure on a gasoline vehicle with a stock exhaust it would be fine but it's far too quiet for my super duty.  Installed a WOLO beeper for less than 12 dollars from amazon and works much better.",2.0
It doesn't fit on Toyota Highlander 2012. The vehicle is using 7433 bulb so it doesn't fit on 3145 style. I would be great if Amazon listed which vehicle that fit this Alert Beeper 3156 style.,2.0
"Came in on time, but didn't fit and they refuse to return my money or even take a few minutes to look for a solution.",2.0
"The light bulb is wonderful.  It's halogen, very bright but it heats up the fixture, so be mindful when sitting in reverse.  Good idea to keep it less than a couple minutes.  More later.  The Alert:  It is supposed to ""BEEP"".  When it sounds Feeble and sounds like hungry sheep or a duck and people are looking, It will soon be silent.  I drive for a living - an excess than 40k/yr.  I have a number of vans, each with at least one of these units in the drivers rear.  The beepers rarely last me a whole year in my active vehicle.  I' sure most people would do much better than I, as I get a saltwater bath more than once a week and every day do many miles of unpaved roads full of potholes and water in the winter and potholes and dust in the summer.  Just a few days ago (Wed) I replaced the unit again.  It was lighting up but the beep only lasted a week.  Tonight (Sat), I just moved my van to unload and silence again.  The light was good, (It's very dark here and I'd know instantly if one was out).  I opened the door and peered back.  Lots of light.  I stopped the engine and turned on the key...Light but Silence.  There's only one circuit in these units.  Whenever they light, they beep and vice versa.  If only one function is working, the problem is not the wiring in your vehicle, It's the unit. Recently I've had a lot of failures.  I count 4 failures now in the 2 years I've had this van and now I'm going to write the company to avoid a fifth. Very frustrating to say the least.  I've been using these for better than 15 years.  On one occasion I know the Alarm warning did pay off.  Funny story involving a tourist but I'll spare you.  I do know my back-up alarm did the job that day.

Note: It's really easy to order the wrong unit.  The 3156 bulb is the rectangular bulb socket.  The other style is the round bulb, (older 1156 style).  More about the heat...My personal experience.  If the backup light fixture is really dirty or gets cracked and dirt/dust gets inside, it will overheat easily.  The plastic lens won\t melt or anything like that.  The bulb socket  gets cooked and deteriorates over time till it no longer functions and you have replace the whole unit which may or may not include the whole tail light fixture. This is intended for myself as well:  ""We all know that proper attention to one's vehicle is the best way. to go.""

Up Date:  (Several months later.)  I wrote the Co.  They said ""send the bad ones"".  I sent 3, They quickly sent replacements and I was impressed by speed, attitude and service.  One did not work, One worked w/lite only and one worked w/lite but faint useless beep. No Comment.., Except yesterday I drove one of my older vehicles w/1156 (Round Socket bulb backup alarm) - more than 8 yrs old... works great.

My Solution.  Installed another mfg's beeper (only) unit inside behind tail light, securing w/cable tie.  Installed $40.00 (22 watt LED cluster) in backup lite socket.  Brightest light I could buy, actually hurts the eyes but really lights up the behind.  And... with almost no heat to destroy the fixture.",2.0
"**SELLER NEEDS TO CORRECT THEIR DECEPTIVE DESCRIPTION**

I ordered this before and received 5 terminal relays, but received 4 temrinal relays this time around.  Without the N.O. terminal you can not use this for some (5 wire) power lock installations unlike how they are advertising this product.  If you need the N.O. terminal I highly suggest ordering elsewhere. If you need just a 4 wire setup then this will work just fine.",2.0
"Hooked it up as the directions stated, could not get it to do what it is supposed to to. I'll keep trying but Im starting to think its a lost cause.",2.0
"I am a certified technician with over 25 years of professional automotive experience. I recently purchased a  Bulldog RS82 remote starter unit along with the 791 Bypass for the Passlock-II security system for a 2003 Olds Bravada. I finally got the unit working, but it took upwards of 10 hours to install and another 10 hours of troubleshooting to get it working. I did not purchase the T-adapter for the wire harness, and spliced all of the wires as shown in the DVD. The T-adapter would most likely have saved installation time. There were no installation instructions for the 791 Bypass in the enclosed information. The installation video is OK for the RS82 install, but is incomplete for the 791 Bypass. The DVD only describes 4 wires that need to be connected for the 791. You actually need to connect 2 more ! Upon calling tech support, I was put on hold for 45 minutes and got cut off. Was on hold for another hour and finally hung up. The best way to contact Bulldog is via E-mail. Got a response the next day and a direct dial line to a support person. This person seemed to be very knowledgeable. After several phone calls and various testing suggestions, we finally determined that not all of the wires on the 791 had been connected due to lack of installation instructions and an inaccurate video. I would not recommend this product unless you are very determined and have alot of automotive savy.",2.0
"Installed unit over Thanksgiving.  Not very straight forward, but definitely DIY.  Took me about 3 hours to install, with the correct T-harness.  After the install, I can see how it could have been quicker if I was a professional installer.
Does it start our car? Yes is does.  While parked in our garage, we can press the start button and the car starts as expected.  Sometimes it may take two or three tries, but it does start.  I have it installed in tachless mode.  It may start more reliably if I had the unit connected to the tach.  But for now it is OK.
Now for my may concern/complaint.  The advertised ""up to 400ft"" range is actually closer to 90-100ft in our vehicle.  I have read the vendors FAQ page and I have installed the antenna as straight/vertical/away from other wires as possible.  I have actually tried three different antenna locations.  None has produced any noticable increase in range.  I have sent the vendor an email to help diagnose the problem.
Until then this is a two star product.  If I can get an increase in range it, I would consider this a 3 1/2 star.  Difficult install subtracts 1 star.  Another 1/2 star subtracted for poor initial antenna range.
If I can't increase the range then this is a 1 star and I will find another brand/model.",2.0
"It took 18 days to finally receive my package. This product didn't come packaged as advertised. It was in a large padded envelope with the items inside a small cardboard box. On top of that, the written instructions had been manually edited: Instructions crossed out, stickers with corrections stuck to the pages, etc. This was confusing to me, especially for a kit that is advertised to install myself. The font for the corrections and the wire diagrams were not clear and easy to follow, like it had been printed from a bad ink cartridge. The DVD was not included in the package, as well. After this experience, I'm going to return this item and then just have a local shop install one of their remote starters.",2.0
"Worked for a couple months, the remote was tacky, would stick to the wall, and company was supposed to replace it but never did. Product doesn't work now, might be the remote, not sure.",2.0
"Know before you buy:  Trying to find an installer is nearly impossible in my area using Bulldog's recommended ""Installnet"".  Even with the bypass module, 1 installer (recommended via Bulldog's site) said another module was needed for another $100... A second installer wanted $100+ for a new key with a chip to be made.  I'm sending it back today.  The price of the system, plus $160 for installation, plus another $100+ -- I can buy an high end system installed at Best Buy for that price.",2.0
It says up to 400 feet it lies i have to be 20 ft away from my car to start it,2.0
"I was interested in a remote start so that I could warm my car up in the wintertime.  I have a 2006 Honda CR-V.

My husband tried to install this, then he realized that with my car, you need to purchase an additional part (I think it's the T-harness) in order to get around the key security system.  Once that got in, he tried to install but said it wasn't simple enough for him to do it on his own (he's not entirely car saavy, but he can do general things like change oil, etc).  So we took it to a vendor to have the remote installed.  They had to take one of my two keys to put into the engine - so now I have to go and buy another key from the dealership (I was told they run over $100 each for the ones with chips in them).

Once we got it installed, it has already set us back the cost of the initial kit, the T-Harness, the install and another spare key.  The remote works fine... when it's WARM.  Once the temperature drops below 40 degrees, it no longer worked.  The crank was too short for my car and it wouldn't start.  This defeats the whole point of getting a remote start to warm my car in the wintertime.  Perhaps it would be useful to cool my car in the summertime?

Soooo, my husband took it back to the car vendor to see if they could adjust it.  Well, apparently this kit doesn't allow you to adjust the crank.  So now, if I want a remote start that will work for me, we have to buy a more expensive kit.  *SIGH*.  My husband said that perhaps it might work on his Toyota 4-Runner as he doesn't need much crank to start his car, but he doesn't want to have to pay for another T-Harness to install it in his car and then to have to pay to get it installed.  Not worth it for him - and no guarantees that it would work in the winter!

It's hard to tell whether the range works well as if I'm in the office and try to remote start, it doesn't start my car anyways (since it's so cold), so I have no idea if it's working.

The annoying part is just how much work & money that has gone into installing this darn thing and it not even serve the function that I wanted it to.  Based on other reviews I've seen on this brand, perhaps we'll look into another brand for my next install....",2.0
"I bought 4 of these remote starters last year at Wal Mart for 60 dollars and no shipping fees and they came with everything that was needed, after I received this setup from amazon I found out that I had to order a separate module called a 791 bypass and they cost me another 25 dollars so this ended up costing more money to buy from amazon and another waiting period for the bypass so my advice is go to Wal Mart and buy one",2.0
"this item need a bypass unless if you drive a 12 year old car, the do it yourself is hard on smarter cars like an minivan, and you will not find an installer who would want to do it without charging you a couple of hundred $$, so do the math",2.0

"I am not sure how this is supposed to be different from other scrapers and pads but it does not magically clean the stove better than the scraper I already had. If you don't have one, this might be what works for you. And might I mention that whomever invented the glass top stoves that are solid black are crazy. They just do not stay clean no matter what I do.",2.0

"I should have listened to the bad reviews on this blade.  The complaints about the blade becoming loose and receding into the holder are absolutely true.  There's a serious design flaw where 2-3 plastic nubs that hold the razor blade into place are too short and the blade easily becomes dislodged with pressure.  I got this thinking that there was something special about the blade that made it safer for the stove top than a normal blade, but there's no difference.  You'd be better off getting something much better at a hardware or dollar/discount store.  This thing will work, but not well at all.",2.0
"Nothing special about this, a regular glass scraper will do the job. Made the mistake of using scraper when burner was still hot, plastic hit the hot class and melted!  Pad is too small to protect hands from a burner that is still warm.",2.0
"The first time I bought this product, it worked like a charm; but the past 3 times I have bought them, the quality seems to be very bad. A little pressure while cleaning the glass top and the blade retracts. I will consider alternatives moving forward.",2.0

"while this product may be very good, we'll never know.  We contacted 3 people in town who could install the starter, the first would not install this one, he would install the one he offers for $350.  The second one said that he took more of these out, than he  installed because they  have been known to screw up the mother boards in the vehicles.  The third guy said he would install it, 5 hours at $65.00 per hour but not guarantee anything because they have been known to screw up the vehicle once they are installed. Sat ""on hold"" with manufacturer for 20 minutes and never got anybody who knew any thing.",2.0
"The unit seems like pretty good quality, but i have not been able to install it yet as one of the three wiring harnesses was MISSING! Instead of three different harnesses, there were 2 identical ones. The other problem that i have with it is that the keys could be labeled better; there is a key on the top left and a lock on the top right, i just know that if i let somebody borrow the car, they'll end up pressing the key to unlock it and end up starting the car. Not a big deal, but the keys could have been maybe a little more thoughtfully labeled, like ""Start"" and ""Stop"", ""Lock"" and ""Unlock"" for example. Just my opinion. Other than that i guess it seems ok!",2.0
It is completely 100% not as easy as advertised.  splicing all the wires of my car just wasn't easy nor practical.,2.0
"We really liked that this rack locked to the car, and locked the bikes. However, the pivot lock that allows it to swing down so you can get into the back of the minivan/SUV broke, so it no longer swings down. We've only had it a year or so. Also, the main reason we bought this was to carry 4 bikes and then pull the tent trailer from that, and the design is all wrong. It's too long. We tried to pull our light tent trailer, and unless you're a monster truck (we've got a minivan), the safety chains don't have enough slack and got ripped off when driving--there's not enough arch available under the car for the chain, due to the length of the chain needed... (maybe if they had welded loops for the safety chain to the end of the extended hitch [if that's legal])...",2.0
"I bought this so I could get my 4 bikes on it and pull my camper at the same time. The design is not good as the camper will put too much weight on the end and will bend the thing downward... to touch the speed bumps.... IF you carry 4 kids bike maybe it would work, otherwise put the bikes on your camper so there is not too much weight on the tongue.",2.0
I used this product for my leather snowboard gloves. The water protectant lasted for a few hours then rubbed off. If you touch snow constantly then find another product.,2.0
"This is a great concept, and I really wanted to love it, in fact I still have it on my subaru with my Copperhead Fork mounts just incase I can figure a better way of using it. . . That being said. The first time on the road with this tire mount, I was going down the highway around 70 mph and heard a loud thud on my roof. Scared part of the rack ripped off, I exited the highway to see if there was any damage. No damage, but no tire upright anymore either. The mount had shifted over and landed on the roof, still attached, but rubbing the roof... I tried what others have said and added some electrical tape under the mount before using it so it does ""turn"", and I tightened the nuts till they seemed too tight. The problem still existed. With the weight of my 29er MTB X-Country bike tire, it simply can not live up to it's need. Fortunately I have another bike with a 700cc road tire that weighs 1/3rd, almost 1/4th, compared to my 29er. The rack should work for it, but I'm still nervous to bring it back on the highway, under 50mph with the road bike tire is OK. Over 50 is yet to be deteremined. Under 45mph with a 29er seemed to be fine, but I was on the highway for no more than 2 - 3 miles before having to exit! So buyer beware. Also - there is no lock, no SkS Lock, notta. A simple wrench could steal the mount off with your tire. So take it with you for the night when traveling, or lock it in your vehical after. On a nice note, it does lay nice and flat while not in use, and match my yakima rack and rail system beautifully. . .",2.0

"The Yamika BOA roof rack seemed like the best deal for a bike rack on amazon.com.

I was a bit disappointed with the way the fork mount held the bike in place. It is a tension fit only, there is not grooves or anything to grip on to the fork ends, just flat metal on flat metal. I will probably grab some small specialty washers for something to bite on because I really don't want to buy new bikes or fix someones bumper when they fly off. The rear mount is a little quirky and looks very easy to steal even with a lock. My bike is a simple road bike with 700c-23 tires on it and it is a very loose fit in the rear strap system. I will have to get some rubber or foam on there to get more pressure on the tire. I have square bars so I probably won't have the problem of my bike tires slipping down and hitting the roof of the car like a few others were having.

I was most upset with the item description. It is not a new model of this item and it is NOT the one in the picture although they are the same price. It looks similar but there were a few great improvements for the new model year in the picture.
Most noticeable is the skewer is a bolt and a threaded locknut is on the other side of the fork to keep pressure more even and to give it more bite instead of the flat surfaces of the old model. The old model I was sold does not have this nut and is instead a bolt that threads into the skewer lever, it is a PITA to adjust because the weight of the bike sits on it.

Other than that it really is a decent, cheap, easily installed bike rack. Be sure to measure your bike if you have round bars, we don't want your paint getting jazzed up. I plan to use a cable bike lock to secure my bike to the rack which does lock well.",2.0
Allot of piceses,2.0
"This cablelock combo is handy and low-priced which is good, however it is not very secure. Anyone with a hammer can break it in no time. The other issue with this cablelock is the lock itself.

"Solidly built, but doesn't fit as advertised. I have a 2013 Ram 3500 with the Class V hitch and the hitch is too wide for this product. Get the SXT5 instead, even though this says it will fit ALL class V hitches. Seems like a solid product for those with a class III or IV hitch.",2.0
"the product is ok but the shaft was not long enough to fit my 2"" receiver on my truck",2.0
The lock head is already rattling after 2 days use.,2.0
"Don't let the * review put you off. This  seems to be a regular strong lock for your trailer, similar to many other locks in the market. But compared to my previous lock, this doesn't fit as tightly, and there is some sideways movement, even when locked.

Bought it as the description stated it would lock down tightly any trailer, but it allows some movement both vertivaly and horizontally. Not enough to cause an issue when trailerig, but not tight enouhg for what I wanted it for.

Overall would be a 4, but not for what I wanted, hence lower rating.",2.0
"I can speak with surety about this product because I have owned it for five years. It received very little use the first 3.5 years. It worked great the few times I used it for those years. I only had it on the hitch when towing, and I removed it once towing was completed. But then I started towing a lot and left it in place for the last 1.5 years. Recently, I needed to take it off my hitch and found the lock was seized. Nothing worked to unlock it, so I had to cut it off; a long process that I did not have time for since I was in a hurry to get on the road. Once I pulled out the pin, I saw the pin was badly rusted within the receiver. So, in 1.5 years, this lock rusted fast and became useless.

Here is the good:
1. It is sturdy and seems to be very secure.
2. The rubber key cover works as advertised and lasts a long time.
3. Easy to operate.
4. Out of the way from my chain connections.
5. Fits my hitch very well. I have seen other reviewers complain about it being too long for class 3 and 4 hitches. I can't figure out why they have a problem with that. There is very little side-to-side motion, which does not affect anything.

Here is the bad:
1. Chrome plated. This means the metal it is made from is not corrosion resistant.
2 You have to keep the lock lubricated very frequently (like once or twice a month) to get decent life out of it (too much maintenance for me).
3. The corrosion problem could lead to structural failure without warning. That could mean losing your trailer on the road.
4. The lock mechanism can seize up from corrosion. If you end up having to cut this off your hitch, there is possibility of damaging the chrome or paint of your bumper because the cutter can and probably will slip.

Because of the corrosion problem, I would not buy this again. I would pay more for a receiver lock that is corrosion proof. Too bad those are hard to find, but I did find a Fulton that claims to be rust proof; so I will try that one.",2.0

I used this machine to take off  20 x 8 x 8 2 ply tires from their rims. The big issue was putting the 20 x 10 x 8  FOUR ply tires on . Taking the tires off the rims was easy. Putting the new ones on was a whole different story. . The bottom beads of the 4 ply tires was easy.  The problem was getting the top bead on the rim. I bent the threaded rod and several times I  bent the bead seater tool with the ball on the end of it. My first attempt to put a 4 ply on failed after about 90 minutes effort. Second attempt another hour failure. Third time was a charm using my forearm to hold the tire down and pulling like my life depended on it to get the top bead on the rim...lol...successful!  That was the first tire. The second time taking the 2 ply off and putting 4 ply on took about 20 minutes. The device is flimsy but I don't know if it was designed to mount 4 ply tires. it seem to work great at taking the 2 plys off.  I don't like the machine but I guarantee I'll use it again instead of throwing it away. I didn't injure any body parts during this fight with the tires !,2.0

This is not a dent puller by any means but I guess it would be decent at picking up glass.....,2.0
"I bought this based on reviews after someone banged into my parked car in a shopping center parking lot. The box it came in said it was a dent puller, but the instructions (for the same exact item) said it was for carrying panes of glass.  I'm sure as a glass carrying tool it would be very effective, but unless you've got 5 inch diameter of flat surface to adhere it to, it's not going to stick.  I could adhere it to my car door or my trunk lid, but could not get it to stick to any part of the dent on my bumper even after trying for over a half an hour.  I was so frustrated I almost took a rubber mallet to it to see if making the dent even bigger would help, but I had enough sense not to try it.

It wasn't a hard hit.  I ended up paying a guy $20 to pull it out using a similar (but much smaller) dent puller, which worked just fine.  The problem with this dent puller is that it is too large to stick to most dents.  So for me, it was totally useless and money down the drain. If someone ever sits on the hood of my car, or if I ever have a large pane of glass to carry, I'm sure it will come in handy.  For what I bought it for it was worthless.",2.0

"This product is well made, comes in a handy case and seemed like a good idea. So far it had been totally ineffective. My backhoe/loader has five grease joints that won't take grease.

After hours of tapping that thing, removing the Zerks and soaking the joints, it hasn't cleared one joint! I was able to remove the pin in the loader bucket joint and clear it by drilling out the hardened grease. To disassemble the remaining four joints is not practical since it would require removal and dis-assembly of the backhoe. I had high hopes for the Rejuvenator, but unfortunately it didn't do the job for me. In fairness, I bought the backhoe used and it probably has years worth of deferred maintenance. Too tough for the Rejuvenator.",2.0

The jury is still out on this unloader.  The first load was a pretty lackluster performance.  I put a good size load of chips in the truck but when I began to unload the chips only a small portion came out leaving the majority in the truck.  I guess the key is for a load like this you will have to be up in the truck and make sure the load doesn't cake up or anchor itself behind the wheel wells.  In any case it didn't work very well for what I needed.  It still left us scooping the majority of chips out by hand.  Given what I know now I probably wouldn't buy it.

"I'm relatively new to polishing so it may just be user error, but I'll tell you my story and let you decide. I started polishing the hood of my car using Meguiar's Ultimate compound to remove some oxidation on speed setting 6. It worked great so I moved to the roof. As I was polishing the roof, I started noticing little specks of white foam on the areas I had just finished polishing. When I checked the pad, I noticed the black plastic backing was cutting into the top of the pad causing the lower part of the pad to bow. I may have been pushing too hard; but when you look at other polishing pads and backing plates, you'll notice the pad only sticks over the edge of the plate by at most 1/4 of an inch. To me, the inch or so extra on the porter cable pad seems like a design flaw. It's still usable but there is no way to put pressure on any part of the pad not directly below the backing plate. This is probably meant to be a waxing pad, so only use light pressure. I wouldn't recommend it as a polishing pad though.",3.0

I feel that the design positives and weight holding capability make this the best creeper for big guys.",3.0
Well made. The larger wheels make it difficult to maneuver. Yes it will roll over the expansion joints on a concrete floor and uneven floors altogether but you sacrifice the maneuverability of smaller wheels.,3.0
Good for rough terrain but a little tall for shorter vehicles(ie; non4wd),3.0
"It copes well with rougher surfaces - I use it to get around my crawlspace. So far it seems well built, but the design could be a lot better. For example:

- No side trays for tools (which I knew before buying). I suspect that trays were not added to preserve the ""bone"" shape;
- Logo in the head cushion compromises its comfort;
- A little short for me (6'), but that's not too much of an issue.

Overall, I'm glad that I bought it, as moving around under the house was a real pain without it, but it could be a lot better with some small changes.",3.0
"It is a great creeper...BUT

I ordered it from Amazon on 12/7/11 and received it as they said on 12/12/11. No complaints there. I paid $134.99 for a creeper that showed up at my door incomplete. That's not Amazon's fault, that ball Dale Adams Enterprises dropped.
When you buy one (I purchased the rough rider) you will notice when you open box it is quite simple. Basically 6 parts. The ""back bone"", and wrapped in separate cardboard 4 completely assembled casters, and one package of 16 each bolts and nuts. When I started to assemble creeper I got to the last caster, and noticed that they put metal sleeves in the wheel opening where the bolt goes through to bolt wheel to caster assembly. An option that clearly strengthens the whole unit which is good...EXCEPT I received one caster assembly that was missing this metal sleeve rendering my creeper useless. I called Dale Adams Enterprises and explained, in which they profusely apologized and told me they were sending a new caster assembly out immediately today. That is great, except I just spent $134 on a creeper that I cannot use. What bothers me is that there are so few moving parts, and how can something like this be simply overlooked? I bought this because it is very high quality as far as construction of unit, and also because of the fact it is proudly made in the U.S.A. When you get it, you get a little pamphlet that shows all the sub-contractors that are involved with the construction of the creeper along with a little brag about made in U.S.A.... which is also fine with me. But when they show the multi-million dollar facility and Dale Adams showing off his car restoration facilities, I hope they realize that they need to sell a good, complete product or they won't have jobs, or a multi-million dollar facility to brag about Made in U.S.A. for very long. Just frustrated I guess. Dale Adams might think $134.00 is fun money for an hour, but I can't afford to think that.
**UPDATE**
I received a new complete wheel/caster assembly from Dale Adams on Thursday 12/15/11 as promised, along with their apologies. Now that I got to take a spin on it...it is the BEST wheeling creeper I have ever owned. I fit good on it (6'5"") and it is made of the best quality. Again, the only bummer was the caster assembly getting shipped incomplete. If it I were shorted nuts or bolts I would have muttered under my breath but then ran to hardware store and that would have fixed that. But to miss such an important piece of creeper in a box with literally 6 pcs. is kinda hard to understand.",3.0
We have two Bone creepers in our shop and they are great.  I bought this one to use in our gravel lot. It doesn't really go any better than the others in gravel which was a disappointment. It's the wheels.  I am going to get a set of wider air tires and I think that will help.  Overall the greatest creepers just not in gravel.,3.0
I use this tool mainly for making brick moulding profiles. As recieved I found the screw that holds the dies in place keep falling out or would screw itself so tight it would jam the dies. I had to install a flat washer to act as a thrust bearing and apply Loc-Tite blue to the screw. The way the case is moulded requires you to have to spend time screwing the dies in or out to get it into position to use it each time. And time is money.,3.0
I bought Park Zone two years ago and the batteries have failed since and I lost the directions to re-calibrate Park Zone.  Can someone tell me how to set it up again?,3.0
"This product was a huge help in getting the car in the garage for my wife.  It registered how close she was to the wall and lights lit accordingly.  Then one day (about a month after purchase) as I was pulling her car in the light flipped to yellow and never went off.  I knew I was close so I stopped and told myself I would look at it this weekend.  Before the weekend came, my wife pulled in and while it never left yellow, she smashed into the sensor which is down toward where the bumper of her car is located and broke it to pieces.  I was surprised how easily it cracked and fell apart on the floor as she was only creeping in.

I would recommend this to someone but to be wary.  It worked for the most part.",3.0

PRODUCT HAD TO BE SENT BACK....BOTTOM GREEN LIGHT IS NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH FOR DAY USE.........IT IS NICE LOOKING AND PREVIOUS UNITS PURCHASED ARE BRIGHTER LIGHTS.  WATING FOR NEW UNIT REPLACEMENT,3.0
I have only installed the device for a few weeks but am well satisfied. Our Lincoln Town Car is only about 2 feet shorter than the garage is deep and we have a garage door closer so precise parking is vital. With this device we have been able to park exactly as needed every time. No more getting out of the car to make sure the door will close or being afraid of hitting the garage wall.,3.0
"There is one major caveat to the use of this product that all potential buyers should be aware of. You MUST have at least 1.3 ft or so between the front of your vehicle and where the unit is mounted. It will not be able to register closer than this distance. If you're purchasing this b/c of a ""tight"" garage, this could be an issue, as it is for me.

This seems a little silly, but I thought the point of this unit was to help you park close to the front wall in a tight garage but not bump the wall. However, the instructions clearly state that the range is 1.3 to 16 feet. ""We recommend that you never leave less than 1.3 feet between your bumper and the wall."" This, of course, is kind of ridiculous since if I had 1.3 ft between the front of my car and the front wall, I wouldn't need a parking assist device. When properly parked, my garage allows approximately 4"" of clearance front and rear in total (e.g., 2"" up front, 2"" in rear if centered). Thus, I have .25 ft. The unit simply flashes red about 1.5ft before I get pulled into the proper position and then goes off.

This may be fine if you have lots of room in your garage and need to park in a very particular position among the piles of stuff, but if you have a particularly tight garage, it may not serve your needs.",3.0
"I had one for years and it broke due to probably an abrupt shutoff of the power followed by a pick when the power came back. I have bought one replacement unit and it did not work...it was like sometimes it lit the yellow and sometimes the green or the red but not in connection with the distance from the vehicle as it was supposed to do, I have returned it and bought another one (thank God for the Amazon return policies). This one works. Otherwise it does the job very well, and with the back up batteries one doesn't have to worry about blackouts.",3.0
"When you are depending on a product for safety, it must be dependable.  I installed the Park-Zone according to the directions.  I hooked it up to AC current, because I had read the reviews that battery life was a problem.  It works great 99% of the time, but ever so often, the yellow light does not come on when it should.  OOPS! Is not a good thing when you have the possibility of running into the garage wall.",3.0
I have an older model of this unit. I bought the new one because the older one was starting to act up. The new model requires three (3) feet of vacant space on each side for it to operate properly. Find me a garage with that kind of extra room. I'm nursing the old model as long as possible then I'll just hang a tennis ball from the ceiling.,3.0
This product works well if the car pull with in 2-3 feet of the wall and if the sensor is place 2 feet off the ground. We have about 5 feet space between wall and car and we store some stuff there. So I tried using this at around 4 feet but it did not work at all.,3.0
"This was my second park zone....The first one works great, sadly this one didn't work. Paid 9.41 to return to mfg. (no reimbursement) ???

"The PZ-1500 Precision Parking Device can be sensitive to mounting location.  I purchased 2 units for my Toyota Camry and VW Passat.  First of all, you need a mounting location in front of the vehicle at about the same level as the license plate.  The device would not reliably detect the car at other elevations.  When mounted at the level of license plate for the Toyota, at first it would not work.  Then I discovered that the license plate was slightly bent.  I straightened the license plate so it was directly facing the device and it would then work.  Also, you cannot locate anything such as shoe racks or cabinets near the device since they seem to disturb the sound pulses from the device.  I think the device would work better on a SUV or van with a large front grill.  Also the green light is very dim compared to the red and amber light.  The green light also sometimes does not turn on when the vehicle is approaching the device.  In my opinion, it works adaquately but is not the precision device as advertized.  The technology needs further developement.",3.0
"This seemed like the perfect thing for my garage. I didn't want something that just popped on all of a suden like most parking aids, I wanted a gradual alert - and in fact I wanted a street light. Then I found this, and thought it must be too good to be true. Sadly, it is.

While it technically works as advertised, it doesn't always work at all. And, I almost never get a Green light - usually just Yellow, then Red. And no, I don't speed into my garage. ;)

Sometimes however, I don't get anything at all. Or, nothing will happen, and when I've decided I've parked myself, and get of my vehicle, it turns Red all of a sudden.

So, in theory this is a great product, but in actual use it seems to have a lot of bugs that still need to worked out. I've had this up in my garage for about 6 months now, so this isn't just a few rare occurrences.",3.0
"The device works well and does what it is built to do.  My only complaint is that the chunky plastic shell and coiled cord make it look like it is technology visiting from the 80's.  All in all a good bargin in terms of performance, but lacking a sexy design.",3.0
"This is a nifty little product...for some people. It does what it is supposed to do, but buyers need to be very aware of it's limitations or they will be returning it like I did. First of all, Amazon lists the working range of this unit as .5 to 16 feet. However, the instructions in the box indicate that you should have at least 18 inches in front of the device to work with, with three open feet on each side. I tried parking a car within about 9 inches of the sensor and reset the range per the instructions. When driving up to the unit it gave me a red light to stop at around 16-18 inches...with about 6 inches of car hanging out of the garage! I thought maybe the calibration was off, so I brought the car to within a few inches of the sensors, reset the range, and lo and behold the red light came on at 16-18 inches again. This device is useless in close quarters.

The second issue has to do with many cars having curved front bumpers (like our Quest mini-van). Because of this it's important that you have at least 6-10 inches of ""play"" in your garage or you might find that one day you don't line up correctly with your curved bumper and leave the rear of the car in the way of the door again. Combine those two factors and you will need to make sure you have at least a significant amount of room to work with. It will not be effective in tight quarters.",3.0
"I bought two devices to help manage my garge parking constraints.  My space is limited and the cars just fit.  I found the devices very easy to install and initialize to create the zones.  After using them for several months, I found one of them eats batteries at a rate of four AA every other month so I switched it the supplied transformer.  The manual claims the battery life should be about 12 months.  They are very sensitive to any obstruction near them so if you move garbage cans around the transducers, it may impact the unit's performance, as I had found when I moved the recycling bin.  As long as you are careful not to move things around the sensors and can use the transformers, the product works as advertized.",3.0

"I purchased this because, being digital, it should be easy to read. As far as that goes, it really is easy to read. Unfortunately, it has a few problems.

1) I find it difficult to get a good seal with the valve stem.

2) It seems to read on the 1/2lb. That's just annoying.

3) The top is plastic with a rubber covering. The rubber covering is not securely attached to the underlying plastic. If it is used (as is natural) to press the head against the valve stem, it tends to slide up. This interferes with getting a firm connection with the valve stem (it also tends to fray the rubber around the head).

4) The battery gives out without warning. I took a reading from two different tires then it failed to read on the third. No warning, just stopped.

I'm going back to an analog gauge.",3.0
"Gauge is easy to read under most lighting conditions.  When I compared readings with my old pencil type gauge the values are comparable.  I have no other way to determine accuracy.  Repeatability is good, although here is where I found the biggest flaw: As mentioned by several other reviewers, I too found it difficult to get a good seal between the gauge and the valve stem of the tire.  Despite my best efforts to position the gauge properly, very often I would be greeted by the sound of air escaping from the valve/gauge junction.  My $1.98 pencil gauge is easier to use and has a better actuator for bleeding excess air out of the tire.",3.0

The few times I used this gauge it worked great. The backlight feature makes the display easy to read.

Update:  I was just looking back at reviews I have written and realized I should have updated this one. The factory did not replace the lithium battery in my tire gauge. Instead, they sent me a new tire gauge in it's sealed retail package. It was a newer, fancier model and included a carrying case. I was impressed. There was no charge to me.",3.0

I received one of these as a gift and the first thing I did was test it against my competition gauge. It was very close - nearly dead on - and easier to read. As noted by another reviewer, getting a good seal between stem and gauge is critical to dependable readings.  Mine seems to do a good job making and keeping a tight connection. The case is cool - does a good job of protecting the gauge.

This item is definitely easier to use than a stick type gauges and about as good as a decent dial gauge. I probably would not have bought this on my own, but it is a decent product.",3.0
"I recently got tired of messing around with my old mechanical analog tire gauge and decided to go digital.  After searching on Amazon, I found two digital gauges that looked good:  the Accutire MS-4000B and the Campbell-Hauschild AU1102.  They both sounded good, although I was a little troubled by some of the reviews of the Accutire.  I decided, since we have two cars, to get one of each, so I could keep one in each car.  I have now experienced a couple of weeks of use, during which I have had the opportunity to employ a tire gauge more than usual due to ""operator learning curve"" problems associated with setting up the on-board tire pressure sensor in a new Toyota.  (How do those things work, anyway?)  The bottom line is:  get the Campbell-Hauschild.

The Accutire looks cool and comes in a nice case.  It has a convenient pocket clip.  But doesn't work all that great measuring the air pressure in your tires.  I experienced the sealing problem reported by others.  It's not that big a thing, but you do loose a little air every time you take a reading.  I will try the rubber tape suggestion made by another reviewer, but the C-H seals perfectly right out of the box.  The Accutire reads a pound lower than the C-H and my old analog gauge.  Maybe the other two are the ones that are ""off,"" but . . .  On several occasions, the Accutire did not give a reading - just displayed ""0.0""  The C-H always sealed completely and gave a believable reading.  The Accutire is easy to use, all you have to do is push it against the valve stem and it turns on and gives a reading.  The C-H has to be turned on with a button before pressing against the valve stem.  The C-H has a tread gauge that also serves to depress the valve; the Accutire doesn't have any kind of nipple or anything to let air out of the tire if it is over-inflated.  With the experience gained using these, at this point I would buy the C-H rather than the Accutire.",3.0

"This is good if you have a car that the battery is not easily accessible.  If the battery is accessible, you would do better using regular jumper cables.  The reason for this is that the cigarette lighter does not allow much current, so it takes a very long time to charge a battery to the point where it has enough power to start the car.  In every circumstance whether your battery is marginally low (just low enough not to crank the starter) or completely dead, the time this device takes to charge the battery compared to jumper cables is exponentially longer.  Additionally because it takes so long to charge a battery, expect the device to get hot the longer you use it.  I would imagine this is why several people have complained that the device stopped working.  The longer the charge cycle the hotter it gets and can cause the circuitry to burnout.  The developer should have put a cutoff circuit to prevent this, but it appears this is not the case.",3.0

Bought this for a reason not to get my hands dirty doing the old style technique. But it takes a long time to charge the other car you want to restart. So if you really don't know the person whos asking for a jumpstart your gonna think twice. Specially the gas is not cheap right now. It'll takes about 20 to 30 minutes to run your car connected to the other before it start. It is actually more than a charger than a jumpstarter cable.,3.0
"Having taken an age to be delivered, it finally arrived. Plan ahead - this isn't going to arrive in a hurry, and in my experience, not on the 2nd or 3rd scheduled delivery date. Oh, the 4th time it did arrive. On the back of an 18 wheeler. With no lift gate.

Putting the unit together (fixing the handles and wheels in place) was a little interesting - as a couple of other reviewers have mentioned, you have to pull out a stabilizer bolt to get the wheel brackets in place. That alone means you need two people to, safely, get the job done.

That said, when I oiled & gassed it up, flicked the switch, it fired up first time.

I have been starting it up every month or so, as recommended in the user manual, running it for 10 or 15 minutes at a time. It's been about a year now and I have not had to pull the starter cord more than once each time to get it started.

We did end up using it last winter: saved us a whole mess of problems. I was running a couple of sump pumps, a 240V well pump, first floor lighting circuit (4 rooms) and two family refrigerators.

"I purchased this as an emergency backup to a sump pump in my basement.  I liked the concept of it always being available, even when I was away from home.  After ~ 5 years, however, I discovered that my unit was completely dead during a power outage.  I'm guessing it was age or perhaps the lighter plug used to charge the unit had wiggled loose.  In any event, the battery was dead and will no longer take a charge.  I am sure my expectations were too optimistic, but I am disappointed that I was unaware of the dead unit and in my false sense of security for who knows how long.  If you purchase, know that you will need to replace batteries at least every few years and check the unit regularly to make sure it is still functioning.  Replacement looks like ~ $40 x 3 batteries.

"This order arrived as stated, I got what I ordered. I have no complaint agaist the seller. But the  Xantrex ac charger supplied to charge/recharge the unit failed on the 2nd recharge. I plug it in and it's dead. I went out and bought another AGM batter charger. I think this product should have atleast an 85ah battery fitting in the same inside space within the unit. I have a 2nd 60ah deep cycle AGM battery hooked in paralell which double the output draingage. The reason I chose this unit instead of others or building my own of larger capacity is because it fits into a 42 gal galvanized trashcan/faraday cage when properly sealed with metal tape. I can run my 2.9 cu ft compact  frig/freezer 1.3 amps and 4.2 cu ft chest freezer 1.5 amps (2.8 ah total) for 24 hrs before recharging. I also have 2 100 watt monocrystalin solar panels (12 ah max sunlight) and/or a small 2200 watt Ryobi gas inverter generator to recharge/sustain this portable power unit as well if enough sunlight isn't available. Just my experience and thoughts, goodluck.",3.0
The unit will burn up the battery pack if it is plugged in to long. If you buy this make sure you have a meter that will shut off the power supply once the battery is charged.,3.0
I thought this would have more capacity. To test it I hooked up a 40 watt light and ran it until light went out. Did it twice and averaged 12 hours. Thought I'd get much more out of unit. I have a cheap B&D 400 watt unit that lasted 10 hours under similar conditions. I called tech support and they told me that what happened was about right. ???,3.0
"We got a Powerpack 1500 in 2006 as a backup power source.  It had six advantages and three disadvantages.  Unfortunately, when I recently tested it, sparks flew out of the AC outlets and it looks like the inverter is fried.  Customer service was pretty easy to get to and knowledgeable, although their diagnosis was that it was plugged into something that was miswired (not sure I agree) and it was not repairable (or not worth repairing).

The advantages:

1.  Fairly portable, so it can be wheeled around from room to room.
2.  Fairly powerful, although not quite as much as advertised.  I couldn't get it to run a well pump with a starting load of around 1800 watts for a fraction of a second, and 1100 watts continuous.  That's what I got it for originally, since running the well pump for 3 minutes is enough for several more flushes.  But it ran the refrigerator for four hours before running down.
3.  DC output, so you can use a 12v bilge pump to pump water out of the swimming pool, or a bathtub, for a toilet.
4.  DC charge, so in a pinch you can charge it off the car at a 10 amp rate.
5.  The capability of connecting a second external battery for increased run time.
6.  It is pretty simple to press into service, so setting up the generator can be put off for a time.

The disadvantages:

1.  The charger is a 12v, 5 amp charger so it takes a day to recharge the unit.
2.  It doesn't function as a UPS, because it doesn't have a transfer switch like a battery backup UPS.  I have an APC transfer panel that can manage a UPS source, but it assumes that when the panel is driven by a generator, the UPS will pass through the AC source it is plugged into while recharging the battery.  This won't do that.
3.  You can't charge a second external battery at the same time; it needs to be disconnected and charged separately.

I have two Honda generators and a transfer panel now, after more than three weeks of outages.  If it still worked it would be useful, but I don't think I'll replace it.",3.0
"First, my perspective: I'm a full-time RV traveler, and purchased this item for basic electrical power while dry camping with no electrical connections.  Based on the price, as well as reviews from this site, I expected to be able to operate my small 19"" LCD tv & DVD player, as well as charge my small items such as computer, camera batteries, and handheld vacuum.  When I recieved the item, I attempted to charge it for the suggested 15 hours.  After 2 hours however, the charger turned off, with a green light indicating the battery was full.  When I went to use it a few days later, it was dead. (AGM batteries should not lose charge that quickly, with only a 2% rate of discharge.)  The next time we stopped, we plugged the charger into an outlet, and left the unit charging for 24 hours, and it again read fully charged.  We watched a two hour movie using only a dvd player, 19"" LCD tv, and a set of computer speakers... (I made sure to turn everything else off, and switch the fridge and water heater to propane.) and by the end of the movie the battery was fully discharged.  Based on my experience, I would only purchase this item for emergency lighting, or other low-powered uses.  I can't imagine a powertool, or other high-powered device lasting long enough to justify the high cost of this item.  I'll keep it for recharging batteries, and powering my phone while off-grid.",3.0
"Purchased this item last week, for my Hurricane kit. The last hurricane we had knocked out power for eight days. And our supply of batteries was depleted after a few days. Using a gas powered generator in an apartment community is risky at best due to the chance of theft, so this is a viable alternative for short term use. Shipping and packaging was excellent.

Manufactured Date of my unit is 31 August 2010. You can find the date by opening up the storage compartment lid, and looking to the raised platform on the right side.  After charging for the recommended 15 hours, I plugged in one 20 inch box fan 120V 60Hz, .075Am. The unit ran for 8 hours of continuous use until the low  battery alarm sounded. Word to the wise, the alarm is quite loud, as it ticked off my GSD enough for him to howl.

 Don't know if this is good or bad for this particular unit, but eight hours seems to be a fairly good amount of usage for a normal outage. Will test it using a lamp with a 23w CFC and the fan and report back later. If anyone has experience with this unit and would like to share expected usage times, please comment. Thanks

Additional testing:

Box fan as mentioned above with lamp using 7W A19 LED Bulb, High Performance Samsung LED, Daylight White, 60W Incandescent Bulb Replacement - Total run time before low charge alarm went off: 7.75 hours.

"Purchased this at a Super Reduced Price for what they were selling for everywhere else.  It charged well.....in a couple of hours shorter than the Max time to fully charge.  Used it with a Fan and Lamp so far.  Worked fine.  However, when I received it, the Date of Manufacture was sometime in 2005.  I purchased this in Apr 2011.  The paperwork inside stated to charge immediately and that if not kept charged, it could permanently damage the battery.  The Charge on it was almost completely dead.  Again though, it charged up well.  I just don't know if the battery will hold up well when I really begin to use it.  I don't know if others come like this as well.",3.0
"It's a decent and basic product, for what it is.

You absolutely must keep the batteries charged, or they will die, never to return.

If you buy one of these that's been sitting on a shelf too long, you are buying a gigantic paperweight. Not the fault of the product. Blame the retailer.

The batteries are the business end of the deal here. Replacement batteries are available for $40/pop. If you find one of these dead at a garage sale for $20, you can restore it to new again for $120.

As many reviewers have stated, if you add more batteries, you get exactly that much more back-up capacity. It's a lot cheaper to add batteries than to buy multiple units.

As is, it's capacity is indeed pretty limited. But then, electricity is VERY useful, even in limited capacities.",3.0

When you put a low charge to this it doesn't send the 110 V. It sends about 90V and you have a risk to damage the device plugged. when it sends the 110V works great and it's really quiet. it saves the battery very well. In general terms it's a very good product,3.0
"It works and does what it says.  Seems to work quite well, even though my sump pump tends to be a slight overload for it.  There was an unexpected surprise after I set this up with my sump pump and tested it.  On utility power, my sump pump draws 9.1 amps (right about 1100 watts) but when running off only the inverter, the amp draw went to 11.3amps (right about 1350 watts).  The draw went up by 2.2 amps because the sump pump becomes less efficient when running off of a modified sine wave (inverter), vs a true sine wave (power company) power source.  This increase in power consumption was a surprise, but thankfully the inverter seems to handle it without an issue.",3.0
stopped working after 2 and a half years. worked fine until then. i will probably get another brand.,3.0
"So far so good. Only had it in my over the road truck for about 1 month. No problems yet. A higher rating after a year or more. I have had 2 different brands in the past.

Works perfectly. Bought it for sw aquarium as back up for power failures. Inverter is not a pure sine wave and so it is not suitable for my API Rena Canister Filter pump which does brake down because of it. This is the only reason I give 3 stars because on the research for pure sine inverters the Tripp Lite ASP 750 was mentioned. It is not true.,3.0

"Good product, handles surges better then most in its watts class.  Works best with the engine running.  Load LED's is exactly what it says, just lights.  Unit does not shut down when battery level reaches 10.5 like most.  It will work till your battery is dead.",3.0
"I brought this because it was a good value for the watts it provides.  I thought a generator would be too noisy and I'd have to store too many gas cans. I brought this for a couple day power outage at home, to run my sump, refrigerator, and hopefully furnace/blower. But, Modified sine wave is more like a modified square wave. I tested it with a fan, and as some warned the fan ran ""noisy"".  I am afraid to use it with my new furnace, as I don't want to damage the control boards with the screwy AC waveform.  So I'm considering getting a small pure sine wave unit to drive my furnace controls, separately power the blower with this MSW unit.  I think the sump will be fine, the refrig I haven't tried yet.  I also had to buy an expensive Deep Cycle battery.

Update Nov 2013:  Here is a description of the 'modified sine wave' I observed with my oscilloscope. It is NOTHING AT ALL like a sine wave. It is a rectangular waveform, with one pulse per half-period. There is no approximation of a sinewave's shape with graduated 'steps'.. The voltage and width of the output pulse varies with the load. The peak-peak voltage of normal 120 Vac is about 344. When running a lightbulb the MSW pulse was 320 Vp-p, the pulse-width was about 4 millisec. Adding a small fan to the load lowered Vp-p to 310 and PW widened to ~5.8 ms. I imagine as the load goes up, peak voltage drops and pw widens to deliver 'same' power.",3.0

The connections leave something to be desired.  Accepts only #2 wire for DC input (Ok if close to battery(s); #10 for AC; really too small for long runs.
And. the available adjustments for system control are limited.

"this is a great all-in-one solution for battery-based off-the-grid power. I spent a lot of time researching chargers and inverters and which ones I should combine before I found this, which does both easier and much cheaper for comparable performance.

my only suggestion would be for them to add a couple of fused terminals for direct DC power that could be shut off when the voltage is too low, but we can't have everything I guess.

"Pros:
- Fit well
- Pocket is useful for an extra place to put things.

Cons:
- Instructions were awful. It would constantly reference the wrong pages, and was very unclear on mostly everything. After 20 minutes of confusion I just threw the book away and did it how I thought it should be.
- The bezel where the actual receiver goes is extremely flimsy which makes it hard to cut the tabs off. It was even more difficult for me consider mine came broken off at the bottom left corner.
- The main mount came broken at the indentation on the left for the R variant pieces. Imagine trying to put it together with this issue when it's already difficult normally with the kit's flimsy design.
- The top of the bezel sinks when you put the panel back on in a Honda CRV 2006. Probably happens with other cars as well.",3.0

"Have used this twice now and have some feedback. During the first use of this, the suction mechanism failed to work. It sucked in a little soap but not a lot of water. In addition, toward the end of the first wash, as I pulled the portion of the handle back to suck the soapy water in, the entire portion came off. You can reattach it with a little effort and re-screwing in the yellow end piece. All in all, for 25 dollars or more, I would have expected more stability and solid worksmanship. It feels a little chinsy to me.

The second wash, all the same problems existed. By nature, a long handle and a soft washcloth like this are ideal for washing cars. I like how I don't have to connect a water source to the end of this device which is why I got it. In addition, the ability to save a step and get soap AND water simulatenously is a real time saver. The rounded wash foam cloth head is properly designed and gets the job done. It is because of this utility I increased the review from a 2 to a 3 star.

Just wish this product was a little more solidly built.",3.0
"This is the first wash stick Ive purchased; based my decision purely on description.  My only need was to reach across the roof and hood of my pickup; all other areas I wash with a lambs wool mitt.  Fortunately, the 33 length of the wash stick body is adequate for my needs.  The Extends to more than 4 feet long in the description apparently includes the pump being extended which I have found no way to lock in place so it just slides out and in when pulling and pushing; the wash mitt just stands still on the surface being washed.  The lambs wool cover is nice but the advertised flexible head requires a little more pressure to flatten out on flat surfaces than I can apply when gripping with one hand at the end of the 33 handle.  Consequently, the washing motion must be side to side so the area in the raised center gets cleaned.  Paying attention to the pictures in the description, they all show the stick being operated with two hands.  It would have been informative to mention in the text that this is typical to get enough leverage to flatten the head for cleaning flat surfaces.",3.0
"Got this brush to replace my old one.  Actually having the soapy water in the handle allows me to make fewer trips to the bucket. The brush material is soft and cleans well.  That's the good news.  Bad news is the head does not swivel like my old one, so you have to be careful to hold it at the right angle to line up the pad with the car.

I have a Sorento with a lot of fairly flat sheet metal.  The brush is curved inwards and while it works fine on the corners, it does not do a good job on flat surfaces.  The brush only hits on the 2 sides of the brush.  The middle section is floating in the air.  That means I need to go over the same spot several times to be sure all the area is clean.  This is mostly a problem with the doors, roof and hood.  Wait, that's most of the car.

The last complaint is it does not have a hook or hole in the handle to hang it up to dry.  I will need to figure out something since I don't want to just lay the wet brush down on something else.

I have used it 3 times so far and am disappointed, but will probably just keep it to avoid the hassle of returning it and looking for something better.  My old one was a CarRand and they don't make that model anymore.",3.0

"I bought this to use for my car, however the 2 prongs the Master Lock has makes it difficult to lock the wheel. (Not impossible). I bought it for a small car BMW Z3 so maybe it might be good for a bigger car.

"I have owned the master lock quad hook club since 2004. The club has the old lock just like the one shown in the picture here at amazon. It has worked very well. I have had no problems with it.

Just for the heck of it i tried it on my 2004 ford truck first, and saw that the new redesigned club that uses a regular key did not fit securely on the steering wheel. its not long enough and I could squeeze out one of the hooks of the steering wheel. It however fits well on my mothers escape which has a smaller steering wheel. I put both the old and new club next to each other to compare and the new one is clearly shorter.  So buyers beware if your buying the newer redesigned lock for a large vehicle such as trucks or SUVs chances are it will not fit well, but its fits OK on smaller vehicles.",3.0
"If you plan to buy this thing, be realistic.  It's $17 from Amazon and $20 from Walmart.  It's solid steel, yes...but the lock is a joke.  You can see that just by looking at it and by putting the key in.  Even without a pick of any kind, thieves can still just cut the steering wheel in additional places until they get it out.  Pull one side out and the other goes, so you really only have to mutilate half of the wheel.  It may require more cuts than the standard Club design though.

Knowing all of this, I still purchased this and use it sometimes.  Just as with locking the doors and engaging the steering wheel lock, it's part of a series of easily erected barriers that are designed to deter casual idiots and delay the serious professionals.

I will keep it as it is marginally better than nothing.

Update: I have used the California Duster three times and it only pushes the dust around rather than picking it up. Still no response from California Duster. I have chosen to have Amazon replace my duster hoping that I just happened to receive a defective product. I will provide another update after I receive the replacement.

Update:
The replacement that Amazon sent is much, much better than the one that I sent back. Still not as good as the others that I have had in the past and I am still not pleased that California Duster totally ignored my email to them regarding the issues with the product. I will revise my review from one star to three.",3.0
Nice product and works well....just a little too heavy with the wood handle.,3.0
I'm not sure it kept my car any cleaner and deposited lots of red threads. Fortunately they came off in a car wash.,3.0
Always leaves yellow dust after using it. I suppose it's the wax material. I also get tiny red fibers on occasion,3.0
"I have used California dusters for years and loved them.  This super duster is too heavy for me to use with ease.  For a large man, this would be the ideal duster.",3.0
"Handle too hort for the job, sent it back",3.0
"It's ok to use, but looks too small.",3.0
"I was skeptical of some of the comments, but after 4 days sitting on various newspapers, this still leaves the streaks people talk about.  I had one many years ago and it was awesome, I'm not sure what changed in their manufacturing process, but I have yet to have these streaks eliminated after a few weeks of use.",3.0
"The only complaint I would have about this is that once you untie the duster from the handle (for example to wash it), it becomes near impossible to re-fit it to the handle and tie it.",3.0
It's ok but not nearly as good as the old version,3.0
"The wooden handle model is superior to the cheaper plastic model. However, it's a fraction of the size that they used to be and cheaper on the paraffin.",3.0
"Would like to get a larger one, like they used to sell.",3.0
"I have not owned this long enough to rate it effectively - I just got it. I like the long handle on it so I can reach the center of the roof on my truck.

I believe this thing would work good on a motorhome or big rig.",3.0
It is very small.,3.0

"Needing to replace a five year old original California Car Duster, the order was placed for the 62442 model.  Arrived complete with strange bag, however, unlike the earlier version, this one left tiny red fibers all over my X3.  Good thing I didn't toss the old one.  Disappointed to say th e least.",3.0
"I was so anxious to get this because I bought a black SUV and I heard so many good things about this but I am disappointed.  The first time I used it, it was great.  The second time, even though I shook it out, it kind of smeared the dirt around with little waxy marks on the finish.  If you accidentally hit the windows, you have to wash them.  I didn't think I would have to wash this every time but maybe.......",3.0
handle broke after a few uses.. otherwise it was good while it lasted.,3.0
"Even after leaving the duster out to 'dry' for several days, it still leaves paraffin film on the car. These end up streaking on the car and are noticeable.",3.0
"Item arrived looking mangled and used. Not sure if that is ""normal"". It does do its job. We'll see if it holds up over time.",3.0
Leaves red fuzzies behind. A fleck of dirt or something got caught in it and left a scratch.,3.0
all Satisfactory,3.0
"Just to much oil, or whatever it is, in this product. I layed it on newspaper for a week but still seems to have to much oil in it, reluctant to use it on my new Corvette. Will use it on my older truck for now.",3.0
"Like many other posters have said, it does leave a bunch of fine red particles on your vehicle that are relatively apparent on my black truck. It is easy to use, it leaves a very light amount of waxy look to the vehicle, and helps wipe off dust. It can take off a very thin film of your average road grime. Tough for me to use it half the year though up here in Iowa. Too much crap on the cars from the salt and brine and sand that's put on the streets to help with snow and ice.

All in all it isn't a terrible product and I'm not sure if there's a way to make the fibers not come off as much without removing the little bit of wax that is in the brush, which I do like.

Maybe I'm rubbing too hard and that's why the fibers are left?",3.0
"The duster worked quite well  but after only using it for only four months, the wood inside has cracked right in half.  Sadly it's too late to return it so I will have to use it as is or see if I can glue/repair it somehow.  I am surprised that some people have had their duster for 10 to 15 years.  I certainly didn't misuse mine so I don't know why it broke in half.  I'm curious if anyone else had this problem.",3.0
"Got this to keep the dust off my car, instructions say that first 2 or 3 uses might leave some wax residue on your car and sure enough it did, not to happy about. The instructions also say that after repeated uses the wax residue won't appear anymore. People swear by these things, time will tell for me.",3.0
Better thatn the look alikes from local parts stores (that left red lint on everything).,3.0
Picks up the dust but leaves a lot of red lint behind,3.0
Meh,3.0
"For some reason, this one leaves streaks. Other ones didn't.",3.0
"I really thought I would like this brush for dusting my classic 1965 Corvette. However, although I have used the smaller versions for around the house over the years, this one with the wooden handle seems to leave a wax trail all over my cars finish and rather than take off the dust, seems to make it look dirtier with a buildup of the wax. Not sure if there is something I was supposed to do first to treat the brush but taking it out of the package and dusting my car I can tell you it doesn't work well. I know these are the kinds of mops or brushes that probably work better the dirtier they getmaybe it's just because it's brand new. But, based on my experience, I would have to say I couldn't recommend it to someone else.",3.0
"It's name does stand up to it's reputation. I like it but a the same time I feel meh about it. I mean it works don't get me wrong. But, you have to do it I'd say everyday? Because if dirt or dust gets on my car and then I leave it there for a night and in the morning it gets sort of damp because of the weather and then it gets dusty again, when I try to use it the next day, the top layer of dirt will come off but the bottom layer will just smudge. I recommend using it in the middle of the day. I still use it though.",3.0
"It's oddly full of lint and leaves it all over the car, even after several washings.  Weird.",3.0
good,3.0
"Every year these ""Original"" dusters become smaller and smaller.  There's no option for an ""original"" sized duster.  Probably after all these years and 20 plus dusters later, I'm thru...",3.0
"It's a duster, that's about all I can say.  I wouldn't pay $16 for it again though. That is simply too much for this item.",3.0
"Not enough fibers, small. Spend a little extra and get Griots maxi duster. I have both.",3.0
"I agree with the posts about red lint all over the place. And yes, I know how to use it. My previous California Duster never ever did that in the ten years I used it. I'd still recommend this but be prepared to use a soft cloth for touching up if it leaves lint on your vehicle.",3.0
It's ok but no where near as good as my old one. Doesn't appear to be any wax on it. Very dry. It does take the dust off the truck and that's what I got it for.,3.0
"I have used this product for years on light colored vehicles and just now bought a new car and decided to replace the one I tossed due to falling apart after 13 years of use. (Seriously I had it that long) The old one I had was much better quality. Seems to me it has changed over the years and is now not as fluffy. My new car is black where all my others over the years have been light colors.

Sad to say I would not recommend this to anyone who has OCD about the paint on their black car. I let it air out on news paper and left it out of the bag for about a week so the wax would dry out. The first few uses I had the little streaks of wax to wipe off but it didn't seem like a big deal. After a month of using this daily and very lightly, never pressing down on the paint, scratches started to emerge.

If you own a light colored car I would get it 100%. Like I said 13 years for me. If you own a black or dark colored car, think twice. Once I go back to a light colored car I will use this product again, but for now I will probably give it to my neighbor who has a white car.",3.0
There is WAY too much carnauba wax on this so it smears all over my BMW.,3.0
"Like the colors, haven't used it yet!",4.0
less room than I guessed but seems to be made well. time will tell.,4.0
"This is my 5th rainsuit and the best made of all. Very comfortable, fits well, many pockets, good ventilation and love the fact that I can easily put my pants with my rainboots on because the zippers are very long.",4.0
"Great value for the money. I purchased this rainsuit for the rain, as well as to use for cold-weather commuting. The suit fits true to size (I'm 5'4"" and 130lbs and the small fits great). The stirups and elastic on the ankles of the pants are perfect for keeping a tight seal to avoid water (or cold air) from entering. Additionally, the pants have zipper expandable sides to allow for putting them on over my boots. Another plus is the heat shield on the lower inside of the legs...don't even think about buying a suit that doesn't have these (I've seen other suits melt on the exhaust, and then they're worth nothing).

I'm not crazy about the jacket for cold weather riding, but it works great in the rain. The problems I have with the jacket are: I don't like the drawcord at the bottom (so I removed it, problem solved); the collar of the jacket is lined w/ corduroy or something, but it scratches my neck (this is the main reason I still wear my TNF jacket for cold weather riding).

I ride 365 days a year, as my motorcycle is the only vehicle I own. In the past I've used ski pants and a North Face Gore Text jacket, and they work, but not anywhere near as well as the Joe Rocket RS-2 rainsuit.",4.0
Just got the suit and it fit perfectly.  It matched the description on the web site.  I like the length of the zipper at the bottom of the legs.  I was able to get my boots through the leg with no problem.  The suit is lightweight when compared to some other rain suits I've had but it appears to be durable.  I also like the gathered fit of the jacket.  Very stylish!!!  I would have given the suit a 5 star rating except for the collar.  It is a bit wide and the velco doesn't reach far enough around to tighten around my neck.  Haven't used in the rain yet.  Will update after I do.,4.0
"Haven't had it in the rain yet.  I bought a large so it would fit over my jacket, which was about right.  I am 5'9"", 165 lbs.",4.0
"good fit  so far so good though haven't been in a real down pour. that will be ultimate test. have to be cautious of pipes of cost, had a lil melting when i grazed it.  didn't go thru so held it own.",4.0
I road for 3 hours in consistent light to heavy rain last weekend and was bone dry when I got to my destination.  It looks like it should hold up well but only time will tell.,4.0
"Great suit, it keeps you dry. But, I ordered one size larger, that was unnecessary.",4.0
"I have only tried it on haven't put it to the test yet under any rainy conditions. I purchased it to use at a golf Tournament. I have used FroggToggs in  the past and was very happy with them, but this time i wanted something more and this seemed to fit the bill. I did not notice it came with no hood, Might have changed my mind if i had noticed, and the fact it has elastic in the back makes for a kind of snug fit which remains to be seen when i use it for the first time which will be in a frew weeks At my next golf tournament. So i will withhold my appraisal till then",4.0
This has come in handy on several occasions. The suit works very well. It doesn't flap around in the wind. It has a vent on the back that is adequate but not great. The jacket has a liner but the pants don't. It would have been nice to have. Overall I am pleased with my purchase. This is a great rain suit for the price.,4.0
"I bought this product to go on my bathroom wall.  It was shipped and delivered to me very quickly.  There were a few design details that did not match the original picture, but did not detract from the overall design.  It was not very easy to get off the backing and place on the wall.  I really needed another person to help me and could not have done it alone.  The design kept sticking it itself and the paper backing was cumbersome and we ended up cutting it away as we went so it was not in our way.  Now that it is up on the wall I really enjoy it and it looks good in the bathroom.",4.0
I liked this wall decal but very very hard to peel and stick so u must have lots of patience and an extra hand to help~And doesn't that great to a wall. But good on a mirror or window.,4.0
"The picture is deceiving, look closely and you'll see this is actually two branches stuck together. Which is fine since you can play around with how you want it to look.

"For the price, they are way smaller than what I expected, it would have been perfect if they were bigger but they're soooooo adorable. I love the pink bows.",4.0
"First off... they are hard to get used to and they are slippery with regular riding gloves. (get gloves with awesome silicon grips ALL OVER the palm and fingers).

Installation: if you know what you are doing installation should only take about 20-30 min.

If you have larger hands these might be iffy. They are a slimmer grip. If you look closely at the picture you can see the concave toward the center of the grip.

As with all grips, I advise using some sort of adhesive spray, especially on the clutch side. The allen screws are there, but they are not nearly enough. I was riding to work one day and the grip slid off as I was bringing the front wheel back down because I did not spray enough glue. Took it home, sprayed a lot more glue and NEVER had another issue.

Like I said, they are hard to get used to because of the lack of grip. But they look great.",4.0

"I put this decal on in June 2016 and as of today (December 11, 2016) it is still on and doing fine.  No sun damage, fading or peeling.  Many reviewers felt cheated, but I don't think there is anything wrong with the product.  It went on without a problem and it has stayed on through rain and snow and sandstorms.  I live in Dayton, NV and it is high desert meaning hot days and cold nights.  It snows in the winter and often gets below freezing - way below freezing.  But the decal lives on.

The decal works well in my opinion.

"This is a reasonably priced, good quality, seven inch diameter, wool buffing and polishing pad.  It is pretty thick and deep, and has a 3/4 inch diameter hole in the middle.  The pad is designed to be secured by the hook and loop system.  `Hook and loop' is a generic term for Velcro type fastening.  One advantage of hook and loop is that you can change pads quickly.

If you have concerns about the reliability of hook and loop, the system is reasonably secure.  The `hooks' on your buffing wheel, need to be in good condition, and not damaged or bent up.  The `loops' are the fuzzy part on the back of the pad.  Push the pad and wheel together, and give them a little twist to make sure there is a good `bite'.  Test run the buffer at low speed and see how it feels.  If it seems secure, you can gradually increase the speed and pressure.",4.0
"Nice pad, not cheap but you get what you pay for, if you keep this fairly clean during use and wash it properly after use this PD should las you a while, has plenty of give and padding. Would recommend a wash before use as it does shed quite a bit. But does give a good finish and rinses well. Used mine for polishing/restoring clear coat on a boat. Would recommend If you need something with some pile to it or for uneven surfaces. May cost a little extra but get a cheap pad and compare for yourself.",4.0

"These are heavy gauge cables made with alluminum wire that has a very thin coating of copper (enough for looks); still their amperage rating is equivalent to 4 gauge copper wires. The clips are decent and will work on most if not all battery set-ups you come across; they grab tightly but are not too hard for the average person to squeeze open.

The wire is crimped to the jaws and but the instalated part of the wire is not also crimped. There is a place on the jaws to crimped the insulated portion (which would then act as a stress relief) but it is not used. You can crimp it with a pair of pliers when you get the cables -- just tight enough to grab the cable is all you need -- this will prevent the cables form breaking away where the aluminum is crimpt to the metal.

Jaw markings-- there are three types of markings boasted by the maker: First is Color -- Indeed one can easily identify one side of the paired cable form the other by the color of the jaws.
Second - Indent stamping -- the polarity is stamped into the metal jaws -- The imprint is not disticnt and not very easy to read in good light. At night, it would be useless and one couldn't read the impression by feel. So these are practically useless.
Third -- Phosphorescent labeling -- phosphorescence stores up energy for a short while after strong light exposure and slowly sheds the energy as dim light. So, if you put the cables in the sun for a while, the labels will glow for few minutes. This would help you if you need to jump your battery at night only if you have some sunlight to hold the cables under for a while. Most people will keep the cables in their trunk anyway, where it is genrally dark, so the cables won't have been recently exposed to a lot of sunlight. I suppose one could hold them in front of the car headlights for a few minutes and then moved away from the headlights and quickly read the labels, that would work. But then, why not just read the color of the clips while holding them in front of the headlights? The phosfluoresecnt labels are just a silly useless sales come-on.

They are not, but even if the labels were made with tritium capsules -tritium is a radiant ionic form of Hydrogen (used sometimes on wristwatches -- the tritium is spent after a few years. The notion of glowing labels on booster cables borders on idiotic.

If you have trouble remembering which color to use for positive or negative, just remember that it doesn't matter! What matters is that the same color going to positive on one battery goes to positive on the other. You could use black for positive if you want or red.

You always double the consistency of polarity before attaching the fourth clip. Even if they glow in the dark, have marquee lights blinking messages or they sing ""I'm positvely in love with you"".

These cables are for consumer (i.e., ocassional) use. For daily, professional use, you'll want real copper cables because copper doesn't corrode or fatigue as easily as aluminum. That's not an issue for cables receiving ocassional use. With ocassional use these will serve most motorists for a lifetime and serve well for the money even overlooking the silliness about the clip labels.",4.0
Good heavy-duty cable. Reaches from under the hood to the back of my Nissan Frontier pickup. I tested with a winch on a hitch plate and everything worked well. I'd buy again.,4.0
I tried using cheap cables to jump a V-6 (VW camper van) from a V-6 engine (98 Toyota 4 runner)  the source battery in the 4 runner was more than adequate - dry cell HD battery.  No luck.  Hooked these up and it started right up.,4.0

My brothers car had been having some battery problems so I bought this to help him out. Normally my old jumper cables could get the job done but since when his car loses power it literally can't change gear I needed something that could get to his battery even when I parked front to back. the lack of head leads is awkward but anyone with enough forearm strength can bend it to the needed angle. all in all excellent cable!,4.0

"So the wire gauge and am-page rating thing confused the hell out of me. I went to my battery manufacturer's website and coleman cable's website to look up the information. After much research, my understanding is that the higher the am-page rating, the better chance you will start your car in cold weather, usually a new car battery has 350-400A Cold Crank Ampage (CCA). Since these cables are made of Copper Clad Aluminum (also abbreviated as CCA coincidentally), their ampacity are only equivalent to 1 gauge lower diameter pure copper wire ( search 'Ampacity of Copper & Aluminum Wire, it's published in the NEC code). What's more with longer cable the resistance also goes up so you will loss some ampacity along the way. My experience with Coleman's 8 Guage 12' cable is that unless I attach to the dead battery's negative post, it won't deliver enough juice to start the car by connecting to the engine block ground point to my Honda Civic (mid size car use 400A CCA battery), so my assumption is anything has current rating less than 200A can't be used without acting against the label warning by connecting to the dead battery's negative post. So take what's available here and consider your need.

Coleman's CCA booster cable product spec.
Cable Gauge Cable length Current rating
6 Guage  12 ft  300A
6 Guage  16 ft  250A
4 Guage  12 ft  400A

"I purchased these for jump starting our Yukon XL that we infrequently drive. We've had problems in the winter keeping the battery fully charged enough to turn over the engine. These cables are great because we can easily connect to the other vehicle without moving either one to get close enough for cable connection. They are long enough for the job and I love the 4 gauge wire - easily boosts the Yukon's battery without needing to sit connected for a long time - just long enough to start the boosting car, get out, walk over to the Yukon and start it! Despite being 4 gauge, they are very pliable and wind up nicely without kinking and twisting.

Only negative is the clamps slip a little on the Yukon's battery terminal. But I think that has more to do with the location of the terminals on the side, rather than on the top.",4.0
"These are heavy-duty enough that I was able to use it to jumpstart my Jetski (Sea-Doo RXP) which could not be started with the only cable available at the local AutoZone.  The handles are not a solid conductor, and the teeth have a pretty sharp point on it, so it was a little difficult getting onto the smaller battery, but overall, it worked well.",4.0

"- Personally, I think price is a bit high.
- Cable quality is great. The ""power glow"" clamps did not impressed me though. In fact, sometimes I feel they are not that securely 'bite' on the battery.
- 20 foot and 4 gauge is a must for a safe and serious jump-start, do not save money by cutting these.",4.0

"I finally bought one after reading all the reviews, the product is good for moderate use not for professionals I believe, it claims to have a 4 gauge cable (flexible weldering style) it looks a little bit less than that to me but can't prove it with facts, clamps could be better they all have a different tension feel when you squeeze them (bit annoying) it comes inside a heavy duty carton with handles for storage and it's very compact for a 16 footer. Conclusion, a GOOD cosumer quality product if you are not looking and wiling to pay for the very best. I'm satisfied.",4.0

"I picked up the 20ft 4ga with a bag that is good enough to hold the cables for a casual user at Wallmart. If they would have had the 25ft I would have/should have got that. Streched the 20ft and it barely clears my F150 from nose to tail. The ones I got at Wally World for $25 are the same here for $35 and I did not have to pay shipping. Just found this posting on Amazon about Warranty with the Coleman Cable Inc., (I was wondering how to make a claim if I ever had too!) Of course this is on an extension cord but a company warranty is a company warranty in my opinion..

By  Ananin Ami (Fairfax, VA USA) - See all my reviews

This cord lasted only 4 uses. On the 5th use it caught on fire and burned my $90 Toro leaf blower. On the packaging there are the words ""LIFETIME WARRANTY"" but when I contacted Coleman Cable they said that their warranty is only good for items that didn't work at all, not for items that failed after use (sounds like an excuse). So I lost $40 on the cord and $90 on the leaf blower.

Stay away from this product and stay away from Coleman Cable!",4.0

"These cables will do the job.  I wish the construction was a little better near the actual clamps, however they work great and are extremly heavy duty.  I would recommend.  Always remember to read the instructions.",4.0
"The weakest link in any booster cable is the clamps.  If the connection from clamp to terminal is even slightly weak then the amperage is critically limited (even 1 ohm is too much at 12 volts).  I chose these because of their fairly heavy gauge to maintain amperage despite their length, but (and you can't tell from the listing) the clamps are not as impressive as I would like -- they are the sort where there is copper on only one side of the jaws and I would prefer both.  Most of us have had the experience of working clamps into corroded terminals to try to get just a bit more power.  I haven't used these cables yet but assume confidently they will work fine.  The cables are fairly flexible and appear sturdy and well-insulated.  Don't skimp on cables, you get what you pay for, and I think these are merely a fair deal in light of their much higher price.",4.0
"Much heavier cables than most of those you find in retail outlets.  The wire guage is what is most important, and these cables are heavy enough.  I wish they had soldered connections at the clamps, but if you keep them clean and dry these will last forever. The clamps will attach to side terminal batteries.

They also have a tag with insructions attached to the cables, but if you need to read them at all you should do so very carefully. Jumping a car battery is quite simple, but easy to screw up and I strongly suggest that if you carry cables you do so only once you are confident you know how to use them properly.",4.0

"This is a good place to start your air accessory collection, although I would modify it a little to make it more useful.  I bought it to complement my Porter Cable 3hp compressor, which is equipped with M-style quick connects.
It has two accessories that require a male M-style coupler plugs, (the blow gun and tire chuck), but only three of this style coupler plug.  If you have more than one air tool to setup, you will need additional male M-style coupler plugs (Tool Crib #727BK @$1.00).  The plastic tire pressure gauge is functional, but nothing special.
The brass hose repair barbs are nice, but there are no hose clamps provided if you have to use them.  I would be hesitant to put them under pressure without a band clamp holding them in place.  The two female couplers and female coupler plugs will complete two 3/8"" air hoses.
The blow gun is a quality, versatile unit.  It comes with a rubber tip, metal tip and pin inflator for balls.  The valve is easily operated and it does not leak.
With the exception of the plastic tire gauge, all the parts are high quality and useful.  I could have done without the tire gauge in exchange for a few more quality parts (male coupler plugs and screw type band hose clamps).  If the assortment had been a little more complete, this would rate five stars.  You will also need a roll of teflon plumbers tape to seal all the threads.  Now you know what else you need to finish outfitting your compressor.",4.0
