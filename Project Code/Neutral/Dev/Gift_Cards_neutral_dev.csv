Review,Rating
Bought as birthday gift.  Recipient didn't try to use it for about 6 months and then got a message indicating it was no longer valid!!  That was really embarrassing.  I went into my account and found an option to resend the digital card which I did.  I have not heard back whether the recipient has tried to use it.  I'd like to know why this problem occurred.  As I said - embarrassing.,2.0
"The card was programmed to get sent on my friends birthday, but then did not send at all. I had to go in and have it re-sent since she never received it and was then two days after her birthday and a lot less exciting. I was supposed to receive an email when it was sent and only did after it was re-sent, so I believe it was not an error on the receivers part.",2.0
I purchased 200 gift cards for a work project.  I was able to upload the recipient email addresses and send the gift cards to each individual's email address.  It was an easy process and it save me a lot of time! I would definitely buy this product again.,2.0
"Had to request redelivery three times.
Supposed to arrive via email as a surprise and never arrived not even in spam folder.
Got online and requested a redelivery, got the confirmation and still never arrived.
Requested a third time a day later and it finally arrived.
Not satisfied in using this as a surprise.",2.0
It failed to arrive and I had to send it again I am still unsure as to whether the card was included second time around. My Granddaughter was understandibly dissapointed,2.0
"When I went to share this on Facebook, the photo I uploaded for the gift card didn't appear.  Only the photo on your ad which shows up on the left.
If we upload a photo for the gift card, that photo should be shown.  It can add to our marketing ability.  Your photo does nothing....",2.0
this was the first time the system uploaded my chosen photo,2.0
Gift card cut off picture that i uploaded for it to use. It looked fine when i sent the card via email but when opened the image was not exactly as it appeared when i sent it.,2.0
It was not good since  I downloaded a picture to be included in the gift card but the recipient didn't get it,2.0
The time I spent selecting and posting a picture was completely wasted.  The recipient of the gift card received an email without the picture.,2.0
IT TOOK HOURS TO COME TO ME.  If I knew the personalised piccie would take so long I would have gotten a plain Jane version.,2.0
"I uplifted a suitable design four or five days before the date I wanted, added money and stupidly thought that was a done deal. The ecard eventually arrived on the recipients computer FIVE DAYs after the birthday date. So much for electronics.",2.0
Be aware of e-mail delivery issues - the e-mail containing the gift cards went to some of the recipients' spam folders. Very disappointing.,2.0
"Eventually the gift card got to its recipient through email, 26 days late. I'd suggest following up with the gift card's recipient with his gift card code so it can be used immediately.",2.0
"I thought that I would be able to print this out and I could not so... the fact it can purchase items is good but would have liked something tangable since it was a gift, It was for 100 yet I still felt cheap.",2.0
"When sending an e-gift card to multiple recipients, recipients never received email with gift card code. Had to re-send several times or send to a different email address before it would be delivered. Otherwise, like the capability and ease of adding a logo and message to the gift card.",2.0
"The order details do not show the uploaded pic and how the gift card it looks to the recipient.  Buyers can preview the gift card when creating it, but order details only show text from message.",2.0
Only was able to use one $50. Certificate instead of 2 $50. Certificates that I paid for were 2 for 50.00.,2.0
After multiple attempts I still was not able to upload a 100kb photo from my laptop harddrive - it came up with an erroir message with no explanation. In the past I have had no problem uploading similar photos. Do you have a trouble shooting guide to explain common problems uploading photos ? Very disappointing that it does not try and help you solve the problem.,2.0
"I never received any notice that gift card was undeliverable to the email I submitted. My granddaughter did NOT get her birthday present and was ""too polite"" to tell me she got nothing! Why wouldn't Amazon have something trigger to check in with me about that?
When I went into my account to try to change email - this was not an option, nor was there any info on how to proceed under the circumstance. PLEASE advise.",2.0
"I was unimpressed with the online gift card email delivery.  Thought an Amazon gift card with a special picture would be a great gift for my Mother-in-Law, right to her email so I purchased it in advance of her birthday.  Per the option on Amazon to deliver it to her email on a scheduled day, I scheduled for email delivery to her on her birthday.

When I checked in with her on her birthday, she had not received it at all. (She also checked her junk/spam folder, although she is already an Amazon customer and nothing there).  When I contacted Amazon about it, they apologized for the mistake and thought there must have been a glitch in their internal system.  They were nice about it and corrected it, but the element of surprise and timeliness of delivery was a fail.

No concessions were offered and just got an apology.  I don't feel confident to purchase an online gift card as an option again.",2.0
I sent this gift card to a friend of mine and it turned out that he can only purchase from the US.. He was kinda stuck with a gift he couldn't use...,2.0
"I've never had trouble with an Amazon gift card before.  Thought I'd try the one with the photo.  It was a gift for my husband for Father's Day.  Well, he never received it.  Everyone opened gifts at our family gathering and it's a good thing I had printed out my receipt because that is what I had to give him.  It never arrived.  I e-mailed and never heard back.  Finally after a few days I called and someone who was very nice and helpful said they would re-send it.  And they did, immediately.  Then, the next day we received an e-mail from my first e-mail note, saying they had cancelled the gift card and were sending a new one.  Now we didn't know if the replaced e-mail card was good.  Very confusing.  Finally straightened it all out but will never use this method again.",2.0
"when I transfered the photo to the card/email, it only printed out 1/2 of the photo and cut out some of the best parts.",2.0
"I bought two online gift cards on the same day at the same time.  Neither recipient got them, although Amazon automated system told me they did.  I had to go online several times to get the first one reissued, and finally had to call customer service to get the job done.  It was pretty difficult to find that telephone number.  After that, I was able to get the second one reissued by going online a couple more times.  The idea is great, I loved being able to put my own picture on the cards, but the process needs some work.  I probably won't order any more.",2.0
It did not upload the photo which took away the personal nature of the gift card.  Will order earlier next time.,2.0
"Love these cards, have used them for teacher gifts for years.  I just purchased four of these ""Holiday Scene (color-in)"" and found I don't like the color-in option.  I like the idea but I thought it was a folded card!!  It's not, it's an 8.5x11 landscape page, flat.

I see now the image looks flat (v. cards that appear folded) but I'm disappointed and annoyed.  More as feedback for Amazon and a ""buyer beware"" for future purchasers.  Color-in option is FLAT, not easily folded as nice card.  Well, easy to fold but not a nice, pretty card.  Ugh.  Whatever.",2.0
"I ordered a bunch of gift cards and when the people went to use them, they found they didn't have anything on them. I gave my father in law some cards and other members of my family as Christmas presents! You need to have these double checked before shipping!",2.0
This made getting someone a great gift very easy.,2.0
"If you purchase the card at the brick and mortor restaurant,  they give you an additional 10.00 card. So for 50.00, you receive a 50.00 and a 10.00. Just sayin...",2.0
I wish I knew they'd be closing nearly all their Long Island locations right after I purchased!!,2.0
"I ordered the grilled shrimp add on to my entree. The pic of what I received is attached. This was nearly $5 extra for 3 pieces of ""shrimp"". RT is getting too expensive for no more than you get. We love the salad bar, but unfortunately, we won't be going back until they lower prices or increase quality and quantity. The server was even embarrassed by the price paid for that.",2.0
"The card itself was fine and had the full account balance available, but the card backing to which the card was attached was mutilated/damaged and definitely not gift-worthy.",2.0
Closed all the locations by my house,2.0
"I realize I am in the minority here, and while these kinds of  card are  great gift ideas, frankly I'm not that impressed with Cold Stone itself, at least in Northern California.  I realize it's not fair to compare it to individual shops like Fenton's, Ici, Gunther's etc, which are waaaayyyy better.  But even compared to other chains such as Loard's, Leatherby's, Farrell's or even Baskin-Robbins (I didn't count Double Rainbow because they no longer have their own stores but sell out of markets), they come up short in flavor.

My experience, at least for the three stores I've personally visited, is that this company's ice cream tastes like its name",2.0
"I ordered a bunch of gift cards and when the people went to use them, they found they didn't have anything on them. I gave my father in law some cards and other members of my family as Christmas presents! You need to have these double checked before shipping!",2.0
one of the cards was not activated when purchased.,2.0
"Great value,  but arrived with outer card dilapidated,  so unable to give as a gift,  which was my intent.",2.0
Was extremely scratched up. Was embarrassing to give as a gift.,2.0
Ordered two only got one,2.0
"Always arrive bent,scratched and looking like they were dumped on the warehouse floor and walked-on. Nice gift for me to put in my kid's birthday cards and etc??!!",2.0
"Was expecting it to look like the picture, but is beat up and the card was attached by piece of dirty tape. Was planning on using as a present but will have to take it off the wrapping because it looks so bad.. Disappointed",2.0
It took long to get to me. I got it two weeks after it was supposed to arrive. Couldn't give it as a gift as I had planned. I just hope that the card will actually work once I give it away.,2.0
Satisfies duty and good present too.,2.0
Card was bent,2.0
"While the item was what I had ordered, it looked as though someone had drug it through mud before placing it in the package. This is a Christmas gift so I'm very disappointed! The card seriously looks to be YEARS old.",2.0
The magnetic strip did not work. So the cashier had to type in the card number several times. Embarrassing!,2.0
"I ordered three gift cards for a friend who was moving and selected one-day shipping, with the gift cards supposedly guaranteed to arrive the day before she was due to leave, so she and her son had gift cards to use for meal stops along the journey. She was to leave in the morning, as one does when they are moving 15 hours away, but instead of having the gift cards packed up with her, they were still on the fedex truck until 12:30 that afternoon. The one-day ""guaranteed"" shipping did not happen. There was no bad weather. There was no holiday rush. When contacted about the delay, there was no reason for why they failed to be delivered by the promised time. Just that they failed to be dispatched with any promptness, and from then on failed to be treated with any of the urgency one might expect with ""guaranteed one-day shipping"".
I got my shipping fees refunded. Well that was nice of them, wasn't it?",2.0
ordered three pack of gift cards and all of the envelopes are too small for the greeting card. I'll either have to trim the greeting card to fit the envelopes or find larger envelopes to fit the greeting card.  This has not happened with single cards so was surprised when it happened with the set of three.,2.0
"I chose the cupcake design for my gift cards and came a different one, not even included in my options. It was blue and the gift was for a girl.! Also, the envelopes were smaller than the cards, and in order to be able to deliver gift (as it was a B-day present) i had to cut the B-Day card. It was to late, so i couldn't go and bought another one.
too much trouble for a gift card....",2.0
"If I had received what I ordered, I would be much happier.  I ordered the cupcake birthday card format, but I got an ugly blue format.  Not what I ordered.  Plus, I must have received the envelopes for the cupcake gift cards because they are too small for the ugly blue cards.  Too late to return as I need them for a gift this week so I will give the card without the envelope.  This is my first disappointment with Amazon.",2.0
The envelopes they sent don't fit the cards. So watch out for that.,2.0
I received these and the thank you greeting cards (with attached gift card) don't fit in the envelopes provided.  The envelopes are too small!!  It kind of defeats the purpose of getting greeting cards if you can't mail them or use the envelopes.,2.0
It wouldn't let me  write a message saying who it was from. It was a gift and they prob don't even know who sent it.,2.0
"I bought one of these and got it in the mail, opened it up and read the paper with the card attached..."" 25.00 Starbucks gift card with a balance of 21.50"". They took the shipping out it or what!? I wasn't pleased with that. I got this for a birthday gift! I won't buy from them again!",2.0
Once certificate was purchased it indicated that it would be emailed to me in 5 minutes. It took 4 hours to get to me. Kinda defeated the purpose for my last minute gift.,2.0
"i ordered this gift card for my brother who has an amazon acct. balance & i wanted him to pay it off, upon researching the amazon gift cards, i was under the impression he could ""apply it to his account"", not trus, he was able to buy more items, but as far as his paying down his acct, no. so he still has his balance and the card did him no good. i would've sent him cash, but i was mis-led by the option where he could ""apply to his account"". i will be more aware next time.",2.0
ok,2.0
Problem with receipient getting the email.  Goes to junk mail.  Embarrassing to keep asking did you get something from me.,2.0
Not very accurate compared to chemical analysis of soil.,2.0
Horrible,2.0
Didn't advertise it was in US$ when I was purchasing in Australia.,2.0
"The idea is great and I quite often buy Amazon gift cards, but unfortunately this time the recipient didn't get it at the fixed delivery date...",2.0
"This is an e-gift. So I thought my friend would get it right away but he did not. Fortunately, I asked him. So i called amazon resp and he solved the problem. So my friend got it on time on Valentine Day.",2.0
The gift card did not reach the intended recipient. I had to fiddle my around the Amazon website to have the card re-sent to an alternative email address. My friend finally received the gift card but by then it was way past the surprise moment that was planned. Quite a let down actually.,2.0
"I am confused when I review my past orders that I am prompted to ""resend"".  At first I thought that it did not go through right but I guess it is in case I am feeling generous and want to send more. Other than that it did go through ok to the birthday girl to her email.",2.0
Because I was supposed to get a $10 rebate for this purchase. which I never did get. This was promised in an email.,2.0
Necessary to contact Support Desk to send out an email to recipient after failure to send on specified date in April,2.0
"It is my mistake !  I mistook amazon.com to be the same as amazon.co.uk - not knowing that the former is America based and so my relative is unable to action the gift voucher for 15 english pounds because of the cost of postage!
My Visa account was debited on the 13 February.
I don't have any other details but would appreciate if you would transfer the gift voucher order to amazon.co.uk.
There must be some relationship between the organisations.
If that request is not possible please send the gift voucher to an American hospice cum hospital.
Sincerely,
Gillian Partridge",2.0
Don't know what happened but I sent out a birthday greeting with a Amazon gift card and I found out a week later that my grandson never received the email to see the greeting. Went online and there was a message to re-send the whole thing. Disapointed that Amazon did not email me to let me know the sender did not receive the card.,2.0
Disappointed you can't purchase.gift cards in smaller amounts than $25. Other than that it was a nice gift to give for kindle books,2.0
"I thought it was great, it arrived on time and provided me with notice of the delivery. However, the first item purchase for his Kindle, never showed up although the deduction was made from the gift certificate.  I Purchased the Kindle which he has had for years purchasing publications. This was very odd,and has made my gift look a little suspect.",2.0
This is the second time I sent 2 gift cards.  One was delivered and one wasn't.  They were both to the same email address.  You used to send confirmation that the person got it.  You don't do that anymore.  Now I feel like I need to check with everyone I sent gift cards to to make sure they got them.  Now I feel like I can't trust they are delivered without getting confirmation that they have been received.,2.0
I received my gift card with the gift box but the gift box is damaged badly. This is the first time I've been unhappy with something from Amazon and I hope it will be the last.,2.0
Nice box but it arrived with a dent in it... not ideal when you're giving it as a gift,2.0
"Gift card is a gift card...but the box was dented, not good",2.0
"I ordered around 10 of these and the tins arrived scratched and dented.  Considering they're holding $100 gift cards and I bought over $1000 worth, I thought they would be in better shape.",2.0
"I planned to buy the gift card because of the box! Otherwise, I will choose to buy a electronic gift card. But, the box disappointed me. It is not as good as shown on website. Many scratches on the box.",2.0
"I read the reviews below and thought there was no way to mess up an order as easy as this. Clearly I was mistaken, the tin was bent, scratched, and obviously well worn. I would find another option than to use these, as good an idea as it may seem.",2.0
"Ordered this as a gift, and all the recipient got was an envelope with order details.  He was understandably confused, but didn't reach out to me till later.  It was embarrassing, and I'm sure there will be cases where the recipient will not know what to do with the ""gift"" but throw it away.

After about a month, the gift recipient finally informed me of what he received (basically an envelope saying ""happy birthday"", and nothing else).  Amazon finally shipped the product the next day, but by then it was too late.

I cannot recommend this product for this reason.",2.0
"Usually, it's just a gift card, so there is not too much to talk about it. The case looks nice and adds value to the gift card. However, the main body of this product, the gift card, is not well made. When the claim code was scratched, the code is not readable; see the uploaded photo. I have to make it clear that I scratched it carefully. I contacted Amazon customer service. They asked me to give the serial no. so they can check on it. I gave it to them and got the answer ""Sorry, I still cannot find it even with the serial number?"" This is very disappointing as I purchased this card directly from Amazon. I had to say thanks God because I am the purchaser so they were able to apply the credit directly to my account. and I was really lucky because originally it was a gift for a friend. I changed my mind and give him something and keep the card instead. I don't know what would have happened if my friend got this card.",2.0
Dented and crushed box this time. Looks bad when gifting.,2.0
"Gift card is a gift card, and I know it was free but the brown box came all scratched and worn. Looked cheap",2.0
"As another user pointed out, the tin is essentially useless for being repurposed. It has a large rectangular hole in the bottom, that serves as a window to view the giftcard numbers/barcodes on the inside. It is covered by a clear plastic window that is glued on. If one is purchasing this item thinking they will acquire a reusable tin, they will be disappointed, as I was. The gift card itself, of course, is great.",2.0
"I ordered several Brown Gift Card Tins and they all had substantial dents.  Not conducive to ""gifting"".  I had to purchase additional gift boxes.",2.0
"Nice design on the tin, but arrived all dented and misshaped. But a gift card is a gift card.",2.0
"Amazon duplicated my order but then reversed what I thought was the duplicate order.  Instead they reversed the original order, which is the gift card I gave as a gift.  Recently when the recipient tried to use it they were told the card had been cancelled.  I gave the original cards I received as the gifts because I thought the duplicates would be the ones that would have been cancelled, and I did not check them before gifting due to a label that had to be removed.  This has been a great inconvenience me and I will probably not order Amazon gift cards in the future.  I love shopping on Amazon and the deals available there.  However, in the future I think cash is the better choice for a gift so as the person receiving the gift is not inconvenienced.  I do have the other cards but have not had a chance to give them to the recipients to see if those ones work.  I will definitely let you know if they do not work, as I did pay for two gift cards.",2.0
Great gift,2.0
"This seems hard to mess up, and a few commenters have mentioned it, but mine also came in a pretty badly damaged box. It just looks really bad when you are sending a gift and it arrives all dented and messed up. At that point, why even bother.",2.0
"I received the gift card next day, but the metal case was crushed. We give these items out as promotional gifts and its not very professional to give it in a crushed gift box.",2.0
"I thought the tin would look nice and wrap the giftcard I ordered nicely, but the tin arrived severely damaged and dinged up.  It was shipped in a heavily padded envelope, so I suspect it was damaged before it ever left the warehouse. Very disappointed.",2.0
"This is ludicrous.  A week to little a little tin box with a card in it.

Now I get to wait and see whether the box is dented, scratched, etc.

Also get to wait and see whether the card has already been stolen (i.e., used) or whether it's usable.

It never never NEVER occurred to me that it would smart to check reviews for a (leaving out the adjectives here) GIFT CARD.

Amazon . . . bad.  These should be quick, and impeccable.  This should not be hard to do.",2.0
"This was supposed to be a 1 day shipping. Ordered this card because one-day shipping option was available. As per the shipment notice, the Order was shipped on thursday. It is Monday night and no sign of the card...  I ordered it to be gifted for an event over the weekend. The event has passed and I had to spend another $150 to gift my friend during the event...

Updated on 01/03/2013
-- Ok.. Day 8 and still have not received it.. Seller does not want to respond to my emails either. I have a tracking number for UPS. But UPS tracking says that the shipping label was created but shipment was never sent out by the person who created it..",2.0
"When I recieved the order the box was in bad shape nothing to do with shipping it was poor quality. The box had chips of paint off of it and it looked used. It is to late to do anything about it. It is a shame to give a gift and have it look so poor. I have always been satisfied with everything I have ever ordered from Amazon, which is why it is a surprise to find some thing from you in such condition.",2.0
"This arrived as a gift a week late! Not cool. When it is advertised as the best way to get a gift out overnight, it stinks to have it arrive a week late!",2.0
I had the same problem as some of the other reviewers: the gift tin box was damaged when I received it and thus it couldn't be given as a gift. A total waste of my time. You would think that Amazon would read these complaints and find a more reliable shipping method.,2.0
"I was so excited to give this as a gift for someone wanting to use create space. You can not use the gift card with create space my friend JUST informed me.....how embarrassing. The box it comes in is very cute but was dented when I received it but the packaging was not, so it must have been before hand.

I love amazon but this was just disappointing and I did read the specifics before buying. Fast shipping on the good side.",2.0
"I bought 3 gift cards for nieces and nephew and had them sent directly to their house for Christmas.  When I placed my order I included a personal message on all three cards, but they were not included.  My brother had to contact me to see if I had sent the cards, not sure how many people he contacted before me, but that is very frustrating.",2.0
"I ordered two of these, as gifts, specified what I wanted them to say and only received the cards with no messages.",2.0
Ordered this for daughter to use with kindle fire.  unable to access it with the code.  Not sure how I will even.  Not happy.,2.0
"I like how I can easily go online to ""gift"" a card to somebody else. However, there is a bug in the system -- the recipient received the card, but the credits all got lost when she changed her Amazon account password (without even being able to use the card for anything).

After sending an email to Amazon support, Amazon eventually sorted it out, but it took a couple of weeks before it was resolved (and got no communication that the issue was being worked until it was fixed).",2.0
The browser is not as good as my dad's iPad but I do like watching videos on it and playing some of the game apps mom let me download.,2.0
I ordered two $50 cards. Received 4 in two separate mailings. Two are loaded as ordered. Two are $0.,2.0
Gift card was detached from the backing and looked scratched. It was (obviously) a gift so felt a little uncomfortable giving it. Hope it works. Never had issues before and have ordered his gift card in the past.,2.0
"I ordered a GAP gift card. I received a Baby GAP gift card; it spend the same, but since I'm giving it to an 11 year old it seems to be an insult to them to think of themselves as still a baby.",2.0
"This gift was supposed to be an anonymous gift from me to a family member.  For some reason my name was on a slip of paper inside the package.

Honestly the first time I have been disappointed with Amazon, but big time disappointment for this one.",2.0
"bought several as gifts, one had a sharp edge that cut the small child it was given to. They should quality check for that sort of thing.",2.0
Great presentation but thought the value would be on it,2.0
"I love the gift cards. The little Amazon boxes are very cute. However, the 3-star rating is because I purchased FIVE $50 cards that were mailed in a loosely closed, un-taped box, so they could have easily fallen out or been stolen during shipping. This was a complete shock. I've never received a shipping package from Amazon that was not securely taped shut.",2.0
Nowhere I found to write a message.,2.0
The box arrived dirty and dented. Such a shame...,2.0
"Unfortunately the gift card, though delivered on time, was despatched without the greeting text so it took the recipient a few weeks to work out who it was from.",2.0
"So these arrived promptly, but the message was not in with the card or attached to the box, as you would expect.",2.0
"I don't remember ordering a plaid box, and it was suppose to be a simple money card for my Daughter's Birthday. And again, it was suppose to be next day delivery.",2.0
"I gave the gift card to my spouse, Karin Thompson, who had great difficulty using it. She thought ""please, not again"".

Why do you suppose this happened??  Thanks.  Jim Thompson",2.0
I ordered this on the 18th and it was supposed to be there the next day....it just got to its destination on the 27th! All my other packages arrived on time or shortly after...but both gift cards that i ordered took 6 to 9 days for them to receive.,2.0
I made a gift tag and it did not go with it.,2.0
"It was a gift to my son, never said to much about it. Said thank you.",2.0
Nowhere I found to write a message.,2.0
Took forever toarrove,2.0
"I ordered a gift card for $225, on a Nativity card, in the plaid box.  Card arrived on a plain $50 ""a"" amazon card.  Turns out that $225 was loaded on the $50 card,after contacting customer service.  Very confusing and not what I ordered as a gift.  Rather disappointing that $50 was on a $225 card!  Why offer c,hoice selections fo gift cards if thy're not going to be sent out that way??",2.0
I do not see anywhere on the front or back of the card to indicate its value.  I order different denominations of cards and can't tell one from the other unless I read the serial number.  How is the recipient to know the value of their gift when received?,2.0
I purchased 2 cards for $40 and one for $30 in the same order but have no way of knowing which cards were for which amount.  The receipt does not indicate the serial number assigned to the denominations.,2.0
"Two stars only because of two points: 1. I selected 'Other Amount' and the image on the product page showed the amount selected printed on the card - but when the card arrived it was blank. I guess I will have to hand write the amount as there is no indication anywhere else on the card of how much it is for! Imagine someone opening the box to find ... a blank gift card. Not quite the same thing, is it? What if I had sent it to someone and thus did not have the opportunity to hand write on it? 2. The gift-card is on paper-ish cardboard, flimsy and thin, and not like the sturdy plastic ones available over the counter - in case you were anticipating that.

The presentation box appears as is, looks fine. Next time I will just buy a plastic one from a store and place it in a card.",2.0
Very pretty box.,2.0
"I have bought MANY gift cards from Amazon over the years.  In every case they ALWAYS had the amount inscribed on the face.
Neither of the cards I just received had any type of amount inscribed.  I find that pretty odd?",2.0
"Ya these are cute, i ordered 4 of them, which arived together, two for $50, and two for $25. Unfortunately there is no way to tell which ones are which without distroying the cute package.",2.0
I am supposed to get $10/20 credit for buying these gift cards.  I bought and paid for the cards when do I get my $10/20,2.0
The gift box was crushed therefore not a very good presention.,2.0
"Cute idea, but the tin is not reusable. The bottom is cut open and a piece of plastic interested so the barcode can be scanned. What a waste!",2.0
"I did not order the nativity. the one I ordered was changed in processing and I couldn''t change it.
Was not happy, but as long as it works.",2.0
The tin could have been really cute if it weren't dented !  I won't be giving the card in the original tin.,2.0
"I Ordered this in time but it didn't arrive until after Christmas.
I know this is a  first-world problem and you guys probably did your best, but it would have been nice if it had arrived in time.
Next time, I hope get a delivery handler that does a better job.",2.0
"Last night (12/17) I ordered $450 worth of gift CARDS with promised FREE overnight shipping. I just received an email this morning that I would be receiving PAPER gift certificates by Monday, 12/23. Tried to cancel but no luck. Never again.

UPDATE: After all that: I did receive my order on Friday 12/20 AND it was actually the gift CARDS and not the paper gift certificates. I will change my rating from 1 star to 2, but no more than that because of the craziness associated with this order. Even the packing slip that came with my order said ""PAPER gift certificates""! Go figure.",2.0
I LIKE THE CARD BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL WHICH CARD HAS WHAT AMOUNT ON IT. I BOUGHT 2 CARDS WITH DIFFERENT AMTS AND I DONT WANT TO GIVE THE WRONG AMT AS A GIFT. PLEASE HELP,2.0
Ordered the product mainly because Amazon noted it will be delivered on a specific day (Present for a family). Item was received 3 days later than the noted date.,2.0
"I order several gift cards for business executives. Very disappointed with delivery of this items, Did not arrive on time. Can't get any verification that items have reached to appropriate person since they don't require signature from actual recipient. Will not recommend this item to anyone even though I am a fan of Amazon.",2.0
"If you're used to overnight delivery, putting the card in a little box really slows things down.  I would not do this again.  There was no indication of who it was from.  We finally called to see if the birthday girl got it and they said yes, but didn't know who it was from.",2.0
The tin was empty.,2.0
"Well, I ordered 3 of these all at different values. Christmas gifts. Perfect, right?

None were labeled with their value. Required a call to the Amazon to figure out which was which.

Cool box.",2.0
A little disappointed. I purchased this gift card for my girlfriend and when she went to use it. It only had $70 on it.,2.0
"I obviously can't write a review for each card.  However, I have not been too pleased with Amazon this year.  Almost everything arrived when it said it would.  The gift card situation, however, is getting worse and worse.  These arrived at the recepients home as requested.... with all the gift cards mixed together and the gift tags all mixed together.  Mostly they were the same amount so it was easy to say ... these and these names.... but there was one that was different.  I, personally, don't write on my gift cards ""Merry Christmas, Blank.  Here is your gift card for X amount.  Love you.""  I just don't operate that way.  Guess next year I will send them each separately.  Which is ridiculous unto itself.  If Amazon needs to hire more packagers perhaps they should!!!",2.0
I wish that you were able to insert a note with the unit. Because the person had no idea who sent it.,2.0
Once again Amazon did not include my gift message and my brother-in-law did not know who the gift card was from!,2.0
"the whole process was very smooth.  However, after the December 3 delivery date I never heard from the recipient, and I thought that was strange.  Today I e-mailed the recipient and guess what?  my gift card was left out!!!  He had no idea who it was from.  Very disappointing to ;hear that this could happen.",2.0
"Not sure how this was shipped, but we do know it was stolen before it even got to the intended person.  Not good!!",2.0
"Tin arrived with scratches in the paint on the edges and front. There is a window in the lower side, as delivered it shows the boring fine print on the back of the card. If you reverse the card so the ""HO!HO!HO!"" text shows through the window, much more interesting but window is positioned so that the HOHOHO is cut off no matter which way you turn the card.",2.0
Don't like the tin - it looks tacky!,2.0
"This is supposed to be a gift/present for some one you care for and this box came in a horrible condition. The edges and surfaces of this box is extremely dirty and sticky. If I send this directly to other people as gift, I'm sure they would feel disgusted by how nasty this box is. I am disappointed with this order",2.0
"The gift card is great and there was a $10 promotion credit which was given to me as a bonus for purchasing it. However, the $10 credit was difficult to use. Most products I wanted to purchase were not eligible for the promotioal credit.  Other products which I tried to apply the promotional credit to would only take partial credit of $1-$2  so I canceled my order. I think offering a promotional credit is a gimmick to make people purchase more that one wants in order to use the $10. I did write Amazon and they did give me a credit but I won't be falling for that gimmick again.",2.0
damaged tin,2.0
"My gift card box was missing it's lid, so now I have to buy a new one at the dollar store.",2.0
"I only received the card in a box without the lid, which makes me upset. This makes the gift card looks not like a gift anymore. I'll probably just use it myself instead of giving it out.",2.0
"Because I bought it AT Amazon.com and when it arrived, it wasn't activated for it's intended gift receiver so they had to go through a process and call, etc. I think that's ridiculous and embarrassing.",2.0
"it arrived in a bubblewrap envelop, it was damaged a little on the outside. the box lid was not closing correctly. i wish they could pack it in a little more safe way",2.0
"Gift card and tin as described; prime delivery date of 12/23; received after holiday on 12/27; had I known delay was possible would have purchased at retail; gift became an IOU, not very merry",2.0
metal tin was bent in and not able to be fixed.  was disappointed because it was a cute concept.  probably won't purchase again,2.0
"I purchased 2 of these cards and neither arrived in time for Xmas.
Kinda made me look like Scrooge.
Hopefully this won't happen again next time I want to use Amazon as a place to purchase gifts.",2.0
"If you expect this to get to the recipient in a reasonable amount of time, just print or email the gift card. One day ship is nonsense. This took a week to get delivered. I would not buy this again. It would be extremely less frustrating to give cash in a nice card instead.",2.0
I was supposed to get a free $10.00 gift card for  ordering $50.00 of gift cards.  I did not receive card or code .,2.0
Very poor packaging.  The tin cannot withstand being shipped in an envelope.  I love Amazon and expect better from it.  Good idea that doesn't work.,2.0
"I bought this because of the cute box design, thinking we could reuse the box. But there is a hole in the bottom, so their machine can read the UPC code. So much for the cute box.",2.0
"Well protected in bubble envelope that looked brand new but the tin container was dented anyway.  It was obviously damaged before they sent it.  In addition I paid for one-day delivery but it took over two days before arrival. I hope that there's a card in the tin.

A gift card should easily get 5 stars.",2.0
"Arrived with dents in tin.  I concur with the previous reviewer, tin with card was shipped in an bubble envelope which is not enough protection to prevent denting. Cute idea, should be shipped in box with bubble wrap around it.",2.0
Can not use this gift card to renew amazon prime!  Buyer beware!,2.0
"The recipient was not told who this was from!!
Not good for a Xmas gift.
We had to call and ask if it got there!!!!
WHAT A SHAME!!!!",2.0
"The gift card is probably okay but the ""overnight"" delivery took 4 days.",2.0
Really dumb as the amount does not appear on the card. I had to write it on with a pen. Tacky!,2.0
"Contrary to the website picture of the card, the card denomination is no where on the card or tin, so I have no idea if I received the correct cards and my recipients won't have any idea how much they're for until they go to redeem them. I tried to verify the amount at the Amazon.com/redeem but it requires the claim code which is covered by a sticker meant to be removed by the recipient. Very unfortunate and I would not have ordered these had I known.",2.0
"I placed two orders for Amazon gift cards.  One was for three $25 cards, and the other one was for $50.  I intentionally placed them in different orders so I could tell them apart.  You combined the orders, so when they came, I had no idea which one was the $50 card.  So, of course, I had to open them all to find it.  Lo and behold, all four of them were for $25.  Don't know how you could have messed this up so badly, but I am very dissatisfied.  I need a $50 card to replace one of the $25 cards.  Please send it quickly as it is a Christmas present.  M. Cetti",2.0
I'm sure the gift card is fine.  But the snowflake tin was rusty on one edge.  Even though it is sealed in cellophane.  There is no breach in the cellophane.  Must have been sealed with moisture in it.  Very disappointing.  Really detracts from the presentation.,2.0
Do not count on the delivery date/time promised. This failed as a gift and Amazon was difficult to work with. Very disappointing,2.0
It got lost and didn't make it for Christmas.,2.0
I was to get a $10 gift card with this purchase but never did,2.0
not good,2.0
"I purchased a go play golf gift card as a gift. The recipient followed instructions to book his tee time and use the gift card. When he showed up at the golf course to play, the golf course indicated told him it had never heard of the program, and had no tee time reservation for him. He ended up having to pay cash out of pocket. Will update review as we attempt to resolve this through the company, but this is looking like a scam at the moment... beware.

Update 6/13/2014: The company processed my refund immediately, and Loralei from GoPlayGolf called me to follow up. So not a scam, a legitimate business with some imperfections? I just sent my father the cash. Loralei was aware of this review and we discussed it - I encouraged her to post a response that includes some of the context/ other information she shared in our phone call.",2.0
"This is great gift card. And I guess inclement weather played a factor in still not recieving an item that was ordered on 12/21. It is usually a two day mail ride from Colorado to Cali.

I wasn't able to give Christmas gift to daughter on time and she has so far done without. Well, maybe they will be here in the next day or three.

It was difficult to figure out the e-card and it was not delivered on the scheduled date - it was a Christmas gift and I don't think I will go this route again for a $200 gift that I had to resend 3 times after Christmas.  Too much aggravation,2.0
"The gift card itself is GREAT. Everyone loves getting an Amazon gift card. BUT...the ""white gift box"" was anything but white. Dirty, fingerprints, and a nice dent in one of the corners. I can't use this box. I'll have to get a new box or an envelope to put it into. I'm really not happy.",2.0
"Fast Delivery, but the white box was all scuffed up and dirty!  Can't even gift it in this box.",2.0
Didn't like it..,2.0
I gave it 2 stars because the gift card was there and it had the dollar amount on it.  The white gift box was totally messed up.  It was unpresentable for a gift. It was filthy dirty an scratch up so badly part of the white is gone and its just cardboard showing thru. I am going to have to remove the gift card and just put it in a birthday card that I'll buy.  What a huge disappointment Amazon.  I can't believe the person who put this in the envelope felt it was ok to ship. Maybe you need some quality control over there.  Really bad.,2.0
gift box was beat up - not what I expected,2.0
White gift boxes the cards arrived in were so dirty and stained did not want to leave cards in the box.,2.0
"When I ordered this I knew that I would be visiting my grandson during the time of his birthday.  It said the card would be delivered on Jan. 12, so I went ahead and ordered it rather than an email or printed out gift card.  I got an email while visitig him that said it would arrive by 8 p.m. Jan. 12. It did not arrive on Jan. 12!!  It came mid-day on the 13th which was the day I was on an airplane flying home.  This was very disappointing for me even though the grandson was happy to get a gift card.  I think I'll forego using the gift card in a greeting card in the future, since this is the second time in 2 months this has happened.",3.0
I was disappointed that Amazon didn't print what I'd asked to have written on the gift card.,3.0
"Every year I send Amazon gift cards--personalized, all different designs--to nieces and nephews (6 different cards).  This year they all arrived timely, but so far I found out at least 2 arrived with no assignation, and no personalized greeting.  (Not sure about the card designs, whether those were messed up too.)  Also, a relative sent one to my daughter which arrived the same way--no sender, no message.  Now I'm wondering if other Amazon gift cards I've sent arrived this way, and the recipients were left wondering who sent them?  Not a good outcome!  Please Amazon, devote some tech time and straighten out your gift card software!  Otherwise I'll be switching to some other store's cards in future.",3.0
"The product itself is very nice. The greeting card and gift card are very cute. The loss of 2 stars is due to the fact that I ordered this for a Christmas gift, along with 2 other gift cards. This one never showed up before Christmas, even though it was guaranteed to be delivered by 12/23. I finally had to call on 12/28 to see what was going on. No one could tell me. They overnighted me the gift card, which was a nice gesture, but by then I had already went out and purchased one to give since I didn't have this one in time. While overnighting it was nice, I just feel a little more could have been done for me considering the circumstances.",3.0

Damage like this could be avoided if cards shipped in rigid mailer instead of a bubble envelope.  I touched up greeting card with stickers and scribbles.  Bit of a hassle, however card was ""free"" with the gift card, so can't complain.  Just have your own greeting card on hand in case yours also arrives mangled.",3.0

I love that these gift cards come with a card and I have ordered them in the past with no problem but my most recent card was printed badly. The color was streaked across the front of the card and it smudged onto the envelope. :/ Looks like it might be hit and miss with the card.,3.0
Superb quality for a gift card.,3.0
My envelope appeared used and I had to rip it to open it.,3.0
I thought the gift card itself was going to have the little Christmas puppy on it but its a standard black $25 dollar gift card inside a blank greeting card with this puppy on the front of that.  The greeting card is only of moderate quality.,3.0

"I ordered 3 different gift cards.  On the $50 on, the Christmas card and the Amazon Card design matched.  On this one and the other $25 one, the Amazon card was the black one.  I assumed they too would match the Christmas card.  I ordered for the same family and wanted distinct designs.  I got the first set replaced and the second set was the same.  Not a good color for Christmas.  I could have bought them here instead of dealing with online.",3.0
Just what I expected.,3.0
The recipient is frustrated that the order processing automatically assumes the gift card is applied to the order.,3.0
"Unfortunately I sent it to myself by accident. But the real reason for the three stars is that my birthday note was nowhere to be found in the package.

"Card arrived to intended party with no gift card to say who it was from so only luckily that I spoke to my grandson about it so he knew it was from my husband and me.  I had written a message to go with the card so now sure how it was missed, leaving him guessing who the gift was from.",3.0

"Okay, the fine print does say it will cost more to send to Hawaii, but I don't understand why.  It's just a card, and mailing a card to Hawaii does NOT cost any more to send outside of the Continental U.S. than it does within the Continental U.S.  Hawaii is one of the 50 states, after all.

I made my cart and then went to check out. but--eek!--it added FIVE DOLLARS for shipping!  And of course, it took a lot longer than one day.  And--judging from the other reviews--the receiver might not even know who it's from unless you tell them.  So that was a lesson learned.  I love giving and receiving Amazon gift cards (who doesn't?), but next time I'll swing by any Wahlgreen's, Publix, Lowe's, etc., put it in a greeting card (great deals at Dollar Tree), write a message with a good old fashioned tool called a pen, and then mail it via the good folks at the U.S. Postal Service with a Forever Stamp on it.",3.0

You can add a ""gift message"" at check out, however it is NOT printed inside the card.

Only disappoint was the design options offered for the $50 gift card. There were no quality designs!
Instead, we are given several options of colorful little crayon-looking drawings that look like they were created by grade school kids.

Busy time for Christmas.  The PO said that he would have to go to that PO and pick it up (by his UPS store).  Which was a very small crowded PO in San Diego.  Well, they finally delivered it to the UPS store.  I will not do a gift card again.",3.0

The representative said that when the recipient received the gift,  all they would have to do is call Amazon to find out who sent the gift.

"We were very upset to see that it comes in a sealed envelope with codes all over the place. You can't open it to write a private message. Amazon did NOT print the private personal message within the card like you would think they would.

Also they did not make it clear that the message would only be on the receipt
And we did not know we had a choice of card, it was TREE ONLY.
It was only after christmas we saw we had choices.
Very disappointing. I should have given the family cash.

These cards came super fast and were the perfect gift for some people on our Christmas list.  Amazon is a great company with quality items and hundreds of things to choose from.  One note:  look for free shipping.  Otherwise your fifteen dollar card will not stretch very far.  Would recommend these.,3.0
"Would have given this 5 stars but it arrived TWO WEEKS after I ordered. It was a Christmas gift, but since it didn't come, I had to go out and purchase something else in it's place. It arrived TODAY... two weeks after I ordered it and 3 days after Christmas.",3.0
"I love Amazon and shop continuously on it.  I bought a gift card for my mom for Xmas and the tracking info actually said I would get it one day earlier than the other products I ordered at the same time.  So when a non descript sealed envelope came in a box with something else I tossed it on the counter thinking it was junk mail like so many other companies send with their products.  I actually forgot about the GC as I expected it to come snail mail solo.  So this envelope sat for a few days and as I was tossing it into the recycle bin I decided to tear it open.  What to my surprise was inside but another envelope, the holiday card and gift card.  Wow was I surprised.  Since the outside envelope is just packaging it should be better labeled as to the contents.",3.0
"This came in two days with Free Shipping.  Yay!  But the requested 'Notes' were not anywhere to be found.  Disappointing, I guess they feel we can always write the greeting (Who writes anymore?)",3.0
"When I buy the gift card, it allows me to add message to it.
I thought it will be printed either on the greeting card or the gift card itself.

But it was printed on the shipping receipt inside the box.

This is dumb, why do I need that information on the receipt.
If it can't be put on greeting card or gift card, Amazon should remove this option, it's useless.",3.0
"Do not believe 1-day shipping will happen. Do not believe it might come on day 2. Believe that it will be late and you will have to have family pick it up from the delivery company's facilities after they make 3 attempts because those happened to be the 3 days you were on vacation. It makes sense that they would require signature for gift cards instead of having the post office put it in my mailbox, and I like that there are so many more options for the gift cards online, but I'll be buying the totally plain ones from the kiosks at the grocery store from now on.",3.0
"On 2 of my gift cards, I wrote messages and when I received the gift cards, they are generic.  How do I get the message that I printed on my order?",3.0
"So, as others seem to be having trouble with gift cards so have I. I ordered what I thought would be a simple order of a $25 gift card and everything was entered correctly by me. I get a response of ""Due to a processing error, we're unable to deliver your order. We're sorry for any inconvenience this causes.""  THEN  ""A shipment from your gift order 105-3700608-8940233 has been returned to our fulfillment center as undeliverable. Some common causes for undeliverable packages are listed here:""

So this delayed my shipment. The second shipment with the same address somehow made it to me without a problem.

Why did the card and the gift card have to come in a 15""x20"" bubble envelope? I know shipping was free but seriously.

If I could have found someplace that sold amazon gift cards like a wal-mart, target.... I would have driven my happy butt and gotten them myself.",3.0
"I bought this for my Grandfather who loves reading books on his Kindle.  For me it would be a great gift, I will most likely have to help him load the value of the card on to his Kindle but, the card is nice and well packaged for anyone.",3.0
"I was excited to find out that I could have this git card shipped to me next day. However, I was really disappointed when I received it because it was not handled properly during delivery and the card was bent and creased. I had to take the gift card off of the card and throw the card away because it was not presentable.

The packaging was not sufficient for the contents. My suggestion would be to encase the card inside of a cardboard sleeve and package it in a cardboard envelope, similar to what other carriers use.

Amazon has been so great with all of the packages I have bought over the last few weeks, so I was really surprised how careless this package was treated.",3.0
"I was disappointed that I did not received this in one-day as ""guaranteed"".
but shipping was free and it is a busy time of year -- just a warning -- don't count on receiving in one day.  If you really need it that quickly, better to print out a gift card.",3.0
"Well, the cards by itself are fine. Good product, well packed. But they were guaranteed for the NEXT DAY delivery by amazon. I placed the order within allotted time frame on Thursday. Friday I did not get them, Saturday I did not get them,..., Monday I did not get them... I finally got them on Tuesday. I am glad that I am not that gullible and did not rely on the promise but what if I did? I think that it is wrong to promise something you cannot possibly deliver. It would be fine with me if they could be guaranteed for 3-5 days delivery, but it is not OK to say next day and still deliver in 5 days.",3.0
"On a spur of a moment I decided to buy a gift card for a friend, who I won't see until after Christmas. My decision was mostly based on the promise of 'next day delivery'. And they promised to deliver even on a Sunday. So I thought on Saturday morning, 'oh, I can still get it on Sunday and then take it to work on Monday morning and give it to her'. Sadly all of Sunday passed, nobody rang my doorbell - the gift card was not delivered.
Instead I received it a day late, Monday evening in the mail box. Sadly my friend is gone and will be back in January, when I still can give her the card.. but still it's not what I had planned.",3.0
"The gift cards themselves are great- but the envelopes are mailed to you already sealed with the cards inside.  I had to open the sealed envelopes to write my personal message inside of them, then tape the envelopes back together to gift them. Luckily- I have an understanding family.",3.0
"These $25 gift cards were purchased with a note, and since they were in a greeting card, I thought the greeting card would contain the note I had typed in to the AMazon ""gift message"" text box for each of the people I purchased them for, but NO!  Only the packing slip with the ""personal messages"" on it, and the cards were all blank (except for the $25 gift card inside).  It's a good thing I had these delivered to me, and not directly to the distributor/aka SAnta Claus/aka Grandpa.  He would have been inconvenienced by having to write something inside each card.
Furthermore, the packaging was silly -- the whole thing came in a box 3 times the size, when an envelope would have sufficed.  Really, Amazon, what a waste!",3.0
"The cards were nice, but no imprint as specified in the order. Took two days to arrive which is no big deal, but no name or message printed is disappointing. No up to Amazon's usual high standards.",3.0
Three stars...product is fine but was not delivered to my house.  Neighbor found it in the gutter down the street and brought it to me.,3.0
"The gift card arrived 1 day later than guaranteed, and the custom message i had typed for the card wasn't included - all I got was a gift card attached to a blank card.",3.0
box was opened and thought product was missing. Package was huge with a small piece of cardboard with the gift card inside that on the bottom of box.,3.0
"The one-day shipping is great but please read the fine print first.  I ordered a gift card for my sister and her husband.  They were on vacation so I had it shipped to their post office box rather than their home.  While the terms of one-day shipping prohibit this, when I placed my order there was no alert at check-out, otherwise I would have had it shipped to me and mailed it myself.  The card was delivered by UPS and simply set on their porch for anyone to see and steal or be blown away by the wind.  I had to drive to their home, retrieve the card, and mail it myself as they were gone for another six days.  The problem is that Amazon had the post office box address on the label; UPS changed the delivery address to their home which is totally irresponsible.  The irony is that I even provided my phone number on check-out after being prompted; UPS never called me.  While I should have read the fine print first, I also feel that Amazon should have had some way of preventing me from entering a post office box number on the shipping address.  Furthermore, it was completely inexcusable for UPS to change the address especially without calling me first.",3.0
"Product arrived on time, but the gift note was not included with this birthday gift. The recipient had no idea who it was from. A bad slip-up compared to Amazon's usually reliable service.",3.0
"The card and envelope were bent. There was no crease, but putting a piece of cardboard in the soft package would improve the chances of getting to the destination without being bent.",3.0
Because I think the description of the product was wrong I am not sure either of the people I bought these gift cards for have an Amazon account,3.0
This was quick and easy. Used it for what i needed. (bought Grand Theft Auto V) But the message i asked them to put on the card was on a slip of paper. I couldve typed it up if i wanted to be that cheap. It said Amazon all over it..not very good for a gift. Even the birthday card itself was just ugly. Next time i'll buy both the gift card and my own Hallmark birthday card myself at the store.,3.0
"Ok - just for reference for you all and myself in case I forget.  I ordered one of these to see how they arrive - and then used it on myself.  Anyway, if you order a card that comes with the free greeting card here's what arrives:

A big (8.5x5) ish white amazon envelope.  Inside is the greeting card with the gift card stuck inside (with the goo).  The message you wrote to the recipient is NOT PRINTED on the greeting card.  It is on the receipt that also comes in the big envelope in very small letters.  There is no price on the receipt, but it otherwise looks like a amazon receipt.  There is also a white greeting card envelope in the big envelope too, but the card is not put into the envelope - it sort of all looks like you were supposed to get it, assemble, rewrite your message in the actual card and then deliver in person.

Anyone with poor eyesight or add will probably not realize it came from you - you have to study the receipt closely.

Kinda lame for such a nice service - not sure why messages can't be printed in the card? and then just sent like a card.  Oh well.  Oh and the card does have some ""amazon"" wording on it so it too does not look like a store bought card if you want to get one to give in person - eh.  I love amazon, but this could be improved upon immensely and seemingly easily.",3.0
I sent my daughter an Amazon gift card for her anniversary. I included a nice message in the gift section of the order. I was waiting to hear from my daughter when she got it. I called her today and i asked if she got anything from me as yet. She said i did get a gift card but there was no message attached any place. They were trying to guess who sent it. Glad i called so be sure you confirm because Amazon failed this time.,3.0
I do not have any thing specific to say about this purchase other than to say that it was OK.,3.0
"I ordered several gift cards from Amazon on July 22 and my account was updated on July 23, saying they had been delivered. It is now July 30 and they just arrived this afternoon. So much for ""free one-day shipping"".

The gift cards themselves are fine. Just as described, with each gift card in a sealed envelope. When I opened the envelope, I found the card (with gift card attached to the inside) and a plain white envelope so that I could write my own message on the card and seal it into a new envelope. The envelopes all had slight smudges on them, similar to what happens when envelopes go through the mail. Not sure how that happened, as these were inside other envelopes, but, unless you are giving to the most discerning recipient, it is nothing that would detract from the gift.",3.0
i didn't know i could buy these gift cards at my local cvs or food market....but everything was fine but next time i need these gift cards i now know i can buy them elsewhere.,3.0
"Ordered the card for a gift since it was suppose to arrive before the party, but it didn't.  Had I known, I would have just purchased the downloadable card instead.",3.0
"It was fine, arrived on schedule, but once again, NO INDICATION OF WHO SENT IT! I have complained to amazon in the past about this practice and have urged them to tell the recipient the name of the person sending the gift or gift card but this has not happened.",3.0
"I love these Amazon gift cards.  You can't beat free one-day shipping!
I have gotten these numerous times.
The only reason I did not give this five stars is because I just opened the one I purchased for my mother and
the birthday card it came in was extremely bent up.",3.0
"I had asked that a gift note be included in the card but there was none.  I am disappointed that it was not there.  Delivery service was fine, however.",3.0

"I of course love the convenience and the free delivery, however, I wish I could have personalized my note with Spanish.  I could not use an ""n"" with a tilde over it and unfortunately the ascii symbols I used were scrambled.  Please, please update this feature!  Allow other languages to be used as well.  Otherwise, I have not a bad thing to say about this very nice service.",3.0
"It may just be me, but I had a difficult time properly selecting tha amount  and type of gift card. It may have been a problem wiht my access, but I ended up having someone else order for me.... I did order numerour ones in th end and they worked great as gifts for grown kids...",3.0

it was good. they were fast. they are great gifts and that is all i have to say about that,3.0
"Gift card was GREAT.  Note on Birthday Card was not done. Order fillers need to slow down
and follow the request that are given with order. Or maybe Amazon shouldn't offer this service",3.0
"Product arrived late beacuse of weather, no problem blizzards happen, but it arrived without the note I had written.  The person who recevied the gift had no idea who it came from or the reason it was sent as a result.  They found it easy to spend however, so can't give it a terrible review.",3.0

"Kind of disappointed. I specifically chose to send the card with the matching gift card inside and a plain old ""a"" amazon gift card was sent. What was the sense of asking what my preference was if it wasn't going to be sent anyways.",3.0
"The gift card was fine and arrived promptly but I ordered the Chanukah card and it was just the generic gift card. It's not a big problem, but I was a little disappointed as I specifically ordered the Chanukah design.",3.0
"It's a great gift idea and all, but it's ridiculously overpriced! Amazon has some nerve charging what they do for some gift card...",3.0
"It is a gift card so there is not a lot to review there.  However, it has you fill out a section for the personal note which I did on two cards that I bought, nothing showed up. What was the point in having me fill out that section if they were not going to bother putting the note on there?. I had the cards shipped to me and then sent them out.  If they had gone straight to the giftee, they would not have had a clue who they were from.  So those shipping to the receiptant beward of that!  Other than that, they are cute cards and were shipped next day.  They were much appreicated after I wrote the personal message myself!",3.0
"If Amazon is going to market these things, the ""cannot activate the gift card"" issue needs to be addressed.  I purchased four $50 cards for family members on one online visit, to be sent to four different addresses.  Weirdly, the ""we cannot activate the gift card"" message was sent to me 4 days after my order, 3 days before Christmas, and 2 days before my sister even received it!  (Sounds like that should have been sung to a familiar Christmas tune.)  Not sure how Amazon, the king of online everything, can fail in this arena -- a 25% failure rate in my case.  Recipients love these things, so it's something Amazon needs to address, especially during the holiday season.  They are gift cards, after all, and it's a little disappointing when one has to buy a gift twice.  I don't think it impresses the recipient, either.",3.0
I would have loved for my name to appear on card somewhere. She didn't even know it was from my husband and me. I also received a 40 dollar gift card and my husband also 40 dollar. I had no idea my daughter had sent us gift cards for Christmas. She also is complaining about this.,3.0

When ordering these cards it had the option at checkout to get a personal message for each of the cards. I purchased 10 or these cards and spent time typing the messages for each one of them. None of the cards had the message printed on them. As a gift card the value was good as it came with the gift card and a christmas card all in one.,3.0

"The gift cards will rate 5 stars - My order only rates a 2 stars or less.  They were received in a timely manner.  I carefully filled in the ""Gift Message"" when I ordered with our personal message for each card.  Neither card had a personalized Gift Message.  The only place I found it was on the order form accompanying the cards.  No big deal but why have your customer fill out the form and not use it?",3.0
"Card was delivered on time and all that, only thing is that the message I wrote for in the card was missing, so was the message saying Merry Christmas and that I sent the gift card.

It is good I talked to the person I sent it to or they never would have known who sent it.",3.0
"Amazon needs to proofread much more closely before sending out custom things like this to its customers.  I had carefully worded a gift note to be included with this gift card but when I got it, I could hardly read it; it was faded and blurry, as if the ink was low in the printer.  The invoice accompanying it was the same way.  Since our printer at home was not working at the time, I ended up having to rewrite my note onto the card myself, which is unfortunate since my handwriting is not all that great.  Very disappointed in this fact, and their only response when calling to voice my concern was to tell me they'd send that department a note, no apology of any kind.",3.0

I ended up sticking the whole envelope in a bag and hoping for the best.",3.0

"I am really surprised that Amazon has not given more thought to their gift card program.  It is highly restricted in the type of gift and the amount of the gift.  I ordered a gift card to be delivered to my son.  The card arrived on time, but did not allow for a greeting or even that it was a gift card from me!  This truly indicates that Amazon has not thought out their gift card program.  My advice is to buy a gift card from someone else.",3.0
"I ordered a paper gift card, with a message, rather than emailing the gift card. I won't do that again. I sent it as a next day delivery, with a message for the card.

"I would certain use this method again. My only complaint was a folded peace a paper seems sort of tacky to give as a present. But from my point of view it was easy to get and I could do it whenever I wanted. My printer was down so I had to print it at work and I didn't have access to a color printer. So the paper card was in black and white. The plastic card may have looked nicer, but this is sure another method to get a gift card if you unexpectedly need one in a hurry or can't get to store to buy one. Method works great.",4.0

"This was a little problematic but I eventually found out that I caused the problem by keying in the wrong email address for the
recipient.  It was one of my son's older email address but was not rejected by the mail system.  The correction facility to cancel the first one and send it again worked very well.  I don't know if it would be possible for Amazon to pick up the email address from my contacts list.",4.0

"This is an excellent option if you want to purchase a gift card for a friend or loved one. There's no hassle of driving to a store & picking one out, waiting in line, etc. You just need to select the design you would like to gift & choose a dollar amount. I have two fairly minor complaints in this process. The first was being able to select the gift card design on my smartphone, there wasn't an option to increase the number of designs per page, so it was constant scrolling & loading the next page until I found a design I liked. The second and bigger complaint is that towards the end of the check out process, there is a box to include your name as the gift giver, which lists that as being optional. I thought that since I was logged in to my Amazon account & purchasing for another Amazon user, I would automatically be identified as the gift giver. Unfortunately, I was not. The email to the recipient just said that someone had sent them a gift card, with no name or email address attached. I wish that this was noted in the text box & not just that it was optional. Other than that, this was a smooth & easy transaction.",4.0
