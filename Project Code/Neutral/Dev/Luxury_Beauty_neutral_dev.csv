Not very strong smelling. Maybe too old???,2.0
"disappointed, aroma goes away really fast, saved some dollars but I'll rather buy it at store, seems like original, box and container the same, maybe is diluted, saw a review with same comment, so I think is not only me, better you bay at store",2.0
"Not the original. I have been using this perfume since last 4 years now and previous one was bought from Macys. It was so strong and permanent in nature that you will get the same smell even after 10-12 hrs. So strong that when my wife used to wash the clothes days after, all of them will get this smell from my shirts. This one has same smell BUT it changes to different note within 5 minutes and you wont't be able to smell anything at all within 15-20 min.s. So, this seems to be a watered down version or probably a counter fit. Interesting thing here is that the bottle and the packaging are exactly similar to the one that i had before. If you are looking for quality, better buy it from Macys and if you are just looking for something cheap, no harm in trying this one.
Update 09/09/2015 - It looks like CalvinKlein itself watered down the original perfume, maybe to cut down the cost. I have desperately been trying to find the original stuff that I bought 7 years back and tried it at one Calvin Klein shop and Macys and other places but it doesn't smell same anymore. They changed and sublimed the original formula to a cheap one. So this is the original product. I will keep the review at 2 stars as I am not satisfied with the product in overall.",2.0
I work on Cruise Ship and we have a duty free shop and they sell this perfume also but its bit expensive then amazon. So i thought that if i get it cheaper on Amazon the why not but when i used this Perfume i found that it does not stay on ur body or cloths more then 2hrs. I do not know if it is really old stock or what ? but i am not satisfy with this product.,2.0
I always like CK products and that's why I bought it but this perfume seems to be duplicate and doesn't last more than a hour.,2.0
Does not seem to be a fresh bottle. I have used this product before and it does not compare well.,2.0
"It is not as potent as what I usually buy at Macy's.  So, it does not last as long.  Large amount for the $$$$, but have to use twice as much.  Will not purchase again.",2.0
"It's doesn't look like the one I bought from Macy's, I am not recommended and would not buy this product again.",2.0
"Eternity is a great cologne, but it seems like the stock that Amazon has has been sitting in the sun, or is old, because it smells great going on, but is gone within 2 hours, this never happens when I buy elsewhere, so it must be Amazon alone with this issue. Avoid for sure.",2.0
i love the smell of Eternity cologne and my dad used to wear it about 20 years ago. So i bought this. I don't understand-why is the cologne green? The smell is not as it used to be. I wonder if this bottle is a fake?,2.0
"I've been using Borghese Cura C for years.  I love the product, however, I have to question the seller and their price.  On every other site I've checked this product retails for 68.00 dollars.  Their price is listed as half that which makes me wonder how old it is.  I fell for this one with Beautyrose and the product was rancid. I did NOT receive any resolution after a flurry of emails and I will never buy Borghese from them again.",2.0
"I bought this product mainly because my daughter has fair, sensitive skin, which most facial wipes cause her minor irritation. This product worked very well as far as thoroughly cleaning her face, hands etc. It did not irritate her skin at all...the problem, the one and only problem, is the fragrance, if you can call it that. It stinks so bad, I did not want to go near her after I wiped her down...I had to give her a bath, it was so bad.",2.0
Don't think it smells too great myself. I don't know if this is fake because I've never bought any before. Just saying it could be.,2.0
"I changed my EDT from D&G light blue to Eternity because it smelled good and lasted long at Kohl's store; therefore decided to buy from Amazon. However, it is not the same:
Smelled: Smell is not I smelled at Kohl's store;
Lasted: Lasting is not long as it lasted when I used at Kohl's.
Packaged: is original package.

I think the smell is a bit too strong for a baby's face. It smells very flowery and strong. I won't be purchasing it again.,2.0
"The wipes are great! Soft, smell good and large. But the description is misleading. I received only a set of 25 wipes. Very expensive. Not worth it for this price",2.0
"We have many allergies in our house, and the scent on these cloths is one of them. Would be great if these were fragrance free, but as is they are unusable for us and possibly dangerous to those with more severe allergies. Caution to those.",2.0
Didn't like this product at all. There are much better ones out there. It feels oily and doesn't absorb well.,2.0
Very dufficult to remove from eyelid wetline,2.0
I loved the color & how smooth & easy it was 2 apply but after only a few minutes of wearing it started 2 run. Everyone does not have this problem so if u don't then u will love this!,2.0
Not worth the cost,2.0
"Not something I reach for often. This is more whiteish pink on me than a light gold that I was hoping it would be. You definitely need to prime before and set with a shadow or it will smudge, and I don't even have oily eyelids! Personally the mac paintpots are a lot better. I got this on sale for like 10$ and I would not purchase again even if it would go on sale. This isn't a bad product if you use it properly. I was just expecting more from a higher end cream shadow, I shouldn't have to do all those steps. The color isn't bad either. I will continue to use it. The color is perfect for an inner corner highlight, however I have very watery eyes and my inner corners are always the first to have the makeup removed because of that. This product did not last through that either.",2.0
The product package was sticky. The color does not apply smoothly though it is quite water resistant. Get the L'Oreal Infallible instead. It's cheaper with a better application and it comes with a brush.,2.0
"I love the original Smudge Pot that I bought as part of a set from Sephora years ago. Even though the black was half the size of this one it lasted for years without drying up (not exaggerating). When I first opened the package it was already dried out quite a bit and was difficult to apply. I'm not sure why since this should be the same product.
Thinking about sending it back if possible",2.0
"WHEN I PUT IT ON, IT DRIES AND FLECKS FLY INTO MY EYES AND IT HURTS VERY BAD! I WOULD USE TARTE INSTEAD, THIS IS NOT AS INTENSE OF A COLOR AND IT FLECKS OFF.",2.0
"This eyeliner started off great. Looked beautiful and was very easy to apply....however, after only about a month or two it dried out. Now it is very difficult to apply. I actually bought this product in 3 different colors and all 3 did the same thing - dried out! Now I'm stuck with 3 pot eyeliners that are hard to apply because it's so dry and doesn't stick to my eyeliner brush. Overall, do NOT buy this product. Buy the Makeup Forever brand!",2.0
"The eye shadow barely has a color, which was what I was looking for, however, it's more like face powder color than an eye shadow color, in that the hint of color it does have is barely noticeable.  I have fair skin, and you would think it would show up a bit more.  It does not.  ALSO, and more importantly, I found a thick black hair about 1/2-in long in my eyeshadow.  GROSS!  It made me feel like this was made in someone's garage, rather than a sterile environment.",2.0
Color and consistency of makeup was great but packaging is so poor and product made me break out :( love stila though!,2.0
"The product ""Stila Illuminating Liquid Foundation"" is incredibly watered down. Feels like you're putting paint on your face, as you actually feel it dripping down your skin as you apply. At the same time, it feels heavy and sticky once applied. That being said, I was quite surprised to see how flawless my skin looked after using it. But if you're looking for something that will wear all day, this isn't it.",2.0
"I thought that the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stila-Illuminating-Liquid-Foundation-10-Watts-1-Ounce/dp/B00021AN4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stila Illuminating Liquid Foundation, 10 Watts, 1 Ounce</a>&nbsp;would be better for me than my off-the-shelf foundation that I got at Walmart. The Stila foundation was on backorder, so I didn't get it with the rest of my shipment (which included&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stila-Illuminating-Powder-Foundation-Refill-10-Watts-0-34-Ounce/dp/B00021CJ6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stila Illuminating Powder Foundation Refill, 10 Watts, 0.34 Ounce</a>) I'd planned to wear the powder version over the liquid version. When I tried this, it looked too fake. I tried the liquid foundation alone with my Marutaki Rice Powder I got some time ago from the VT Country Store. Better, but still too shiny for my taste. I ended up sending it back.

Right now I've decided to wear (in this order) moisturizer, the Stila Beauty Balm, my Walmart liquid foundation topped with the powder version of the Illuminating Foundation. I top everything off with the Marutaki Rice Powder because it gives a nice matte finish. Sounds like a lot, but it works and looks really natural blended well.",2.0
"First complaint is that it doesn't come with a sponge. I don't know if this is a refill or what because I couldn't really determine from the listing.  Also, the color is decieving.  I have pretty light skin and this was too light.  It felt really cool going on, literally, cold which I actually really liked. It's expensive for the amount you get. I didn't use it longer than a week but couldn't see it lasting a month and I don't know about you but I don't need new foundation every month. Then again I don't really cake it on either. Overall, too expensive for what you get but the ""cold"" feeling when it goes on it kinda neat.",2.0
"I have heard nice things about this foundation, so I jumped at the chance to try it. However, I can't get the darned thing open and there are no instructions included other than that the compact is designed with an airtight seal and to twist lock clockwise to close. Logic would dictate that I would do the opposite to get it open. Not so, in this case. Perhaps the case is faulty on this particular compact.

Short of taking a hammer to it, I'm not sure what my other options are. I could take it to a Vincent Longo counter, I suppose. All I have to do is find one close to me. Seems like a lot of trouble, though.",2.0
Product received with the lid's snap in piece busted off inside the opening.  In order to use this product I had to cut a secondary hole and squeeze the product though this hole.  might be a great lotion but its hard to overlook the terribly cheap bottle with busted pieces.,2.0
"I bought this item, First time using it the tap where the cream comes out is busted. I had to open the bottle up and use my fingers. I really like this product but I hope next time it's not broken.",2.0
"Seems fine for my sensitive skin, but I don't like the smell. If it was fragrance free I might rate it better.",2.0
Goes on easy and dries quickly with a pleasant smell. Skin dries tight and skin feels dry. I wouldnt recommend the product.,2.0
This product possibly helped make my hair a little stronger but I didn't see any new hair growth. I used as directed.,2.0
Left my skin feeling extra dry after applying. I only used it because it had SPF in it and I had already bought it and didn't feel like returning it. I would apply this one and it would leave my skin feeling really dry so I would have to use a non-SPF moisturizer on top so that I could actually feel some hydration. I will definitely not be buying this product ever again.,2.0
Did not do much for me,2.0
Claims organic and natural but the sunscreen it uses is dangerous and brings other chemicals into your skin which is very scary.,2.0
Very expensive and leaves your face feeling oily.,2.0
no good,2.0
"I have very dry skin and his product made it worse. I suspect whatever makes this product avoid ""oiliness"" went a bit too far on my face.",2.0
"The moisturizer smells nice and clean, and feels smooth and not too heavy when applied.  I used it twice and broke out horribly, I typically have very clear skin.  I was using Kiehls ultra facial oil free lotion before this and am definitely going to be switching back. I don't have very oily skin, more normal-slightly oily but not dry, perhaps this is better suited for someone with dryer skin.",2.0
Made me break out :(,2.0
This was such a tiny bottle for the price. The product wasn't exceptional. Neutrogena is just as good for half the price,2.0
"After reading all the positive reviews, some mentioning the same condition I suffer from (red, super dry, flaky skin) I decided to try this moisturizer. Sadly, after 4 or so weeks: no visible improvement on my skin. It actually makes my face feel a bit dry. Go figure... I do like the fact it smells okay. Won't be buying again.",2.0
"Gave me an odd rash, even though it's supposed to be hypo-allergenic! I had to return it using it only two or three times. My face was red and heated after use. Back to using Clinique face moisturizer, which has never caused me an issue.",2.0
So light that it is almost useless for someone with moderately dry skin.,2.0
The actual product is OK but the packaging/container is defective.  This is very dangerous to be marketed as a baby product.  The tube cracks and breaks off on the sides leaving very sharp edges.  It left a deep scratch on my face so I would never use this on a baby!  That being said the product is nice if they found a better way to package it.  I ordered this because I like the idea that it has cold cream in it.,2.0
Very small and very expensive..,2.0
"Convenient product, but watch out for the packaging! As you can see in the picture I've attached, the plastic on the corners have broken off creating sharp, uneven edges. I'll be throwing this away and looking for something else now.",2.0
"I bought this with the sunscreen stick. I usually love mustela products, but these two are too small. the cream is rather thick so i had to spread it out on the face after applying, so my on would hate it everytime i try to apply",2.0
Way smaller than you think,2.0
I sent this product back because it didn't moisturize my lips or baby's dry lips and skin. Aquaphor Baby healing ointment worked much better on my newborn ' s dry skin. I thought the shea butter in this product would be great on my newborn ' s skin but the Mustela hydra baby lotion was better at hydrating her skin.,2.0
"I just tried this -- knowing there is a massive ""smell"" controversy about this brand.  Seems like a great lotion, light and applies without leaving a greasy feeling or chalky complexion.  Sadly, I agree with the detractors -- this stuff smells like the handrail at a nursing home.  And it doesn't fade.  Wait for the ""New & Improved"" version if that ever happens -- then you'd have a winner.",2.0
"This has some quality ingredients, but I actually think this drys out my skin; weirdest thing. It takes A LOT of this moisturizer to even get close to moisturized for me. The price is sky-high. I have purchased this multiple times and have tried very hard to like this. It's time to pull the plug. FYI, I bought this direct from Jack Black, not from Amazon.com.",2.0
Scent could be more manly.  The smell reminds me of something my grandma used when I was a kid in the 70's.  I like that it has sunscreen.,2.0
Great moisturizer but smells like old lady perfume. I only use it when I have a cold so I don't have to smell it.,2.0
don't like the smell,2.0
"I bought this after reading stellar reviews elsewhere. It does initially leave my face with a nice matte finish, and the sun block protection is nice. The smell is nothing strong  or offensive in my opinion. However after several hours of wear this ends up making my face more oily in comparison to when I do not use it. It is not the miracle face lotion some people claim it is, atleast not with my skin type. Couple that with the steep price tag and I would say overall not a good product for the money. If this was about twenty dollars cheaper it would change my perspective a bit.",2.0
It personally does not keep my face moist for more than an hour. I have to re-apply more than twice a day. Gold Bond has worked better than this for me.,2.0
"This product looks, smells and feels just like sunscreen.  It isn't moisturizer and doesn't effect dry skin.  It may help with sun exposure but save your money and use regular sunscreen, don't buy this if you're looking for a good face moisturizer",2.0
"I take back my original review after using this product consistently for over a month a started to break out bad. To eliminate other variables I only switched moisturizers and I stopped developing these large painful zits. This product contains an Algae extract which are stated to be very commondonic. My skin just didn't respond well to this moisturizer, but many others have had no problems so take a risk and see for yourself.",2.0
"I have very dry, sensitive skin, and am always on the lookout for a product that will do what it says, but not irritate my skin.  Well, after reading many positive reviews and articles, I decided to give this one a try.  It is expensive, but I was prepared to spend a lot to solve my issue.  When I received it, I did the usual cleansing and exfoliating (I use Simple wipes, so I know it's not them), and put the moisturizer on.  30 minutes later, my face had dry patches of flaky skin all over it. At first I didn't think too much of it, and just applied some more cream.  The next day, I tried again, and the same result happened.  It might be the SPF ingredient, I don't know.  However, for the price it is, I don't expect it to make my face even drier after it has been applied!",2.0
Doesn't really absorb into my skin. My skin usually feels drier than ever after.,2.0
"Unfortunately I had to return this.  The moisturizer itself felt a little thin as compared to other creamier moisturizers.  The first moment I put it on I felt something ""off.""  My skin got very red from the product, which means I was reacting to one or more of the ingredients.  The product smells like hot lather that you would smell in a barber shop when they go to shave your neck.  It is not overpowering and it does go away.  In addition to the reaction, it didn't do anything to make my pores smaller.  So, I returned it and went back to Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair.",2.0
"I purchased this first and foremost for a moisturizer, not so much for the sunblock.  Was disappointed with the ""moisturizing"" aspect as I've been using this on my face for about a week and my skin still feels extremely dry.  Regular nothing-fancy lotions seem to be a better job at moisturizing.

It's not a bad product, just expect to use it more for the sunblock not moisturizer.

Pros: Smell is pleasant and it dries quickly enough.  Doesn't leave your face feeling too greasy like most sunblocks do.

Cons: This is not a good moisturizer.  It may have some moisturizing aspects to it, but in my experience should not be used solely as a moisturizer.

I'll keep it around and use it when I spend time outside in the sun, but will be seeking alternatives for a facial moisturizers.  Think of this as a high-end facial sunblock.",2.0
"I love almost all Jack Black stuff.  Just not this Jack Black stuff.  I am not a fan of sunscreen in moisturizers.  Maybe its me, but the feel and smell makes me think I am putting on full blown sunscreen, not a moisturizer. I have tried other similar moisturizers including sunscreen with the same result (Loreal for Men).  I know the concept behind it is supposed to be good for us, but I have just not found a product that can combine the two without the ""ick"" factor.",2.0
"I really like their shaving cream, but this was not my favorite- it is pretty greasy and the tip always gets clogged every morning with a chunk of material from the past morning.  I would say look for something else.",2.0
Too sheen. Maybe another color will be better. Herd good things about this brand. Will purchase another to see. Looks different on my cheecks.,2.0
"The eye shadow barely has a color, which was what I was looking for, however, it's more like face powder color than an eye shadow color, in that the hint of color it does have is barely noticeable.  I have fair skin, and you would think it would show up a bit more.  It does not.  ALSO, and more importantly, I found a thick black hair about 1/2-in long in my eyeshadow.  GROSS!  It made me feel like this was made in someone's garage, rather than a sterile environment.",2.0
never did what it is supposed to do.didnt even leave my skin feeling soft.,2.0
"I love the shade Louisiana, but was unable to find it. Thought this might be close to that shade but was to light. If you know your shade ordering online is great, but if you don't it can be risky.",2.0
Smell too strong.,2.0
"Love Cargo, but this blush doesn't show up on my light/medium skin. Using the amount necessary for it to show up looks super cakey.",2.0
"This product is scented, I dont' care for the scent either. I would be wary if you are sensitive to scent. It feels nice on my skin but I'm not seeing much improvement in the post partum area beyond what you can expect over time.",2.0
Smells good but other benefits it claims? Not that I could see.,2.0
"I love the color and the product itself; it goes on easy and stays on for a good amount of time.  However, the container is absolutely ridiculous.  It seems petty to rate a product two stars because of the way it's packaged, but it really does make a huge impact.  I have a lot of product left but I'm considering throwing it out because I can't handle the container anymore.  It's impossible to open every single time and I can't count the amount of manicures I've chipped trying to get into it.  I would never buy this again based on the container alone, which goes to show just how much of a struggle it was.",2.0
The feeling is nice for this. Cream it actually makes your skin soft and smooth but didn't really saw any results fort stretch marks maybe becouse you are supost to use it for a wile I used it only for 1 month,2.0
"I had read a number of good reviews about this product, but when it arrived from this seller it had clearly been opened and the box was all mashed up.  I haven't decided if I want to even bother trying to return it.  I would recommend finding this item on sale somewhere else.",2.0
"I sprayed it on my wrist and the scent was almost gone instantly.  Then I sprayed all over and after 40 minutes or so, you couldn't even tell I had perfume on.  The fragrance is ok, if you can smell it at all.  It is just your classic fresh baby cologne with a hint of citrus.  I feel like I just bought some watered down perfume, or just tap water in a cute bottle.",2.0
"Smells good but doesn't last as much. On top of it, had some irritation from the product. I tried to return it but was unsuccessful in that attempt since the seller declined to do so...Will definitely check the return policy from some particular vendor before ordering from 3rd party in the future.",2.0
"im very addicted to baby smell. so i bought alot of perfume that indicated they're baby perfume. but this one, for me, the smell is too strong. not the smelling thats good for baby. and it doesnt smell like baby at all!!!!!!!",2.0
Disappointing...especially after reading all the great reviews. I purchased it for my children. It does not smell light or baby at all. It smells very much like a man's cologne. It's very strong. It actually gave me a headache. Returning it for a refund.,2.0
I love the smell of this product... but it caused my babies eczema to flair up and his skin to turn bright red and crack. The scent is quite heavy.. back to unscented products go,2.0
One of the straws inside the bottle is broken so the pump doesnt work.,2.0
Satisfied with the product. Latest delivery came with cracked top. Hope the product will still work and that future deliveries are not cracked.,2.0
"Is it just me I wonder after reading all the good reviews. It had a strong, not so pleasant smell. I was using Burt bees lotion before and wanted to try something new. Anyway having bought, I wondering what to do with it when an awesome Amazon customer rep helped me with the return and refund!!",2.0
The original lotion and shampoo I bought before from this brand smelled amazing but it is unfortunately and disappointingly not the same fragrance I thought I was buying,2.0
unfortunately I don't like the fragrance of it,2.0
"My daughter's pediatrician recommended this brand of lotions to me for my daughter who has eczema. It made her break out, although we have has success with the face creme made by Mustela. I don't care for the smell. It's a strong floral scent, like a natural one, it makes me think of a field of wild flowers. Or dandelions, I can't decide. If my daughter didn't have such sensitive skin, I might have given this a higher review.",2.0
My baby reacted to this. NOT GOOD FOR SENSITIVE SKIN\. I USE ADAN AND ANAIS ultra gentle lotion and it made his skin so sofg after getting allergies from this mustela which is not oeganic! Too many chemicals,2.0
This lotion may work really well but I never used it more than a few times on my child.  The smell is overpowering and gave me a headache just from putting it on him.,2.0
Too strong parfume smell for babies. I gave mine away.,2.0
"This lotion is supposed to be hypoallergenic but it has a fairly strong fragrance which, for us, defeats the purpose of a product made for sensitive skin. It's a nice smell, but unnecessary. It's also definitely a lotion - much thinner than a cream, and doesn't moisturizer as well as Aveeno or Eucerine baby products.",2.0
Scent is too strong and my baby is very sensitive to smells so I have to return it. I love the fragrance-free products from Mustela though and have been using them since my baby was born.,2.0
"I purchase mustela products quite frequently from Target, but now we have moved, and I'm running out of my products, and I have no target to go to! So i ordered online. Should have listened to the others who said it smelled bad. It does. It's over powering, and when you smell your baby with a poopy diaper, mixed with the lotion, it just reminded me of a litter box. And i haven't had cats for years..!",2.0
"I really wanted to like this brand, but unfortunately it caused my son to break out in a rash. The smell is okay, but not great. My baby did not react well to this lotion or the Newborn Foam Shampoo.",2.0
this lotion has a lot of good ingredients but is heavily perfumed. I put on my baby who has mild eczema and immediately noticed a whole bunch of red itchy patches within 5 minutes of applying the lotion to his body. not good for sensitive skin. i will still to his current moisturizer with no perfume. i might try the stelatopia.,2.0
"I tried this lotion becasue it was cheaper than the sletatopia cream and was hoping it would work with my daughter's excema as well. It has a very strong fragrance to it, and when using it on my daughter's excema it seemed to aggrevate it. I will stick with the stelatopia cream which I love!",2.0
"My son has eczema so I've tried very lotion under the sun. This product was okay for the first few days. The smell wasn't refreshing like the no rinse solution or the foam shampoo, but my son seemed to like it. After the 3rd day he started crying only when I put this lotion on him. It was burning his skin. This may work for others, but my baby's skin is too sensitive for this product. I have not had a problem with the other Mustela products.",2.0
I never used this on my baby.  After receiving the product I read the label and noticed it contains parabens.  This ingredient has been linked to being a carcinogen.  Although I'm not certain it is known to be it is still questionable and that's enough for me not to slather it on my baby.,2.0
"Very drying.  I used it and it dried my skin out.  Gave my infant dry, flaky skin too.  My sensitive skin toddler broke out in a rash a few hours after her bath,  this being the only new thing in her regimen.",2.0
Nice smell nothing more,2.0
Doesn't smell the same as it used to,2.0
"This is hands down the best baby wash on the market. My daughter broke out when we used other premium, organic brands, but as soon as we switched to Mustela, she was rash free. I feel like the price is great too because it is so thick that a little went a long way. The scent became what I associated with my baby, even though I continued to use it far beyond her baby days (she's almost 2.5 now) At some point last spring I stocked up and bought a couple bottles, so by the time I bought a new bottle this last fall (October 2016) I was shocked and saddened to open it and be immediately hit with the scent of an old lady's perfume... Totally overpowering and gross. (Note: I do remember buying another Mustela product when my daughter was a few months old and this was the scent it had too and I immediately tossed it. So the scent isn't new to the company, just this product) Either way, we have tried to get used the new scent, but we just can't. I have bought 4 or 5 bottles from random small stores hoping to find an old scent, but have had no luck. I wrote to customer service a few times, but never heard back. I have no idea why they would change the scent, but it's so bad now that we just can't tolerate it. Please bring back the old scent for this product! I have been reading similar reviews elsewhere so I know others feel this way.

If you buy this now, just be warned that the scent is STRONG. The product still seems to work well, but it's just not worth having my daughter smell like a 90 year old's cheap, bad perfume.",2.0
"Didn't like the fragrance of it, too strong, returned it",2.0
Didn't like anything about it. The smell was off putting for me and it didn't clean as well as I expected.,2.0
"I bought this because of all the reviews, but the scent is overpowering and too strong for a baby. It smells like it would be a men's product, which is not what I'd want my baby girl to smell like. Disappointed.",2.0
Make my baby had rashes in his body,2.0
Smell is too strong,2.0
I am an avid mustela user for me and baby. Mustela is my favorite scent in the world. This is not the same scent as other mustela products.,2.0
"I usually love Mustela but this product smells way too strong for sensitive baby skin.  I was looking for something more mild and natural for my 7 month old's sensitive and dry eczema prone skin.  The smell of this wash (while pleasant) is very strong and anything with this much perfume cannot be good for baby.  It smells like something a woman's department store brand would make. I am shocked this is a Mustela product.  More importantly, it has not improved baby's skin and I think it's actually made it worse.",2.0
"I bought this to replace the newborn shampoo/body wash that had run out, also by Mustela. Every other product I have by this company smells the same, fresh and clean. This product smells strong and grandmotherly. It was not what I had expected.",2.0
"I bought this product because it's supposed to be safer and healthier than other shampoos.  They leave out a lot of harmful ingredients that other soaps and shampoos include.  However, it has a very strong, unpleasant chemical smell. I couldn't get past the bad smell, so I bought a different product instead.
I won't be buying any more products from Mustela.",2.0

I thought that the fregrence will be more like the green tea perfume of Elizabeth Arden but it's not similar. Disappointing.,2.0
The smell of this deodorant is too strong for my taste. I just couldn't get past it. I would not purchase this product again.,2.0
I usually like Elizabeth Arden products over all but the green tea deodorant just did not work for me. It has a sharp fragrance that just smelled bad after application and did not last more than an hour.,2.0
"The smell of this deodorant fades throughout the day, along with its effect. Because it is a cream deodorant, you need to make sure you let it dry before getting dressed. Otherwise, it will rub off on your clothes and not work. It smells great, but it doesn't last.",2.0
The deodorant itself was fine.  The deodorant dispenser broke immediately.  The bottom part that you turn stopped pushing the product up the second time I used it.  I was able to pull down and push some of the product out the next two times I used it.  I used it about 4 times and it was empty.  I really don't think I used that much in 4 days.  I would not recommend this product due to the packaging.  It is nonreturnable through Amazon so I spend $10 on deodorant that I used 4 times.,2.0

"Definitely a stain -- wanted to use it as a cheek stain but it was too pigmented, not enough of a gel to glide onto my skin. It left streaky patches of color. When used on my lips the color was easier to apply and lasted about 2 hours.",2.0

When I draw the applicator out of the tube there is very little product on it. Only a little dry color goes on my face. I have to dip it in and out several times to get enough color to spread. I don't know if this is the way it is supposed to work or if I got an old drying tube of product..,2.0

I have used this product for several years and never had a problem. The color of the cream should be white. When I purchased this from you the cream was beige.

"I'm not sure this is the real thing.  Is it supposed to be tannish in color?

product and I am wondering if I got one.  It smells a little minty which is not bad.",2.0
"I have been using Stri-Vectin SD for several years.  It does make a difference even though after awhile you wish that it would do more.  But, if I stop using it for a period of time, I notice a change in my face and not for the good.  So I will keep with Stri-Vectin.  Word of warning!! This is an old product.  It is tan instead of white and contains peppermint or some other type of mint oil that causes your face to tingle, burn or itch.  I am still looking for the expiration date on the tube I bought a few days ago.  I should have known better..$53.00 as opposed to $135?  My bet is that this has been sitting on a shelf for several years. The seller was 101BeautyStore.  Not sure if I will continue to use this tube.  Even if you liked the product before they changed it,  I would be leery of an outdated product.",2.0
"I used this product as directed for stretch marks and also used it on my face. I went though an entire 6oz tube. It was an okay moisturizer... didn't notice much of a difference in fine lines but I don't have many to begin with. As far as stretch marks go, I had some very new ones appear and started applying this product maybe one week after. Not only did it not improve any appearance of the existing stretch marks, but several more appeared in the area. I am not saying it caused them to appear, but it certainly didn't help prevent them.
One thing I did notice about the cream was that there is some sort of dye in it that stained my clothing. It did come out in the wash, but it leaves me to assume that the cream doesn't do anything chemically to the skin and just tries to mask the marks with a dye, like makeup would.
I would have given one star, but I suppose it is a decent moisturizer. Not work the money though. If I were you, I'd try something different.",2.0
"i used this item for about 3 days now twice a day, morning and night.  when i first used it i thought it expired due to the tan look of it and the weird minty-ish smell. then i thought maybe that is how its suppose to be.  the second time i used it i notice a rash coming on on my thighs (i use it for stretch marks) and i thought that was weird since ive never been allergic to anything before or rashed up to anything ive used before. the rash wasn't directly on where i was placing the cream so i thought i would try again and i totally regretted it. now the rash has spread to both legs, its a little itchy and its forming where i put the cream.  it is only on my legs and i do put the cream on the hips too where i have other stretch marks and i haven't had any rash there so i will discontinue to use it on my legs and maybe even all together. i am disappointed in this product especially with the cost i bought it for. and it only lasted TWO DAYS for me. i suggest ppl test it out on a small area on your arm or something before fully using it. i wish i would of done that, even though i never get allergic reactions or rashes. best of luck to everyone",2.0
"I have been using this product exactly as directed since I received it in early January and I can say honestly I see no difference. The only plus is it starts out as a nice  moisturizer, but later seems to get greasy. I will not buy this again and feel very cheated by this company and their promises.",2.0
"After all the hype I expected at least some results, but found that after 30 days there was no improvement in lines and wrinkles, and in fact my previous product didn't make my pores as noticeable.  I will not continue using Strivectin-SD.",2.0
"Have been using this product for years and cannot do without it.  However, I just opened the package I received from you and it must be old or something.  When getting it out of tube it seem to seperate and I can't account for it unless it is old.  I do notice they have changed packaging and wonder if that is not the case with this.  Have never had this happen before.",2.0
"As soon as I opened the tube and began to place some of the cream on my hand/fingers, it was much more watery than any I had used in the past.  I am too lazy to return it to you so I am using it every night as always but with regret that I ordered it through the internet instead ofo the department store.

Sorry for the remarks but the truth hurts sometimes.

"I usually buy the new-packaging product however this item arrived with my last order. Whilst very moisturizing (which I can achieve for a lot less money) the efficacy of this product is greatly diminished from previous purchases. I can only imagine that an additional question needs to be asked when considering ordering this-Is this the original 'brownish' colored cream or the newly 'white' created product. Very disappointed in this product compared to previous purchases, an expensive mistake thrown into the garbage.",2.0
we knew there would be no good answer for old stretch marks. used this religiously for about a month and a week and saw no improvement at all. so i gave up. it was worth a shot though. i am glad other have had success.,2.0
"I had heard so many wonderful things about this product and how it helped the skin contour, removed fine lines, etc.
I have used it three times a day for a month with NO CHANGE AT ALL.  However, it is a nice EXPENSIVE moisturizer.",2.0
"Don't believe the hype around this product. Unless I happen to be one of the 7% who experience no results as indicated in the literature, this stuff did nothing for me...and I used it as directed. Revitol, Celrase, Nivea Q10...none of these cellulite/stretch mark creams work. The only products that have helped me are X-tend Life products from New Zealand. They take care of it all. I do not work for X-tend Life; I'm just trying to help other frustrated customers find a true remedy.",2.0
"I have used Strivectin three times a day for about three years. Being 45, I would have appreciated the disappearance of some lines or wrinkles.  However, there is absolutely no change in them with Strivectin. I find the claims to be bogus and I'm glad the FDA has been investigating them.

On the other hand, this moisturizer feels better on my skin than any other I've used. I love the feeling of it! Peppermint is what makes it feel cool but apart from that it is wonderfully thick and luscious on the skin without being sticky or oily.  Of course, there are probably moisturizers for a quarter of the cost that feel just as good. The problem is that most moisturizers are for women and contain scents that are supposed to appeal to women (although I cannot imagine how they would). Strivectin does not contain strong scent so it is suitable for men to wear.

Therefore I give this 0/5 stars for doing what it says it does - because the claims made for the product are bogus based on my experience. I give this product 2/5 for being a good men's moisturizer but it is way too expensive for a mere moisturizer so cannot be rated more highly than 2/5.",2.0
"I used this on some older stretch marks that I had and it did nothing for them. It is a great moisturizer, but way too expensive to use for that.  I ended up buying 100% unrefined shea butter and noticed a significant improvement in my older stretch marks and it moisturizes my skin all day from just one application.  Makes a great all over body moisturizer and you can even use it in your hair.  The unrefined shea butter is way cheaper and way more effective.  I would suggest buying the unrefined shea butter instead.",2.0
"I splurged and bought myself StiVectin about a year ago as a Christmas gift to myself.  A good friend of mine uses it and loves it and I swear I noticed a difference in her skin. Well, all I can say after my experience is it must work differently on different skin types.  I applied it every night and every morning for the past year (give or take a time or two).  Today I don't notice any significant change in my skin - either in the texture or the fine lines around my eyes, mouth and on my brow.  When I first started using it I broke out, too, around my mouth and on my chin (I'm 34 years old, btw).  It could be coincidental - after a couple weeks the breakouts stopped, although I do still get the occassional zit.  The smell isn't so bad - it is kind of strong but it wasn't offensive to me.  Anyway, if any of my friends were to ask me whether they should buy it or not I would probably not recommend it.  I've used Clarins products in the past and they work MUCH better for the price.  Also, previously to trying StriVectin I was using Aveeno products on my skin and my skin looked the same as it did while using StriVectin, only without the breakouts.

So there's my story!  As I said, my friend says it works great for her and from what I can see it does.  As for me, I will never buy this product again.",2.0
"I've been using it 2 times a day for 4 months. Unfortunately, i did not get the result it promised, even  though i am 30 yo and just started to get wrinkles. I think (hope) StriVectin gave some good to my skin overall, since it is full of great ingredients. However, i  cannot really see it.
The bottom line is it  was too expensive for me  (even though i found it for $95) for the result i got.
I plan to go with Shiseido next time. My friend got rid of wrinkles with it.",2.0
"As many other people I purchased this product expecting good results regarding firming and erasing wrinkles and I didn't see them at all.
Plus the fact that as somebody else said it smells horrible.
My personal recomendations with great results and for less money:
Redermic by La Roche Posay: is great to fill wrinkles,you just need to put a small ammount in the targeted area and you'll see!
And as a firming and moisturising cream:
Regenerist by Olay,smells great and is not sticky or greasy at all.
If you want to add a glowing look that erase sun or age spots,you'll be very pleased with Lumedia (but apply it before anything else).",2.0
It really smells horrible. And its kinda greasy. Didn't work for me at all and left my hair smelly.,2.0
"Works I guess. I so don't like the texture it leaves in my hair. The smell is weird. Don't leave it in too long as you shave your legs or something. After I put in hair and leave in for a bit, some kinda runs onto my face. It's a weird sensation, like a unpleasant residual film is left. Ick!",2.0
"Never again. I like the purpose of this, but I hate the residue it leaves on my hair. It just makes it look dirty. On the plus side, I like the smell.",2.0

"Normally love the product, but when it arrived I was VERY disappointed by the way it was packaged. The conditioner had leaked all down the bottle. It took me awhile to clean up the mess. It was shipped in a box that was too small and the conditioner was leaking everywhere, 1/4 of the product was wasted and I will likely have to transfer it to another bottle.",2.0
"This thing didn't make my hair feel smooth or nice. It made my hair tangled and feel unconditioned. It was not smoothing at all. The first time I tried it, it made my hair feel gross.

Now, I have this huge bottle of useless ""conditioner"" that I wasted my money on.",2.0
"First off I very highly believe that this is a fake. Due, to the smell and it's ineffectiveness. Because I have tried it before having bought it from a salon and it worked beautifully that time. This time not so much. If you find the real product it is great, just be weary of this seller.",2.0

For one it smells terrible and my hair was greasy and thin when I used it. I guess I'll just have to save up for the WEN. It's to bad because this is a BIG bottle and I don't know what to do with it, it would cost just as much as the product to send it back.",2.0

You can easily get refillable spray bottles that you pump up (commonly used as well for cooking with oils to replace products like Pam) and put spring water in them to get basically the same results.",2.0
Not what I was expecting.  It's like spraying water on your face.  Did I order the wrong product? Wish I read French,2.0

doesn't work as well as I had hoped it would.  Wet or dry hair - doesn't matter.  Does give some thickness but not that much.,2.0
Make hair thicker but does not feel natural !!!,2.0

"This stuff is just ok.  It smells nice.  It gets hard when it dries, kind of like hair gel, if you use too much.  I'm not sure it really makes the Toppik fibers stick better, or if it makes it so you don't have to use as much.  If it does, I can't really tell a difference from when I don't use it.  I purchased this stuff a year and a half ago, and I still have it.",2.0
"I was shedding more than usual from stress and decided to try this product. It made my hair feel and look great, but it also caused my hair to knot and then the knots/clumps would fall out. I thought it was part of my hair loss until I was traveling and did not bring this product with me. Sure enough, when I didn't use it, no knots and clumps. To be totally sure, when I got home I tried it one last time and it happened again. It must be because it is glue like. If you are having this problem while using this product, try stopping and see what happens.",2.0

I used varying amounts, pea to nickel-sized. Didn't matter. I give it 2 stars because it did make hair feel fuller (which is weird, since greasy hair is usually flat). I have very fine hair, and an oily scalp that needs to be washed daily. This just didn't work for my chemistry.",2.0
"For $30 the compact is TINY. Apparently it's 1 oz of product which is good. But this blush is awful and glittery. It's more of a blush topper/highlight than a blush.

"I have been using Dermablend for many years now and I must say, this is by far the best product in covering very dark circles like the ones I have. I tried this color because they were out of the golden bronze 41/2 that I usually wear. Amazon wanted to charge $57.00 for it, but I was out and couldn't wait for the shipment, so I went to Macy's and got it for $39.

This particular color,it's just too dark for me, although, I did find a way to use it when covering my dark circles. I know it's said to use concealer a shade or two lighter than your skin tone, but for me, what works is using a concealer that is the same color as my circles combined with orange concealer. It really blended well to my surprise. I like a lighter look under the eye, so I personally go over the top of that with just a little bit of a lighter concealer and then set it by lightly pressing in setting powder. This technique works great and a little of the Dermablend goes a long way, just be sure to ""warm it up"" first.",3.0

It is firmer than a normal cover-up and need to apply with applicator sponge.,3.0

Not worth the money or the effort.  They give you instructions. You must also buy the setting powder. You can get this coverage from drugstore products for five dollars.,3.0

I tried going with this product and it fell short of expectations despite reviews. It covers tattoo well but it smears,gets on clothes very easy. I tried blending with some setting powders, concealer to match my skin tone better and it doesn't hold. Instead, it comes off and tattoo starts becoming more exposed.

I will be going back to Tattoo Camo. I rather pay a little more to guarantee what I need rather than pay slightly less for less quality.",3.0
"The product has very full coverage, as advertised, but doesn't look the most natural on my skin (which could be caused by how flakey my skin is). Maybe do more research before buying this product if you have dry skin. I'll probably end up using this as a concealer, though it didn't look that bad as a foundation.",3.0
It's ok . I thought it would work better,3.0
"I couldn't even finish it - you only need something smaller than a pea size, which is great, but it's not forgiving, it won't let you layer areas that may have received a thin layer - not friendly with most loose powders.

This stuff isn't any better than Maybelline super stay concealer that you can get for around $8 bucks!,3.0
It's true that it requires some prep (apply to hand and rub to warm up for smooth application). It also requires a really smooth face as well. Any dry skin and this will highlight those patchy areas. I'm a low maintenance make up user so this is now only used if I really want a full face cover such as for events or when I know a lot of photos will be taken.,3.0
Application was more complicated than I expected.,3.0
I was looking for a replacement for the Estee Lauder Maximum Coverage foundation (they have stopped making the lightest shades). This was recommended to me as a replacement for coverage. It does not blend smoothly and does not last longer than a few hours. It's pretty for a little while but just doesn't do the job.,3.0
It has great coverage but it is visible and it makes it look like you have very dry skin. The color I got was also very light. I mix with a smoother darker color and its amazing. stays on all day and covers great. with the mix the dry look goes away.,3.0

"This is a good product if you are looking for nice all over coverage, as in a foundation. As for covering serious scars, acne scars or dark circles this product is not so good. I mean you do get minimal coverage but it does not cover flaws as the website portrays and it does not last all day, this is a product you need to reapply throughout the day. Also, this product reminds me of costume make-up, very thick and I feel like I have so much make-up on when wearing it. I was just expecting more from all the hype on their website.",3.0
Too dark for my skin tone.....will order a lighter shade next time.,3.0
it is ok.,3.0
Not as easy to use as the crme in the tube.,3.0
"I didn't use it on the whole face but apply little to cover flaws and spots only.  A bit dry and very hard to blend off, I personally prefer the five-way concealer wheel from Lise Watier which works better on me.  The good thing is, it's water proof and can wear it all day long.",3.0
like that it covers my redness on my cheeks but it doesnt cover my birthmark on my nose which is the whole reason why I wanted this foundation.,3.0
greasy as the day wore on.,3.0
"I needed to cover tattoos on my hands & ordered this product. I selected a color that was too light (my own fault). This product is probably better suited for minor scars/blemishes & not body tattoos. It is very waterproof but didn't fully cover my tattoos. Dermablend leg & body cover was a better choice for me after doing a little research, but this is still a great product.",3.0
"a bit dry, but coverage is quite good",3.0
"Terrific coverage, good color matches, but breaks my skin out in only one time wearing - within one use- pores might clog and get a small bump . I can wear a lot of different make ups. - so total bummer here. Does look like you have make up on if you don't use a really good bronzer or other color accent - or setting powder that has some warmth . Found it impossible to use in certain areas only - too perfect or thick. Had to use all over or not at all. Do recommend using the tiny spatula that comes with it - rub small amount on hand to soften - then blend into skin - sponge works well.",3.0
I bought the ivory and the brown color but they don't match with my complexion. However I mixed them and looks good.,3.0
"This stuff is a bit heavy and contrary to what it claims, it does wear off. The only good thing about it really is that the jar lasts for a long time, a year for me and it does work better than the covers one can buy at Target. Still, it's not what it claims.",3.0
"I purchased dermablend to help cover up some of my acne, unfortunately the product and my skin didn't mix together all that great. It didn't cover my blemishes all that well, and it just made my skin look cakey. I ended up returning the product, the return was super easy I had no hassle. Amazon sent me an email the same day I dropped it off for shipping and informed me my money would be back in my account within 2-3 days. So even if the product didn't work out as expected for me, customer service was still great.",3.0
I bought this to cover a scar on my face.  It worked well for that purpose.  The reason I am giving it only three stars is that it is so thick that it feels like I have a foreign object glued to my face whenever I use it.  I realize that to completely cover a blemish of any type ther needs to be substance I just was hoping for something less pasty.,3.0
"I didn't know that ""setting"" powder was needed to make the product last.  Also, very difficult to spread to get coverage.",3.0
"It works ok, but it's  hard to determine your shade when  you haven't actually seen it.  I use a lot of other products described as rose beige so I thought it would be the same, but it was a lot lighter.  And it is rather expensive.",3.0
"it goes on easily, covers well for first half of day.  later on it seems to have lessened in the coverage.  also i am a true medium beige skin tone but the medium beige cover creame goes on and looks way to light.  i have darkness on my upper lip and with this it looks like i have a white mustashe.  not good.  i have tried to put darker foundation and power over  it to hide the lightness,  with no success.  might be good if the color was closer to what i need.",3.0
"good product, excellent texture and it stays.
the only thing its that it's very difficoult to math the real color over the internet and i got it darker than i need it, maybe next time i'll get it right",3.0
The product arrived in record time and is as described. I would have liked a sample before I bought because the color is not right for my skin.,3.0
This color is not nude.  I read somewhere that it was the closest one to Joey New York's nude lip liner.  I loved that so much but can't find it anywhere.  I think Joey New York is gone.  The Joey New York NUDE lip liner was perfect for my lips and went on super smooth.  This does not go on as smooth.  I'm a little disappointed but glad I finally made the step to buy a Jane Iredale lip pencil since I'd read that it was good.  I will not being buying this brand again as others are similar if not better for the price.,3.0
very hard pencil have to line my lips several times before it shows. Expected more from this expensive brand,3.0
"The color is beautiful, no doubt about it. True to what was shown here. It's not as smooth as I'd like it (still little clumps in it) and actually expect it from the lip pencil that cost $15.00 and that's the reason I give it only 3 stars. I've recently purchased the whole set of pencils for like 22 bucks and I honestly cannot find a big difference in quality between these. It's also much shorter in length than the cheaper ones. The only reason I've bought this one (other than color) is to prove to myself that not everything that costs more is necessary of better quality either.",3.0
"I LOVE the color of this pencil and the fact that it has lasting effects. No need to constantly reapply. Unfortunately the pencil seems it may be old stock or inventory because it is extremely dry, therefore when u sharpen it you lose a great deal of the pencil due to it breaking at every attempt to sharpen. It's unfortunate because it's an excellent lip pencil and u waste more of the pencil than you actually use",3.0
"Jane Iredale PurePressed Eye Shadow. Jane Iredale is a luxury-priced maker of cosmetics and skin products, and apparently, there is, or was a real living Jane Iredale. The firm presents  a comprehensive line of mineral based makeup. The firm states that their mineral-based eyeshadow will enable the user to enhance the color and shape of the eye with  light-diffusing, highly-pigmented pressed eye shadow. That it is easily blended,  glides on wet or dry, stays crease-free. Safe for sensitive eyes. That pine bark extract protects and calms irritation while helping to condition the skin.

I had not previously been aware of Jane Iredale products, but my dermatologist does stock and sell the line. I assume this means she approves of it. Her assistant did give me a makeup seminar after Id had some work done, you know the drill. So, as is customary, I did purchase something: an eye shadow. Color: Mermaid, a pretty light green. I have two things to say about that eye shadow: it is ridiculously expensive to anyone not accustomed to buying luxury brands, and it is, in use, an eye shadow no different from any other in my decades of experience",3.0
"Pretty nice nude color, pinky brown with a touch of mauve. A little too light for all over the lip, makes me look dead. Dupe for zuzu luxe ""innocence"". Innocence is a little darker so i like it more. Also its soften, Spice is pretty hard. Spice contains Carmine, Innocence does not. These 2 pencils are the closest colors to my natural lip color so i see why people like it so much. My skin is light w yellow undertone, natural blonde, blue-green eyes. Ill keep Spice for outline only. When its all over the lips i feel weird sensation like i put lemon juice on my lips. Ill keep repurchasing Innocence",3.0

"jane iredale lip pencils break easily and have to be ground down quite a bit each time they need to be sharpened.  I have found this to be true of every lip pencil I have bought in this line of cosmetics.  For that reason, the lip pencils are way over-priced.  You lose half the product when they continually break and need to be sharpened by losing several layers in each sharpening.  Not worth it.",3.0

I have a big issue with all eye makeup making my eyes hurt. I had resurched what kind to use found that this one is recommended. It bothered me anyway so I sent it back.

I know I can't return it since it is a personal item so I guess I need to get really tan if I am going to use the loose powder.

I had high expectations for this stuff.  It is ok.  i have used it more as an acne spot cream.  When applied all over felt my face dry out.  Did not experience anything that was cured overnight,3.0
"This is my first review written ever. I have light acne thankfully but I do have a lot of scars from my previous years where I used to have cysts. Anyways, this cream feels sort of like a waxy texture. It smells kinda bad but nuthing too bad. Also I thought this cream would soak in but it just lies there on top of your skin so when I put it on night I can sleep in my sides. It does minimize the pimple but not really a huge difference. It doesn't seem to work on white heads just normal zits. In the morning my face looks kind of greasy but this hasn't broken me out thankfully. I don't think I'll repurchase sadly.",3.0
"This is a ok product. While using this I came across this product called the 2 minute miracle gel. I fell in love with it.  Me and my wife both used it. It was sold for 8 years on HSN shopping network. Google it yourself and see. I could not believe the results in one use!  This is a 5 STAR product. You can buy from this site: [...] If you buy retail its $50, but if you sign up under wholesale customer you can get it for $39.95.

Just to give some background information the company stopped sales of this product for a few years to reformulated the product by removing unnatural preservatives like parabens. Now its even better than before. The product is all natural.  Once applied to the face for 2 minutes it will take ages off, fade dark spots and make your skin feel so smooth like never before. Healed my acne in a few days. This is crazy! The best thing about this is their is no waiting period to see results. Its hard to believe what this can do. You will see immediate results just after one use. I liked it so much I wanted to share with others. It does not cause any burning, drying reddening, or irritation to the skin. During application you can actually see the dead skin coming off your face. Your face will be so smooth after one use and wrinkles aged skin will diminish the more you use it. This will improve any skin disorders, even acne. Continued use will show more results over time. You will be amazed after one application, trust me.",3.0

"It's been only a week since I started using this product, so far nothing new. I also didn't realize that the cream was so small.",3.0
"I've been using the PCA acne cream and face wash for the past 2.5 months. It seemed to really work well, in fact exceptionally well, for the first month or so. However, as is the case with most acne treatments, the results are diminishing.

I will say it is really pretty good for cystic acne. I have noticed though that it is causing small acne bumps anywhere I apply it. For cystic acne I would probably give it 3.5 - 4 stars, for an all over acne treatment it really doesn't do the job for me. However, it's important to note that this is an 'on-the-spot' treatment and not an all over treatment.

Like I said though, the big thing for me is that its impact has seemed to wear off over the last 3 weeks............unfortunately I will still be looking for something that works better for me.",3.0
Didn't do anything.,3.0

"I like the actual liquid that mists but the bottle itself leaks and the liquid builds up in the cap. So every time I open it, it pours onto my lap! It's very frustrating bc I want to keep it in my purse (I have it sitting up right and it's never on its side.)",3.0

I wanted something more buildable. I even used it with the coordinating mascara primer and i still couldn't get the thick lashes I was looking for. I do like If He Have airedale products but I probably won't be purchasing this again.,3.0
This is an ok product. I'm being more conscious about my make up lately and chose this brand. It doesn't have a wow factor but it does thexr  extension wait job,3.0
Being a fan of jane iredale products I had high hopes for this mascara. Besides it having no visible effect (it looked like I didn't even wear any mascara) it also started to crumble after couple of hours of wear. I don't know if I just received an old product but I'm very disappointed.,3.0
"Ok mascara, not as good as what it is made out to be.",3.0
i don't get along with the wand. the wand isn't really my favorite type but it also causes me to get mascara all over my eyes during application. it just doesn't seem to fit in my eye correctly to avoid it.,3.0
I wanted a more natural mascara without the harmful ingredients.  This doesn't really lengthen as much as I wanted it too.  i probably won't buy it again.,3.0

"Works, but not as well as traditional curler, brush doesn't seem to get hot enough to do much curling.
Will not replace my traditional eyelash curler.",3.0
It's not that it's a bad product but I definitely would recommend a change or two. I wish there was a guide for the top of the eyelashes otherwise your just pushing the lashes up.,3.0
This product will slightly curl your lashes but its no small of a difference it's not worth spending money. I'm back to heating a regular eyelash curler with a blow dryer.,3.0
"this seemed a miracle worker the first few times I used it and it worked great! no more burning my lids from my curler that I heated with my hair dryer
but it got less and less hot every time I used it and started to fail in effectiveness
too bad becasue i really loved the concept
just needs to be updated",3.0
Takes longer to use than manual curlers.  Or maybe takes longer to get used to using.  So for me it is better for special occasions rather than for every day use.,3.0
"I love the product, I just thought that the tube would be larger for the price.",3.0
it moisturizes well but I did not realize it had parabens in it until I checked the ingredients. Had it been paraben-free I would have given this product 5 stars.,3.0
"YuskinA works better than this which is it's USA distributed counterpart. This is thinner and the moisture doesn't last as long as YuskinA. But if you don't want to wait for a shipment of YuskinA from japan this is a good compromise. Use it on hands, face, feet, elbows, lips. I love the menthol smell.",3.0
No very moisturizing.  Prefer oil to this.  Use on feet only.  Disappointed.,3.0
Did not live up to the hype,3.0
"One thing I liked was that a very small amount can be used and it will spread into the skin easily. Also, the scent. But, it still carries a high price for such a small tube. It makes my skin soft, but does not stay long enough with the skin.",3.0
"Let's see...what can I say?  I have extremely dry skin.  I hate to face it but my skin is also older and getting a little crepe-like on the backs of my hands.  My skin is very fair, tends to freckle and doesn't like the sun.  So, I decided to try this lotion paired with cotton gloves.  Here is what I noticed.  The slightly menthol smell is not a problem because it fades rather quickly.  It does not interfere with any scent I might wear. It is thick which is okay.  One would expect a cream to be thick, right?  However, for me it is sticky.  Even after being left to absorb over night.  If that is a problem for you...you might want to take this into consideration prior to purchasing.  You know, for me, I think I'll just stick with plain old petroleum jelly.  I know, I know, but it really does work for deep overnight moisturizing!  I slather it on the backs of my hands and into my cuticles and put on the gloves.  I do this in the day sometimes too.  I was first advised to use it by my manicurist.  By the way, I also use it on my feet with a pair of cotton socks.",3.0
Bottle is not user friendly ( you have to squeeze hard to get the soap out). I don't see much difference in my skin tone/complexion since I started using. It has been over a month. One could argue that it is too early to rate this product but I think Its a 3 star product at the best.,3.0

"This shampoo is pretty mehh. I have super thick and wavy and oily hair, so i tend to try alot of different shampoos. When I got Baxter's Protein Shampoo I expected more of a high end product, but this is exactly like any other shampoo you can get at the groceries. The biggest con was the EXTREME MINTY smell (without the minty tingle). I was pretty bummed about getting stuck with this shampoo that im really not going to use.",3.0
"This shampoo comes in a nice pump bottle and has a pleasant smell. I usually spend $5-7 on shampoo that works just as well as Baxter. Given the high price, I plan on finishing the bottle but in the future I don't see myself buying it again.",3.0
"Highlight of this product is the pump on the bottle.  Makes it easy to dispense in the shower.  Downfalls are the price and the size of the bottle.  Upon dispensing Baxter of California Daily Protein Shampoo I was pleasantly surprised at the fresh and minty fragrance that came out of it but was quickly brought back to reality when the shampoo gave my hair a ""stripped"" feeling - basically gummy.  Overall I wouldn't spend the money,",3.0
"The impression I get is that Baxter's is a brand of super-premium toiletries no unlike Kiehl's.  If I had to liken it to a Kiehl's shampoo it seems closest to that company's Scalp Purifying formulation without the anti-dandruff component.  Compared to the Kiehl's then it is actually a little less costly.

This is a shampoo aimed for masculine use.  The first thing one notices is the strong minty eucalyptus component.  It smells great, but it's a fact men like this scent better than women like it for themselves.  Women prefer spices such as vanilla and florals like lavenders.  No problem, however, since being a man I really love the scent.  The other component of the mint is the strong ""tingling"" sensation it imparts on the scalp.  It's truly refreshing.  Be careful, however, as it isn't a shampoo you'll appreciate it it runs in your eyes!  Prudent application is a must, yet I love the smell and the way it wakes up the scalp.

Now for the critism.  This shampoo is still pricey and at 10 ounces isn't particularly generous in quantity.  Add to that that that it has a medium to lower sudsing quality and I find I actually use more of it than my favorite Nexxus Hydra-Light shampoo.  This is also more agressive in cleaning which for my daily use is somewhat drying, but may be just perfect for someone with hair that tends to be oiler or washed every few days.  For me it absolutely requires a post-wash conditioner to avoid both tangles and overly dry hair.

I must give it 3-star rating.  I love the scent, but have reservations over the criticisms for my personal use.  If one has a need for deeper cleaning it easily rates a full-star more with the last star being withheld only due to the fact that it's just a little bit on the pricey side given the quantity.",3.0
"This bottle of shampoo retails for about $14 for a small bottle of the shampoo.  This is about 3 times the price of the normal shampoo that I normally use, so I was hoping that it would perform at a much higher level than my normal shampoo.  The shampoo makes a lot of claims about being better for your hair, and I did not really see any difference in my hair after using this shampoo.  To be fair I have short hair so the effects may be different or non-existent for me but I was not overly impressed with the shampoo.

The Shampoo has a strong scent to it, and it has that tingling effect on your scalp.  The problem with the shampoo is that tingling effect reaches wherever the shampoo touches, including skin and neck.  It made my skin burn (not terribly, but noticeable).  You have to be extra careful not to get the shampoo in your eyes because it will burn them severely.

Overall I gave the shampoo three stars, it is an expensive shampoo that didn't seem to work wonders on my hair, and for that price I would have liked something that didn't burn.",3.0
"This shampoo is mild and pleasant but the fragrance is a bit medicinal - smells like mouthwash.  Kind of minty.  So if you want your hair to smell like toothpaste, this one's for you.",3.0
"My first impression upon opening the Amazon box is that this is a very small bottle of expensive shampoo. It's smaller than a regular can of Coke, and about 3x the price of my regular shampoo (Suave or Aussie, most of the time). Although I'm a woman, I used it today, and offered it to my husband to get a man's feedback.

Both of us agreed that it seems like regular shampoo - the first ingredients are Water (Aqua) and Sodium Laureth Sulfate, just like most shampoos on the market. The minty smell is nice, and it definitely cleans the hair and scalp. It did a good job on my husband's oily scalp (he's got a buzz cut so not much hair to test it on), but over-stripped my normal hair. We both liked the pump on top, which makes it easy to dispense in the shower, but we both felt this product is overpriced when compared to our regular shampoo.",3.0
"This shampoo is featured to do some nice stuff, but there is just one problem: it is irritating. It did not irritate my scalp, but my eyelids and neck started to burn seconds after this shampoo made contact with those parts. It did not get into my eyes, but I hate to imagine what it would have felt like if that did happen. The burning sensation went away several minutes after rinsing it off. As far as my hair and scalp are concerned, it did a very good job cleaning, perhaps too good. My hair seemed dry but no worse otherwise. I don't know what ingredient caused the burning sensation, maybe the peppermint oil. The scent was fine. I do not really recommend this product over other more suitable ones.",3.0

The plastic bottle is so hard to squeeze the product out that it makes it so difficult to use I'm going to switch to Jack Black's face wash.  (Which is equally good as a face wash.)  As it is now, you will have to put the face wash into a different bottle that you can squeeze out what you need to use.  (So now it's a throw away bottle that gets no use!)  I love the product...but please Anthony, switch back to the old bottle.  Super design and usability fail. :(",3.0
Works like any other facial cleanser in my opinion. It's really watery too. I think Anthony Logistics products are worth spending the extra money on with the exception of this cleanser. Save your money and just get a cheap cleanser and use their other products.,3.0

While I suppose my use of it doesn't qualify as a very scientific study on the matter, I found during the time period that I began to use this less desirable face conditions than when using the product I previously had been using. No reaction or anything like that occurred, but I think if you would feel the texture of this solution you would agree probably not best of skin that tends to get oily.",3.0
"Okay ... weighs hair down and makes it look dirty, especially blondes.",3.0
it hold your hair and style well but it makes your hair stiff and hard and not natural looking it. also it flakes,3.0
"I had thought I was getting their humidity control but I bought this by mistake.  It works the way it should, it's just a litle crunchier than the other kind I was using.  I will switch back once this is used up.",3.0
"I have used a number of Ouidad  products but, I found this one too heavy for my hair. My curls were weighted down by this product. I may try diluting it with water and spraying  it to refresh my curls after sleeping on them.",3.0
"This held my curls together without feeling overly crunchy.  Good of you like the ""wet"" look.  Climate control gel will give you a softer hold.",3.0
The smell on this product is terrible!  Reminds me of a dentist office and actually makes me a little nauseous.  It also left me hair hard and sticky.  I would use it only as a hairspray and keep using my other curly hair products (different brand) for everything else.  It has nice hold.  The smell alone is enough for me to never buy it again.,3.0
Doesn't smell that great but helps if you have hard water and blonde hair,3.0
"Its for curly hair and mine is straight. I didn't notice in the description. Works okay, but with the price I was expecting more. VO5 clarifying works just as good for much less $$.",3.0
"I bought this shampoo as part of an Ouidad kit. I have fine curly hair that knots easily, but tends to be dry. As a result, I only wash my hair a couple time per week, though I use conditioner way more often.

This is probably one of the better shampoos that I have used for curly hair. It really doesn't create as much suds and my hair did not feel as dry or get oily more quickly. So as far as the essential part of the product goes, it works for me.

The scent, however, is AWEFUL. It is the worst smelling shampoo I have ever used. I think it smells like sandlewood. I realize some people like that smell, but to me it STINKS. And it doesn't go away. I washed my hair with the shampoo two days ago and I can STILL SMELL IT.

If you don't mind paying for it (it's not cheap) and you like sandlewood or have damaged olfactory senses, this isn't a bad shampoo for curly hair. If you are smell sensitive, don't waste your money.",3.0
not so good,3.0
"I know a lot of people swear by Ouidad products, but for some reason they just don't work as well with my 2c/3a hair as the Shea Moisture Curl & Shine line of products. I felt like my hair tangled more easily after using this and that it was more harsh on the hair and scalp. It could just be my hair, but I won't be repurchasing.",3.0
"I have curly hair, so I'm always trying out new styling / management products.

This shampoo seems fine, but I can tell absolutely no difference between using it and using a cheaper ""Moisturizing"" shampoo. I'll keep looking for other sulfate free shampoos in other brands.",3.0
"I got this because it's doesn't have a lot of the chemicals that can be harmful in pregnancy. So for that, it's good. But it doesn't lather well at all, and I felt like my scalp wasn't as clean. Still, I was grateful it had pure ingredients. I probably wouldn't buy this again, I'd look around more.",3.0
"the shampoo is ok. It really does its job, but  for my hair texture, which is a kinky 4c, my hair was rock hard when i put that shampoo on my head. i could not comb or even try and put my fingers through my hair. It can work well for other looser hair texture probably, but not mine. other then that if your looking for something to really clean your hair and get all that dirt out, its a pretty good product.",3.0
This wasn't the worst conditioner for my curls but for the price I was expecting my hair to have less frizz,3.0
"don't get me wrong...this thing smells lovely! also it aids in detangling my hair in the shower as I comb through after applying this, but as my hair dries, so does the look of my hair. It makes it look thirsty and parched! even though the other reviews say its left their hair amazing, not for me! So on I search for something my locks will love! It's been a search for me for about (hmm...all my life?!?).",3.0
Great moisturizer for curly hair.,3.0
"Makes hair look dirty, especially if you're blonde. Use sparingly. Very.",3.0
After reading great reviews of these product for curley haird peopel I gave several products from the line a try.  I haven't been impressed with a single ine of them.  I have very curley fine hair.  I received better results by using several Redken Conditioners alone.  I only shampoo about once a week but I condition everyday and comb it through using the conditioner to cleanse.  I live in Florida and this stuff just didn't perform.,3.0
Nice product works for my thick dry hair helps make it shiny and a little silkier,3.0
"This conditioner didn't rinse through well and left lots of tangles, but worked well to keep curly hair bouncy and not flat.",3.0
"I am Caucasian with curly hair.  This product does an okay job of conditioning my hair, but I much prefer other products I have tried.  My hair feels dry and course after I rinse this product out.",3.0
"There's nothing wrong with this conditioner -- it's totally fine. It does the job.

I have dry, curly black hair that's stripped and color-treated, and frizzy, so I'm careful and selective about picking products that serve my hair well.

This does a great job, but I've used other products at cheaper prices that perform just-as-well. So while I have no complaint about this product's performance, I just think that you can find better values elsewhere.",3.0
"I think this could be a great conditioner for certain curls... Of course it cannot work for everyone! My hair is mostly curly. It's has some wavy sections, but my biggest concern is the frizz. I live in a humid climate.  The conditioner definitely helped with the frizz! But it seemed to almost flatten my waves, to make them body-less and almost straight. Maybe its too heavy for me, but i never thought that could be possible because my hair is SO this and naturally dry. Seemed like I lost volume when using this conditioner. This could be great news for the right kind of curl, but for me it was just ok",3.0
It's ok but the spray is kinda hard and sometimes jammed,3.0
"Bottle was leaking, its broke I guess so I have to transfer it to another spray bottle.",3.0
I think reg hairspray works just as well.,3.0
I'm not satisfied with the toppik fiberhold,3.0
"This product probably does the same thing that plain old hairspray does (holds hair in place), but I'm not sure if it really holds the fibers in place because even after applying, I still can see the fibers on my hands after touching my hair.",3.0
thanks,3.0
I don't have anything negative to say about this product except to say that I believe a good regular holding spray can achieve the same results.  I have a can of hair spray at work and that's exactly what I use after applying Toppik and it gets the job done.  I wish I had thought of that prior to purchasing this product.,3.0
I didn't like the puffer very well...liked to sprinkle better...had better control.,3.0
"This was kind of just like a very light hairspray.  The pump that I received was not working properly so I had to pump the bottle about 15 times just to get it started.  It does help to keep the fibers in place a bit, but it's not totally necessary.  It also hardens your hair somewhat without really helping to stray hairs in place.  No longer using.",3.0
It is just a hair spray.. don't expect more than that.,3.0
"The tops to these things are absolute crap. The product itself is great, but the tops are just trash.",3.0
Works well but not great,3.0
"Not bad but it makes your hair hard all day, what you comb in the morning is what stays all day.",3.0
wrong color ... not sure if this work...,3.0
"This is esentially just hair spray. It smells pretty good, but does nothing more than a normal hair spray would.",3.0
Doesn't hold hair as i was expecting but still good and it doesn't smell bad,3.0
I'd have liked it better if it was unscented. The scent was somewhat masculine.,3.0
Love it...smells good,3.0
i'm not sure it work holding the fiber in.  It's more like a hair spray.  I would buy the fibers again but maybe not the spray,3.0
"In my experience Toppik stays in very well without the need for this spray, so the spray just makes your hair stiff, which I don't like.

If you already use hair spray frequently, and are used to ending up with quite stiff hair as a result, this may be fine for you.

If you prefer not to have stiffened hair, then I'd recommend skipping this hair spray, and just buying more Toppik fibers so you can reapply more frequently.",3.0
Works pretty good.. Doesn't make your hair as stiff as the Cabooki hair spray. However the sprayer broke the first time I tried to use it and I had to put in an another spray bottle,3.0
Wonderful color but had glitter in it.  Gave it away,4.0
"I just bought this color and tried Infinite Shine for the first time. I am blown away! I had to come and leave a review.

Pros: it's a thick polish that is very easy to manipulate. It's INCREDIBLY shiny- I have been doing my own gel nails at home with a gel light for years and this polish looks the exact same as when I do my nails in gel. It dries fast; I painted my nails with the 3 steps and 30 min later it's totally dry. I also love the color. It looks a lot like You Dont Know Jacques.

Cons: None yet! I will check back in to see if it truly lasts the 7-10 days as advertised.

Update 11/1/15- Sadly, the product does not last that long. I've tried two separate colors and it only lasts about 3 days before it starts to chip. Definitely better than a ""regular"" top coat, not nearly as good as my gel nails at home.",4.0
The color is great. The polish is somewhat thinner than I thought it should be.,4.0

"The color on this is amazing. I like the shade.

Like others, I did have some bubbling the first time I applied. You have to do very thin coats to avoid this.

The lasting power is pretty good. I seem to chip my right pointer finger no matter what except for when I had a pro apply this. I'll change this to a five-star review if I can get that finger to last more than 2 days.",4.0

"This polish is more of a light robin's egg blue than the turquoise shown on my computer screen. Goes on nice and smooth- you can almost get away with only one thick coat, but I recommend doing 2 coats. Dries quickly and stays on for about a week with the OPI top coat.",4.0
"I love this nail polish and really don't understand the bad reviews! It is the first polish I've ever used that stays on more than a day or two, and I only have to re-polish because of the new growth line! My only complaint is with the color selection, but I'm sure that will be expanded soon. I'm in water and scrubbing and cleaning and taking care of babies all day, 5 days a week, and this polish lasts 7 days. It only wore off on the edge of my longest fingers. I'm sure if I applied a second top coat a few days after the initial polish it would wear even longer!",4.0
Good product!,4.0
"This is the perfect color! It's a little more than just a clear coat, but doesn't show too much when it chips.",4.0
"Doesn't add ""shine"" per se but it does protect as a top coat. It seems to pick up a bit of the color so pretty soon the brush is the color of your nail polish. But it lasts pretty well. If it provided more SHINE I would have given it 5 stars. If you are not a fan of bling then this is the top coat for you.",4.0
This is a very light neutral shade that will work great for anyone and any outfit.  This could even work ok for a french manicure too.,4.0

"I love Opi products, I can't even tell you how many bottles I own. Pink is my favorite color so I have countless variations of it. I did not like this color as much as I thought I would. It's too light, even with muliple coats. It's a got a real creamy bubble gum pink look to it. I prefer either a natural pink or a dark pink. It has a very youthful look to it. The quality of course is that of all Opi. Goes on smoothly and starts chipping about a week after I apply it.",4.0
Works very well,4.0
"This is really pretty color, however, the color is not as pictured. The color swatch on the item reads more blue wear as the actual color is more green. Very pretty but not as expected. SO this is a happy and sad review.",4.0

Nope, it's got a pretty obvious purple hue to it, just enough to make my skin look anemic. It's a very pretty color and shimmery. If you are a pale Irish girl like me though, you will stick to putting this on your toes. Shipped pretty quick and polish is in excellent shape. I've ordered some on here that have arrived clumpy and obviously not stored properly.",4.0
"OPI top coat is a work house I've been using for years.  Thick and glossy, with OPI top coat my mani lasts for a week.

The disadvantage is that it dries slow, it takes at least an hour to dry.  You can buy the little drops to make it dry faster.  I keep it on my collection for times when, unlike seche vite, I need a top coat that can be used over dry polish.",4.0

"I got the Little Teasers set and have now used three of the four colors that came in it. ""Rising Star"" is a thin-applying, coppery orange with glitter so small it appears as shine. The color, like most OPI, goes on easy, but I did decide to use three coats instead of two to get the desired intensity. It is not a pigment intense color. It is, however, quite striking and even though I got a lot of ""that's orange, Kat"" I also got a lot of ""it looks really good"" along with it, often from the same people. Men seem to like this color; women are also intrigued. Seeing as how it is autumn right now, this is a good color to wear. It is not too bright or shocking, so it is good to wear with any color; as your fingers turn the shine really kicks in.

I would recommend this for any time of year. I will probably not buy a regular-sized bottle of this, but I will definitely use up the tiny bottle that I have now and wear it with delight.

And if you have henna in your hair (as I do) it matches beautifully.",4.0
"I bought this nail polish because I had gotten the same color applied at the salon and I wanted to do touch ups at home. It is a noticeably different shade than the color of the nail polish the salon applied, even though it's the same brand and color name. So it's actually only a good idea if I take it with me to the salon for them to apply and then do my own touch ups at home. I like the color of the nail polish and I think that OPI is the best brand because it stays on for a really long time compared to other brands. It's rather expensive but worth it because of the quality.",4.0
Excellent subdued color and OPI quality.,4.0
"Color is a tad darker than I expected, but still nice a bright.  Glides on easily and doesn't chip excessively.",4.0
"The best way to keep it from chipping, or peeling off, is first use mild polish remover on nails to get any oil or dirt off (I have also been told to rough up the nails abit every other week (use a buff bar and use the even out side but do not push hard or do for to long.). After I use the remover and let the nails dry, I use a good base coat, one that helps hold the polish.  I let the base dry for 10 min's or so, then put on 1 THIN coat and let it dry 20min's or more then Put on JJa second Thin coat of the polish. After 20+ min's I put on a good top coat, which protects the polish, gives a nice shine and takes away that sand paper feel. You need to put on thiner coats and let it dry longer between coats when using glitter polish.  Also it helps to use 100% acetone remover, got mine at Walmart, to make it easer then reg or even normal acetone polish remover.
Also, you can use a thin coat of colored polish after the base coat and under the glitter to give a little more depth.  With this glitter you can use almost any shade.  Such as bronze, red, blue , purple, etc.  Use light, dark or anything in-between.
Sapora for OPI also makes some nice glitters.",4.0
I love the color the only problem is that it tends to chip easily & instead of  chipping off small pieces like normal paint will do it come off the entire nail at once.,4.0
This is a beautiful neutral shade. Looks great on all skin tones.,4.0
"I had this put on at a salon and loved it..but like others in the review found it peeled off or chipped.  when I did need to remove it, it took numerous cotton balls and remover to get off...gritty texture....why is it 2x more expensive than other OPI products? Or even other nail polish from Burlesque line?",4.0
"The real thing and the seller promptly sent the product with a free Winnie the Pooh nail file (nice touch).  Unfortunately, it was put into a padded envelope, which might be good enough if mailed in the States, but I am currently working in Iraq so maybe the added shipping (military postal service) made it worse, and it came broken at the neck... a little was left so I was able to use some:( Next time, I'd put in a small box, with padding to ensure safe delivery.  Otherwise, nothing negative to say.",4.0

I am all about bling and this polish doesn't fail in that department.  It has all the colors in the glitter.  Not just browns.

"I loved the whole OPI burlesque line, and this seller by far had one of the best prices I cam across for this polish.  The colors are fun, festive, happy, and sparkly.  My only complaint about the polish is that once it dries on your nail, its not a smooth polished finish.  It is rough and grainy because of the glitter pieces.  Thats my only peeve with it.  It doesnt bother me so much on my feet as it does on my fingernails, but for the look, I'll bear it for a few days.",4.0
"I love glitter nail polish of any kind and even though this didn't appear to be the same color as the picture shows, it is still a pretty color.

This is a great polish but I prefer more of a pinkish nude called Passion for everyday ""go-to"" polish. The Passion is much more forgiving for errors since it is lighter too.  This is definitely a nice change and I will wear it often. I can see it going well with both casual and business casual. It is a nice, becoming shade that would work with any skin tone.",4.0

"I have a professional manicure once a month. In between times, I do my own nails. My nails are well conditioned and the professional manicure keeps my nails in top notch condition.

I noticed years ago that my manicurist always applied a base coat that acts as a layer to receive the nail color I want. Some base layers are glossy, I prefer those that are not. This Opi base is perfect. I start by applying  one coat to my left hand and then by the time my right hand is done, the left is ready for the nail color. The base is a necessity for me, and keeps my manicure you'd for at least a week. I usually use only Opi and Essie products, so I do know that I am using quality products.

"I've been using OPI Start to Finish for quite a few years.  It's not cheap, but it's the longest lasting two-purpose product I've found yet.  In the past year, OPI introduced a ""formaldehyde-free"" formula, and since I've always read how bad formaldehyde is for our nails, I tried it. At some point while using it, I started having problems with my nails peeling! It was horrible. It never occurred to me that the ""healthy"" product could be the cause, so when I ran I out, I bought a second bottle.  The peeling problem continued, and finally the light bulb went off.  I went back to this ""Regular"" formula, and guess what?  The nails are healing.",4.0

"Great formula, nice and even color that wears well.  I'm not super crazy about the color because it looks a bit weird on my skin tone which is the only reason I took 1 star off. I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere and don't have access to many Opi polishes. While I tried to research swatches via the Internet of this color before I got it, the images never match up to what you see in person.  Still like the color just not lovin it.",4.0

"I find it a little weird that the nail polish isn't sealed. I'm not sure if all OPI nail polish's don't come sealed, or if it's just the ones sold by Amazon but it makes me feel like the product has already been used. Maybe it's just my imagination but it did seem a little empty. Because of this, and also because it chips easily (started to chip after 24 hours), I give it 4 stars instead of 5. As far as the nail polish goes though, I absolutely LOVE the color so much (Over the taupe). It's perfect! This picture doesn't do the color justice.",4.0

If you do not have a nice coat of completely dry base, your natural nails will dry out and become brittle!

I swim 12 hours a week and the polish still goes 2-3 days without chipping, which is impressive considering that without the top coat it chips quite a bit after 1 day. Overall, very nice top coat! I'd suggest getting a pack with the base and top coat. It doesn't seem to work as well with other base coats for some reason.",4.0

I had hoped for something a little more coral - this is almost orange. Still cute.,4.0
Very nice,4.0
"I got this as a base coat, and for that purpose it works really well. It's easy to apply (the brush is easy to use) and dries to a matte, translucent white coat. Nail polish glides smoothly over it, just as I was expecting. It protects my nails from dark polishes and prevents my nails from chipping easily. I'm unsure of how different it is than other regular base coats, but I really like and recommend this product.",4.0
Really pretty and goes on well just not sure if it is authentic because of the shape of the bottle and the writing is a little different than my other opi nailpolish.,4.0
"Love Love Love Opi. Great consistency, easy to apply, professional finish and very long lasting. The reason I gave this four stars is that I think it's very very slightly sticky. The other top coat I like to wear sets hard and is very smooth to the touch. This seems like it's about 99% dry/hard. It's ok. I will use it on my toes.",4.0

"This is a great topcoat.  With the addition of drying drops, it dries quickly and doesn't chip easily.  My manicure lasts a week if I use rubber gloves for dishwashing and cleaning.  The seller is another matter. Salonwholesalers agreed to cancel my order and then shipped it anyway.  They told me they would combine shipping for another item, but they didn't tell me how to get combined shipping.  And their shipping is slow.  They got the order the same day another order to the same area went in.  It has taken 3 days longer.  I can't figure out how to rate this seller any other way.",4.0
"I'm not sure if I got a 'bad batch' or what, but this color looks a little more purplish than it looks in the picture. It's still a pretty color, especially since spring just arrived and summer will be here before we know it. Other than the hint of purple that I am not crazy about, this nail polish is wonderful. It goes on very smoothly and the brush makes polishing your nails very easy and like you had a professional polish them. It stays on your nails without chipping or flaking for a lot longer than most other nail polish does, too. It's a great quality product.",4.0
My favorite color. It's not too fancy but not dull either. I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.,4.0
"I got this in Berlin There, Done That, and I absolutely love the color.  It is that almost industrial greige with a hint of lavender.  The polish itself applies smoothly and is a two-coater for opaque coverage (possibly a one-coater, depending on the look you're trying to achieve).  The brush is typical and the shape of the bottle and handle are pleasing enough.  I deducted a star because this chipped in fewer than 24 hours, and by Day 3, I had to take it off as there were countless chips and a few stress lines.",4.0

Beautiful brown color that is neutral.  One of my favorite shades by OPI.,4.0
"This wasn't the color I wanted from the POTC collection, but somehow I ended up buying it anyway. I chose this over a lilac by Essie, which was more along the lines of what I was actually looking for. While I do like some shades of the purple family, I'm not huge on purple-purple in general. I took a chance thinking it might be a fun color, though I was really expecting to dislike it. It is a bright color, but not nearly as overwhelming as some purples out there. It worked well with my skin color, I figure because it has more blue than red. I guess it turned out to be the super purple polish for the non-fan of purple. =-)",4.0
"I like the OPI top coat polish. It is glossy and it does protect the color underneath. I only wish that the top coat felt more hard and less likely to get nicked. It feels like nail polish if you use a fingernail and touch the top coat. It doesn't give a feeling of hard protection like I thought top coat should do. I don't even know if I'm making sense here. Anyway, this is a good top coat. Certainly better than others that I've tried. So I'll stick with it for a while. It does seem to take a long time to completely dry.",4.0

This base coat helps to prevent nails from becoming yellow as well as to easily remove the nail polish (i tend to use reds often)...,4.0
"I have very weak nails and they peel all the time so when I learned about this product I decided to give it a try. What a diference it makes. Before I apply nai polish, I use this as a base coat.  This is great to keep my nails strong for a week. Just make sure you use it all the time.",4.0
"This is a great natural base coat. By natural I mean that when you apply it on your nail it is not shiny and you can barely see it.
I have not experienced staining while using it which is a big plus! And I also feel that it makes removing nail polish easier, like if the color was only sticking to the base coat and not your nails.
One of the thing that I was looking for in a base coat is less chipping but I didn't see any difference. It is not bad, it just wasn't better than without base.

Pros:
-Good quality
-Prevents staining
-Natural look
-Easy removal

Con:
-No chip prevention

I recommend!",4.0
I definitely love the brand Opi but this product did not work well for me.  I have extremely thin and peeling nails so it is very hard to find an item that does produce good results. This particular nail strengthener works just as well if not better than other brands I have tried.,4.0
I like it but it's not the color it looks on line. It's more of a dark purple/gray. I was looking for a dark blue/black. It's a pretty color just not what it seems.,4.0
"So I bought this because I saw pictures of how pretty it was. Product came fast and in perfect condition, however the product itself chips very easily and within two days of applying it it needed to be completely redone. I've found that most opi chip easily now, so buy it if you don't mind multiple coats to keep up with it!",4.0

I have to blend two colors to match my skin. But I have to use so little of it to get good coverage that I can afford to have two. They last an extremely long time because so little is required.,4.0
"I have light skin with some imperfections. As I age, I find that my skin tone is uneven, and I have capillaries that are visible as well as some dark spots on my face. I wasn't quite sure how this product would work for me.

It comes with a spatula, but instead I moistened my fingertips and applied it as I would my normal foundation. I was quite surprised and impressed by the coverage as I blended it. Since it comes hardened in the jar it was not as easy to apply as a liquid is, but warming it with the fingers seemed to help the spread. I dotted it and blended on my brown spots and it didn't seem to cake but looked fairly natural. I was very pleased with the outcome.

So why only 4 stars -- well, the truth is that the hard product in the jar isn't that easy to use. I didn't use the ""scoop"" and just twirled my fingers in the jar. It would be easy to overdo this. It is essential to get the right color for your skin and there is a handy chart on the website to use. I was thinking that a sponge might help with application, but I find that those just waste a lot of product. I also use a powder to set it. It is definitely thicker than my usual make-up and it's important to apply thinkly to avoid the ""caked-on"" look.

Overall, I do like the foundation and I will keep using it. No hypersensitvity reaction nor increase in blemishes noted.",4.0
"I got it for my Mom- she likes the coverage it provides, although it's a little darker than I expected.",4.0
Works great. Nice color. Does what it is supposed to do. Long lasting.,4.0
"I give this 4 stars because once I learned how to blend it, I really loved it, but like most people say- if you accidentally touch your face, consider that area gone.

Im a nurse, and decided to wear this to work one day (because it was new and of course I had to wear it the day I got it, to see if I liked it) and by the end of my shift, it was so splotchy. I don't full on sweat at work (most days) but thats what it looked like- makeup that had been worn and sweated through. At one point I had to wear a mask for a procedure, and just the mask barely touching my face pulled all the makeup on my nose and cheeks off.

Also, this product is very thick and dry. I have to use the spatula to scrape it out & apply it in dots all over my face. Then I take a brush and blend it, then go over it with a beauty blender. It eventually is a very nice, full, even coverage, but it takes some work. I also noticed I cant really use primer or setting spray because it will cause that sliding of the product to occur.

I use the setting powder and press it into my skin with a beauty blender (it didn't work well with a brush for me), and then I use the pressed powder over the top. The other way didn't work for me.

Overall, I like the product and it stays on nicely for me if I do all of the things I mentioned, its just not good for me if I don't follow the tricks Ive learned, and it seems to be different for lots of people.",4.0
"This product provides great coverage. Maybe a bit too much. I found that it was very thick. It is also lighter than I expected and you could notice the difference between my neck's skin color and my face's.

I am a bit sensitive to certain products, but this foundation did not irritate me at all.",4.0
product as advertised,4.0
"Similar to a foundation makeup cream but much stiffer, so not too easy to spread. Yet this consistency also keeps it from melting or running in the heat. It has a high SPF of 30. As a sunscreen I like it best as applied to the nose and cheekbones. To get it more pliable rubbing it between the warm fingers works well.
There is no annoying fragrance. I think it is suitable for both women and men to use.",4.0
"The color was nice and it went on easily. It felt really good going on and stayed all day except on really hot days. The only thing is I felt like I would need to buy a shade lighter and a shade darker to ensure I could blend appropriately when my coloring changes in summer and winter. However, it felt smooth and was not at all irritating.",4.0

"Got this to try to cover up tattoos for interviews. It definitely did the trick. You couldn't see a single bit of tattoo after applying it. Im not sure I would use it as foundation on my face. It is really thick and I feel like it would clog pores really bad. Taking it off is pretty hard too. I had to use A LOT of make up wipes and scrubbing. I would use it again to cover tattoos, but I would steer clear of ever using it on my face.",4.0
Nice but be careful ordering online - color was darker than I expected.,4.0
"This is a great product.  It's easy to apply and only requires occasional touchups.  And it works well without causing irritation, across a small range of skin tones.  They have a variety of shades but even not matching exactly did not prevent this from being useful.

"The foundation in the Vine list was too dark for me, but I still liked it as far as the way it applied, lasted, and sun protection and was glad for the chance to try it!  I wore it around the house when I did not have to go anywhere.  I have sensitive skin but the foundation did not cause any break outs or other irritation.  It govered the imperfections in my skin very well.  Because of the darker shade I may not be able to evaluate the coverage as well, but I liked it well enough that I may get a shade that matches me.",4.0
Probably at some point need to purchase a shade lighter,4.0
"This is a quality product that does an excellent job covering blemishes and evening out the skin. It's a little heavy for my personal preference during daytime use, but I like it for nighttime as it looks more natural away from harsh sunlight, at least on my fair skin.

"This was a little darker then I was expecting but I was able to use it and I love how well it hides the blemishes and imperfections.  I don't use a lot of makeup because it is hard to find ones that do not irritate my skin.  This creme has been great so far, and I have not had any redness or irritation.",4.0
"This review will be done from the perspective of a makeup artist.  I am going to explain how I find it is best to apply and use this foundation based upon the formula, and then how I think that this performs compared to other products that I have used over time.

WHAT IS THIS FOUNDATION LIKE?
First of all, this is a very thick creme foundation.  This type of foundation is different in performance and application than lotion, powder, or mineral foundation.  More on that later.  The foundation comes in a clear jar with cap on it.  There is no scent,, and it is highly pigmented.

COLOR?
I have compared this to a few colors I have access to at the moment and can tell you this color, medium beige Chroma 2 1/2 is:
-Similar lightness to Bare Escentuals medium beige, but BE is quite a bit yellower base
-Lighter by two shades from MAC NW25 Studio Tech formula which is similar to this.  It is the same tone range, however.

This color has a more pink base to it, but is not so pink that it looks strange like some foundations.  This is more suitable for cooler complexions, but not limited to.

HOW TO APPLY
First of all, make sure that your face is moisturized after cleaning it.  Good moisturizing is key.  You can use a primer, if you like.  I happen to really like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Natasha-Denona-Face-Glow-Primer-Hydrating-Underbase-1-01-oz-30-mL/dp/B01MQJMK21/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Natasha Denona Face Glow Primer Hydrating Underbase 1.01 oz/ 30 mL</a>&nbsp;for drier skin and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swanson-Hyaluronic-Acid-Serum-1-fl-oz-29-6-ml-Serum/dp/B008PPXBA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swanson Hyaluronic Acid Serum 1 fl oz (29.6 ml) Serum</a>&nbsp;for more oily or normal and  younger skin.

The way to apply this foundation is to take the jar, open it up and get yourself a Beauty Blender.  I prefer to stay with the name brand as I have tried many substitutes and still go back to the Beauty Blender for the best performance.

Wet and squeeze out the beauty blender, so it is damp.  Then dab the beauty blender into the Dermablend and just get a small amount on the surface so that it looks like there is not much at all on there.

Choose a quarter of your face area and begin to bounce the sponge all around that area.  It will look like you are not doing much of anything.  Trust me, you are.

For under the eyes, take the tip of the Beauty Blender and from side to side, bounce the foundation from inner to outer corner of the eye.  Again, it won't look like you are doing much at first.  Keep going.

You won't have to get the surface of the sponge loaded more than four or five times in most cases.  You keep bouncing around and around the skin and suddenly you will see that the skin is covered, but still looks like skin.  THAT Is what you are going for.  Any other application method does not do this foundation justice and will not be as realistic/flattering looking.

COMMENTS
Although I am not as fond of this as I am&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Graftobian-HD-Creme-Foundation-Super-Palette-Neutral/dp/B004IBU2O6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Graftobian HD Creme Foundation - Super Palette - Neutral</a>, which is also available in individual colors, this is as close to it as I have come so far.

My problem with the Dermablend is this- it has sunscreen in it.  Many times when wearing this level of foundation, there is a special occasion involved.  That usually means photos will be taken.  Sunscreen makes for some pretty weird effects on film.  It will look white, or off color in certain light as well.  You can use this at home and think it looks perfect, but in some light it can look really off.

If this did not have sunscreen in it, I would like it better.  However, if you really love sunscreen and don't plan to have photos taken in this foundation or don't care if it looks off in photos or on video, then this is a nice foundation.

Wear is pretty much all day, even in humid weather, although it does come off it there is a lot of sweating involved and might need to be reapplied in certain situations.  Setting with powder helps a little bit but in really hot sweaty weather, that might not help.

THE BOTTOM LINE
If applied as outlined in this review, this is an excellently performing foundation.  Although the color turned out to be lighter than I expected, if applied as I outlined, it will blend well with skin that is not an exact match.  Sunscreen in this will alter photos or look off in certain light, but if that does not bother you, then it still is a good choice.  Great coverage and generally speaking excellent durability (except extreme humidity and heat) this foundation could be an excellent choice for more natural looking coverage that does not crease excessively or crack off.  If applied any other way, results will be different.

RATING
Four stars because this has sunscreen in it.  I prefer to have no sunscreen in foundation.  If someone wants to have sunscreen, I prefer to add it separately.  If it did not have sunscreen, I would like it a bit better.",4.0
"I got this for my wife to try out, and she said it is an excellent cover cream. Easy to use, covers well, and lasts long. The only issue is that getting a skin color match; the coloring is strong, so you have to make sure it will match your tone.",4.0
"Very nice job of covering brown spots, blemishes  and under eye area,  and was easy to blend.  The color was wrong for me and had way too much yellow.  I usually use ""normal"" skin tone or ""medium beige"" and the Almond Beige is a tad bit darker than my skin tone and a bit more yellow.  It does do a very good job of covering/blending so I may try to find the right color locally and would consider using.",4.0
"First, the color on this worked very well.

You do need more to use more product than I would like to cover trouble spots and it felt a little heavy.  You do need to work to blend it correctly so that it looks flawless.

It was good for my sensitive skin - no redness or irritation.

I'm also scent sensitive, but had no issues with the scent here.

I'll continue to use for the occasional trouble spot.",4.0
"I found this foundation too dark for me so I am buying a lighter shade.  When I first put this on I realized the color was wrong but the makeup itself went on my skin just fine, evenly and smoothly.  When my lighter shade arrives, I shall come back and add something that explains my opinion better.

I have quite a few products from Dermablend and have been happy with them all.",4.0
"The directions for DermaBlend Cover Creme are conflicting and missing a key item for best results.

First, the box has sunscreen directions for liberal all-over application. The paper insert, however, has instructions specific to spot-coverage for imperfections. This wouldn't be a conflict IF you could indeed spread this crayon-ish clay-like material all over. But you can't really, unless you mix it with some other smoother product.

This is best used as a spot cover-up, to be followed by a rather long setting period, followed by your favorite all-over make-up. An impressively tiny amount covers quite well. This product will last a long time. The spatula is great for hitting the exact spot and smoothing gently. Wipe it clean after each use and put it back in the box you so smartly saved. This little tool will be easy to lose and easy to find via your vacuum cleaner.

What's missing in the instructions? You skin cannot have any flaky areas. This heavy compound accentuates such irregularities, rather than helps to hide or ameliorate them.",4.0
Dermablend is amazing.  It covers everything up easily and does not sweat off.  You have yo use soap to get it off and then it comes off easily.,4.0
"Dermablend Crme Warm Ivory Foundation Makeup with SPF 30 , 1 oz is easy to apply and covers well. Make sure you pick the proper color to match your skin tone. There is only one thing that they do not mention is that you need the setting powder to keep it from coming off. I used regular face powder and it did the job somewhat, but really the maker should alert buyers that the setting poweder is not an optional product but a needed one.

This product covers very well skin blemishes or other imperfections. I have heard from others that some women apply this and then put their regular foundation/concealer over it. There are many ways to use it. I am pleased with how it works and even let a friend try it and she liked the coverage.
This would be a 5 star product if the setting powder came with it, or was at least made known you had to have it.",4.0
"I got this for a friend of mine who was interested in trying it (It is not the right color for myself or my wife). She was suitably impressed with the make-up and coverage, but the color just wasn't as perfect a match.

This is a great idea for a product, but I think you have to be very careful about matching the color. It either works for you ... or it is going to look a little funny.",4.0
Good,4.0
"This cover-up works quite well.  I am a fair-skinned Caucasian of English and Irish descent and this blends in nicely with my skin tone.  It's especially good at muting post-shower blotchiness and acne.  Although the price might seem high, a little bit of product goes a long way on one's face, so you can expect it to last a very long time.  Just used it today, as a matter of fact, with the usual positive results.",4.0
"I'm a dude, but a dude born with a weird birthmark under my left eye.  As I've aged, I've become increasingly self conscious of this quarter-sized mark and looked into ways to resolve it.  Surgery wasn't going to do anything and I sure wasn't going to get a tattoo to cover it.  And so, to the makeup industry I go.

I've tried a lot of concealers, good and bad.  This is one of the better ones.  It's very thick and heavy to apply, but matches the skin tone quite well.  The only issue I have with it is I've come off a morning workout or it's really hot out, it doesn't stay on too well if I'm sweaty or oily.  Somewhere there is a magic 5-start cover cream that stays in while SCUBA diving, but this isn't it.  All in all though, very highly recommended.",4.0
Very helpful in covering up my scars. Easy to wash off with make-up remover. It didn't smudge once applied and I only had to reapply it occasionally throughout the day. Would definitely recommend for those seeking a cover-up make up.,4.0
"This product does provide a lot of coverage, but it's not a dream product.. You will need more than a thin layer to cover, heavier coverage will need to be built up.  And it's VERY visible on the skin if you build it up to full coverage, which pretty much defeats the purpose of correcting skin--unless perhaps it's for a stage situation where you will only be viewed at a distance.  I also found this formula on the dry pasty side, and while it may sometimes be the only product that works, it is not a pleasure to work with. And you absolutely will feel having product on, this isn't weightless.  It's not irritating, but it also isn't second-skin-comfortable.

I've worked with this item in several colors and they ALL are darker than these images appear.  While I do appreciate that they have a wide shade range, I wish better photos and descriptions were provided.

If purchasing this, be sure you also get a setting powder, as this does need to be set.  I would also suggest a brush for application.",4.0
"This cover creme is as described.  It's thick but not difficult to put on.  Can be applied with fingers or sponge or other.  Like it says, it will smear so finishing powder is required to set if worried about smearing.  If you have wrinkles, know that it takes some skill to apply; otherwise, you'll end up with unintended lines of accumulated creme where wrinkles occur, such as around the eyes.  A light application and finishing powder ought to prevent this.  With face cream, it was easy to take off, and my skin did not react at all to the product.",4.0
"I was very skeptical about this product when I received it and realized it has the consistently of a thick paste rather than a creamy foundation.  I am a very low fuss person when it comes to cosmetics.  The instructions are easy to read and you basically scoop some of the foundation out with the included tiny plastic spatula, place it on your palm (or index finger), and gently rotate your finger on the product until it is smooth and ready to apply.  You then tap it on your skin and gently smooth it in.  You will need to allow about 2-minutes after application for the product to ""set.""  My skin looks flawless with this product however use of a setting powder is not an option - it's necessary otherwise my skin gets oily by mid-day.  What was really impressive with this product was how I was able to layer the product over my dark spots from sun damage and they virtually disappeared and the makeup didn't look heavy or caked on my skin.

I'm pleasantly surprised by this product.  It takes some practice to familiarize oneself in applying the foundation; however overall, I found it really easy to use.  The 1 ounce jar will also last a long time as a little bit of this cover creme goes a long way.",4.0
"Wow - the coverage of this is top notch. It's smooth, easy to apply and while perhaps not fully professional level, this isn't far from it. There are two issues with this...first the color is a bit darker than anticipated. I thought it might match a dark tan but this doesn't work for my skin tone...it's more mocha. Beautiful color but not mine. The second is the titanium dioxide which I found a bit more irritating especially in summer. This is a first with this brand but worth mentioning.",4.0
"Dermablend Cover Creme Foundation is a very different kind of foundation than any I have used before. I followed the directions carefully and rubbed a tiny bit of the cream against the back of my hand to soften it and it really does go on my face so smoothly. I only use a bit during the day and it lasts all day. I do touch it up again if I'm heading back out in the evening. I haven't tried the translucent powder to set it yet, but I'd like to. It blends easily with fingers or a sponge and offers pretty good coverage. The Warm Ivory is very light but I'm pretty pale so it works ok. The warmer color works better for me than the Pale Ivory in the summer.  I've used it daily for about a month and have only used a tiny bit. I imagine this container will last at least six months, probably more. My only complaint is that the makeup does settle into my tiny wrinkles and makes them appear more pronounced. Overall, I've been very pleased with the makeup.",4.0

This Dermablend Cover Creme does a very good job of covering my freckles & gives my face a smooth looking appearance. It lasts all day & washes off easily with soap and water.  Definitely recommended!,4.0
"I have loved all the Dermablend products I've been trying lately.  I find they offer the same high quality as department store brands but contain much more pigment in them.

This particular cream makeup is for dry skin only.  It has a beautiful luminous finish and the trademark Dermablend high concentration of pigments.
But it goes on with noticeable slip.  I used a makeup sponge to apply this.  It looks wonderful but was definitely on the oily side for my skin type.
A bit of powder to set this takes down the slipperiness.  I prefer some of the other products in this line such as the powder foundation.  I have slightly oily skin and large pores and that worked better for me.

If you have dry skin you may like this a lot.  I recommend visiting a store that sells this to make sure you get just the right matching color for your skin.  This is very high quality high end department store makeup for those who want high coverage to hide more obvious imperfections.  It's worth the higher price if you want higher coverage and a truly flawless look.",4.0
This is heavy duty - stayed put throughout a hot day of bbq.  I chose this because I knew I would be on the run all day and it has a high spf as well.  Typically I prefer a lighter coverage or tinted sunscreen.  If you want full on coverage that lasts - you won't be disappointed.  I am pale and this color perfectly blended in with my slightly sun kissed skin.,4.0
"this works pretty well but I ordered a shade that was really too dark for me.  Overall I do like it and I'll be buying it in a lighter shade.  It was easy to apply and covered well!  Nice and smooth, and the ingredients seem to be high quality.",4.0
"Excellent coverage for concealing imperfections, discoloration, even scarring.  I skip concealer when using this.  The cream foundation is thick, as would be expected.  I usually use MAC foundation sticks, so this is a bit heavier than my usual routine.  It's good for when I really want to go out and put on a full face.  Use your fingers or a makeup sponge for even application.  I am typically one of those people who prefer to use a tinted moisturizer and some eyeliner and leave it at that.  The golden brown is darker than I expected.  Even with the shade charts provided on Amazon, I'm not entirely sure how to get a good color match online without seeing the full spectrum of the color palettes available.  If you fall between two colors, it's not as though you can easily order both colors just to dab a little on the back of your hand and see which one suits you best.  Especially at these prices.  I used to say you couldn't buy shoes online, it's really something you have to try in person.  Generous free return policies though have proven me wrong.  Maybe I'll be wrong about buying makeup online too.",4.0
"Dermablend is a professional cover creme that works beautifully to obtain flawless skin. Many women have acne, scars or different pigmentation on their face and neck. This creme was designed to cover up those issues, when used as directed. If you are going to use this as a sunscreen, apply 15 minutes prior to sun exposure and reapply every two hours to benefit from the 30spf. If using as a foundation, you only need to apply once and if you also use the setting powder, it will stay put without smudging for 16 hours. The deep brown shade is the darkest of four shades. It can be used as a contour creme also.",4.0

"I chose this to cover some imperfections/blemishes/rosacea and it works as described.  I use a bit of this first and then my regular foundation for the rest (or just this alone).  The coverage is clean, it goes on smoothly with a bit of warmth on my fingers, and stays on fairly well most of the day.",4.0
"Dermablend products are the bomb. They cover up scars, acne and discolorations or flaws on your face, but it doesn't feel heavy. If you want to use it as a sunscreen, you will need to apply every two hours. If you want to use as a foundation, you will need  to apply in layers and when done, use the powder to finish the look and set the look. You can also use lighter shades for highlighting and dark colors for contouring to get that perfect face This product has not caused any irritation to my skin and works extremely well. It also comes with a paddle so that you can apply in small amounts where needed.",4.0
