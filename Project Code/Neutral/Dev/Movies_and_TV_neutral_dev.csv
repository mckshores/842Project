Story about adultery with lots of violence as well as sex.,2.0
When are people going to learn how to make a decent video to screen adaption?? Haven't seen it yet and I don't think I will. Sorry but I will stick with the games.,2.0
"Resident Evil 2 has much of the same qualities as the first film did.  For instance, both films cut right into the story with little background, and the two films end just as precipitously.

However, there are some differences to be sure.  For instance, while in the first film the zombies are restricted to Umbrella Corp.'s compound, in the second these mutants overwhelm all of Raccoon City.  In addition, while the first focused on twisting plot development, with little truly exciting action, the second tries to, somewhat successfully, turn this around with the main characters fighting the mutants from the start.

Oh yeah, also while at the end of the first film, we see a guy ripped away to be used for some experiment and we the audience actually are upset; but, in the second film the tenderness for this man-turned-mutant is never developed enough for us to care, and I mean at all.

Other then that, the two really are just the same poor fare.  Both of which clearly made for, or from, the video game realm, because the story translates poorly to film form.  Why?  Basic action, basic characters, and a complex plot that's going to be dragged out for not one, not two, not three, but four films!!!  You could make one film, or just read some short story, that gives the same entertainment that these films do.  Oh well though, I am only a reviewer and regrettably cannot actually tell directors what to make and what not to make.  (It's probably better this way)",2.0

"Is it even possible to make a decent movie out of a video game? As we continue our tour of movies pre-made from video games, we're starting to doubt that. Video games have already revealed everything. Where can the movie go and stay true to the video game (assuming ""staying true"" has any meaning in such circumstances). In RS2 we're given every genre gimmick and stereo-type in the book trying to flesh out a story that is already very well-known. Nothing can ever succeed on that basis. Good movies--great movies--are new, strange, and exciting. The writing needs to go in utterly new directions to be meaningful. It's a tremendous risk... and probably one the studios are unwilling to take. But there is a precedent. Shakespeare himself took stories--well-known stories--and wove them in new ways to create the greatest stage-plays ever written. Is this so entirely different from taking concepts from video games and putting them on the screen? Video games provide a shorthand and background that screenwriters could exploit if they chose. Instead, the choose to exploit a too-willing audience.

WHO SHOULD SEE THIS

As we've often stated here at Inchoatus, there is a certain charm in going to see some kind of mindless film. Well, this film is utterly mindless. And it has swearing, nudity, blood, and fighting to go with it. If you want to get seriously drunk and go see some women kick ass, then you've probably found a movie. Go rent it and just make sure you're pretty damned drunk when you go see it. There is no reason--none at all--to see it sober. The film is void of any artistic merit whatsoever.

WHO SHOULD AVOID

The goal of Inchoatus is to elevate the genre. We're founded precisely to encourage people to avoid films precisely like this. There are actually some decent films out there that feature blood, nudity, and fighting. Conan the Barbarian is an excellent example. The Event Horizon is another. Even Underworld had some merit to it. The anim film Ghost in a Shell is a tremendous film. As the core audience for all things speculative fiction, we don't have to automatically succumb to this kind of stuff just because they market it. If we can just muster the strength to show a little resistance to this kind of schlock, producers will be forced to provide something better. Is there a better reason to avoid seeing this film? We think not.

Obviously, anyone who isn't well and truly immersed in zombie movies or horror flicks--or has a very serious thing for Milla Jovavich--should avoid this film.

"This isn't a bad zombie movie, but then again it isn't a good one either. Although one knows what to expect in such a movie,

any kind of plot usually keeps things exciting. In this case

however the plot is not particularly interesting. As so many people get slaughtered during the first 20 minutes, we the

viewers do not really care anymore about a little girl getting saved or not. Milla Jovovitch's stunt fights are surreal and her battle with Nemesis, clearly a distant relative of an Uruk-Hai from Lord of the rings, looks silly. I think this movie is unlucky that the crowd's appetite for zombie movies is starting to temper a little. We now want a reasonable story as well.

Just shooting zombies isn't enough anymore. Shame about this movie though, as it obviously is a lot better than the previous part. This just looks like a wasted opportunity.(SARR)",2.0
"Paul Anderson shouldn't be allowed in hollywood period. The guy can't direct, and he can't write a good movie.

His second try at the Resident Evil series, while better then the first, is still crap compared to REAL horror movies. It's kinda like asking to be kicked in the nuts once instead of twice...ones better but who really wants either option?

I guess this is fine though for people who can't handle the real horror movies, like 15 year old girls and horny guys who only want to stare at the hot main star. It's generic and cheap looking at times, much more so then the budget would suggest.

I would only recommend this if you can't handle real horror, or if you've already seen all there is to see in the form of horror movies.",2.0
not as great as the book!!,2.0
"Let me start off by saying if you like true horror/zombie movies, then don't even bother watching this movie, it's a horror movie made for the mainstream, meaning it sucks.

Sure the lead character is hot, sure there are some nice looking zombies in the movie...but thats where all the good stuff ends.

The video game for the PS1 (and it's gamecube remake) are amazing, both in atmosphere and story telling, why the movie didn't follow them more closely is beyond me. Instead you get some horrible story about a computer and the t-virus (which is the only thing in the entire movie from the games, that and the spider-man creature).

Paul W.S. Anderson should not be allowed to make movies ever again, he is a stain on hollywood that needs to be cleaned away.",2.0
"To say this movie was a good, successful one would in fact be a lie. In my opinion this was a terrible sequel to a movie that I adore. For starters, it is unrealistic in its approach to situations presented in the Resident Evil world, and by taking away Alice's feminine vulnerability it detracts from her character a heck of a lot.

The staged characters that are in the games are nothing like their counterparts. Jill, for one, does not do the character justice at all, nor does Carlos. And can I say that the other characters while at first seemed interesting, were killed off far too quickly to develop any emotional attachment to them.

The pace of the movie was too fast and it was not easy to catch on to what we are supposed to be seeing. Not only that, but every five seconds it seemd like there is a fight scene that has no purpose what-so-ever as opposed to the balanced feel of it's predecessor.

Overall I am very dissapointed with this title, and I would not recommend it at all!",2.0
"Beautifully filmed but otherwise, a vanity piece for producer Streisand who loves the camera to love her and blonde love interests--Nolte, Redford, Bridges.  Best Nolte ever looked and good performances from Kate Nelligan and Blythe Daner but otherwise, offputting by profanity and focus on Streisand.",2.0
"I loved this book so much. The movie really is not very good at all. It focuses way too much on the present day love interest, and not nearly enough on the wonderful backstory. A big disappointment.",2.0
one of the DVD's  didn't work,2.0
"Shocking! Of course, i tried to take it on it's good points. Before i saw it i was looking forward to seeing the movies translation of nemesis. It was CRAP! There's no other word for it, sorry to anyone who may have found that rude, but it was a big guy in a suit. The movies neither scared me, thrilled me, or even interested me at parts. But as i always say, it may be to some people's liking so check it out if you liked the first one. All in all, i didn't like either. I'm glad i still have the games to give it a good name. Enjoy!",2.0
"That was me vomitting from this movie. Not because it's gross but because it's just...sigh...there isn't a word for this.

I am almost certain that the majority of these people that write this crap in movies are drunk, horney, 13 year old's. It's sick that these people make tons of money to produce meaningless garbage. I loved the video games and these movies were nothing like it. Nothing.

Were any of you aware that George Romero (like I have to say it...but the creator of Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead) wrote a screen play for the first Resident Evil. I've read it and it rocked, it had characters from the game in it and everything, but noooooOooOo. They had to go Hollywood and use the script that someone puked on and called it a movie. I'm just tired of seeing this crap made when there is a true horror genius out there that no one wants to hear from.

Don't buy or rent any of the R.E.'s go to the video store or Best Buy and buy or rent ""Night"", ""Dawn"" and ""Day""...even the Tom Savini ""Night"" remake that rocked too, then see Land of the Dead. Those movies will show you what can be accomplished when you put a little heart into your movies.

It's just sad that they can take something so good and just reduce it to utter crap.

I gave it 2 stars because at least the zombies didn't run.",2.0
"That's not really true. I didn't find this movie all that mind blowing.

Realistically, noone expects this movie to win any oscars. However, it is a little bit funner than most of Paul W.S. Anderson's other masterpieces. The thing is, you will be laughing at the action rather than be exhilarated by it. My favorite part in the movie is when they take a shortcut through a cemetary. It's priceless.

The only bad part about the movie, besides the script, acting, and plot, is the fact that our heroine is now super-human like. She just seems impossible to defeat as she can kill a million zombies with her kung fu abilities.",2.0
"The first Resident Evil movie was a homage to zombie movies that have gone before.  And Aliens.  And a few other movies thrown in for good measure.  It had a creepy girl, zombies, long-tongued monsters, carnivorous dogs, and Alice (Milla Jovovich) with lots of firepower.

Resident Evil: Apocalypse has all of those things, but none of the spunk.  Where the first movie had a relentless ambiance of terror, Apocalypse is a juiced up action horror without much horror.

PLEASE NOTE: This review contains spoilers, but that's sort of like saying ""water might be wet""--everything I explain here is painfully obvious from the start of the film.  So read at your own risk, but you're not risking much...

Where we last left Alice, she and the other survivor of the movie, Matt Addison (Eric Mabius), were captured by the evil Umbrella Corporation for experimentation.  When she awoke, nobody was left alive in the hospital (shades of 28 Days Later).  So Alice does what she always does in an uncertain situation...she grabs a shotgun.

Meanwhile, the entire city has been infected with the T-virus, a biological weapon that 1) mutates Alice into a superhuman killing machine, 2) turns poor Matt into Nemesis, a muscle-bound gun-toting juggernaut, 3) turns people into zombies, 4) turns dogs into zombies, 5) allows a little girl (Angie Ashford, played by Sophie Vavasseur) to walk, 6) did I mention it turns people into zombies?

So what does Umbrella do?  What all authorities do in a zombie movie: they seal off Raccoon City and call in the nukes (shades of Return of the Living Dead).

Also running about trapped in the city is a cast of stereotypes: the hot police chick (Jill Valentine, played by Sienna Guillory who fails miserably at disguising her British accent), the hot military dude (Carlos Olivera, played by Oded Fehr), and the funny black guy who swears a lot (L.J., played by Mike Epps).  After lots of grandstanding, swearing, amazingly accurate zombie head shots, and a lot of confusion, the plot finally gets going when Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) gives them a mission.

Using his amazing ""personnel locator"" that only seems to work for Dr. Ashford, he discovers that Angie is holed up in her school, all by herself.  We're not sure exactly how this is possible, but never you mind...what matters is Ashford hacks into the entire Raccoon City network and is able to view what's going on from every video camera and microphone.  He then calls our heroes with a deal: if they agree to get his little girl out of the city, he will tell them how to escape.

The means of escape is through a helicopter.  That's it.  That's the big plan.  Hijack a helicopter.  But of course, it's all a trap, and ultimately Alice and Nemesis must duke it out...for some reason.  Something about the perfect weapon, yadda yadda.

There are a lot of neat graphical touches throughout the film.  Alice's bullets have little Umbrella Corp. icons on them.  The helicopters are painted with the Umbrella Corp. logo.  And the end of the film (and subsequent cover-up of the nuclear blast) is entertaining in the same way that the rise of a zombie outbreak was entertaining in Shaun of the Dead.  Which is to say it's awful, but you enjoy it anyway.

But that's it.  Alice is far too much of a superhero to make us feel concerned about her survival.  There are too many characters to keep track of without enough plot development to care about them (Carlos seems to have no actual value at all, less so than even L.J.'s offensive portrayal as a black gangsta). And for some reason, Alice's every move is punctuated by a whiplash sound that quickly gets tiresome.

There's a lot of slow motion action sequences, a lot of blue lensing, and a lot of freeze-frame shots of weapons dropping to the ground. The director (Alexander Witt) is new to directing a film on his own.  He doesn't seem to know what to do with Paul W.S. Anderson's script, and it shows.

The movie drags on and on and on long after it should end, such that it feels a lot like you're watching the third film (an inevitability).  By that time I had lost interest.  When the most interesting part of a film is Jill Valentine's miniskirt, it's hard to care about Alice's fate.",2.0
"""The Prince of Tides"" is my favorite novel.  This movie has very little to do with the book.

Taking this story out of South Carolina and putting it in New York city was the worst idea in the history of Hollywood until some genius decided to take ""Sex and the City"" out of New York city and move it to Abu Dhabi.

This is also the movie that exposed the severe limits of Nick Nolte's acting abilities.  The only thing worse than his laughably fake and inaccurate southern accent is his ""performance"", which is nothing more than a lesson in how to overact.  He somehow managed to take the Tom Wingo character from the novel and turn him into a completely unsympathetic jerk.

If I hated the movie so much, why 2 stars instead of 1?  Simply put, there are two scenes in this movie worth watching.  The opening scene of the Lowcountry marshland and the last scene showing Nolte driving a car over that same marshland.  Everything in between is simply horrible.  The last person in the world who should have directed this movie was Barbra Streisand.  She is undeniably one of the great talents of our time, but this was a mis-match.  It should have been directed by someone who is from the south and who understands the south.  And Tom Wingo should have been played by a southerner - or at the very least an actor who has mastered the southern accent.

Skip this piece of garbage and read the book.",2.0
I was disappointed in a new product - I was not able to hear a great deal of the audio even with the volume as high as possible.,2.0
"John Huston once said that a good story should have ""excitement,color, spectacle and humor, adventure, high drama, tragedy, good conversation, truth and irony"". Unfortunately the discerning viewer won't find much of any of those qualities in ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"". What they will find is a mildly entertaining spectacle of excess. There is enough tension to keep you watching, but when it finally ends and your mind recovers from its numbness, you will wish that you had not bothered.

The ending is both familiar and predictable, at least to anyone over age six. Apparently predictability is comforting to the movie genre's core fan base, in much the same way as it is for a young child watching ""Beauty and the Beast"" over and over again. They know the ending so the initial viewing does not scare them, and the repeated viewings give them a feeling of power and control as if they are determining the outcome each time they watch it.

The authors of the DVD expect multiple viewings as they provide three separate commentaries on the disc. A director producer/commentary, a cast commentary, and a writer/producer commentary. More terrifying than anything in the movie is the thought of listening to ALL these commentaries. Sometimes the degree of conceit and self-delusion exhibited by those close to a movie is astonishing. Do they actually believe that this unoriginal exercise in excess is worthy of even one commentary. If you can't make better stuff than this (editor and production designer excluded) you should go back to school and get your CPA.

Finally John Huston would say that it doesn't hurt to have lovable hero's in your story. Lovable heroines wouldn't hurt either or at least ones that look sexy. Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory are attractive women but if they chose their own costumes (?) for this movie they are also airheads.  Like many women they dress in what they think makes them look sexy. The result is a 6th Street hooker look that makes you laugh every time they appear in the frame. Check out Milla's ""Zoolander"" look if you want to see what could have been; she actually looks sexier wearing old army fatigues in ""Dummy"" than she does in her ""Resident Evil-Apocalypse"" outfits.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",2.0
"The chorus goes ""Have you met writer/director Paul WS Anderson? He's the biggest hack in the whole wide world, if there ever was a hack, he'd be the biggest hack, he's a big fat big fat stupid hack! Hack hack hack hack hack hack he's a stupid hack!"" Well you get the idea.

 REA was supposed to be the film that addressed the problems of the ill fated poorly received original RE movie, and while this film is significantly better it still falls flat on its face, and completely lacks the artistic integrity of the game on which it is based.

 Jill Valentine, and Nemesis, and a couple others FINALLY appear in an RE movie. That's where the good news ends, however, as the film once again forces this useless Alice character into a spotlight that belonged to Jill, Chris, Leon, and Claire. The movie forces itself into the already complex plot of RE Nemesis (PS1, GCN, DC, PC). Sadly it negates the fantastic frantic storyline of the source material and instead focuses on two moody women who would never get dates in real life because their attitudes make them completely unattractive. Jill and Alice were both written as though they were the same character, and both were played out like they would get into a serious cat fight at the drop of a hat. I didn't buy that Jill would rescue Alice at the end because I never got the impression that they were getting along. But its hard to get along with yourself, really... these two were identical in attitude, tone (which was just awful) and even their posture! Not only that, but Jill in the movie was NOT the Jill from the game. They may have put her in the same costume, gave her the same name, but the way Jill came across in the movie is completely different from her superior video game counter part.

 What it boils down to is this, game fans want to see the story of their favorite games brought to the big screen true to form. We never asked for Alice, we don't want Alice, drop kick Alice! Let's make the next one based on the magnificent RE4, let's get good actors in there, and let's get a writer that can actually write instead of just hack his way through a script. PWS Anderson is the biggest hack in Hollywood and people need to stop giving that guy projects. He ruins everything he touches. This one's not even worth playing MST3K to.",2.0
"Now, the first Resident Evil movie, I didn't see.  But hey, I've got friends who liked it, so I went along to watch Apocalypse with them.  They all liked it, and they can't seem to understand why I didn't like this movie as much as they did.  Yes, surprisingly, the movie is close to the games, but it's cheesy and forgets that while it's a movie, things do need to make sense before you can mess them up.

I was pleasantly surprised at least, that the movie does manage to help me learn the gist of what happened in the first one.  Now I don't have to watch it.

But the first problem with the movie is that it jumps into the plot right away.  No build up (people say this is scary?  all the good horror movies have some sort of build up and suspense, for an example: watch Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining""), which makes the film not scary at all.

The action sequences were tiring at most.  Too flashy and perfect.  It also seems that characters don't have to have knowlegde of where characters are to find them.  For example, Jill and company are fighting off a group of lickers in the church when Alice comes riding through the cathedral on a motorcyle.  She's completely in gear and ready to go, doesn't sustain any wounds from the glass, manages to flip off the bike and kill all the lickers.  But she somehow knew Jill and company were there.  How?  Forget how cool her entrance was!  And then she manages to KNOW them all?

I'll give the movie this though.  Anyone who was a big fan of Resident Evil 3 will appreciate the costume design for Jill and will REALLY enjoy seeing Nemesis on camara.  Even though the plot twist at the end is predictable (OH MY GOD!  Nemesis is Allice's old partner?  you mean we WEREN'T supposed to see that coming?), it was pulled off pretty well.  It was also stupid that Nemesis ends up helping our main protagonists through a disneylike ""Yeah, we used to be buds"" moment.  In the game Nemesis was a relentless bio-weapon that had no feelings or emotions.

Really, I'm not sure why this is such a popular movie among my peers.  It's mindless, and the parts that should be funny aren't.  There was nothing really memorable about the film.  For an action film it's shallow, weak, and the main action heroine is much too perfect.  Was John McClane in Die Hard perfect?  Nope, he still got wounded.

For horror, the movie isn't scary.  Too much of it is ruined by building up too much suspesne.  It comes off as more of a ""OK, let's take bets.  Who is going to die next?""

Really, this isn't a ""horrible"" movie, just a ""bad"" one.  Go on and buy it if you enjoy a lot of mindless action.  But if you're like me, mindless action DOES have to make a little bit of sense, or else it isn't ""mindless"" it's just ""stupid"".",2.0
"From my experience, all sci-fi films need one very important ingredient... and this is ATMOSPHERE. Its the foundation block for all great movies in this genre. From classics like Star Wars to new favourites like The Matrix. They tell not just a story, but also of a world different to the one we reside in. That is the heart of a great sci-fi. Without it, characters, plot, nor action can develop. This is where Resident Evil Apocalypse falls apart. From the beginning we are rushed into an established storyline. It begins with a few words from the narrator, explaining the damage already done... and instantly we are expected to follow the paper-thin characters on their journey to righteousness. Its difficult to really care, when we are given little time to absorb the horror of a city under fire. Scenes flip from one character to another, each with a separate agenda. Everything is robotic, human interaction and emotion is minimal and the impact of armageddon is ignored. Its derivative, ironcially much like a computer game, you get bitten... its game over. That is it.

The influences are all there, simplified, squeazed and chopped together.

'Dawn of the Dead' a generic town is ravaged by a zombie outbrake shown in a TV report like fashion

'28 Days later' she wakes in a deserted hospital

'Terminator' dressed in a full leather with a mini gun.

'Robo cop' Remembers friend and defies command to KILL

'Tomb Raider' Girl with two guns wrapped around her thigh

'Aliens' aliens

'Matrix' the action

In the end, it has little originalty, and fails to improve on past formula. Post Viral-Apocalyptic films like Omega Man, Dawn of the dead series and 28 Days Later do a much superior job in creating a world in chaos.. the hysteria, tension, loneliness, despair, humour. That was riveting.

Followed the book to some extent.  I guess it is more of a chick flick.  I thought the acting was just so-so.,2.0
"i didn't have high expectations to be crushed simply because this isn't that kind of franchise.this isn't like the disaster AvsP is.nothing is.but this is a typical big budget action/horror movie.i don't beleive in leaving my brain,the most important part of most movie goers,at the door,but i didn't have to.i kinda got the gist from part one and this continues from that well.if i were a rabid R/E fan then maybe i would be more thrilled with this.video games turned into movies doesnt really get my undying attention.something about it seems for lack of a better word,''fake''.i liked it enough where as i wasn't bored.i took whatever i saw for granted,i didn't get a headache if everything didn't make sense.so on those terms,its not a bad movie,coming from a person not a R/E fan to begin with.",2.0
"This is the first movie in the supposed Resident Evil trilogy and so far, things aren't off to a great start.
  For a horror movie, it borders on all-right to bad. For a movie based on a video game it's pretty bad. Not much from the original games is really intact in this movie.  Mainly just the monsters and some of the lab type levels from the first two games are intact, but thats were the comparisons end. Although, to give the director credit, he did say this movie was more of a prequel to the games, rather then a movie version.
  Horror movie wise, there isn't that many great moments in the movie. The zombies are mediocre, I'd take Romero or Jackson zombies over these ones any day.  They're just not that frightning and they don't do a whole lot.  The part with the dogs is fairly decent, but the licker at the end of the movie is just plain laughable and crappy. The budget wasn't very big for this movie, but I've seen TV movies with better special effects then this movies licker. Although I must admit, the part where they're trapped in the corridor with lazers that our out of control, is one of those ""wow"" moments of horror movies.
  The characters are one dimensional and not very fun. Milla doesn't seem to comfortable in her role yet, but that changes in the second movie. Other characters in the movie could live or die without the audience caring much, unless you're like me and would rather just see them all die. The story is descent enough for what this movie is, but it's nothing to write home about.
  Overall, it's all right, but I'd stick with the 2nd movie, Resident Evil: Apocalypse for a better time being entertained.",2.0
"I love resident evil, and the first movie is one of my favorites.

This movie was such a huge let down. First off the Directing was horrid. The action sequences scream of low quality. The director uses quick jagged camera movements to obscure the action in the movie and give the moive a ""sense"" of action, but people who are used to the matrix/jackie chane show whats going on aspects of a fight sequnce will be aggrivated with the final show down.

Ontop of that the movie down right STEALS from the various RE stroy lines. and re-writes resident evil 3 completly,.

I much rather have had a RE type story or one that could have ran parrel much like the first movie. In stead we get whole a scene stolen from RE code veronica and they actually look less stunning. If it wasn't a complete rip off (say if the character was the same) it wouldn't have been so glaringly bad, but when you go to see a movie you go to see ""new"" thoughts and ideas not just shifted image stolen from video games with different characters doing things that run logically against the game that the images are being stolen from.

An ok movie for people who have never played the game..

But the action super hero twist and rip-off only serve to tarnish the fact that its supposed to be a ""resident evil"" movie. The director probably should have looked at some of the movies that RE borrwed from before he went about trying to turn this into a horrible wanna be super hero flick",2.0
"I have to admit I loved the first film.  It was one of the few films that I thought best represented the video game that it accompanied.  Milla was perfectly cast as the lead and the non-linear structure of the film allowed us to see the who, what, where, when, and why of the events.  There was just the right amount of terror, the right amount of action, and a whole bunch of originality.  I wish, I really wish that I could say the same about it sequel.  As the credits rolled and we were brought back up to speed from the last events that occurred in the original only to discover that a new director had decided to helm this project and was obviously handed more money and forced to follow the footsteps of Hollywood.  Everything from the original was lost and discarded as a mainstream horror film with maybe zombies (couldn't tell due to the blurry nature of which they ran) moved in to take its place.  More money was on the table with, in this case, meant more explosions and less story.  A disgrace to the name of both the video game and the original film came in several ways with this inferior sequel, mainly horrible acting, cliched characters, a recycled plot, and especially with a amateurish, craft sale created monster known as the Nemesis.

To begin the characters were very disrespectful to the original.  I remember hearing of this sequel and hoping they would build more on Milla character, giving her more to work with and more past stories of her time at the Umbrella Corporation.  I was a hopeful viewer who wished for more deeply rooted characters with many layers, but found the Hollywood clich instead.  The entire character known as LJ could have been eliminated with the greatest of ease and without any remorse.  His lines were the epitome of every other zombie film created while trying to bring his own game references into a franchise that was doing well on its own (the GTA line nearly took my rage over the top).  Like any good supporter of films and video games, I don't mind when they bring in more characters from the series, but let us know who they are first.  There was no introduction to Valentine for those less familiar with the series other than she knows how to shoot zombies and she was disbarred from the force (see the writing on the wall).  This goes the same for Carlos, who just wandered through his part without really contributing anything worth while, and Nicholai, whom I always considered another villain of the series.  Oh well, I guess when tons of Hollywood cash is being thrown in your direction, you can just go crazy with creativity and forget the basis of your film.  Yet again, who am I to say?  Milla was the only one worth watching in this entire film, and even her character seemed to be turning to cardboard by the end.  It was a sad change of events for the Resident Evil group.

The bad acting was the only trouble with this film, the horrible script allowed the Hollywood character and plot clichs to pour in like the flood gates had been opened.  The wise cracking character that always has something to say and obscure pop culture references that try to gain a couple laughs from the audience was present.  The no-nonsense female cop that has a strange past, but finds out that she has the heart of gold.  The corporation boss that is willing to kill everyone for the sake of science and proves that he has no heart what so ever.  Finally, there is the large overbearing monster that was nothing more than table scraps of every other Hollywood big budget horror movie, which discovers the true meaning of Christmas.  YUK.  Could director Alexander Witt either not do his homework or just try for once to build upon the original instead of slicing and dicing.  Not just the characters were clich, but also the story.  Lines were replaced with explosions and CGI.  Gore replaced the sci-fi element and 1984 Big Brother moments were just the mother load.  Seriously, I would love to know what happened.

I would like to end this review by saying that I laughed at Nemesis the entire time it was on screen.  For any of you that did not, I question your sanity.  The reality, if that is what you want to call it, the creative imagination of the original was lost when Nemesis made his screen debut.  It was sloppy and cheap.  Definitely not something for Witt to be proud of.

Overall, this was not a crowning achievement for the series.  The themes were jumbled mess of save humanity and science is bad.  Milla did the best with what she was handed providing some of the better parts of the film, but everyone else were just worthless.  I hope that the makers of this film see the error in their ways and the fact that they completely butchered a great concept.  Video games are an amazing source of imagination, but sometimes when Hollywood money becomes involved, you get projects like Resident Evil: Apocalypse.  I loved the video games, but after the original, this series needs to tighten up to regain control.

Grade: ** out of *****",2.0
"Sorry guys, bear with me, this is a long review, but if you want to know why I gave two stars you will have to read the entire thing.

Let me first state that unlike many people, especially fans of the Resident Evil game series, I thoroughly enjoyed the first Resident Evil movie and although it wasn't anything too special or original, I felt the it was a solid action/sci-fi/zombie/horror movie which never really went wrong.  RE - Apocalpyse however disappointed me numerous times.  I excepted a generic plot, I expected Matrix style action, I expected hordes of zombies, I expected a lot of things, what I didn't expect were some lame scenes and a lazy plot wrap up.

The gist of the story is that a zombie creating virus has infected the Umbrella Corporation's secret research facility known as The Hive which resides underneath the city of Racoon City (the events of the first movie).  Of course a science team goes to reopen the Hive and the bad stuff escapes, no problem there.  All of Racoon City starts to get infected and all kinds of zombie hell is breaking out everywhere.  Alice our main character wakes up in a ""hospital"" after her ordeal from the first movie.  By the time she walks outside the city is already officially screwed.

First the things I liked about the movie, I love the Resident theme, I like the action/fighting scenes, I generally like the characters and the acting, there aren't too many lame quotes, there are some decently frightening scenes and the special effects are about as good as you could ask for.

Now what I didn't like.  *SPOILERS*  Some how Umbrella Corporation in less than 24 hours managed to contain the outbreak within a city seamingly the size of Chicago using 30+ foot walls around the entire city.  Allrighty then, in all fairness the Umbrella Corporation knew the virus had infected the Hive, so prior to entering The Hive they could have and should have had safety measures ready to be deployed if the virus escaped into the city.  Okay I guess I can buy that.

There were naturally a couple of scenes that were lame or dumb, such as Alice jumping via motorcycle into the church where the other characters are battling against some Lurkers, not knowing where she was going to land and who she might squish on the other side.  A little bit reckless, but I'll forgive it as a theatrical flair.  And of course if a zombie/undead resurrecting virus gets lose one of the first things you would put on your site seeing list is a stroll through the cemetary, right?  Well our characters did, and of course the buried zombies don't crawl out of their graves until our characters are right dead smack in the middle of the cemetary.  Sigh... well every horror movie has to have the character stupidity moments and maybe the buried zombies didn't have enough willpower to dig themselves out until they started to smell fresh blood standing right on top of them.  All right I'll forgive that stuff.

Then a semi-side plot to whole movie is the conflict between Alice and Nemesis (a huge T-virus mutant).  The Umbrella Corporation wants to see the two battle it out and test each other.  Allright so the two have a couple semi-random encounters which were actually kinda cool, but then we get towards the end of the movie and their ""battle"" has yet to resolve itself.  So we can't have that.  Rather than have to two stumble across/find each other in some random cool location and end it, an Umbrella Corporation scientist forces the two to literally fight now.  ""You and you step forward and end this.""  I thought for a second I'd stumbled into a ""Mortal Kombat"" movie, I expected at anytime to hear the deep gravely voice utter the word FIGHT.  Needless to say the scene was lame.  Once again however ultimately forgivable due to artistic license.

Now we come to the end.  A horrible disease ravaged a city the size of Chicago, a huge 30 ft wall is erected around the entire city (we are talking miles and miles of wall), newspapers lay scattered through the streets with headlines reading ""THE DEAD WALK"", people struggle to escape the city and many do before Umbrella Corporation puts a stop to it.  To cover this tragedy up Umbrella Corporation touches off a nuclear bomb and claims the power plant had a meltdown.  Fine no problem.

However, some amateur footage of the zombie tragedy ends up in the hands of mainstream news.  Reports of disturbing and shocking footage are aired.  Oh, wait sorry, never mind the whole thing was just a hoax.  All we know is that Racoon City was leveled by a nuclear meltdown.  WHAT?  Are you trying to tell me no one in the outside public knew about this outbreak?  No one noticed the 30 ft wall surrounding a major metropolis?  Newspapers had enough time to release breaking news headlines reading ""THE DEAD WALK"" and nobody outside heard about it or read these articles?  None of the presumably thousands of earlier escapees told anyone about the tragedy?  None of the remaining people not to mention the reporting local news, government or law enforcement groups made a phone call to the outside world to report what was happening and/or ask for aid and/or say there goodbyes to loved ones, especially in the early hours of the outbreak?  How in the world am I supposed to buy that crap?

If you want a cover story say terrorists released a biological/viral disease and before anyone could figure out what was going on, the nuclear plant had a meltdown and obliterated the entire city and any potential explaination of the virus outbreak.  There both horrible tragedies reported and simply explained and resolved.  But no instead the outside world remains completely ignorant of the zombie disease outbreak. Please.  That my friends is why I didn't like this movie.  It makes the whole plot resolution unbelievable.",2.0

Second film in the series, based upon the ""Resident Evil"" video game series.

  We all enjoyed the first film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B0002J4X1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil (Deluxe Edition)</a>&nbsp;(2002) that was inspired by the ""Resident Evil"" video game series. The movie became such a hit in the movie theaters and in the movie rental shops, they quickly made plans for a movie sequel, Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004).

  Just another beautiful day in Raccoon City, but underground the Nemesis has escaped.  Important residents in Raccoon City are visited by two agent men from the Umbrella Corporation telling them at their front door, ""There's been an incident"".  They are taken in the van immediately.  Their is chaos going on downtown. Officer Jill Valentine (Sienna Gillory) is called in. She enters the Raccoon City Police Department and kills the bio-hazard zombies.
  As we saw at the end of the first film, we see Alice (Milla Jovovich) unhooking herself from the operating table and leaving the building. She now stands in the middle of downtown Raccoon City where all the turmoil has just ended.
 Later that night, Raccoon City is quarantined. No one is allowed to leave. They must go back home. Valentine, Peyton (Razaaq Adotyi) and Teri (Sandine Holt) are in the church to get away from the zombies. The lickers are running rampant inside. Suddenly, Alice finds a way inside to help.
  Their next mission is to get Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) his daughter, Angela (Sophie Vavasseur), back and he will help them get out of the city.

  Also in the cast: Oded Fehr, Thomas Kretschmann, Zack Ward, Mike Epps, Stefen Hayes, Brad Borbridge, lain Glen, Larissa Gomes, Alexander Witt. Matthew G. Taylor as the ""Nemesis"".

"I can't help but wonder how good this film may have been had it had another director, maybe one more attentive to the nature of the story.  Instead, actress/singer/director Barbara Streisand helms this picture, and she does a lot more damage than good.  Instead of creating a film that is rooted in raw emotion and heartbreaking tragedy she turns this film into a longwinded soap opera with over-the-top acting and `romance novel' style dialog.  In fact, the last quarter of the film is so ridiculous that I seriously wanted to vomit amidst all the saccharine facileness.

The film tells the story of Tom Wingo, a southern `good ol' boy' who is troubled by a dark family secret, a secret that has pushed his sister to attempt suicide.  While she lies in a hospital room, Tom ventures to New York and meets his sister's psychiatrist Susan.  Tom is apposed to his sister seeing a shrink, but the more he sees Susan the more he begins to open up, about his life, his wife, his mother and eventually uncovering the family secret that has haunted him for so many years.

The idea behind the film is a good one in my opinion (I have not read the book, although I don't hear good things about it so I don't think I will) but the handling of the material really sidelines the film in my opinion.  Instead of taking a raw and emotional approach to the film, the soap operaish delivery makes light of the tragedy surrounding the film and ultimately turns the serious subject of abuse, suicide and murder into a joke.  All of this weighty material is more or less just a backdrop for Tom and Susan to fall in love and in the end the film makes their relationship the weightiest subject; expecting the audience to swell up with tears at the prospect of them having to leave one another as apposed to the audience being emotionally responsive to the turmoil boiling within Tom's past.

The acting doesn't really help the matter.

I am not a fan of Nick Nolte.  I never have been and never will be.  He has really only delivered a few (countable on one hand) good performances, and this is not one of them.  His over-the-top delivery of Tom's emotions is comical to say the least.  He has one good scene, when he finally breaks down and exposes his past.  It's the only scene where his emotions seem real, and it's the only respectable `scene' in the film (which ends up getting ruined by the overly sentimental `cry in my bosom' closing).  Streisand is better than Nolte, but too clichd.  The only good acting comes from the supporting cast, notably Blythe Danner (who is sorely underused) and Kate Nelligan (who received an Oscar nomination for her performance).  They are not enough to save the film, but they at least prove to add some interest to their scenes.

In the end I can honestly say that `The Prince of Tides' is a missed opportunity, which I think is what makes the sting of the films failure hurt all the more.  It could have been so deep and haunting but instead comes off vapid and hollow.",2.0
"Only the Nolte and Streisand characters are well-drawn; the rest are stereotypes.  The dialog attempts to be moving, but is more often cliche.  Even the climactic revelation has an ersatz, made-for-TV quality to it.  Not a bad film, just not a good one.",2.0
"Barbra Streisand has made a very good-looking movie, and competently directed a very good cast, so this movie isn't a total dud.  The problem lies in the story itself.  It's simply too unbelievable, formulaic (the ""childhood trauma"" at the center of the film doesn't have any resonance, it's simply a glibly Freudian attempt to tie the narrative together), and full of overripe rhetoric that cannot disugise the vacuity of the tale.

The one redeeming feature in this film is Nick Nolte's SUPERB performance.  This is far and away the best performance I've ever seen him give.  He deserved the Oscar for this.",2.0
"Barbra Streisand is Lowenstein - a shrink trapped in an unhappy marriage to a violinist (Jeroeme Krabbe) and who ultimately finds salvation in the arms of Tom Wingo (Nick Nolte) the brother of one of her patients, Savanah, who has attempted suicide. This is a love story with plenty of treakle but more than an ounce of vinegar as Tom and Lowenstein hit things off, become lovers, but ultimately part company forever to resolve their differences with their respective spouses.
Columbia Tristar has given us a truly awful looking print of this film.  Colors are muddy and undistinguished.  Everything takes on an orange characteristic that is unbecoming to the story.  Night scenes suffer from low contrast levels.  Aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement are all present throughout the print.  Fine grain elements and regular wear and tear have not been cleaned up for this presentation either.  Flesh tones are inaccurately rendered, either too orange or too pink.  There's a considerable loss of fine detail throughout, presumably because of noise reduction equipment used in mastering the print.  The soundtrack is dated, strident, unnatural sounding and very tinny.  It's 2.0 but almost sounding mono in spots while presenting the music at very boisterous listening levels that intrude on an otherwise very subdued audio presentation.  No extras - big surprise.  Columbia's penny pinching started with this release.  You can see where it's lead to by examining my reviews of ""The Awful Truth"" or ""Talk of the Town"".  For a studio that entered the DVD race so early on and so prominently, I've little in the way of flattery to offer for its current trend in the digital format! BOTTOM LINE: DON'T BOTHER.",2.0
"Mostly everyone knows that rarely does a sequel live up to the expectations that its previous installment set up for it. Don't get me wrong there have been quite a few sequels/trilogies that have created legacies for themselves,..the Resident Evil series on the other hand seems to be moving towards disaster. The first installment of the series, Resident Evil, was excellent in my opinion, the story was told in a manner that left you yearning for more and kept you somewhat in suspense. Resident Evil also left you with a cliffhanger wondering what's going to happen next, thus wanting to see the sequel, Resident Evil: Apocalypse. I actually waited a few days after viewing the first Resident Evil to see RE: Apocalypse because I thought the first one was done so well that it will be better if I wait to view the second film. So I watched it and honestly can say that I have no reaction, the was absolutely no plot and if you can try to point one out it is probably a very silly one. It seems as if the writers just wanted to push another installment out so they can get to the next one and create a collectors edition box set. Milla defiantely was not aas appealing in the second film as she was in the first Resident Evil. I don't know but a very attractive woman who seems innocent at first then kicks arse later on in the movie is very sexy. In Apocalypse you already know that Milla kicks [...] so theres no suprise and she looks a little brutish while doing so. Kinda turned me off, The character Jill Valentine was very appealing but I feel she got robbed of a decent portrayal, I was confused throughout the movie as to who she was as there was a very brief intro to her. Overall the film was trying to hard to outdo its previous and failed miserably. There was too much focus and shooting 'em up and not enough story or plot. So a comment to the director/producers, in the next film remember that maybe fans watching the Resident Evil films actually enjoy a good plot and are not mindless like the zombies wandering within the film.",2.0
"As a die hard Resident Evil fan there is a certain amount of consistency I come to expect from the games and even more from the movies.  I loved the first installment, it wasn't based on the games but it had the same feel to it, but Apocalypse is a disjointed montage of things that happened in various games.  Sure I didn't mind many of the inconsistencies to the game to the movie, but get someone who understands how a Beretta operates, the slide locks in place when you're out of ammo.  My biggest issue was the ending, everything made sense how you wouldn't want the story getting out but I think that Paul W.S. Anderson forgot about events in the cold war that led to the establishment of NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) there purpose to track missiles...  Translation you can't nuke the city and get away with it, NORAD has our backs.  Then the refusal to use any other mutant other then Lickers is insulting to the far superior Hunter's of almost every Resident Evil game, 6 foot tall killer decapitating frogs just never gets old.  If you didn't know anything about Resident Evil other then it had zombies and lots of guns then yes you might like this insult to Resident Evil fans but a die-hard such as myself, I had a hard time with number Apocalypse, and when it comes to the next one im going to pretend that the first was the only movie.",2.0
"This movie would have been better if they had developed the characters more and stopped trying to cram so much into a relatively short movie.

I do not play the Resident Evil game, but I like movies based on games.  It feels like this movie was created by a committee of game players with ADD.

Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory are hot.  The costumes, weapons, action sequences, etc...are very well done.  Overall, it's a good movie that could have been so much better.",2.0
"This movie is quite gastly when compaired to the first resident evil,I mean this movie hade a cheese factor of 8 out of 10 it is quite obvious that there was a differant director who made the movie. if you like the games then stick to the first movie it's much better and so is the video transfer, for some reason they gave this movie a really bad transfer, none of the blacks are black and the color is washed out I was fooling around with my color and brightness controls throughout the whole movie.",2.0
"Resident Evil: Apocalypse begins where the first film left off as Raccoon City has become a sweltering pot hole for T-virus infected zombies that seek human flesh to devour.  People seek refuge outside the city as the Umbrella Corporation, which is responsible for the mishap, has risen walls around the city in order to contain the virus within the city.  When it becomes apparent that the T-virus has reached the outer wall the Umbrella Corporation shuts down the passageway out as the remaining people within the city are left to fend for themselves.  One of these people, Alice (Milla Jovovich), has just awakened inside a hospital where she is attached to several different machines that monitored her health, and once again she has to fight for survival.

The struggle for survival turns the film into a roller coaster journey that goes up and down, but unfortunately it seems to stay down most of the time as the action sequences become too cool, almost godlike, which removes any atmosphere of fear, or trepidation that Resident Evil should arise.  The true horror, which was an element in the first film, is wiped out as the film instead attempts to offers a cinematic experience through shoot 'em up action.  There are some interesting scenes such as Alice running down a wall, and the Nemesis attack on the S.T.A.R.S. station, which leaves one survivor.  But overall, Resident Evil: Apocalypse does not provide much fright or scare.  The action sequences, at times, feel awkward and more humorous than suspenseful as the characters are supposed to struggle for survival.  When some poor soul is about to die, it becomes slightly predictable as if some formula was concocted in order to save the film.

The film does not overcome its negatives as in the end the film does fall flat, but there are some highlights in the story.  For example, the film has interesting cinematography, good lightning, and cool special effects.  These positives only make it bearable to view the film as the story seems to be hurried and unfinished.  Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a distilled cinematic version of the video game by Capcom, but the film does not move the near heights of the video game as the film is purely a trip to the shooting range, which leaves an empty feeling within.",2.0
"I'm reviewing this movie because after renting it (thank god!), I had a very good mental vision of how cool this action/horror slasher flick would be, little did I know that dissapointment was just around the corner...I mean, wow, they really screwed up here with one of Playstation's most popular video games in history.

I wanted blood, but there was barely ANY, what were they thinking? Resident Evil is all about the blood 'n the zombies, which mind you, not EVEN ONE get's it's head blown off, which is how you kill them idiots! No wonder Alice's team suffered so much! The most redeeming, interesting part of the movie is the way it tries to give suspense and surprise, it fails on some levels to say the least but it is the best feature.

The way the movie ends is stupid too, it basically ENDS where it should've BEGUN, thus resulting to a tiresome sequel that may I say was a total flop!

Might be pleasing to some, but I've seen better...",2.0
"I would like to say that I am surprised by the responses that this movie was better than the first. It was terrible, it had lousy acting and the plot was extremely confusing.

What is up with the dead people coming out of the ground in the cemetary? The virus is spread through a bite or getting injected with it. This movie was terrible...No story line, The action was lame too..",2.0
"oh, c'mon, what a load of crap, what a waste...

The first one was good sci-fi/horror movie, good and kind of interesting caracters, good zombies, a good storyline and well directed. Now the second, sorry but this is very bad, i gave two stars because of the action sequences, they were entertaining but that'S it!!

this is sad because the beginning is good, i mean the 20 first minutes are good, all the panic and etc, i won'T spoil it. But after it'S only mindless action with stupids caracters, a lot of zombies and action, but where is the gore, i mean zombies, people with big guns, you see what mean. I will not talk of the storyline, it'S just not very good and so the acting, i know it'S a horror action movie, but it'S not a reason, just watch Dawn of the dead (remake) and Shaun of the dead. 2 recents horrors movies and 2 great movies with good storyline and acting.

There'S some good points of course, good special effects, the pumped soundtrack and two sexy female caracters. :-)!!!!

I'm big horror movie fan, since my childhood and i mean all kind of horror, and i love ZOMBIES. This movie is bad, and personaly and I don'T think this is a good horror movie.

"Hollywood's latest contestant in the video-game-cum-feature-film sweepstakes rears its head in the form of Screen Gems Resident Evil.  Originally Evil was in the hands of zombie guru George A. Romero but ultimately it was not to be, and his latest foray into the zombie arena was momentarily halted.  Currently Romero is in pre-production on the 4th installment of his popular `Dead' series. That aside Resident Evil liberally culls its plot and look from the popular PlayStation discs, classic zombie flicks and Alien-type sci-fi.  But alas Anderson's Evil disappointingly brings very little to the horror fans table.

Is the film all bad? Well, no. On the contrary, the cybernetic sets are slick and well conceived, as are the gored-up, out of control zombie dogs. The script is a notch above par and the soundtrack features music by Crystal Method, Static X, Slipknot and Marilyn Manson. However strong these attributes are they hardly rescue this release from being more run of the mill, teenage drekk.

Fans of Lucio Fulci and/or George Romero's zombie epics will find little redeeming in this sanitary picture. It's appalling that Hollywood can screw up such a simple formula. There's no need for convoluted plots or deep subtext. Merely start with some dead bodies and a gung-ho group of survivalists fused with radiation or good old-fashioned voodoo and you've got yerself the makins' for a zombie marathon. Oh, and you can't forget the blood, lots of blood.

Resident Evil was rated R for ""Strong Sci-Fi / Horror Violence, Language, Brief Sexuality / Nudity."" Taking the latter first, there was only one fleeting glimpse of a female nipple and some sex-under-the-sheets-in-a-flashback-with-a-strobe-light type of crap. Next up is ""Language."" I recall but one ""F"" word and I'm quite sure that many a youngster has spewed-forth much worse while blasting the contaminated undead in the comforts of their parents' homes. Finally the ""Strong Violence"" - the handling of this aspect distressed me as I soon found that these zombies hardly bled at all. Yep, a near blood-free zombie pic. In the film's defense they did attempt to explain this by saying, ""the blood coagulates only after the body is dead."" Fine. So now we should see blood clots and splats rather than streams and pools, but we don't. What we see is a whole lot of nothing.

Furthermore, the fast action scenes (i.e. minions of zombies being massacred by 3 people) are obscenely influenced by the stylistic renderings of the MTV age. Any gore that may have been present in these sequences is completely blanketed in an overkill of rapid-fire filmmaking tricks and stunts. So while it may come as a surprise to all 4 (count `em!) of the producers, the jittery camera pans, quick editing, flickering lights and extreme close-ups just make for one unpleasant mess.

It's a sad fact that the video game is more compelling, more fun and a helluva lot bloodier than its cinematic offshoot.

Note: The film's star Milla Jovovich may have experienced some dj vu as she awakens towards the end near naked on a lab table, just as she was at the start of The Fifth Element. Bruce Willis co-starred in The Fifth Element and awoke to a similar predicament in Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys. All roads seem to lead back to Bruce Willis. I don't like that.

"Saw Resident Evil 2. Without going into FULL detail, allow me to say this:

What a LOAD!

Tell you what, if you liked the first movie, then watch this only if you want an excuse to create a big budget, blow-every-flipping-thing-up, bridge to another possible sequel.

I swear, Paul Anderson is films version of Piers Anthony (sp?). He doesn't know how to end a movie, so he stops them all on some freaking Joss Weadon cliffhanger.

Y'know Paul, sometimes we WANT endings to our films. We want to be able to have that last sigh of relief when a film ends. We want to feel like something is concluded. We DON'T all want to be left hanging at the end of everyone of your films. Every once and a while is fine, but not EVERY movie. That kind of crap makes me wary of wanting to see the future releases of Driver and Necropolis. Heck, if he WANTED a cliffhanger, he could have stopped the movie 5 minutes from where it did end and I would have been less irritated.

The ending isn't the only fault of this Summer ending fluff. Mila Jovavich was the best actor of the film. Now, while I'm not down playing her growing talent, look at this closer. When your highest-grade actor is an ex-super model, something is wrong. Most of the other actors had some kind of Van Damme ascent and made it hard to understand them alone. The others padded their sub par acting with guns blazing at things (most which weren't zombies, more on that later) or a blazing flurry of F-Words.

It is with that word and the pointless topless scenes that I think garnered the ""R"" rating, which is pretty flipping sad.

All the characters were stale and you began to not really care if one guy lived or died. When the characters did die, there wasn't ever that feeling of ""Aw, man, I really liked him/her too"".

Now, I KNOW the Resident Evil series isn't all about zombies. It's not a plain zombie story, sure, but they sure as hell have a lot to do with it. It played a lot into the first movie. THEY were it. THEY were the baddies, while sharing the light with the ONE Licker and the amnesia filled dude with the attitude.

The zombies this round are filler in the film. The movie just seems to flash back at them, as if to say ""Oh yeah, they're here too"". The Licker was even downplayed as a minimal threat to the people who had guns. In the first, it ransacked everything in sight and began evolving and becoming badder. This time, there's like TEN of them. You're thinking, ""Holy crap, they're screwed"".

Not necessarily so, Lois.

Instead, one guy gets offed and the rest are either shot, run over, blowed up or Crushed By Christ(TM).

Naturally, our heroes trip into a graveyard all filled with fog (that only seems to be THERE) and one of our ""Zombie Reminders"" shine as a bunch of dudes pop from the ground and start dancing around with Michael Jackson to bring in the long awaited Thriller 2: Zombie Boogaloo.

Okay, maybe not, but it would make more sense as to why they arrived than the NON reason the movie gave.

Then there's Nemesis. Ah, Nemesis. One of the biggest Baddies of them all. He was mysterious, he was tough, he wore black and he whooped your butt. Now, though, he was more like Frankenstein with a gun. He just kind of lumbered around Raccoon City, making himself known and doing very little. Then there's this hand-to-hand fight he was with Alice that's the equivalent of Nancy Fowler Archer, of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman fame, battling the Stay Puffed Marshmallow Man. They just shuffled about and twitched at each other. I couldn't tell what was going on half the time cause of Paul's EXTREME close-ups, which were, more than likely, hiding the characters physical flaws.

All of this combined makes me want to see the possibility of a three as much as I want to fork over 7.50 to see a third Star Wars.

"I've never claimed to be an expert on movie-making. Having said that, I think it's fair to say that a movie sequel should have at least *something* that distinguishes it from the first one. Something that spices up the overall story and yet maintains a continuity. Well, you won't see that with ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse."" Alexander Witt sat in the director's chair for this one, but he may as well change his name to Paul Anderson, because this movie is basically a recycled, watered-down pointless sequel to the first one. Witt brings absolutely nothing new to the table. This might as well just be an hour and a half long prologue to ""Resident Evil."" Judged on its own merits, this one sinks faster than a ball of lead thrown in a river.

To begin with, just about every cliche in the book is thrown into the mix, including the obligatory multi-racial cast, which of course wouldn't be complete without the loudmouth, wise-cracking nimrod whose only purpose is to provide comic relief. And poorly-timed comic relief, I might add. The script is so atrocious that one could probably follow the entire movie with zero dialogue spoken. And oh yeah, there are plenty of profanities just to make it more ""hip."" Action sequences are forced and cliched, and pretty much all of them are shown in the trailer. This movie has no flow whatsoever; it's one ""shoot 'em up"" scene after another. After the millionth zombie shot in the head it gets old real quick. The so-called ""scary"" scenes are more laughable than frightening. You can see them coming a million miles away. It's not a good sign when the audience is one step ahead of the movie. Many scenes were just flat-out sickening, such as the zombie corpse with worms crawling all over its face. Cheap shock value. And don't even get me started on the ""Nemesis"" monster. But hey, one good thing was that the guy inside that Halloween rubber suit could at least hide his face and not let anyone know he starred in this movie. I could go on but I think you get the point.

For me, the only enjoyable thing was seeing Milla Jovovich, whom I worship. She's perfect in her role as Alice. But as much as I love you Milla, even you couldn't save it.

Bottom line: ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is an overly-loud, pointless, cliched, virtually plotless, poorly directed carbon-copy of the first movie, and at least the first one had its moments. Now, I'm a movie-goer who's able to have realistic expectations when walking into the theater. The ""Resident Evil"" movies are based on a video game for teenagers, so I'm not expecting ""Citizen Kane."" But come on, there's nothing wrong with having at least SOME iota of intelligence in a movie of this genre. A total waste of time.",2.0
"Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a LOUD, vulgar, obnoxious work of celluloid that completely lacks the style and atmosphere of Paul W.S. Anderson's first film. The sound design is ridiculously over the top, the script is non-existent and the FX are sub-par. The eagerly awaited ""Nemesis"" looked like a man in a rubber mask and the ""Lickers"" appeared as if they had been crafted from 1st generation CGI circa ""Alien III."" I was hoping for more and was ultimately disappointed...",2.0
"The sequel to 'Resident Evil' has more actions, to be sure, but the film itself is done with less creativity and originality, repeating what you have seen in other better films featuring the un-deads, or zombies.  (The timing of the release is worst for we have seen recently 'Dawn of the Dead.')  And as to the actions, some must be really good -- I say 'must' because many scenes are poorly directed and edited, with a camerawork that shows the director doens't know how to create exciting fighting sequences, whether they are martial arts or bullet shootings.

Sorry if I sound harsh, but don't say I am missing the point.  I know the film is based on a Capcom game, and I know the story is only an excuse for the heroine Alice (Milla Jovovich who returned from the original) who must fight against a lots of zombies, in Racoon City which always looks like Toronto.  I'm not complaining about it.

Anyway, the Umbrella Corp. very strong company cause the infection of deadly virus that spread all over the city (which has only one bridge to access there), and it should be contained immediately.  Many citizens are turned zombies, who attack the following hapless people -- Beside Alice, tough (suspended) cop Jill (Sienna Guillory, 'Love Actually'), soldier Carlos (Oded Fehr 'The Mummy'), small-time crook LJ (Mike Epps, 'Friday'), newsreporter Terri (Sandrine Holt).  Plus you see Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) and Major Cain (Thomas Kretschmann, 'The Pianist') who controls the military operation ruthlessly.

If you can ignore the numerous plot holes and inconsistent logics, 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' has serious problems with it.  As I said, the fighting sections, which should be the biggest feature of the film, suffer heavily from the inept editing that use too many fast cuts and slanted camera.  Milla Jovovich, physically fit, is fine as the fighting heroine, but the camera fails to capture the essence of her, which was so eloquently shown in 'The Fifth Element.'

To make matters worse, though Milla is as beautiful as ever, the film's confusing (and unfocused) plot somehow refuses to use her to the full.  In fact, you don't see Alice on screen for considerable time, as the film heavy-handedly introduces other characters into the story.  And the way it does is so confusing that you find the film repetitive -- see how many times you have to see some people biting others, which causes inevitable results.  Many have already seen the consequence in the original, so once is fine.  Twice is unnecessary.

There are good things, though.  Sienna Guillory is a standout as the strong-willed police officer, whose acting is perhaps better than the star Milla Jovovich.  Perhaps her roles was cut short (especially the earlier part) because some of her behaviors in the opening parts look too adrupt.  They should not have done that (if they did, I mean).  And Mike Epps gives us a few moments of genuine laughs, which are always welcome to me.

But as a whole 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is a bit disappointment, because of its recycled ideas and mediocre actions.  What if Paul W.S. Anderson (who wrote the script, but went to direct 'Alien vs Predator') directed this?  I don't know, but perhaps, just perhaps, made it more effective than Alexander Witt, who was the second director for pefectly choleographed 'Pirates of the Carribians.'",2.0
"Based on a computer game, Resident Evil actually looks like a computer game:  the characters run around in a maze-like environment, shooting zombies and mutants while a standard video game soundtrack hums in the background.  There isn't much of a plot, just enough to establish why the zombies are there.  Admittedly, with two characters with amnesia and a possible traitor in the group, there is room for a plot twist, but any revelations are mere diversions from the killings.

With more than a few references to other zombie flicks, particularly Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, Resident Evil doesn't offer anything very new.  The action is passable but nothing special; essentially, anything this movie does, some other movie has already done better.  On the other hand, there is nothing truly bad in this movie: it merely lacks anything good.",2.0

Had to watch this for class,2.0
"The movie is sort of a crossover between the genres of zombies [a la Night of the Living Dead] and artificial intelligence gone wrong [in the mode of one of the less good early X-files episodes]. The result is a mediocre horror flick, with a story not convincing enough and character development far from sophisticated enough for the movie to be even slightly memorable.

The atmosphere is clinical, very much reminiscent of Event Horizon, another movie made by the same director Paul Anderson, only that Event Horizon is a slightly more interesting movie. The movie's sterilized feel is almost devoid of human emotions, even in the one or two forced scenes where the characters are supposed to express sympathy and compassion. Those scenes are ineffective. It feels like the script writers feel compelled to include them only to make sure the audience can distinguish the otherwise cold and expressionless human characters from the zombies and artificial intelligence. The stubborn refusal to develop the characters in any three-dimensional sense is rather annoying.

Even if one treats it as a ride in an amusement park, the movie fails to really deliver. The zombie attacks are clichd, and you could feel that even the cast sometimes shows in the movie their own lack of interests. Humor, in any form, is also conspicuously missing in the movie. Overall, no matter what you are looking for, I would not recommend this movie.",2.0

"Resident Evil is sort of an unbalanced mixture of old-school zombie horror and new-school filmmaking and special effects. Everything about the movie has to be a lot faster (except the zombies themselves, somewhat surprisingly), there has to be martial arts complete with even some wire-fu, and it has slimy monsters that are rendered by CGI, not old-fashioned animatronics. As you can see, I was never particularly won over by the film.
Resident Evil opens in an underground laboratory called ""The Hive, a top-secret facility owned by a company called the Umbrella Corporation, situated underneath Raccoon City. One of the lab workers sabotages the place, shutting the power down and unleashing a deadly virus that kills its victims and brings them back as zombies.
We then cut to a cutie naked chick (Milla Jovovich) called Alice, who awakens in a bathtub inside some large mansion; not only is she unclothed, she's also suffering from a mild form of amnesia. Before she can collect her bearings (though she has enough time to put on a dress), an elite military task force barges into the building, taking her and an outsider (Eric Mabius) to the underground facility, directly connected to the mansion. Their mission is to shut down the Red Queen, the computer controlling the lab, but they''ll have to get through flesh-eating zombies and maniacal defense systems to accomplish that.
As directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, the same man who crafted the far superior and terrifically frightening Event Horizon, Resident Evil is unfortunately lacking in much of that film's thrills and chills. Anderson shows an inconsistent hand at staging and filming action sequences; the movie's numerous shootouts and fight scenes are only mildly exciting at best, hampered too often by close-up shots of big guns and expended shells. Worse yet, all the violence is sanitized; there's hardly any blood or gore in this picture.
Actually, what's probably most memorable about the picture as a whole is how maddeningly inconsistent it is in terms of pacing and excitement. For every scene that's fun to watch, there's another that's just plot-stopping, whether it's watching the survivors move from one bland-looking corridor to another, or Milla Jovovich jump-kicking zombie dogs in slow motion, or a computer program tiresomely going over the very simple zombie rules.
There are also some glaring technical faults that I'm surprised were't fixed or edited in post-production, such as an unbearably loud industrial score that blocks out most of the expository dialogue, most of it uttered by Colin Salmon, who if you're familiar with his work, already has a pretty quiet voice that'd be inaudible matched up against anyone else in the cast.
The zombies in this movie are your basic ""pale and rotting skin"" undead, some with the occasional missing bits of face and flesh. Unfortunately, the zombies in this film have goofy-looking mechanical movements, as if though their joints were so stiff, they could barely show much in the way of mobility. Maybe it's the effects of rigor mortis, but this makes zombies far less enjoyable to observe.
Most of the cast ranges from non-descript to just plain awful. Easily the worst of the bunch is Michelle Rodriguez, whose only distinct trait is a perpetual frown; she's given a lot of macho dialogue, but Jenette Goldstein she is not. Surprisingly, it's Jovovich who stands out as the film's kickass heorine. Sure, she's not much of an actress, but she's got the physical stuff down pat, for the most part. And she's cute enough that I don't mind seeing her in a slinky red dress, as well as a couple of scenes that briefly reveal some of her naughty bits.
Because there's hardly any gore, Resident Evil doesn't really work all that well as a zombie flick. And because it's not scary, horror is out of the question, too. But being a zombie fan, I'm prone to forgiving movies of this ilk simply because I'm pretty easy to please. Resident Evil is a passable enough timewaster, worth a rental, but it's certainly nothing I'll ever give much thought to again.
Compared to the recent spate of zombie horror, Resident Evil might very well be the most lackluster of the bunch. It's never as intriguing or intelligent as 28 Days Later or as marvelously thrilling as the Dawn of the Dead remake and it's never as hilariously enjoyable as the misguided House of the Dead, proving that mediocrity really can be less entertaining than plain awfulness.

"If you are unfamiliar with the incredible Resident Evil video games, watching this movie won't make you want to try them out.  And if you're a fan them, like myself, you're going to be set up for extreme disappointment.
First of all, there's not much here in common with the games, other than zombies and an occasional mention of the T-virus or some other phrase from the games.  Secondly, there is nothing frightening about this movie.  Unlike the games, all the instances of violence/gore/shock come across as very campy rather than scary.  Actually, ""campy"" may be the wrong word to use, as that would imply a bit of lightheartedness- this movie takes itself *way* too seriously.
You feel very little tension or buildup while watching, and you'll find yourself looking at the packaging halfway through to find out what the running time is.  It's just plain boring.  And of course, there's a setup for a sequel no one is asking them to make.
The only impressive thing about this film is the performance of lead actress Milla Jovovich, who seems to be the only involved in the movie who realizes this is based on a VIDEO GAME, not Shakespeare.  She did a great job considering the quality of the movie.  On the other hand, Michelle Rodriguez gives an eye-rollingly melodramatic performance as the token ""tough chick.""  The other actors either just stand around, get killed, or most likely, both.

But what turned me off was the tortured and borderline evil portrayal of God.  i was looking for something inspirational.  This movie had the opposite effect.  It seems to me the ""message"" of this movie is only tortured schizophrenics believe in God, and it does not give a very historically accurate version of Joan's personality according to the relatively reliable accounts we have.",2.0

"The directer Paul Anderson (MK/ Soldier/ Event Horrizon/) said this in the Making Of RE on the DVD. The question I have is, at what point in this movie does he ""hold true to the Video Game""? Who the heck is this ""Alice"" person? Where is the mansion? Where are the S.T.A.R.S.? Where is the Tyrant? Where is the music? Where is the ""world of survival horror? This movie is everything the VG is not. Which is exactly why I gave it two generous stars. People say, ""you can't expect the same thing, you can't expect all the puzzles and gadgets, you can't expect the same characters. Huh? What's that? Why call it Resident Evil? Paul Anderson has done great in the past, Mortal Kombat is a peach of flick if you ask me, and Event Horrizon was more scary than this and it was Sci-Fi. I don't get it either.
Paul, I know your a big director and I'm one of the little angry viewers that didn't ""get it"", but take some advice. Whenever you adapt something, be it a book or a video game, the idea is to truly stay true to the original by re-creating that atmosphere that made us jump at the zombies and the dogs crashing through those windows. The erie music that played over the vast rooms of the mansion and basements. The darkness that followed you everywhere. You did a good job with MK and I respect you for that. But I can't forgive you for what you did to a classic game and genre of Resident Evil.
Paul is now at the helm of Aliens Vs. Predator coming out later this year. I'll cross my fingers.",2.0

The original story was that Jill, Chris, Barry and Wesker were forced to stay in the mansion because there helicopter pilot abandoned them. The only thing from the game that the movie had right was the zombies. This movie only desreves 2 stars because first it was a bad movie and secondly it was not true to the original story. I hope that the sequel is true to Resident evil three.",2.0
"...on it's own, standard Hollywood fare. Don't go into this expecting a faithful take of the original ""Resident Evil"" game; that storyline was tossed out the window, with director Paul Anderson inserting his own cookie-cutter vision (lack of vision?), looking to cash in on the franchise name.
Anderson, in the liner notes, is called a ""fan"" of the RE video game series. Coulda fooled me, since his big-screen adaptation hardly has anything to do with RE. For whatever reason (ego? studio execs with zero inspiration beyond $$$?), Anderson decided to script his own ""prequel"" to the events of the first RE game. The game was a slow-paced creepfest, all about atmosphere. This film is typical Hollywood tripe, full of kung-fu babes, lame one-liners, wooden acting, obnoxiously-loud industrial metal music, and cheap ""things popping out of lockers"" scares.
The basic plotline: Umbrella, a sinister mega-corporation which profits from bio-engineering & genetic alteration aimed towards warfare while operating under the guise of a General-Electric type company, has a massive underground lab. Nine-to-fivers work there like they would in an ordinary office, live there, eat & shop there, shut away from the world above. This is all hidden under a pristine mansion. Some criminal jerk decides to steal a very lethal viral agent known as the T-Virus, intentionally loosing the virus in the process, causing all hell to break loose. Everybody down below dies, re-animate as zombies. A ""crack"" SWAT team swoops in to find an amnesiac agent and a do-gooder trying to bring down Umbrella. Zombies attack, and most of the squad dies in a laser room before most of the action goes down. Later, mutant dogs abd beasts attack, Milla does her ""Matrix"" routine....you get the point.
Anderson turned a great game series into a convoluted mess. There is no ""Red Queen"" killer computer in the game. No underground office workers. No Alice the Zombie Killer. The script is paper-thin. Here's a great example; Team Leader: ""Report, soldier."" Jovovich as Alice: ""What?"". Good stuff, eh? Michelle Rodriguez will make you wonder how she gets paid to act, irritating you beynd belief in the process. She plays a Vazquez-from-Aliens ripoff character, snarling the entire movie in an effort to play a tough commando chick. The rest? Uh, doesn't matter since you barely even learn any of their names. Bad zombie effects, mediocre CGI work (including some zombies), blasting music....meant as a distraction, I believe, from the awful screenplay.
There's no crumbling Spencer Mansion. No odd puzzles to solve. No lone zombie wandering a dark hallway. No mouldering tombs to search. No blackened catacombs. No Trevor family. No freak mutations like the massive snake Yawn, Plant 42, Lisa Trevor, the shark Momma Neptune, or the dreaded Tyrant. No moody atmosphere of being stranded in a remote mansion, looking for your missing comrades without a clue as to what happened. No horror of discovering sinister experiments. In fact, there's nothing in this movie that made the game so creepy and effective. It was all there; perfect source material to make a truly frightening film. Sadly, it was all trashed in favor of pretty actors and lame Matrix-like action. In other words, Hollywood took another promising franchise and turned it into the typical garbage that they churn out day after day. On it's own, the film is your average Hollywood action/horror job, indistinguishable from the rest of its ilk. As a RE film, it is a complete bomb & miserable failure.
Want a great RE movie experience? Buy a GameCube and the Resident Evil remake. The graphics are amazing, and the mood is perfect. Play it in the dark and you start looking over your shoulder. Want a bad RE movie experience? Pop this film into your DVD player and you start looking over your shoulder for the nearest exit. Shame on you, Paul W.S. Anderson. What does the W.S. stand for? Writes Sh*t? Next time, stick to the storyline and spare us your own embarrassing version of things.",2.0

"Watch this one and then watch the silent 1928 Passion of Joan of Arc. It's the difference between a comic book and Les Miserables. I've seen most of the Joan films except the one with Ingrid Bergman, which I haven't been able to find. I'm not an expert on the historical Joan, but I can compare films. The Joan films have been good, bad, and indifferent. The silent film is beyond compare. This one falls somewhere between bad and indifferent. Someone else mentioned the mix of accents. It drove me crazy. Most of the French army sounded more English than the English and Joan sounded like she was from Illinois. I also get extremely annoyed with historically based films that feel compelled to dumb down the dialogue by salting the dialogue with contemporary-usage obscenities and vulgarities. As a historical novelist myself, one of the things I research meticulously is the slang of the period. Nothing pulls you out of a historical moment like a 20th century slang coming form a long-ago character. I guess ultimately I have to say it's an ok movie to rent, but I wouldn't spend money on it. If you want to buy a Joan film, opt for the 1928 silent. The added orchestral score is wonderful. The acting will break your heart. This one *shrug*

"This movie is so painfully inaccurate, one could assume it was written by someone who not only has no notion of who Joan of Arc was historically, but also has no reverence for her as a saint. Joan of Arc had two brothers, not a sister. Domremy was not attacked by the Burgundians or the English, as it was already English territory. Joan heard the voices of Saint Catherine, Saint Margaret, and Saint Michael. Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret were the dominant voices. She also spoke of the voices comforting her, not terrorizing her for following their direction. I despise this representation of Joan as a broken, pathetic, and incredibly insane antihero. Anyone who has given the time and thought to reading her trial transcripts would know that she was so much more than this film could possibly pretend to portray.",2.0
"""Resident Evil"" was, originally a series of really enjoyable video games. With a dark, creepy atmosphere that could make you jump out of your seat, it created a world in which you could easily go into. It also had the reputation of being a very graphic and gory game. Another great element of the games was the plot; you had to resolve many puzzles, and your intelligence was required to play.
The same things are not all true in ""Resident Evil"", the film.
""Resident Evil"" tells the story of a woman who had been rescued from a virus infested research center. She awakens later on, she has forgotten everything. After that, a military team takes her and brings her back in the research facility, when the effects of the virus are no longer contagious. They find that the release of the deadly virus was a conspiracy. But there are many problems on their way; some almost invincible zombies, a main system (which takes the aspect of a little girl) that wants to kill every intruder, and a security system that turns against them.
In the case of ""Resident Evil"", it's not the movie itself that is so bad, it's all those little things that are messed up, without ruining completely the quality of the movie. If you've seen ""Deep Blue Sea"" and liked it, then you'll love Resident Evil. As much as ""Deep Blue Sea"" was a very simple and common model of what a suspense movie turns out to be in Hollywood, ""Resident Evil"" is another clone of that model. What I mean by that is the presence of the similar elements, which mostly are: A good-looking girl, a bunch of men that get killed one by one, a spectacular enemy, some high-tech facilities and equipment, a very simple scenario, some violence (not graphic enough to gross out the average teenager, which is 80% of their target audience, but not mild enough to be rated PG-13), and some cool looking action sequences. It's a formula that works many times, and they chose it for a movie that promised so much, but did not deliver what the real ""Resident Evil"" fans like.
A movie that could have been so much more...I could easily criticize the plot, or the actors, but you know how it is, and we all know how it is. It's just normal, common, average...it has nothing special...it is an excuse to make a movie. I'll still have to admit that Milla Jovovich is not only a beautiful woman, but she's also a pretty good actress. Even though her role in ""Resident Evil"" did not require a lot of talent, she's still able, sometimes, to make us share the shivers she plays on the screen.
The points where I would focus a little more are two very important elements in the ""Resident Evil"" video games. Like I said before, originally, these games were moody and gory. Two major deceptions here. The gore...ARGH! I just can't take it, it's made by computer! This is a message to all directors: If you want to put any gore in your films, do it the old fashioned way. Digital blood looks fake, digital monsters look fake...Even with some very cheap gore/creature effects, you can do a better job than the one they did in ""Resident Evil""...the same thing is true in Blade...Every single mutilation in ""Resident Evil"" was made in CGI, and every single one of them really looks bad. (Spoilers) There's a part where more than half a dozen soldiers are cut in pieces by lasers (and it really deceived me to see that three quarters of the human characters die in two minutes...human characters were the only hope of seeing a gore scene in this film, because the zombies in this film have coagulated blood, which is, for sure, realistic and intelligent, but absolutely not satisfying for the gore fans) and some heads are cut off, some bodies are cut in cubes. But every darn death looks so fake! Even in the excellent low-budget Canadian movie ""Cube"", the effect with the guy that gets sliced into dices is really, really, really, really, a thousand times better than all of ""Resident Evil""'s reunited gore moments. I'm sick of CGI gore...and all CGI made movies...this is removing all the human aspects of movies...people are amazed to see things that were made with computers and almost look real...Yeah, they almost look real, but if they were done like before, they would look even more real! Well, what is the point of being impressed with things that could be a lot more simple and look better if they were done like before...It's not because technology exists that films should overuse it...Technology is a tool, and many film makers don't understand it.
The other aspect, the mood, is not delivered the same way...it's more like a futuristic atmosphere, with a certain lack of terror, a very ""Blockbuster"" atmosphere, with nothing really eerie. The music is not bad, but it certainly is not as creepy as the one in the games. The zombies are not scary at all, and the other ""creatures"" are plain laughable.
They kept some elements from the games, and that's a good thing. The city is still ""Raccoon City"", the train really is identical to the one in the game of ""Resident Evil 2"", (Spoilers) the city in the end really seems to be an image taken from the game, it's the Umbrella Corporation, etc. But, talking about that ending, which is actually pretty good, I would have seen the whole movie setting in the Raccoon City streets, like we do in the beginning of ""Resident Evil 2"" (the game).
Overall, I'd say that ""Resident Evil"" really is a disappointment, especially if you were a big fan of the games, but for those who haven't heard of the games and saw the movie and thought it was good, you should definitely check these games out! ""Resident Evil"", the movie, is a very common piece of entertainment, that, without being bad, simply offers some acceptable entertainment, some mild thrills, and an easy and agreeable night at the theater. It really is nothing impressive, but it's very ordinary recipe of Hollywood thriller that puts itself under a name that has acquired reputation with the years.

"As a movie, certainly entertaining, but don't look for anything historical here since it must have been a Joan from an alternate universe being depicted.  For example, in this movie Joan has deep angst about her sword she may have found in a field.

While in fact this Sword:

""- --In place of the sword offered to her she described in detail the location and appearance of a sword in the Chapel of St Catherine de Fierbois.  It was found deeply buried exactly where she had described and the blade was so covered in rust it would have been impossible for her to describe it without having seen it before.  The rust readily fell off when the blade was wiped. -- ""

Perhaps this film is a conspiracy of the irreverent, irreligious and atheistic working  to ""deconstruct"" Joan; to convince a modern, uninformed audience she was a raving schizoid lunatic leading the superstitiously ignorant to lucky victory; with a flaming end.  Or not.

Aside from that, I found it entirely entertaining filled with arrow sticking battle scenes and screaming mayhem.  Once I brainwashed myself into believing that actress Milla Jovovich was portraying a personality from the bizzaro world instead of a real-life historically significant figure, I actually enjoyed the film.

I give it 5 stars minus 3:
1 For Milla Jovovich
1 For the incredible exciting siege sequence
-1 for being magnificently historically inaccurate
-1 For conning me to believe this was a movie about Joan of Arc
-1 For being so unfaithful  to her hard to believe true story making up stuff when it's so easy to Google it out the Real Deal otherwise (hmm, insult my intelligence comes to mind...)

Buy it for the two stars though, the siege IS really good...",2.0
"Throughout the years, the story of Joan of Arc has stimulated the production of several motion pictures. Her life, actions and words have inspired and intrigued for more than five hundred years. From a historical standpoint, it is unfortunate that we do not know enough about Joan of Arc's life to fully understand who she was and what she did. While what she accomplished cannot be denied, and her recorded letters, speeches and trial manuscripts form a profile, much of what we know of Joan comes from eyewitness accounts and the memoirs of those around her. Due to these historical obstacles, writers and cinema directors will always have room for individual interpretation when relating her tale.

In 1999 ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"" was released in theatres as a full length feature film. Director Luc Besson's intention with the film was to accentuate the fact that we cannot prove what her visions were or from whence they came, and in doing so cast doubt on Joan's legend. Unfortunately, while depicting Joan as a schizophrenic, hesitant self doubter, he also made some glaring historical mistakes.

The first inaccuracy occurs at the very start of the movie. While Joan's village is being sacked by the English, she is hiding in a closet, watching her sister being killed and having her corpse raped. Admittedly, this does assist in creating the image of Joan as a traumatized nut-job, however, her sister was certainly never murdered or raped.

Secondly, the movie fails to accurately present Joan's wound received at Orleans. It makes no mention of her specifically foretelling her being shot with an arrow between her ""left neck and shoulder"", during that specific battle. More importantly, in the movie, Joan passes out from the wound and awakens the next morning. In reality, Joan was treated and returned to rejuvenate and lead the French soldiers in a final attack, which resulted in the victory.

Perhaps the most disturbing errors occur during Joan's trial, shortly before her execution. This is the best documented and most historically evident portion of Joan's life. Meticulous minutes were kept recording every spoken word, and most of the trying members wrote notes concerning the atmosphere of the room and Joan's demeanor and reactions to the questions. Joan was given a wooden bench to sit on and always remained fully chained. Throughout the trial, Joan remained courageous and absolutely steadfast in her faith and beliefs, confidently answering fully any questions asked of her, excepting those which she believed God to have forbid her to. In the movie, she is standing, and only chained at the wrists. In addition, she is stuttering and unconfident, not sure of herself. She is shown to not only begin to doubt what she had done and lose faith, it is also intimated that she did kill during the battles, which is untrue.

While whether or not the viewer will enjoy this movie is probably based on their beliefs as to whom Joan of Arc was as a person, which is relatively subjective, the historical mistakes are unforgivable. This movie fails to paint an accurate or truthful picture of Joan because of these misconstrued facts, which stem wholly from the creators apparent need to vilify and lay suspicion on her.

The DVD does get 2 stars (instead of 1) because it was in fact shot well, with decent special effects and good cinematography. Also, Joan of Arc material is limited and for the most part inaccurate, so this movie is just as good as any.",2.0
"... I was appalled by this adaptation. Everything that made the games so overwhelming - the feeling of dread and isolation, the brooding music, the terrifying jolts when zombies crash in on you, the complex relationships between the characters, the paranoia of who can be trusted and who not, and above all the excellent story about the mother of all corrupted corporations, Umbrella - all this has been reduced to nothing.
Instead we have yet another Matrix ... with thumping techno-soundtracks, a Lara Croftian tough babe with more one-liners you can recall, ... cgi, mind-numbing action (so what do you do when a zombie dog comes running for your throat? You whirl around mid-air three times and kung fu kick it right in the face!), and predictable plot twists.
The only redeeming ingredient is Milla Jovovich, who actually tries to put some depth in her character. Overall the best actors in this film are the zombies. In other words, everything you loved in the videogame has been torn to shreds in hope for a quick buck at the matinee. Avoid.",2.0
"In the opening scene a thirteen-year-old Joan of Arc witnesses English soldiers burning her village and raping and murdering her sister.  This much is true: the real Joan of Arc's village was pillaged when she was thirteen.  She never had a sister.  The villagers took refuge in a nearby castle.  Those invaders weren't English and were probably about thirty years younger than the actors chosen for the scene.

Nearly all of the principal roles in this film are miscast.  The historical Joan of Arc was seventeen years old and not very pretty.  King Charles VII was twenty-six.  Most of the leading soldiers were around the same age.  Decades of war and disease had decimated the older generation.

This film consistently begs the question of how its unstable heroine ever rose to power, depicts her as the bewildered observer of her own success, and portrays king Charles VII as the thoroughly unworthy object of her devotion.  Don't look here for subtle characterizations.  Factions line up from the moment they meet Joan of Arc and wait for the chance to act (which, given the story's repeated assertions about her insignificance, is pretty odd).

Historically accurate details make their appearance in awkward and disruptive ways.  Older biopics about Joan of Arc generally had sanitized violence and bloodless battles.  This film is gruesome in all the wrong ways.  It is also true that some fifteenth-century hedonists liked to eat dinner in a bathtub built for two.  No record suggests Charles VII ever did this - he was actually known for his piety - and the film's decision to plop him into one seems based on the assumption that John Malkovich needs props to be sufficiently creepy.

The Messenger isn't exactly an anti-historical film.  Many of its story and character elements have respectable pedigrees.  Some twentieth-century scholars treat Joan of Arc as more of a psychological case study than a political or military leader.  I doubt it was the filmmakers' intention to discredit these theories by dramatizing how unsatisfactory they are as narrative, but in this respect at least The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc succeeds.",2.0
"i ran into blockbuster excited to watch this movie. i am a big fan of joan and i like many others had big expectations for the movie. this movie was done the wrong way in many ways possible. who made the idea to have ""joan of arc"" the savior of the republic of france, to make her into a total lunatic? i know she had a minor case of epilepsy but she's not no EMILY ROSE. (in case you don't know emily rose she was a girl who was a epileptic that was so intence she was supposely possessed by demons.) how can u do such a thing? they made joan so annoying i didn't want to watch it no more. the action was not good at all. u could tell some of the cast of the movie were atheists because they made it look like those signs were not real. those signs were left by GOD and they were not by coincedence. don't bother pick it up and if you do, i doubt u will watch it again. this is the miami reviewer.

"I decided to give this movie a try despite the many negative reviews.  Boy was I sorry!  This film is a travesty so save your time (and your money if you're thinking of buying).  Milla Jovovich simply doesn't have the acting ability to pull this role off, plain and simple.  She portrays Joan as a wild-eyed nut case and somehow it's hard to generate much sympathy for her in the end.  Add to that the ridiculous dialogue (somehow I can't see 13th century people using the 21st century expression ""whatever!"") and you have a mess of a movie.  The sets and costumes are fairly good and the battle scenes reasonably realistic but that's about all I can say for it.

Go elseware for the story of St. Joan!",2.0
"Besson's film on the legendary Joan of Arc leaves mixed results. Although he presented an original angle in showing her to be less than heavenly inspired, Besson has seriously and uneffectively distorted several documented facts about Joan of Arc. This is rendered worse by a bad script and questionable acting.

All historical accounts suggest that Joan of Arc was soberly persistent in her pleas for the Dauphin to give her an army but she was never the delusional psychotic as shown in the movie. Her visions were inspired by the Saints and not by Christ Himself. All accounts are conclusive in that Joan of Arc was leading as a symbol of inspiration to the army and never once raised a weapon against the enemy: she never shed any blood. Finally, Joan of Arc never reneged her faith or retracted her statements about her divine mission: that's why she was put on the stake.

The film is unique in showing Joan of Arc more as the political puppet that she was in real life and how she became a liability after the crowning of the Dauphin in Orleans. The film also shows Joan as a person suffering from a dissociative disorder rather than being a divine messenger. John Malcovich and Faye Dunaway play their roles well as the Dauphin and the Regent Queen. Mila Jojovich is the worst performance in the film and, with her being the main character, the quality of the whole film is reduced to below average.  The battle and siege scenes are interesting but perhaps a little exaggerated.

The movie is perhaps worth renting once but this is certainly not the best rendition on this most intriguing of Christian saints/martyrs.",2.0
"Is the director French?  Is Joan not a French heroine?  If the answer is yes to both questions, then I have a hard time understanding why Besson makes her ""confess"" that all her great deeds were a mistake.  It doesn't bother me to interpret Joan of Arc as a lunatic - for all I know she may have been schizophrenic indeed!  (What else makes you hear voices?)  What I don't like is the notion that Joan herself lost faith in her own cause, questioned her own motives and regretted what she did, as apparently Besson makes her do at the end.  That's not my idea of a heroine or hero.",2.0
"The first fifteen minutes of the film are mesmerizing as young Joan of Arc is explored with her leanings towards enjoying confession and how she got her calling. A fascinating openning.
The only justification for the two stars I gave it.
Then unfortuneately, Mila Jovanivich takes over as the grown up Joan of Arc.  A very unfortunate casting choice. She runs the gamut of acting emotions  ranging  from a to b.  She gawks in amazement and her eyes bulge with absolutely nothing underneath. She is unconvincing and annoying in this role.
To add to this, her hair color changes from scene to scene. One scene she is blonde then she is brunette. Is this to distract us from her acting? Is this a God given hair color change? Or is it a vision from  Clairol?

Faye Dunaway and John Malkovich give good performances but they are not in enough of the movie to save it. By the time Dustin Hoffman shows up at the end, who even cares?
 Aside from the great opening, the hole mishmash shows no insight into Joan of Arc.  After the fascinating opening--the ball is dropped and that is the director and lead actor's fault.  Lead a nation in battle? This woman can't lead a movie.
Haven't seen other versions of the Joan of Arc Story but this definitely isn't the one to see.",2.0

"I have read like three books on Joan of Arc and I have seen the mini-series on NBC, starring LeeLee Sobieski (I love you!).  Everything I have seen or read about Joan of Arc, Jean d'Arc, was better than The Messenger.  Joan was a kind, wonderful person but this movie made her look like a maniac that should be put away.  Though I have to say Milla Jovovich played a wonderful crazy person.  Joan's visions weren't even correct.  In the movie she saw some man that looked like Jesus, while in life she saw Saints, such as St. Catherine.  The war scenes were gruesome, but I liked them; they were realistic.  Another thing wrong was how Joan found her sword.  She didn't find it in a meadow, as if someone dropped it there and she found it.  Her voices told her that the sword was in St. Catherine's temple around the alter, so she sent some of her men to the temple and they found it buried by the alter just as she said.  No one else knew it was there before.  I was so upset after watching this movie, because it didn't show the true Joan of Arc.  I would recomend reading Joan of Arc by Mark Twain to find the real Joan of Arc.",2.0
"""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"" is nothing more than a by-the-numbers film created with liberal use of ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Directing the Medeival Epic."" I have been vastly entertained by director Luc Besson's work in the past, but this film is a plodding, gore-drenched nod toward Mel Gibson's vastly superior ""Braveheart."" ""The Messenger"" completely lacks all of the finer emotions that make an epic story compelling, despite the true nature of the people and some of the events. ""The Messenger"" also revels in its violence and grit, rather than trying to create something realistic (and more convincing). Milla Jovovich turns in an annoying performance as the shrieking saint, who does not inspire her troops so much as berate them in her holier-than-thou manner. The film's topics are interesting (was Joan really a saint who could speak to God, or was she just insane and driven by rage?), but the execution is poor. On top of this, the scripting and dialogue is just plain bad. If you want an epic, I suggest looking elsewhere. Maybe somebody out there will make a better picture about this fascinating historic figure.",2.0
"It is definitely a Hollywood version. They have changed a lot the real history of Joan D'Arc. I don't think that Joan of Arc was angry all the time like they present her in the movie. Joan, according to the story heard voices from three saints, St. Catherine, St. Margaret and St. Michael. But in the movie they present three images and they never speak. Is like the same angel or saint in three different ages. The movie has more o less a slow pace and it turns really boring after 3/4 parts of the movie had elapsed. I think the version of Joan of Arc, starred by Lelee Sobieski is more loyal to what really happened than this one. Even the one in black & white with Ingrid Bergman was even better than this one.",2.0
"Having been somewhat fascinated by the life of Joan of Arc, and entertained by the French flair of Director Luc Besson's movies, it pains me to say that my disappointment in THE MESSENGER is most profound.  Truly, with such a promising opening scene and more than a couple of excellent actors at its disposal - not to mention a mythical and supernatural aura intertwined with an amazing history - one would expect, even at the very least, a little glimmer of brilliance.
Yet, apparently, it never was meant to be.  However, I must say, the movie opens promisingly enough:  There's the pious child, Joan d'Arc, living her bright yet humble life in the 15th century French countryside. - She is portrayed at once as being extraordinarily blessed and preternaturally enlightened, by Heaven.  There's Music of Angels singing ecstatic praise, Visions of Divine Power moving nature around her, and Voices of ""Him."" (Be it Deity, Angel, Archangel, or perhaps her own Subconscious Soul?  I cannot tell...) - All so enticing and gravitating her toward Heavenly bliss.
Yet it is within minutes of these glorious opening scenes that everything takes a very dark turn.  Suddenly, the child Joan sees the storm clouds culminate as the wolves and the English Army thunder in.  The sight of this is quite ominous -- not only for the child Joan, but for the entire course of the movie as well.  It's a shame - because, from here, THE MESSENGER actually could very well have become a movie of remarkable depth, voice and vision.
Instead, the whole thing engulfs itself in blustering failures - its own annihilation ignited with the first sight of Milla Jovovich as Joan, the peasant girl, suddenly all grown up.  She makes her first appearance having somehow made her way to the castle of Chinon with a message to the Dauphin Charles VII, France's heir to the crown.  The movie offers no explanation as to how this unknown teenage girl had come to be known as the ""Maid of Lorraine,"" nor of how she had made her way into the French Court.
Apart from various transitional errors and a stunning lack of continuity, this picture further bears the awesome burden of poor casting and an even poorer script.  John Malkovich (Dauphin Charles VII) did a fine enough job of it - however, the script, relative to the role, was not compatible with his talents - and he was very blatantly miscast.  As for Milla Jovovich:  Well, I cannot say much about that folly, actually, without blasting away all credibility to her as an actress.  Truly, that's something I really do not wish to do.  Really, I must say in her defense that it seems she was obliged to make do with a script that made her sound like a borderline psychotic and rebellious adolescent somewhat of the present-day variety.  It's impossible to buy the possibility that anyone in the French Army would even consider following her lead.
Sadly enough, the only reason I halfway speak in her defense is that she seemed to speak her lines as if she hated every single word of them - and her every look seemed to disdain the movie.  OK - Well, regardless, even for that, I guess I cannot in my heart of hearts give her any credit as an actress.
Finally, I must give no insignificant amount of credit to Dustin Hoffman (the Voice), Faye Dunaway (Mother-In-Law to the Dauphin, Princess d'Aragon), and Timothy West (Pierre Cauchon - a prominent figure in Joan's final trial) for making the most of a flippant and shallow script.
Finally, all the more I can say about this movie is that it could have been great, with only a bit more insight.  It's a shame that it fell the other way....",2.0
"The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (Luc Besson, 1999)

As the final credits rolled, I found myself asking one thing many times: what in the world was (fill in the actor, director, etc.) thinking? Besson, who gave us such amusing and occasionally brilliant fare as Leon and Nikita, went way off the deep end. Milla Jovovich, who worked so well with Besson in The Fifth Element, delivers every line as if she's being forced to overact. John Malkovich is about as French as a quesadilla. Etc. One wonders why this got a big-screen release and Christian Duguay's incredibly superior three-hour Joan of Arc, release the same year, got relegated to TV miniseries status.

Mother always said that if you can't say anything good, then shut up. So I'll just say that if you're looking for a modern retelling of the tale of St. Joan, Duguay's version is available on DVD. Rent it. Forget this exists. *  (only because Dustin Hoffman actually gives a halfway decent performance; too bad he's only got about ten minutes of screen time.)",2.0
"Well, you can be sure you'll be treated to your fair share of glorious Plantagenet hairdos if you rent this DVD. Almost everyone in the (fabulous) cast - even John Malkovich - has one. But alas the hair styles are about the only source of genuine cheer; almost everything else is a let-down.
Malkovich had a peach of a part as the dastardly, conniving Dauphin, but played it amazingly straight, with nary a hint of the cheeky chappie the role was crying out for. What would Alan Rickman have made of it, I wonder. Or even Bruce Willis?
He certainly wasn't helped by the dreadful pacing of the first half - it is a full hour before Joan has even got her army, let alone used it - the first 60 minutes being devoted to tedious back story leading to Joan's appearance in the Dauphin's court; by turns voyeuristic (was she a virgin? Spend ten minutes finding out!), gratuitously violent (the murder and necrophilia of Joan's sister), and just plain daft (recurring visions of a remarkably camp Jesus in a forest surrounded by wolves).
The gratuitous violence is a serious blight on the film; the murder/rape scene was arguably relevant to the plot but still was depicted with more detail and relish than necessary, and the remainder of the film overflows with dogs, wolves and crows gobbling human carrion and more battlefield amputations and decapitations than probability would dictate. I'm sure these earned the film its 18 restriction when, fundamentally, it could have quite easily avoided them.
But for all the above, I think the main problem with this film is Luc Besson himself. The early stages are laden with meaningless cliches - wolves streaming through the forest, girl running through meadows - and laboured imagery (crucifix, fire, dripping blood and a combination thereof) which get the film off to a bad start from which it never recovers.
And thereafter Besson unwisely tries to have a bob each way. On one hand, he takes the historically faithful/dramatised documentary angle - this is really how it happened, you see - but on the other he plays the dreamy, psychedelic/quasi-spiritual card at the same time. Which isn't how it happened, at all.
Most peculiar were Joan's visions of Jesus. It really isn't clear what we are meant to take from these: Did Joan really see visions of Jesus (as a boy and - heavily made up with eye-shadow, a beard and a toga - apparently as a member of Slade), or was she simply a paranoid schizophrenic, not in need of an army to march on the British so much as Professional Help?
Besson doesn't answer this fundamental question, and the introduction of Dustin Hoffman at the end of the film, seemingly imbued with magical powers, really doesn't help. I still don't know what Hoffman was meant to do in the film or who he was. Was he Jesus? Was he Joan's conscience? Or just more evidence that she really was nuts? Or was HE the lead guitarist from Slade?
All in all, hairdos aside, a pretty dissatisfying night in.",2.0
"He has ever had passion to explore some aspects of women, but now he's a ""grown up"". I don't want to see Englishmen, Americans and French themselves playing French in a movie describing history facts, we can not find THE REASON France fought with England when those emotions has been confused a lot. Though I like Milla Jovovich, always. About French's madness, if you are interested in it's beauty and mystery (in this movie, it is expressed little and not so completely), I recommend ""Beatrice"" and ""the ninth gate""(but I've ever seen few French movies). Notice how those people betray God; the ways are funny sometimes and beautiful sometimes, though are cruel (cruelty is based on despair) the same time, of course. I don't know how successful the two movies are, in trying to touch the thought of God, since I myself do not really understand God and find it is hard to understand a little more; at least I am sure they are closer than this one.",2.0
"Milla Jovovich as Joan of Arc. No. I don't think so. She tries, she really does. She invests her all into this role, and sometimes she does very well. But does she inspire legions of men to defend her and to defend France? Does she convey the kind of passion and compassion that could inspire so many men to believe in her? I think Jovovich errs too much in that she plays the role a little too far down the ""insanity"" line. This is a debate for some... was Joan of Arc a holy, saintly woman who really heard voices or was she simply insane? Who will ever know for sure? In this portrayal though Jovovich overacts and instead of conveying the passion of someone for whom her religion is sacred she conveys insanity. The story of Joan of Arc has been done better and more convincingly, and this film, while visually stunning, does not compare to earlier versions. Nice try.",2.0
"You know I have heard a lot of people love this movie, but when I watched it I was utterly dissapointed.  I have played every Resident Evil game that has came out and I loved every single one of them.  One of the things I liked about the game was the well developed plot.  This movie does a horrible thing to that plot.  First the movie is about a a virus that allows the dead to come to life as zombies that wander lifelessly feeding off human flesh.  First the mansion would have been better left off the movie entirly it served no purpose other than to give us a few glimpses.  Whatever they did to the police teams was atrocious and it still leaves me confused.  The movie throws you into a situation where the police are holding people hostage during a raid on the house.  I must say the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent special effects, but they do not make up for the mutilated and awkward plot that was created.",2.0
"This movie uhhhh, stunk. Period. Milla Jovovich was so bad I wanted to burn HER not Joan...HER! In fact all the acting from the ""stars"" was horrible including John Malkovich who you'd think would excel in such a role. The fight scenes were so utterly ridiculous...as in: Joan gets shot with the arrow while on the ladder and suddenly the BATTLE STOPS!! INCREDIBLE. The attempts at humorous banter were so bad it actually makes you uncomfortable. About the only redeeming quality of this waste of a movie is the scenic landscapes. And thats the ONLY reason I  gave it 2 stars.",2.0
"It seems that Luc Besson is capable of reaching deep inside of this Milla Jojovich and bringing out a beautiful monster.  Her portrayal of one of the least understood of our most famous icons is intense, and thoughtful - bringing the viewer full circle around the character of Joan of Arc.
Unfortunately, Jojovich is the the only relief from what is a long and generously violent flick.  There are a number of ""spirtual"" moments in the film which deal with her supposed communication with God.  However, it is apparent that Besson has his predetermined notions as to whether Joan of Arc was indeed divine or disturbed and we are never really given the opportunity to consider the other.
Unfortunately for Besson, this is the first movie to involve knights, castles, and battles since Braveheart(Gibson, 1995) which seems to have become the obvious comparison.  Even the ""revenge"" story is not dissimilar enough from the Braveheart ""righteous revenge"" theme to encourage excitement about The Messenger.
Even an ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"" style performance from Dustin Hoffman does not detract from the fact that by the time you have sat through The Messenger, you will really feel that you have seen it all before.",2.0
"I bought this in the vague hope of stumbling on one more underpublicized and underappreciated (in the US) French masterpiece such as Claude Berri's  Queen Margot.  Not quite!  There are certainly aspects of brilliance here  both in the cinematography and Mila Jovovich's performance, but there is a  tremendous amount of anarchy and occasional apparent aimlessness in the  plot.  Of course the Joan of Arc story is well known, but many times, the  director seemed to let things ramble on without good tie ins.  It's a long  film, but that shouldn't be a vice.  Here it is, because long portions  could be cut without harming the overall effect.  Better yet, the themes  could have been better established and linked and the character development  focused better.  Apart from the title character, everyone else was pretty  much constructed of cardboard.
What really offended me about The Messenger was the  dialogue, which in many places is simply ludicrous.  There is plenty of  90's colloquialism and plenty of medieval cliche, but very little authentic  sounding conversation reflecting the status relationships between French  nobility (and royalty) and peasants.  At the same time, there are some  cheap, Keystone coppish antics in which the ostensible army leaders bumble  like the Three Stooges, while Joan takes some implausible action.  In these  respects, at least, The Messenger demonstrates that the Hollywood lowest  common denominator can be at home on the Continent as well.  This sort of  triviality really disappoints me, as I think it did a lot to mediocratize  another film which should have been very good, Mel Gibson's Patriot.  All  in all, what is frustrating is that this could also have been a very worthy  effort, perhaps memorable, but fails because the whole was far less than  the sum of the parts.",2.0
"Unfocused, overproduced, over-ambitious and overlong, that is the best way to describe this uneven period action movie/tragedy/religious melodrama. That's really too bad because it had potential and some great actors in it;  Faye Dunaway, John Malkovich and Dustin Hoffman. Starting with the cast,  Mila Jovovich was simply wrong for the role, 'Joan of Arc' is just as  complex a character as 'Blance DuBois', it was just too difficult for her  but who can blame her for trying. She was miscast in a vital role and  overdoes it a lot, but then she isn't even an actress, she was originally a  model that's always been typecast for roles where exotic looks where  needed. Faye Dunaway is under-appreciated, John Malkovich is simply miscast  in a role that makes him look silly and childish and Dustin Hoffman just  plain seems awkward in the role of devil?/angel?/conscience?. For a period  film it is too Hollywoodized, strange considering the French cast and  foreign director, it also fails to capture the times with silly accents and  unimpressive sets, costumes and makeup. The battle scenes have an extremely  low credibility level and look cartoonish. And the 'miracle sequences'  where Joan is visited by God are ridiculous, the guy that plays Jesus  looked more like a freak that the son of God, his looks are really  distracting. It tries to be 'Braveheart' (a much better film) at times but  fails miserably and near the end it violently changes direction to  religious melodrama. This are the film's best scenes where they start to  question whether Joan really saw God and even those sequences are overlong.  And the final burning at the stake, which should of been poignant or  dramatically successful is dull and unrewarding. The stylized direction by  Besson is completely inadequate here, it works well in films like 'La Femme  Nikita' (his best film) or even 'The Professional', but not here. Note: if  Joan really saw God (and I'm not saying she didn't), I wonder why he  preferred the French armies to the English, there's a religious  contradiction right there. God loves all and doesn't wish war and  manslaughter for anybody. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 4!",2.0
"Gosh, this film disagreed with me. Overlong, extremely shallow and with a tone that varies from comical slapstick to brutal fight sequences, watching  this film at that cinema was a mind, heart and buttock-numbing exercise.  Confirming the suspicion that Luc Besson is essentially a grown-up man with  a child's understanding of cinema, it's stylish, inconsistent, and with no  depth of any kind. The film seems like a terrible waste of talent -  Jovovich's edgy, verging-on-madness portrayal of the title character,  whilst never particularly subtle, nonetheless explodes with gusto, and the  battle sequences are highly entertaining in a grim and gritty,  post-'Excalibur' style. The rest of the film is a mess, though. Jeanne's  heavenly visions contain the worst kind of cliched mid-80's pop video  imagery imaginable, not a single line of dialogue stands out (except for  the well-known transcriptions of Jeanne's trial, taken from court records  of the time), and Eric Serra's music sounds rooted in the 1930's, when it  isn't using a 'Fifth Element'-style breathy 'thrum' noise. The tone veers  alarmingly - the opening sequence features Asterix-style comic English  soldiers, pantomime crooked teeth and all, brutally raping and murdering  Jeanne's sister. Later on, Jeanne's expedition to attack Paris is reduced  to a 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'-style 'attack the castle' fiasco,  whilst the ending tries a stab at indie art, with Dustin Hoffman as  Jeanne's 'conscience'. And it's much too long.",2.0
"Well, after just finished watching this rather, er, unusual video, I can finally give my honest opinion. First of all, I can agree with many others that the historical accuracy left something to be desired seeing as how  much of today's generation seems to take historical movies as the whole  truth and nothing but the truth.  As for the acting, I found her to be  rather, shall we say, odd? As I stared at her I couldn't help myself wonder  if she was about to scream in rage and burst into flames. It would make  someone wonder if she was sane of mind. In my opinion, the actress who  played Joan of Arc made her appear to be a religeous nut case and a  complete lunatic.  And as far as the comment one of the other reviewers  made saying only a ""...religeous fanatic...Pat Robertson."" would  ever buy this video, I can't help perhaps think the contrary. I was rather  disturbed seeing Christ protrayed as a rather frightening man with almost  lunatic seeming eyes and an expression of one about to be executed.  In any  case, presenting all these down sides, I can at least say that at least the  movie had some good special effects and recreating some of those moments  were good. I'd comment on the good acting if it wasn't downright unnerving  watching it.",2.0

"Not being an owner of a game console such as a Playstation and the like, I have never spent much time actually playing any of the Resident Evil series. I tried to play them on my PC, but it always seemed like my top of the line PC was being dumbed down by playing console games on it, like it was getting a headache trying to think on the same level as a console. That said, I have however seen the games played by many of friends and know the Resident Evil stories, read some of the comics and a couple of the novels. I know and like the characters and all of the playable ones like Claire Redfield or Jill Valentine. Both have one quality, among others, that Mila Jovovich lacks in abundance- her character Alice is not very likeable. In fact, she isn't much of anything, she isn't even that attractive.
 The Resident Evil movie also has very little in common with its console video game forebears- other than it's title and that it has an evil corporation named Umbrella which has made a terrible virus that turns people into flesh eating zombies. Now, to me, this sounds like a match made in heaven. I'm a graduate of the George A. Romero school of zombie flicks and cut my teeth on Night, Dawn and Day of the Dead. I make no apologies for like spectacular gore- I want to see people being ripped in half with their intestines and other organs spilling out on the floor with wet goopy splatting noises like a bowl of rotten fruits being tipped over. I want limbs hacked off. I want people using 500 bullets to kill something instead of using just one. I want Peter Jackson `Bad Taste' and `Brain Damage' level gore. Resident Evil the movie has flesh eating zombies, but very little gore, very little actual eating of flesh. Almost none. So, what's the point?
 Anyway, the film is pretty much an amalgamation of some of the game stories, namely the virus being released and Umbrella trying to cover it up by gassing the residents of a watch house after someone attempts to steal the virus and purposely releases it. Alice, who awakes in the shower, has no memories of her past and is suddenly thrust in the middle of a commando raid as Umbrella attempts to gain access to `The Hive'- their massive underground research facility where the `T'-virus was made and subsequently released. Now, in the video game, everything Umbrella owns is made of rusted steel and looks to be about a hundred years old or painted a sickly medicinal green and splattered with mud and blood. The film, however, everything is cut from polished stainless steel and aluminum, all very sanitary and high tech, which doesn't fit the milieu.
 The commandos realize they'll have take down a powerful hologram-based AI known as the Red Queen, because she controls the whole Hive and they suspect she's insane. Entering through a glass corridor we get to watch as most of the team is cut into meat by lasers, including the grid laser seen in the commercial. But they wimp out- we barely see Number 1 cut into giblets Sylvester-running-through-the-chain-link-fence style, and get a semi decent slow motion decapitation. Now, in my mind, after the first laser had passed and killed two of the commandos, the next obvious move would be to roll a couple of grenades down the hallway- made entirely out of glass!! Instead, no, everyone dies, leaving only Alice, three commandos and a ineffectual cop to deal with it all.
 All in all, this film is nothing like the video games. None of its characters are likeable and truth be told, I wanted them all to die. However, the production values are very high and they obviously put a lot of care and thought into the end product. I'm also a big fan of Jon Anderson- Event Horizon will always be one of my favorite films. But in Resident Evil he changed too much, took too much away from the games that made them so effective. Very few of the monsters made it to the screen save for the lickers, which were underused and the undead skinless dogs, again, underused. Notice I have said much about the zombies? I haven't because there aren't exactly a lot of them, nor a lot of scenes with them.
 It's a zombie movie! For crying out loud, this is what people paid money to see and they give a very poor account of themselves. In this is where the film really falls apart- the zombies just didn't look dead enough, for the most part. It's like the make-up artists gave up before they were finished. The zombies didn't looked decayed enough, weren't feral enough, weren't missing enough body parts or bleeding enough. In short, they were one of the least satisfying portions of the film. I want gore...not scene after scene of high tech equipment and mean spirited characters with very few redeeming qualities. Dawn of the Dead could get away with being a character drama as well as a satirical portrait and scathing indictment of our consumerism-based society. Resident Evil is about gore and killing zombies in as many disgusting ways as possible and nothing else. Worse, the music had me reaching for an icepick to puncture my own eardrums it was so terrible.",2.0
"The score to this film was flawless but, the movie itself is just another average in my book. Marilyn Manson did the score for this movie and he did  a job! If you watch the commentary to this movie they said that they didn't want to show zombies in the beginning because, you knew that you were gonna see some any way. The film didn't even have enough gore to be a serious zombie movie. I give this 2.5 stars.",2.0
"I actually give this 2 1/2 stars. After watching Milla Jovovitch in The  Fifth Element, I was enchanted.  So much facial expression and wonderful  potential as a great actress.  Her acting doesn't disappoint in this film  either.  The others in the cast are in top form also; John Malkovitch,  Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway all give wonderful performances.  The  photography is stunning, the battles are exhilarating.  And yet the movie  falls short because of the poor presentation.  There was no real  connection, flow, or even story line between the battle sequences and her  dream sequences.  The editing fell short in tying the remarkable individual  elements into one sensible theme.  As another reviewer mentioned, it would  have been better if this movie had less going for it from the start, such  as the superb acting and extraordinary visuals.  By the time we get toward  the end of the movie when her conscious appears, I just wanted the movie to  end.",2.0
"If you think that this is an inspiring movie such as Braveheart which Mel Gibson acted so brilliantly as Sir Richard Wallace, you would be extremely disappointed with this offering. Luc Besson's movies are always interesting  to watch with beautiful cinematography & French flair. But this latest  offering, despite it still shares those traits, it could become  disillusioned at times.  I couldn't stand Milla Jovovich running around the  set screaming her head off.  If I were one of her soldiers, I wouldn't be  inspired by her at all to fight for France.  Rather, the English looked  more like those civilised type.  With due respect, Milla is not a bad  actress after seeing her in the Fifth Element & her minor role as the  prostitute in You've Got Game with Denzel Washington.  So, the decision for  her to depict Joan as that mad woman is questionable.  The part of her  arguing with her conscience acted by Dustin Hoffman is like watching X  Files, you want to know the truth but the truth you shall not find.  At  times, I just wished that she could be burned & done with so that I  could get on with life.  Well, a completely forgettable film & I  wouldn't dream of watching it one more time, just like putting myself over  a guillotine.  Having said that, Faye Dunaway & John Malkovich were  superb in their amoral roles being calculative, manipulative, conniving to  serve their own interests.",2.0
"..and is defeated.
The main problem appears to stem from the lack of realism, it is simply not sufficiently believable for a historical epic.
Jovovich is not remotely convincing as a leader of men, showing  neither charisma nor divinity. She's just plain mental.
John Malkovich  is totally miscast as the young King, and quite why Dustin Hoffman's part  exists at all is a mystery.
The battle scenes are visually impressive  but  show us only the spectacular gore, and none undoubted horror and fear  of the battlefield. Five invincible nobles cutting a bloody swathe through  dozens of doomed English Knights and foot soldiers would be more at home in  a Conan film than a historical epic.
And the accents? Although nowhere  near the farce that The Man In the Iron Mask was, the mixture just doesn't  work. English and Americans playing Frenchmen share dialogue with Frenchmen  playing Frenchmen and we end up with a compromised mess. The only way to  tell identify who's supposed to  be English is that they have as yet  undiscovered Northern English dialects and swear.
On the positive side,  Faye Dunaway is good, as are all the French cast.
I can't help thinking  that had this been made in French with a French cast, a more subtle Joan  and more realism in battle, it could have been a great film.
But it  wasn't, and it isn't.",2.0
This film is quite confusing. The possibility of Jeanne being a prophet is imposibble a) she cant perform any tricks and b) cant predict the future. She is a girl who is very eager to go into war with english most likely for  revenge. She claims that god talks to her and tells her what to do. 2 and a  half hours the film is long and quite boring near the end you cant decide  whether its god or the devil Jeanne is consulting with. Oh and she goes  into war Braveheart style gets badly injured but is still eager to go back  and fight. I can give you one reason to watch this film Mila Jovovich thats  about it.,2.0

"I have seen three films based on the life of Joan of Arc, the Ingrid Bergman film from the late 1940's, the video verison of the recent mini-series and this one, and this is, by far, the worst of the three.  Historically, it is a farce, (Joan did in fact have a sister named  Catherine, but she was not in any way harmed by the English, in fact,  Joan's village apparently only suffered one minor raid during the entire  war)...Bishop Cauchon, far from wanting to ""save Joan's soul"" was  the spearhead of the plot to completly discredit her and have her burned.  Neither did she sign with an ""X""one of her letters to the English  garrisons around Orleans still survives in a museum and the  signature,Jeanne, which is what she called herself is plain...All period  sources agree on how even tempered she was, becoming upset only on very  rare occasions.  The Joan of this film seems closer to a lunatic than the  peasant girl who led an army. I will admit that the costuming is superb, as  good as any I have ever seen. Joan's spiritual side in this film is almost  non-existent, shown only by her requests to hear Mass during her  imprisonment.  As it stands, I only give this film two star based on the  cimenatography and the costuming...The great ""Joan of Arc"" film  is still to be made....",2.0
"NOW what? For the life of me, I can't imagine why Besson thought that the world needed (yet) another Joan of Arc movie. The ""real"" Joan wasn't even considered important in France until the 1800's, when her story  was resurrected (and embellished - current scholarship doubts whether  Orleans was actually under siege at all!) But (sigh), he decided to give it  his *treatment*, and this is what we end up with: two and a half hours of  his wife (and ""Leeloo"" from ""The Fifth Element"")  alternately screaming, shrieking, or whimpering in the face of anyone who  happens to be standing by. The scrolling text at the opening of the film  was illegible and flipped by so quickly no one could read it, not that it  seemed to matter. Any ""plot"" is sublimated to the ""art""  - gorgeous photography, lush scenery, and realistically violent battle  scenes. Warning - this is serious stuff, not a candied-up rendition of  medieval warfare. Back in those days, you took out your enemy not by  gunfire, but by debilitating them in as serious fashion as possible,  including maces, axes, the ubiquitous swords, and some even less pleasant  and graphically-demonstrated methods. But along the way, Besson loses  whatever guiding vision originally prompted him to make this film.  Characters start to answer questions with ""Whatever"", the  Dauphine (John Malkovich playing the usual invertebrate) seems less  interested in being King than he is in where the cast party will be, Faye  Dunaway snaps and snarls in a puzzling way (one minute she's Joan's biggest  patron, only to turn on her with no discernable motivation), and in one of  the BIGGEST casting bloopers in the last half of the 20th century, Dustin  Hoffman shows up looking like a retread Obi Wan Kenobe, sounding like  Dustin Hoffman, and is supposed to be ""The Conscience""  (apparently because the gaping plot holes required SOME sort of cinematic  asphalt to keep the audience at least partially ""in"" on what is  supposed to be transpiring). This is certainly the most serious problem  with the movie: if Hoffman is intended to be a sort of mental foil ,  voicing Joan's inner doubts, he certainly takes his time in making his  presence known. If the movie is intended to illuminate Joan's  ""human"" aspects (as opposed to her spiritual side), then  three-quarters of the film is wasted on one battle scene after another with  nary a glimmer of self-doubt or moral questioning. Buckets of blood, to be  sure.
No, this isn't the ""thinking man's Joan"" by a looooong  shot. The film is irritatingly anachronistic (see ""whatever""),  and crippled by  hopelessly befuddled motivations and seriously  one-dimensional acting by people who should know better AND by the lead,  but in her case, being the director's current ""significant other""  must have gone a long way. Besson's fans will appreciate the cinematography  and the hyper-kinetic pacing of so many scenes, but those with a taste for  subtlety, or serious philosophic enquiries, or even historical accuracy  will find the two and a half hour length about an hour too long.",2.0
"This movie has 1 redeming quality-it introdues the modernviewer to the art of war, especially the devestation brought aboutduring a siege.  I liked the way the movie took you through all the different phases of a battle; the rallying of the troops, the pre-fighting taunting, the use of siege towers, etc..  What amazed me is how much this movie stole from Braveheart.  The scenes involving Joan addressing the troops before the charge and the boiling oil falling on the helpless battering ram chargers made me think I put the wrong tape in.",2.0
"Another example of how Hollywood can take a great story and make it painfully drull.  The dialogue is laughable (completely comtemporary), the attribution and manifestation of Joan's madness utter nonsense, and it was  probably Hoffman's worst perfomance in a movie in well over 20 years.  Braveheart it is Not.",2.0
"Was she a prophet? Was she a nut? Perhaps she was a sly and highly intelligent manipulator. Maybe she was a feminist in an age of male domination who decided to use God as a ladder to French Royalty. All  interesting possiblities. All completely ignored by this film. I doubt that  even Luc Besson could explain what he thought of Joan of Arc and he doesn't  even try to here. Depite battle sequences that are almost on par with those  of Braveheart, a terrifc cast giving superb performances, and stunning  visuals the film falls completely flat . I would've prefered it if the film  had nothing good in it. It would have been easier to dismiss, but the  presence of such great elements makes the whole that much more of a  disappointment. Milla Jovovich gives her all in the lead role, Malkcovich  is as usual terrific as the sly back stabbing king, Faye Dunaway wreaks of  menace despite being underused. Then we come to Dustin Hoffman as The  Conscience, who I think is Besson's attempt at redeaming himself. After  roaming through the first half of the film, giving us battle sequence after  another, dream sequence after another, all which look magnifecent, but by  the third time you see them you start wondering if he is going anywhere  with this, he doesn't. The Conscience is his feeble attempt at  understanding Joan, but it comes too late, and by then we are not so much  interested in understanding her, as much as we are hoping that the film  would end. By the time the film is over you'll be thinking to yourself,  what a waste of lots of great elements in this completely pointless mess.  Note: The film was released outside America under the title Joan of Arc,  which despite being used before, is a much better title then The Messenger:  The Story Of Joan of Arc which sound more like a TV move then a cinamatic  release.",2.0
"First, let me say this with confidence: ""Resident Evil"" starts with nastiness, and then goes to downright nastiness till the end.  I like Milla Jovovich, so as far as she is on the screen, it's OK.  But the film itself is ... awful.  Not that it fails to entertain us.  It is often scary (some of the kids were jumping in the seat, it's true).  Its production designs are decent.  However, the director Paul W.S. Anderson doens't know one thing: originality.
The story is about Alice and the squad with special mission, who have to (they are told) to shut down the main computer of The Hive, underground institute specializing in the study of lethgal virus.  An accident there changes the workers (and dogs too) into zombies, and in this deadly place with booby traps, Alice in undergraund has to fight with a vengeance.
OK. ...are  As it is, fondly remembering James Cameron and David Twohy, I started to get bored after a while, the film being completely relying on shock tactics of sudden big ""Bang!"" and strongly suggested violence.
Jovovich (a bit one-note) is so-so, though lacking the presense of Jolie; Michelle Rodriguez is good, but I frankly thought they are wasting the time and the career.  All in all, just a passable flick though I strongly recommend that you  watch ""Aliens"" instead.",2.0
"Resident Evil was fascinating as a visual, technical piece but overall empty as a movie.  And as a horror movie, there were no thrills, no jumps, no real scares.  I anticipated every zombie, mutant doggie jummping out from corners.

"I`m one of the fans of the video game {Resident Evil} the game is really scary but with the movie nothing scary here except
for some awful acting and lame special effects in fact the video game is a lot more fun than the film.

"RESIDENT EVIL is one of those movies you go into knowing that you won't get much out of other than a little dumb fun.  Unfortunately, you don't get much of that here either, thanks  to a razor-thin plot and alot of idea-snatching from superior films. The plot revolves around a company called the Umbrella Corporation, which does illegal viral research in an underground facility called the Hive, which in turn is monitored by an artificial intelligence component called the Red Queen.  After  a security breach, the Red Queen activates a defense mechanism in which all the Hive employees are trapped and summarily killed in the facility.  At this point a tactical unit is dispatched to investigate, and that's where the so-called fun begins.  Again, a movie like this is never known for its' character development or acting range, in which case Milla Jovovich acquits herself admirably in the lead role, looking sufficiently (hacked) off when the scene calls for it.  Michelle Rodriquez does another one of her always-looks-mad-as-hell routines, which seems to be all she's good for and is frankly getting tiresome in every movie that she's in.  All in all, video game afficionados would be better served renting TOMB RAIDER or even one of the MORTAL KOMBAT films. For typical movie-goers, I'd say pass.",2.0
"If you're looking for a great horror movie with an eerie back drop, flesh eating zombies and plenty of blood you're definitely looking in the wrong place! The eerie mansion backdrop of the video game is completely absent instead replaced by an over stylized laboratory and the basic premise of the game (survival horror) is thrown out of the window.
Instead you get a bunch of incompetent special forces jerks who have no personality and seem to not think of trying a headshot when the people they shoot get back up after emptying entire magazines into them. This movie plays more like a crappy matrix remake with zombies delivering neck-breaking and kung-fu kicks galore instead of horror. Another thing there's no blood when they shoot 'em in the head just a shot of the gun going off and a quick cut to the tiny bullet hole on the forehead of the zombie; no forehead squibbs!
The best thing about this movie is Milla Jovovich gets naked. You can even tell that some of the background in the mess hall tank sequence are 2-D paintings. As for any campy fun, none to speak of; very low gore it's mostly sterile CG stuff, the zombies just seem to nibble not taking a single bloody chunk out of anybody and in my opinion if you can't see it free of charge, don't.",2.0
"This one should have been ""The Night of the Living Dead"" of the new millenium. Instead, we get a Matrix-like movie with amateurish directing, an incredibly irritating techno soundtrack and a mistalented cast. Ironically, Paul W.S. Anderson was also the director of 1995's ""Mortal Kombat"" ; perhaps the ONLY good videogame turned movie in cinema history. The success of this film was due to the fact that it gave the videogame fans what they wished, that is action and plenty of it. Unfortunately, Anderson probably forgot that ""Resident Evil"" is a horror videogame, NOT an action one. We wanted endless scares, suspense, a creepie environment. We deeply wished to see the dark atmosphere present in the game, but we get nothing of this. All we get is a group of soldiers spending nearly all of the movie wandering through labarotory rooms and shooting bullets which seem never-ending.
And speaking of the characters, why does Michelle Rodriguez think she can act? I mean she does nothing other than spending the entire movie looking angry and [mad]at the camera that she becomes incredibly annoying halfway through. And she seems to play the same annoying character in all her movies; just watch ""The Fast and the Furious"". It was a great pleasure seeing her changed into a zombie at the end, at least we can all hope she will not be in the sequel.
It's a real shame that George Romero left the project of directing this movie; I'm sure he would have done a great job. But he had his reasons of not participating; most probably he read the awful script and was discouraged. So why did I give this movie 2 stars? Hmmm, well probably because Milla Jovovich is a real hottie. As a matter of fact, it's thanks to her that I remained to see the movie till the very end. Cause some smart people know that if you're going to make an awful movie, at least bring in the hottie who will make teenagers fall in love and increase the marketing of their product. The same thing can be said to ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"".

The entire first 45 minutes were the most boring 45 minutes of any movie. it gets better, but the zombies aren't scary at all and it just needs more suspense. the entire movie was a sinch to predict. Thats what makes it bad. If you go to see a horror movie and you can predict when there will be a zombie at every turn, its not gonna be that scary. the graphics were ok, but it just didn't have that ""ew >:-("" and ""ahhhhhhhh <=-0"" like the game. the point i'm trying to make is that the 2nd R.E. movie is gonna need a lot of work to get a good rating from me.",2.0

This is a good classic Sinatra vehicle with good chemistry between Sinatra and Kim Novak, catchy Rogers and Hart tunes impeccably arranged by Nelson Riddle with unpretentious choreography by Hermes Pan; and the sound quality is very good.  It's enjoyable enough to watch, with several chuckles along the way.  But unfortunately, this so-called Blu-Ray disc is little more than a regular DVD, superimposed onto a Blu-Ray format with no noticeable improvement in the quality of resolution, sold at a highly inflated price.

"...Ok, as an action film, this is quite good. But as somebody else said before it is aimed really at 15 year old kids. The explosive sound effects and pumping techno sound-track absolutely ruin the atmosphere in my opinion. Where is the tension and suspense that was so abundant in the awesome game ?? And where are the spooky silences and orchestral soundtrack which really made the game.
What made the game such a success was the feeling of tension and genuine uneasiness as you crept around completely alone. Milla Jovovich didn't portray any feelings of anxiety or terror, there was nothing in the film to scare you psychologically at all.
I think Paul Anderson really should have studied some George Romero films before trying his hand at this. Its annoying because Anderson said he had replicated the atmosphere of the game as much as he could - the reality is that he hasn't at all. What game were you playing Mr. Anderson ?
As I said, I think this is one aimed at the younger fans (even though I'm not old myself !). If you want to see an action film, go see it. If you want to be paralysed with fear and suspense - play the game.......

I am rather thrown off as to why this film is getting such good reviews by other Amazon.com customers, because in my opinion, the movie is a mindless escapade through one obstacle and another. The film tries to go for intense plot twists, however, the makers of the film must not have realized that if they want intriguing plot development, an existent plot is required. The video games really do give you a sense of uneasiness, however, all this film offers is a brainless combination of Night of the Living Dead and Die Hard. People say that it's no big deal that the story doesn't follow the game, but it is. Reason being, the film IS based on the game, so I'm sorry, but YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THE GAME'S PREMISE.

"Rita Hayworth is the only reason for watching this film, and Kim Novak is good. The rest is not good..the script of the original Pal Joey has been completely re-written to accomodate Sinatra, and this means the thinnest of plots, the transposition of songs, elimination of numbers that make him look bad, and the suits and pants with football padding to disguise thinness and age.

This was the musical Sinatra wanted; he was sure he could carry a film, certainly a musical film. He had seen M Brando take the lead in Guys and Dolls,  and he reacted negatively toward Barndo all through the shoot of Guys and Dolls. Thank God Brando secured that lead!

Sinatra's voice in Pal Joey is very bad, his style of acting is no style at all, and his acting, even on its one note foundation,  is excruciating. He needed Gene Kelly and others to fill in when he made MGM musicals; he was never a star, and Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak eclipse him in every scene,proving that point.

Too bad, because this was a very good show, on Broadway, with Gene Kelly, who should have done this picture, or Marlon Brando, certainly Brando.

See this for Rita and her number, Zipped, and forget the rest.

See also, Kim, sing (dubbing)My Funny Valentine, and how it gets ruined as you watch Sinatra's reactions to it.",2.0
"this movie is fun...no doubt about it!!! great action sequences....decent zombies(not as scary as george a. romero's zombie versions) great ""licker"" sequence!! movie didn't have as much suspense or mystery as the video game, which definitely hurt my viewing experience! in the game it was a mystery as to why there was a mansion in the middle of the mountains...and in the game, you didn't find out who exactly the ""umbrella"" corporation was until 3/4 the way through the game's storyline..in the movie, its just all laid out in front of you...no real surprise. the red queen addition also hurt the story!! they should have been fighting zombies all the time!!!not some stupid computer!! bottom line: if they had just followed the videogame story and not made their own, this would have been a 5+ star movie. the two stars are for the zombies, the zombie dogs, and the ""licker"" sequence!!! the acting lost it a star.",2.0
"Musicals are historically slight in the plot department, and this movie is no exception.  Three stars: one fading, one rising and one coasting do not help matters either.

Rita is the fading star.  It was painful for me to watch the once dazzling love goddess reduced to playing the controlling widow.  The make up department probably had to work overtime trying to cover the circles under her eyes, and her hair and costumes are just bad.  Novak is the rising star, although I don't get the 50's obsession with bubble headed, busty, bleach blond bimbos.  It would help if she could act, but sadly her range is very limited. I truly believe they added the dog to help make her character sympathetic, since she was unable to convey it herself.  Then there is Frank just coasting on his charm and cool.  Doesn't seem plausible that a hep cat like him, who could bag any ""doll"", ""dame"" or ""mouse?"", would fall for either of these gals.

Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because of Snuffy the dog.  He stole every scene he was in.  Although that wasn't too difficult to do in such a dog of a movie.",2.0
This movie took most of the great songs from the stage play and dumped them.  For a theater lover this is heartbreaking.  What a disappointing story.  If a movie can be faithful to the theater version then this one is a class-A adulterer.  Even the ending was changed and not for the better.  The dubbing for the two leading ladies was also disappointing.  A pretty face is not enough.,2.0
"I do not like Sinatra, and as someone once said, Joey is the role he was born to play.  A self-important little heel.  I think he had a very slight singing voice (with orchestral delusions of grandeur, look at the arrangement of his ""Softly, As I Leave You"") and I think he was a megalomaniac.  Also, before I drop the subject, the tune in this flick that floored all the other reviewers here (""The Lady Is A Tramp"") was written for a woman and has many more, and many cleverer choruses, and was written for ""Babes in Arms,"" not ""Pal Joey.""  Rita Hayworth (whose character, Vera Simpson, was just rich on the stage) plays a former stripper, not a former singer.  And her number, ""Zip!"" has words in it not even written by Hart!  The plot of the show (par for Hollywood) was bowdlerized, rewritten and destroyed for the flick, and left simplistic and with most of its songs gone.  Good ones too.  I've read O'Hara's libretto and I've heard the score.  The film is a colorful diversion (like the films of Porter's ""Can-Can"" and Loesser's ""Guys and Dolls,"" both also with Sinatra, both also eviscerated and abridged, though Loesser fared best of the three), it'll kill an hour and a half, Rodgers' tunes are done well (as well as non-singers can do them), O'Hara and Hart are rewritten with only the bare bones left, but in 2003, who really cares anymore.  Rodgers & Hart will be around when this shadow of one of their best shows (almost all their shows were their best shows, they were gems, but this one had a script by John O'Hara, sigh, what a waste) is forgotten.  Watch it, feel good (if you can stand Sinata; Novak and Hayworth are talented and beautiful), and then forget it.",2.0
"There is only one brief moment in Paul W.S. Anderson's misguided film of Resident Evil in which he actually captures the awesomely creepy atmosphere of the original games. It's when we first meet Milla Jovovich's character, dazed and amnesiac, waking up in the shower in a dark and deserted mansion. It's also the only scene that can reasonably be termed ""horror."" For most of the rest of the film, Anderson tries to capture a riff similar to that of James Cameron's Aliens...and fails. Sure, there are specific elements of the game introduced here and there (like the skinned-looking zombie dogs), but what on earth kind of zombie movie is it that has NO GORE!? Perhaps fearing those prudes at the MPAA, Anderson gives us close-ups of muzzle flashes in the gun-battle scenes when any REAL zombie movie would be bestowing its special make-up effects crew with the latest means of molding exploding heads. Make no mistake, this is an action movie, not a horror movie, and not a particularly tense or original one, borrowing as it does from every ""bunch of folks getting picked off one by one"" plot that's come down the pike. (For a movie that's almost identical to this one but actually remembers to be good cheesy fun, try John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars.) There is, now that I remember it, one other shot that reminded me of the game, and that was the final one in which Milla is gazing out upon the Raccoon City street littered with burning cars and wreckage. It's a sign that Anderson could have actually made a Resident Evil movie if he'd wanted to, but he just didn't. I told myself I'd give this DVD a rental if it proved to be an extended unrated director's cut, with excised blood-n-guts restored, but it looks like this ""special edition"" is going to be nothing more than the sanitized-for-your-protection theatrical edit after all. So game over, man.",2.0
"For those of you who have not played the Resident Evil game, I suggest that you not purchase the DVD. The story line is unique but badly portrayed with corny scenes that makes you think ""oh no, they're doing that matrix bit again"". The zombies can be related to an 80's style dracula-like movie; the only real feeling you get is from the fast pumped and creepy music from Marilyn Manson, Slipknot, Static X, etc.
All summed up, Aliens would of been a better purchase if you wanted to see a chick kick some [bottom].",2.0
"When this movie was released in Australi, not many theatres picked it up. I can see why.
A pathetic remake of a video game classic, it follows the likes of Mortal Kombat (by the same director) and Tomb Raider. Although director Paul Anderson did well in creating tension, and overall adding a rather eerie and freaky element to the movie, the actual story has many things left to be desired.
There are a few goods bits though. The start was well contrived, leading the watchers to feel for the soon-to-be-killed employees of the Umbrella corporation.
It falls rapidly downhill from there. Somehow, directors seem to get a thrill in having leading star Milla Jovovich naked when we first see her and when we leave her (think Fifth Element). It wasn't much of an acting challenge for Jovovich, just a few looks here and there, and a number of well-placed kicks. The supporting actors were not much better. Michelle Rodriguez, known better as Lennie in The Fast and the Furious, puts on an act not unlike Velazques in Aliens.
Highlights include the laser killing techniques that bring to mind the opening sequence of alternative movie Cube, which used thin wires for the same effect, the death sequences, the alarming jump that one gets when a former employee reanimates for the first time, and the startling eery super-computer, the Red Queen, which in my opinion was the best character of the lot.
Even the casting of dancers as the zombies was a good idea, making their movements realistic.
But the whole story had a lot of flaws. The explaination of the zombies was extremely inaccurate and unbelievable, as well as their following of our 'heros'.
As a business student too, the actions of the Umbrella Corporation after the Hive was sealed and the survivors rescued was extremely inaccurate. But I won't get into that.
Apart from the small highlights, the movie was extremely poor. Only watch it if you are a die-hard fan, or like getting kicks from extreme gore.",2.0
"I don't understand where all the gore went. Thirteen ghosts was filled with gore that was not needed,this film is based on a video game that was bloody from start to finish,its rated R so why? No zombies show up for 40 min and you only see one mutant creature. The dogs are killed off too fast and with no originality,and yet another slow motion matrix ripoff jump kick. What a waste,they had 40 million dollars and millia jovovich and this is there best.dawn of the dead had almost no money,but they have a 2hr nonstop zombie masterpiece.watch it instead.",2.0

"The Hives set up by the influential Umbrella Corporaton has been secretly conducting genetic experiments and the subterranean lab has unfortunately been plagued by a viral outbreak, taking its toll on the working staff. It is up to Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez with the assistance of cop Eric Mabius to confront and isolate the virus. Accompanying them is an elite task force - and the situation is critical with the time factor going against them. They have to reach the Red Queen, the mother of the computer network that powers and defend the Hive.
Unless you are a computer fanatic of the popular Capcom game and its spawned 3 sequels or wanting to get a thrill from seeing the protagonists battling terrifying obstacles through the dark labyrinths, you might want to spare yourself from surviving a horrible movie.
It is a splatter of unnecessary gore with decapitated corpses and mindless violence that desensitized rather than offer true scares. The phalanx of cannibals and vampire-like troops eating people alive and animatronic creatures like Licker, Zombie Dogs doesn't exactly fascinate either. Paul WS Anderson who also helmed the cheesy Mortal Kombat makes a movie that is stocked full of grunge rock to compensate for its lack of atmosphere.
The only saving grace of the movie is Milla Jovovich hiking up the kick... factor with her resilient mantle. Otherwise the movie is a sputtering mess - and it's a shame when horror-chiller George A Romero of the famed Living Dead trilogy inspired this movie. Resident Evil is butchered unscrupulously into a gore flick which is shockingly horrible instead of terrifying.",2.0

"It's been six years since I have run out of a movie theater angry and bewildered.
This review is really intended for the mature movie-goer. I say this because many of the young adults loved this movie and were having a blast.  I only wish I could have seen what they found so interesting. But hey, I gave it a go.  Even though the critics hate this movie(if you want a real laugh, check out Roger Ebert's review),  the trailer was intoxicating.
If you want to know, in depth what the movie is about..see another reviewer's review.  I'll just say here that the plot of an underground, highly classified colony of people, working on unnatural forms of DNA was exciting. When one little vial gets dropped, the computer system shuts the plant down, literally. Everyone is killed to contain the contamination.  The first 50 minutes were decent, but when really awful and unconvincing zombies jumped out of the woodwork, the movie could not redeem itself (think of zombies from knock-off flicks of the original ""Night of the Living Dead""). This is when 11 or more people, including ourselves walked out of the theater.
  There was rumor that this movie is based on a PC game of the same title.  I play many PC games and would appreciate if someone would email me and elaborate.  If this is true, that could be the reason why the younger crowd was so enthusiastic about this flick.
I give the movie two stars for suspense, a great initial plot, and choosing Milla Jovovich as the lead. I enjoy her acting, she is blossoming into a great actress.  In all, this movie felt like a combination of ""Aliens"", ""Ghosts of Mars"", ""Return of the Living Dead"", and ""Relic"".  It's a mish-mash of many great film ideas...but the ridiculous zombies were the movie's downfall. If they were more realistic, and frightening, instead of laughable, the movie might have succeeded.",2.0

"Movie musicals aren't easy. Some of the biggest directors have failed trying to film them. Sir Richard Attenborough is one, with his A Chorus Line that had all the zip of Gahndi. John Huston is another, with this version of Annie.

Yes, the actors could not have been cast betterbut they can only do so much with clunky direction and a ridiculously rewritten script. Sorry, but a high-altitude chase involving elevated bridges and helicopters is not what this story needed.

To see this material filmed right, look to the Emmy Award-winning 1999 TV movie by Rob Marshall (the director-choreographer who would go on to win the Oscar for Best Picture with Chicago). It features smart scriptwriting that actually improves on the original musical by finding the heart of the show instead of slathering on the sensational, and a cast of Broadway royalty with a ton of Tonys among them. They include Victor Garber as Daddy Warbucks, Audra MacDonald as Grace, Kathy Bates as Mrs. Hannigan, Alan Cumming as Rooster, and Kristen Chenoweth as Lily St. Regis.

"The Bottom Line:

A quickly-put-together and unconvincing version of Krakauer's amazing book, Into Thin Air (and other movies like it, obviously) is the reason why ""TV movie"" is a pejorative term; rewriting real people to make heroes and villains and condensing everything into a tidy 100 minute block, Into Thin Air is depressingly bad.",2.0
"The acting on this film makes Keanu Reeves look like an amazingly talented actor. Also ripe with contridictions to the book and Bourkeev's book ""The Climb"", this movie is a major flop. The movie makes Krakaur seem like a hero when really he did nothing heroic; he peacefully slept in his tent as more than half a dozen climbers were slowly freezing to death a mere couple hundred yards away, only thanks to Broukeev's (which this movie typecast as your typic Russian, it is like a bad cold war movie - all they needed to do was add a fur hat with a hammer and sickle to his character) herculien rescue did three who otherwise probably would have perheised survive. The characters are weak and stock. Read the book and Anatoli Bourkeev's ""The Climb"" instead of watching this piece of [...], both are far better (I consider ""The Climb"" to be better than ""Into Thin Air"", which has better prose but reeks of the blame game, just my two cents""). I would also recommend the IMAX movie ""Everest"", which doesn't go as deep into the tragic events as this (because it is not about them) but is none the less a fantastic documentery.",2.0
Loved the book but the movie was so cheesy.  The main actor who played Jon Krakauer was completely unbelievable and it made it seem like Jon was a bigger hero than he was. It also conveniently painted characters like Sandy or the Russian in shades of deep black and light white and no shades of gray in-between.  Really hated it after reading the book in a day or two.,2.0
"I don't know what should have tipped me off first -- that this film is made for TV or that the ""bonus trailers"" on the DVD are for ""Cliffhanger"" and ""Vertical Limit.""

A story as profound as Krakauer's and a mountain as big as Everest just shouldn't be forced onto the small screen.  The movie suffers greatly from the very things that mountainclimbers cannot do -- rush.  The movie pushes along at a relentless pace using fade to white as a time compression device.  The movie never takes its time until its way too late.  We can't decompress that fast!

The dialogue and acting suffer from the made-for-TV feel, and the plot comes across as something closer to one of Reader's Digests' ""Drama in Real Life"" instead of Krakauer's prose.  Sure there are a few emotional moments and points where they ""get it right,"" but they are too few and far between.  The movie is so rushed we don't have time to care about the characters presented.  Ironically I thought Imax's ""Everest,"" even with its documentary feel, was far more moving.

Of course I also did this movie a disservice by seeing it back to back with ""Touching the Void"" an immensely superior film.  Read Krakauer's book and watch ""Void"" or ""Everest.""  Leave this DVD back at base camp.

"A few years ago I read the book this movie is based on and it started a fascination with the mountain and the people who sometimes die climbing it. I then discovered a movie, this movie, was made. It took some time to get a copy, and when I finally had opportunity to watch it with my girlfriend, I fell asleep (not really a comment about the movie, but the excessive hours I was working).
  So now, I've watched it. And... it was clearly in trouble right off the start. In a story ABOUT how several people died on the mountain, the movie often STOPs to remind us with the narration,  that '5 people will die'. The producers obviously recognized thier inability to recreate the actual drama that happened.  I say, ""Don't tell me, SHOW ME"". After several scenes I was left wondering if I hadn't read the book if I would really understand what was happening.
  Catch this movie on some tv channel at night. Definitely READ Jon Krakauer's book, or even listen to the audio tape or cd. Or wish someone with ability would take this story and make a good or even great movie from the story.",2.0
"This is a fair version of the Jon Krakauer book on the Everest disaster of 1996.  The characters of the climbers are much richer in the book than this film.  Of course, that's often true of any film.  However, it's the people who experienced this climb that really make the story vibrate and live.  The film takes about two steps back and puts the mountain and conditions first.
It's not a terrible film and a viewer who hasn't read ""Into Thin Air"" or ""The Climb"" may find it superficially enjoyable.  But why take the time to watch this when you can see a much better view of Everest around the very time this disaster happened by viewing the IMAX film (or its video) and live the experience through one of the two books.
David Breashears, one of the creators of the IMAX film has an excellent book that uses his experience with the climb and the film to study the '96 disaster.  This film takes a back seat to his book, too.
Don't plan on reading any of the books? This film is a fair alternative.  But the viewer won't understand the complexities and drama of the event through this point of view.",2.0
"Into Thin Air:Death On Everest~1997
I'm afraid to say that this is a very poor movie based on a true story. If you want something along the similiar lines of this read Jon Krakauer's book or watch Vertical Limit anyway I will tell you the plot:
In May 1996, writer Jon Krakauer joined a party of experienced and amatuer climbers-lead by Everest veterans Scott Fisher and New Zealander Rob Hall-who attempted to reach the world's highest and most infamous mountain. Krakauer was one of the lucky ones, he made it back alive- 12 people didn't.",2.0
"The making of this movie was quite an undertaking. Unfortunately, it never quite makes the grade. The characters are not developed. Instead, they are caricatures of those whom they purport to be.

One expedition leader, the late Scott Fischer, comes across as a mellow, disorganized, bumbling dude. One of his expedition guides, the late Anatoli Boukreev, is depicted as a self centered, Neanderthal like he-man, who clearly differs with his boss on what his role as a guide is to be.

Another expedition leader, the late Rob Hall, fares somewhat better, in that he is portrayed as an organized, stand up expedition leader, who puts the welfare of his clients above his own. His much publicized radio farewll to his pregnant wife is included as part of the drama.

Socialite Sandy Hill Pittman seems to represent conspicuous consumption and is depicted as a self-absorbed, rich bitch with little regard for the Sherpas whom she treats as little more than human yaks. Texan Beck Weathers fares little better, as he is characterized as a buffoon. I am sure that, were he to see this movie, he would wish that they'd have left him on Everest.

The actor who plays Jon Krakauer's character has the thankless role of Greek chorus. He is there to basically tie up loose ends in the movie. He portrays Krakauer as a dour, humorless human being who, were it not for the fact that he is a talented writer, would have been pushed off the Lhotse face of Everest by some enterprising soul. Last, but certainly not least, are the Sherpas, who are shown as wise, brave, put upon souls. Now here, the movie is hitting its mark.

The cinematography is laughable. Numerous shots of a mountain purporting to be Everest are easily spotted as shots of a mountain other than Everest. Since when is Everest without its signature tell tale plume, waving banner like in the sky?

Let me cut to the chase. Read the well written book upon which the movie is based, ""Into Thin Air"" by Jon Krakauer. Do not bother with this movie, unless, like me, you are an Everest junkie and a glutton for punishment. It is the only reason that I rated the movie with two stars instead of just one.

"Review of A River Runs Through It
Hot Toasty Rag, September 25, 2017

This famous movie from the 1990s follows brothers Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt as they grow up and react to their strict father, Tom Skerritt. Its a period piece, in the years after WWI, going through the Great Depression, and while the boys take their separate paths, they're always tied to each other because of family, home, and their mutual love of fly fishing.

Robert Redford directed this family drama, and as always, you can see his love for nature in every scene. Hes also the narrator in the movie, so if you think you recognize the voice in the beginning of the movie, you're right. Redford specializes in directing beautiful nature scenes and capturing emotional turmoil within a family. A River Runs Through It is very pretty to watch, but as much as I love Robert Redford, its not my favorite of his films. Dont throw anything at me, but Im not really a Brad Pitt fan, so I found myself rooting for Tom Skerrit more often than not.

Watch the preview to see if its your style. I like The Horse Whisperer better, but if you're one of the millions of people who drool over Brad Pitt, you're going to want to rent this one alongside Legend of the Falls.",2.0

"Nine Things About the Movie ""Annie"" (1982)

[After watching the 2014 version of ""Annie"" I decided tonight to go back and watch the original 1982 version again. I hadn't seen it since I was a kid, and I remember loving it when I was little. This review reflects my adult perspective on the revisiting. I realize that this review will make a lot of die-hard fans very angry with me.]

1. What did I just watch? OK, the songs are just as catchy as they were. And fine, Carol Burnett still rules.

2. But the movie itself? The movie is utterly ridiculous. And weird. And there is entirely too much dancing. Most kids today wouldn't have it.

3. I realize that this movie is based in the Depression, and is based on the original comic, which had different social standards. But I still find the movie disturbing in ways that were completely over my head when I was 11.

4. This movie is blatant capitalist propaganda. It openly worships money and power, and demonizes the poor. It even manages to make fun of communism.

5. I was horrified to now understand the context in which the song ""Tomorrow"" was used - to encourage the President of the United States to distract poor people from paying attention to their situation.

6. In this movie, money is always the solution, and people are essentially property.

7. Besides being classist, the movie is sexist and racist.

8. The character of Punjab is a car crash of gasp-inducing stereotypes.

9. But they all smile and sing about it, so that counts for something, I guess.",2.0
"Looking at the list of the cast - an ""A"" list- I was looking forward to a great movie. I was very wrong!
Dunaway throughout the movie has one look: a catatonic look in her closeups, and after a few closeups of that, it gets to be tedious and repetitive. The unexpected ending is not satisfactory, and does not make sense, either.
The acting of Jones is not very believable- this was one of his early movies.

"I remember seeing ""The Eyes of Laura Mars"" in the theater lo' these many years ago and while not a life-changing motion picture it has remained, since then, utterly watcheable. I confess I have sat through at least twice since it has been on TV - a sign I need to either get out or that on some cheesy level of my onw, I enjoy it.
I must agree with much Bragan Thomas' articulate review but beg to differ on his claims that the movie makes no sense - and the specific examples he uses to support this claim.  True, the plot is thin and the resolution thinner still...but the movie does have a story to tell and tries to do so.
To answer Mr. Thomas' question ""Why does the killer enter Mars' mind (presumably in the first place)?  It's simple really - her photos.  Early on we see examples of Mars' trendy, society-is-sick and dangerous fashion photographs.  The killer's childhood mirrors the crime scene photos (and Mars') that he has access to.  Connection made.
Why doesn't Laura warn her soon to be killed friends?  It's always too late.  She see what the killer sees as the killer is about to strike.
So - while cheesy yes - ""Laura Mars"" does, for the most part, make sense.",2.0

"I was truly disappointed by this movie.  I rented it because I mistakenly thought that this was the movie that Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for as Best Actress.  After watching it all the way through, I suddenly realized that it was My Cousin Vinny that she won for.  Now, I'm as romantic as the next person, but this movie was so sappy that it was unrealistic and stupid.  Marisa Tomei's performance in this movie and her performance in My Cousin Vinny are like black and white.  In Only You, she takes off on a whim to chase after some guy named Damon Bradley, only 10 days before her wedding.  Romantic?  Sure!  But the way she plays it out is ridiculous.  Call me a cynic, but she makes herself way too vulnerable to the men she encounters in Italy.  I'm glad I saw My Cousin Vinny first because, after her performance in Only You, it would take a lot for me to see her in any other movie.",2.0

"I have tried on more than one occasion to like this movie. It is beautiful to look at of course and worth seeing it just for the scenery.  But, Redford just missed the boat on directing it. It just doesn't hold the interest. The pace is so slow most of the time that you could doze off and there seem to be odd things thrown in for no particular reason. Brad Pitt was too young, with too little depth as an actor to put everything into the role that needed to be there.  He just comes across as a rather delinquent personality with no real depth.  Pretty much a tragedy looking for a place to happen from the time he was just a kid. I think the test of any movie is ""does it grab you and hold you from the first scene?"". This movie does not.",2.0
"""Easy Rider"" is the 60s counter-culture classic that seems to wreak slightly of formaldehyde today. It stars Peter Fonda (Wyatt) and Dennis Hopper (Bill) as a pair of drugged out loners who trade a formidable amount of cocaine to `Connection' (Phil Specter) for a sizable amount of cash. Unfortunately, the best that either Wyatt or Bill can think of doing with their new found wealth is to mount a pair of truly sweet cycles and roam the countryside - looking for trouble and, ultimately finding more than they bargained for.  Along the way they enter into an on again off again tempestuous relationship with loose canon George Hanson (Jack Nicholson). Together the boys go through a heap of money, a string of hookers and more than a few ounces of psychedelic trippin'. Nothing seems to help cleanse these reprobates of their rebel without a clue - little boys lost - syndrome. Fueled by a soundtrack that features Steppenwolf's classic ""Born to Be Wild,"" ""Easy Rider"" is anything but, and perhaps, the closest realization of the decade's hippy counterculture ever put on film. That it today seems quaint in its hostility toward authority only serves to reflect just how lost contemporary film culture is.

Previously, ""Easy Rider"" had been made available through Columbia Tristar in a moderately pleasing DVD transfer. If you're thinking of upgrading to this new 35th Anniversary edition for a better print of the film don't bother. This is the exact same transfer and extras previously made available. The only pluses to this edition are an extra CD of the film's soundtrack and a nicely put together pocket book on the making of the film. But the DVD quality remains the same. As for the quality of the transfer - beginning as it does with several long shots of the boys on their bikes, there is a remarkable amount of resolution to be had in the image. Fine details are nicely realized for the most part and colors, while slightly dated, exhibit a fairly accurate level of contrast and balance. Unfortunately, roughly mid-way through this transfer some strange digital happenings begin to occur, beginning with the flashback sequence in which Wyatt and Bill pick up a pair of hookers. Designed to reflect to an audience that the sequence is going on in the mind of the boys, its exceptionally grainy and slightly out of focus with a bleached out color scheme that is unflattering to say the least. On top of the inherent grain in the print we get an exceptional amount of digital grit which generally makes for a very harsh looking image. Also, the print quality after the flashback - which until its insertion had been moderately pleasing to very nicely done - is increasingly riddled with age related artifacts and grain which degrades the final third of the film's image quality. I really am unable to account for the reason this occurs but it does and is distracting. The audio is 5.1 and, as expected, dated. Dialogue is never natural sounding, obviously manufactured post production studio recordings that are tinny at best. The one kick that the audio gets is in its throbbing rock score that jumps to life with an explosive bass and vibrating treble.",3.0
"Yesterday I have finaly had the chance to see the british special edition of Easy Rider. I was realy excited to receive it, not to mention the expectations of a claimed 1 1/2 hours extra footage with never seen before scenes. Wow. What dissapointment!

"I watched this movie again last night after not having seen it for about 25 years.  I had almost completely forgotten the plot, except for the ending.

I did not grow up here, but I have lived in the deep south all of my adult life, and as usual the actors in this film have the stereotypical phony Southern ""accents"" -- even Dolly Parton has been too long in Tinseltown.  And even here the accents change somewhat (NC being different from GA, which is again different from an LA parish).  I understand that the rest of America cannot hear it, but native southerners pick right up on the forced sound of the actors.

The other thing that bothered me this go-round was the obvious change of seasons in the story (Easter, Halloween, Christmas, and back to Easter over several years) -- all while the native foliage is in the full bloom of summer.  We do have the four distinct seasons here, and our deciduous trees all turn colors and are then bare by late Fall every year.  However, I don't remember one outdoor scene where the trees were anything but fully green.  It gives the impression to the viewer that the entire movie was shot start-to-finish in about eight weeks.  The IMdB website of this film lists at least 34 shots where there was some flub or mis-continuity, but never mentions the obvious lack of outdoor seasons.

Other than that, a sad and funny film, with a wonderful title theme from Georges Delerue.",3.0
"As good as Easy Rider is, it is not the type of movie that is going to pull in younger crowds.. The message of peacefulness and community with its underlying criticism of those who take this concept to brain-dead stages is one that stands the test of time.
Unfortunately, the mechanics of the movie itself simply do not. Nicholson, Hopper and Fonda all give great performances. However, this movie is always going to appeal more to the peace and flower power crowd than the [chemical] genre crowd.. For the latter, this movie simply cannot compete with Trainspotting, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, etc..",3.0

"Easy Rider is a counterculture touchstone.  It also was a trailblazer in the independent film market.  There had other hippie movies before, but they were mostly bad films about drug use.  Easy Rider tells the story of two hippies, played by Dennis Hopper & Peter Fonda, who motorcycle across the country from California to New Orleans for Mardi Gras.  They had just made a big drug score and are using that money for the trip.  Along the way, they stay at a commune in the desert, get caught up in a dispute in a small town and of course take alot of drugs.  There is a scene in a New Orleans graveyard that visualizes an acid trip.  Jack Nicholson shows up as a drunk who is constantly being jailed.  He rides along with Mr. Hopper & Mr. Fonda and meets an untimely death. The role garnered Mr. Nicholson an Oscar nomination and catapulted him to stardom.  The film is visually pretty and well shot and they make great use of rock songs as no other movie had beforehand. The film was also a commentary by hippies about hippies.  It is supposed to show that hippies are just peace loving people who embody the freedom America is supposed to give people.  They are unfairly persecuted by small-minded people who judge them by the length of their hair.  At the time, this was all groundbreaking stuff.  The problem is that the film hasn't aged well in the 30 years since it's release.  It is still cemented back in 1969 and now is just a relic from that time.  The film's power should be more judged for the doors it opened up for other maverick film makers like Martin Scorcese, Peter Bogdanovich and other later ones like Quentin Tarantino and Spike Lee.  Before Easy Rider, you had to play within the system.  After it became a huge success, you could go underground and get daring pictures released.",3.0
"OK.  To me, it is a classic, but that is in my world as it is in many others.
This film satisfied a void in the cinema of its time that was very underserved.  If you are very thirsty, the worst beer will be very  welcome.  In that way, Easy Rider offered some groovy music (the subset  which was made available for the soundtrack), drug themes, trite  counterculture, ...  And they didn't use sexual themes really at all to  sell it.
The characters, notably Hopper's, are thoroughly unlikable and I  find it funny how many people align with the film but would have to force  any real identification with the lead characters.
Fonda's ""we blew  it"" summation near the end hits on a variety of levels: their  filmmaking, the disillusioned culture that closed the 60s, as well as the  obvious plot direction.  The editing is abyssmal.  But there is a certain  charm in it all.  Waywardly adrift bastards of the generation (or any  generation) are portrayed as unsympathetic and directionless in a very  genuine and probably artistically accidental way in concert with the same  production qualities of the film.
I do still like to watch this one  periodically.  It brings back memories.  Unlike what some may assert, this  film doesn't reveal the 60s or 60s culture in any breadth.  As a longhair  of the times, I can say that it does remind that being a longhair at the  time wasn't so hip to most people.
Also, Phil Spector as the connection  at the beginning is a bizarre (in a good way) touch.
I think just about  anyone should see this movie.  Make up your own minds.  But take off the  rose-coloured glasses first.",3.0
Very good movie. Worth watching again. Only exception is very poor sound quality. Throughout entire movie you have to adjust sound.,3.0
"I'll never understand the male stereotype that says you cannot admit to liking anything that doesn't involve bloodshed, sports or nudity.  Sure, as a guy I can understand why those three things are appealing to my gender (although I am far from a sports fan) but I have never been one to hide my deeper feelings or emotions.  I cry whenever I want to; I have deep and meaningful conversations with my male friends and I definitely watch whatever it is that I want to regardless of the intended fan base.

I say this, not because I think that this is a particularly good movie but because this seems to be a popular movie that men feel unabashedly ashamed in either watching or enjoying or, god forbid, crying at.

The film tells the story of a group of women who frequent the same hair salon and become a central part of each others lives over the years.  There is M'Lynn, the kind hearted mother who only wants what is best for her daughter Shelby, who just so happens to be a serious diabetic.  There is Truvy, who owns the salon, and Annelle, her new employee with a background no one is too sure about.  There is the loudmouthed Ouiser and her loyal friend Clairee.

Together they make for one lively bunch.

The film mostly focuses on M'Lynn and Shelby as they struggle to come to terms with Shelby's growing independence.  Shelby wants to get married and have children, but the doctors have warned her that childbirth will not be a smart move for someone in her condition.  M'Lynn wants to allow her daughter to live her own life, but she also is the mother and mothers always know what is best for their children; right?

The film is tragically clich&eacute;d, which probably adds to the memorable factor, since we've seen it all before, but it takes away from the originality and my personal overall appreciation of the film.  It's also very heavy handed, and it's not always smooth about it either.  The acting is a bit spotty, sometimes so over the top it's annoying and other times so grounded in itself that it is stunningly superb.

Let's look at the two opposite ends of the spectrum; Shirley MacLaine and Sally Field.  Two of my favorite actresses of all time spar off and only one is the victor; Field.  Sally Field delivers what may be her finest performance ever, delving deep into the maternal spectrum of this woman's very being.  M'Lynn aches to see her daughter live a full life, but she cannot look past the fact that a full life may very well kill her.  It's heartbreaking to say the least.  Shirley MacLaine, who may even be a better actress as a whole, is ridiculously overacting throughout this film.  Her mannerisms are all over the place and her characters comedic timing borders on annoying.  It's shameful, which is sad, because I love her.

Olympia Dukakis is stunning here, Dolly Parton is fun and Daryl Hannah is effectively nave, even if neither do a whole lot to be remembered for.  Julia Roberts was nominated for an Oscar for her performance, and was the favorite to win (although she lost) but her performance is decent at best, never really investing itself as deeply as Field's.  She does a fine job, but nothing spectacular.

So, did this movie make me cry?  Yes, it did, and I am not ashamed to say that.  The ending is such a heartbreaker, and Field is so convincing in her tragic portrayal that anyone who doesn't cry is made of stone, really.  Is the movie really as amazing as many make it out to be?  No, not really.  It works to an extent and sports a beautiful performance but its own clich&eacute;s and spotty collective ensemble tear it down a few notches and keep it from being the classic many want it to be.  See it for Field, for she is heaven-sent, but don't expect too much from the film as a whole.",3.0

"Some pretty big talent (Sally Field, Dolly Parton, Julia Roberts, Darryl Hannah, Shirley MaClaine) and a good story lead me to recommend this film.  Shelby (Julia Roberts)is a head-strong diabetic who, against doctor's orders, decides to get pregnant and have a child.  Based on a true story, ""Steel Magnolias"" concerns itself with the group of strong Southern women who become Shelby's insulated comfort zone during her time of need. Some of the aspects of the film, including dialogue references, costume design and overall set design, has pegged the movie as a product of the 80's.  That isn't to say that it's not a good film.  But it just doesn't hold up quite as well as say, ""Fried Green Tomatoes"".
Columbia has given us a rather worn looking print of this movie.  Colors are slightly faded or off balance and there is some smearing of background details that comes from the overuse of noise reduction equipment in the DVD mastering process. No pixelization, some slight edge enhancement and a bit of fine detail shimmering also present.  The sound is amply presented but exhibits an equally dated characteristic.  The documentary that accompanies this feature is rather disappointing.  Although we learn why the film was written, there are virtually NO INTERVIEWS with principle cast members and very little in the way of background on how the film was made.  Also incl. theatrical trailer.  BOTTOM LINE: Still a good reason to stay home on a rainy night.  Just remember to bring Kleenex.",3.0

"I love Spielberg AND John Williams. Plus Richard Dreyfuss was great. But, I got bored in this movie. I was too young to watch it when it first came out. Then, once I was old enough, I forgot about it. So, my husband and I watched it with our kids just recently.

Maybe I was just tired that night, but I got kinda bored. It isn't that I felt that the special effects were dated and no longer amazing. Not at all. I just didn't feel the ""tension"" that I would expect from such an iconic film. I started losing interest right when I should've been on the edge of my seat. When Roy and Jillian (Dreyfuss and Melinda Dillon) were climbing up to Devil's tower with the other guy... they were evading the miliary/goverment... I just wasn't feeling too worried about them for some reason. And everything that happened after that seemed pretty flat which is crazy b/c a big mother ship with a bunch of aliens showed up.

On a positive note, the soundtrack is great. The acting is great. The set design was so accurate. I remember thinking the same thing when I recently watched ET with my kids. ""That really looks like a house where kids live."" Things are just the right kind of cluttery mess.

Nothing is overstated or overdone. The characters all feel very authentic. Also, the government scare tactic to keep the people away from Devil's tower is done really well. It wasn't some evil, nefarious government plot to screw the people. This could've easily been overdone but wasn't.

Overall, it is one of those movies you should watch, I guess. But, you might not get a big ""WOW"" at the end.",3.0
"Everyone alive has seen this movie by now, so there's no point in writing yet another review.  I just wanted to say something negative about Richard Dreyfus, who in my opinion is possibly one of the worst actors - ever.  And I mean that.  He's untalented, irritating and just terrible in every role.  I can't think of one role he's done where that whiny, abrasive, neurotic personality doesn't diminish the movie.  And I can't think of any movie he's been in that virtually ANY other actor could not have done better.  That includes Close Encounters, the Goodbye Girl, What About Bob, etc.  Honestly, I try to avoid his films at all costs - but a couple of these had good stories and other good actors.  This movie is one of those.  So I was compelled to watch it.  But it makes you wish at several points in the movie that they would have just killed off his character and gone in a different direction.  It was a mistake to try and build a great movie around him, and obviously, I'm still unhappy that they tried.  I don't know who's life he saved, or who he loaned money to - but somebody clearly was forced to put him in.  He, by himself, brought this movie down two full stars.  Still a good one, but it could have been really superb without him.  Well, there it is.  Richard, I hope you run across this review someday and understand how much I really despise the fact that you ""made it"" to the big screen when so many other deserving, talented actors did not.

"Truly, one of the finest movies of its kind EVER made. What can I say that most on this board haven't already said? I was in grade school when this movie came out and 2 scenes will be forever etched in my mind until I die. The first being where Jillian is heading towards her house as the night sky parts with these eerie and brilliant lights descending from above. That was just downright scary because their trajectory is taking them straight to the side of her home.

The second scene came moments later where Jillian's son, Barry is being pulled in a very frightening tug-of-war between mother and alien through the pet slot in the doorway! The music and the lighting increased the tension of that scene to such a crescendo! That entire segment was so frightening because you could barely see the aliens fingers latched onto Barry's arms. To this day, I've argued that Jillian ""lost"" the tug-of-war because the aliens were simply stronger than she was instead of several people insisting that she let Barry go as not to hurt him for fear of her son being pulled apart or injured.

I'm no parent, but I've always believed that a parent will go through great lengths to keep her child protected or die trying and not give up so easily. But that's me. As far as the movie is concerned, it'll always be a 5-star rating. My 3 stars are in reference to the Blu-ray transfer. I will admit, that my Blu-ray transfer expectations were a bit high. Okay, very high:) I'd just watched the incredible The Dark Knight on Blu-ray and that just blew my mind!

The transfer for this movie is not too bad, it's just not as great as I was expecting it to be. Especially with it being the 30th anniversary edition. But that's totally my fault. The sound however is incredible and some scenes look more sharper and crisper than others which was annoying. There were spotty graininess in some scenes and that disappointed me too. That's not to say that I lost my money purchasing this item. One of the pluses of this disc is that it contains all three versions. I really loved that. My personal favorite has always been the Director's Cut, but all three of them are pretty good.

It's funny because I wonder if the 3 versions on the 1 disc have somehow retarded the sharpness of the Blu-ray process itself. It's worth taking into consideration because not many discs have 3 different versions of the same movie on 1 disc; maybe alternate endings, but not an entire movie. That's been my experience anyway. With that said, I'm still glad that I got this movie and in this format as well. Watching Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind never gets old. And with my Blu-ray BD dvd player, big screen tv and my entertainment system, I just can't go wrong. The way Close Encounters was meant to be watched!",3.0

Lots of artifacts and graininess. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be watching CE3K on Blu-Ray or DVD as the graininess was rivaling Battlestar Galactica on DVD.

Disappointing for a 30th Anniversary Ultimate edition.",3.0
"This is one of my all time favorites.  My expectations were a bit high for what to expect in the Blu-Ray format here.  The transfer is decent, at best.  Sounds was fantastic.  There was a lot of graininess in some of the low light shots.

Because there are three versions of the movie on one disk, my guess is that the compression may have been a bit higher.  This might explain the surprisingly low quality of the Blue-Ray version.",3.0

"First off, let me just say that when I saw this movie as kid in the 90s I loved it! Now, its an ok movie that is obviously dated.
This is a movie for teens, it doesn't make much sense (I doubt its suppose to) and its over the top. Theres girls, boobs, booze in the movie and a couple of laughs. If you need even more detail then take a horny teen and give him a possessed devil hand that does every and anything (it kills a few people). I vaguely remember the ended, because I fell asleep lol. I don't hate this movie at all. If you love 90s movies then check it out.
My mistake is that I should have held on to the memory of seeing this when I was younger and NOT rewatch it as an adult.

"While it's always a pleasure to see a good film presented in a better home-theater version than has ever been available, my recent screening of the Blu-Ray version of Close Encounters left me flat.

I'm not going to go on at length about why the film didn't work for me or my wife, who are both at the older end of the Baby Boom.  Suffice it to say  that there's no doubt that the movie is a fine piece of craftmanship all the way around, and the Blu-Ray pressing brings out every visual and aural detail. But none of that quality can turn a story that doesn't ""work"" into an evening of great entertainment.

There's no way to know how YOU will react, especially if you haven't watched any version in the past few years.  It might be prudent to rent the blu-ray before springing for your own copy.

Happy Blu-Ray watching, even if this re-pressing doesn't do the job for you. There are lots of great new discs out there well worth viewing and buying.",3.0

"I bought the very same product on VHS tape (in widescreen).

I had hoped that this would truly make it an enhanced viewing experience, since it was on DVD.

Yes, it comes in a 2-DVD package, although the container itself is stupid to say the least. A flip-flop tray that has to be pulled out of a sleeve.

The second DVD doesn't offer much more, than the specials already included at the end of the videotape.

Granted, the sound is a bit better than its VHS counterpart, but was it worth it? NO!

Let me just compare it with the ""LEGEND - Special Edition"" 2-DVD release.

What did you get in that one?

First of all, since there were two versions of the ""LEGEND"" movie (a Europen/International and a U.S. version), you got them both.

Same feature was included in the ""ALIEN"" superbox, in which one got the theatrical releases and the special/director's cuts, back to back and in the ""X-MEN"" superbox, in which you can easily ""reintegrate"" the cut scenes of the theatrical versions with a push on your remote control.

Here you just receive Steven Spielberg's original vision and the cut/additional scenes are left to a special by itself, included in DVD 2.

The special contents are the very same as the ones included, as said earlier, at the end of the tape.

The interview with Spielberg is tedious and disenchanting. A man consumed by too much success speaks out and seems almost bored with what seems to have been his masterpiece of all times.

A man that has lost his original vision and is disenchanted with his own ideals of yesteryear is not very interesting at all. He's just old.

To impose it then to his ""fans???"" is stupid to say the least.

Maybe he is tired, maybe he is just plainly being sarcastic, or so I hope, 'cause if it is what the man truly feels about producing and directing his own movies (and having an extreme amount of luck in being able to do so at all, while many never get a chance in their lifetimes), seems like a slap in the face to those who have admired his work and his talent.

I, having watched the interview felt personally offended by his reviewed vision of things. Maybe I lack the ""maturity???"" he has achieved?

Nevertheless, I bought this, let me say, junk of a movie.

I even attributed it 3 stars in memory of the old glory it represented, when I first went to a movie theatre to watch it.

It hasn't improved one bit, being transferred onto DVD.

It just sits there, in my shelf, gathering dust.

I wanted to buy ""E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial"" Special Edition, but having seen this, I suspect it's the same-o, same-o as the Laser Disc version I already have and the special VHS widescreen tape I bought some years ago.

Nor am I enthused to have, as a special, the score conducted live by John Williams either. I'll rather wait until the ""live"" score will appear on audio CD one day, and then again, the question will still remain, will I still be interested in anything Steven Spielberg did?

As said, the decision to include such a disillusioned interview with Spielberg on a movie I have learned to cherish for years, made me think, and when I think, it is not usually a good thing.

I sometimes wonder whether this movie was made out of passion or plain and simply with a taste for money in mind.

These are things that irritate me immensely. It is as if Shakespeare would have put down all the works he had written and had considered them plain ""youth junk"".

Sorry Mr. Spielberg, a man that loses faith in his own visions, after having founded a family or not, has either been badly burned by life (which doesn't really seem to be the case with you), or he is plainly tired of his life as it is, in which case my honest suggestion would be, to change activity altogether and allow somebody else ready to carry your burden to emerge.

I have always detested winers, especially when they have reached the top and had so much luck with it.

Please take a moment and think about it, Mr. Spielberg.

Who made you what you are?

The Studios? The Executives? The Backers?

Or we, the audience?

Think, and think hard!

Sorry, I cannot recommend this product and unless somebody with more inventiveness and loyalty toward the audience will dish up both versions (in their entirety), with more uplifting and more interesting specials, I don't see why anyone would do himself so much harm as to waste his/her money in a clever ""rehash"" of the very same product.

By the way, since I am already at it. Please studios, distributors, directors and producers, do us all a big, immense favor.

Stop reissuing the same products in a dozen of different packagings, when the product itself is always the same.

It's a waste of time, talent, taste, money and a complete lack of true intelligence, creativity and intuitiveness.

I can only suppose that you are all better than that, so why don't you push yourselves harder to finally give us, the audience, better and more thoroughly thought of products?

You only stand to gain from it.

Just remember what Abraham Lincoln said:

""You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.""

A bit of respect to those who buy your products should be in order.

Do not ever dare assume that the masses are only formed by illiterate and uncouth people.

Unfortunately for you, there are also people out there able to scrutinize and judge you by your deeds.

There are even some, able to read between the lines.

So, please, become a bit wiser and show us that we are not just buyers, but rather chosers of your fate.

Yes, because ultimately it is us, the customers, who decide whether you have another day in business or not, not your fancy peers, nor your elegant, Armani clad, shareholders.

Keep that in mind, and you will be in business forever.

Forget it, and your life may be drastically changed by the twists of fate, and as we all know, fate cannot be influenced by one man alone.

This is it.

Buy it, my fellow customers, if you feel you have money to throw to the dogs. Refrain, if every penny is dear to you.

There are far better movies around.

This is just an old myth and getting older by the minute.",3.0
"Apparently, Spielberg said he made War of the Worlds because it would be `fun' to do nasty aliens for a change. But just how `cuddly and benevolent' were these particular ET's? They terrorise a mother to within an inch of her life, pulling her child out of her own arms leaving her distraught and not knowing whether he is alive or dead. Why did they do that when they had dozens of adult abductees that had perfectly useful mature brains for study? Nasty aliens. And what about those adult abductees? Second World War guys, torn from wives or girlfriends. True love gone forever. Their parents probably dead in the interim. On top of that trauma they now have to adjust to a new world where they don't fit in. The result: depression and alcoholism, maybe even suicide. Nasty, nasty aliens. Then to cap it all off they come out of their mother ship naked and expose themselves to the reception committee. Sexual assault can be extremely traumatic, resulting in long term psychological problems. Except the French guy who no doubt treats that sort of thing with a Gallic shrug. Nasty, nasty, nasty aliens.

Spielberg is fooling nobody but himself. See War of the Worlds, by the way, it's great. There's no plot, though.",3.0
"The trailers for ""Idle Hands"" implied the film was a madcap horror comedy when, in reality, the filmmakers created something more along the lines of ""An American Werewolf in London."" Granted, they don't come near the high water mark of that film, or even the later ""Fright Night"" or ""The Lost Boys,"" but ""Idle Hands"" has genuine moments of horror along with its comedy, although neither element is particularly memorable.

From the icky premise to the icky undead friends acting as Greek chorus to the hot babe inexplicably drawn to the protagonist to the dark finale, ""Idle Hands"" bears the mark of the creators watching ""American Werewolf"" over and over and over again while creating this film.

Of course, it's not as though ""An American Werewolf in London"" is difficult to find at your local video store. For those looking for those sorts of thrills, stick with the original, as well as ""Fright Night"" and ""Lost Boys.""

""Idle Hands"" is a recommended rental for fans of Seth Green or Jessica Alba, but other horror fans should give it a miss.",3.0
"""Idle Hands"" starts as a horror film, but after the opening 10 minutes, it's very obvious that this movie is also a comedy. This film features some spoofs to classic horror films like ""The Shining"", ""The Evil Dead"" or ""The Night Of The Living Dead"". As a matter of fact, ""Idle Hands"" works better as a comedy than as a horror film.

 The cast includes a lot of young actors like Devon Sawa (Anton), Seth Green (Mick), Elden Hensen (Pnub) and Jessica Alba (Molly). We already know that Seth Green is very funny and Jessica Alba is charming, but the surprise in this movie is Devon Sawa. He uses a lot of physical tricks and shakes his hand in a funny and convincing way.

 The plot is kinda silly and obviously has holes here and there, but the dialogues are the main attraction here, the characters talk in double sense, with irony and black humor, and they make a lot of funny references to Anton's hand, Pnub's severed head or the bottle inserted into Mick's head.

 This an amusing movie, it's good enough to entertain the audience for 90+ minutes, the MTV 2 soundtrack features tracks performed by bands like The Offspring, Rancid and Rob Zombie. ""Idle Hands"" is a movie for young people looking for laughs, it's much better than the average teenager slasher flick. And by the way, Jessica Alba looks gorgeous in ""Idle Hands"".",3.0

"IDLE HANDS has more misses than hits, but one can't help but find the overall movie amusing.  Devon Sawa does a very good job with his possessed hand, some have already mentioned it's likeness to Steve Martin in ALL OF ME.  Bringing back his friends (Seth Green, Elden Henson) as zombies is a direct ripoff from both American Werewolf movies, and even though derivative as such, are buoyant and fun.  Viveca Fox as the hand hunter is hilarious, as is Jack Noseworthy as the pseudo-studly Randy.  There is lots of gore, pot smoking, even nutmeg/oregano smoking, but in this day and age, what teen movie wouldn't have it.  The overuse of soundtrack songs is as always distracting, but again, when one targets a teen audience, this is what one gets.  However, the musical score itself by Graeme Revell is very good.  This is one of those movies you watch when you need a good laugh, and even though it's not as funny as you want it to be, it still delivers.",3.0
"First of all I will say that if you read this review and have not seen the movie, you may want to skip it all the way to the last sentence or two.  Well, anyway, I enjoyed this film, yet I feel I've been down this road before.  The only real difference is that the characters are all a bunch of stoners, for the most part.  It involves one particular stoner who wakes up one morning and finds his parents are not around, though he seems too stoned to care.  Though there is a serial killer on the loose, all he cares about is scoring some more weed...which, to most stoners, is pretty right on the target.  He comes to find out later that HE is actually the killer!  Big surprise!  I won't say anymore about the plot though.  If you've seen Evil Dead or Re-Animator, you're really in for nothing new to the genre.  The gore scenes are pretty interesting, but nothing to really single it out as a gore classic either.  Mediocre at best, Idle Hands only really stands out in the defiant attitude of the time it was released just nearly a week after the Columbine Massacre.  The DVD has got some interesting features, including a good deleted scene, but it's a little murky.",3.0
"Wow, this movie was incredibly terrible. ""Idle Hands"" are the devil's playground. Nobody cares. Anton (Devon Sawa) is a teenager who uses his inhaler as an 'instrument.' Not cool dude. His right hand then becomes possessed and starts to murder. His parents, family and almost his girlfriend (Jessica Alba). That hand deserved major punishment going after ""Dark Angel"" like that. Aside from the horrible plot, watch this movie because of how good Jessica Alba looks, nothing else.",3.0
"I would really rate this as 3.5 stars but not 4, so I'm forced to give it a 3.
First off, the movie overall is excellent. Heck, I was 11 years old when this came out and I LIVED in Muncie, Indiana when it was released. The theater went nuts when the subtitle came on, saying ""Muncie, IN"", and then seeing Roy wearing a Ball State University shirt, well that just got the crowd in the theatre all worked up. We loved it!
I saw the ""Special Edition"" on VHS when it came out. I was a little diasppointed at the time when the scene with Roy tearing up his lawn was removed from that edition.
However, I wasn't as disappointed with that version as I am with this. Many of the scenes from the 1st SE have been moved off to the second DVD as deleted scenes. A bad choice in my opinion. However, those scenes that were missing in the SE from the original release are back in with some other new scenes plonked in as well. Still, it's a disappointment with the other scenes missing.
But, the other features on the second DVD are great. But, I wish Columbia/TriStar would take notice of how James Cameron released T2 - The Ultimate Edition. In that release, you have the choice of 3 versions of the movie on the same DVD: The original theatrical release, the Special Edition which came out a few years later on VHS, and then a third version with more deleted scenes in addition to the SE version. I don't know why Columbia/TriStar/Spielberg couldn't have done the same for Close Encounters.
The picture itself is great and the sound is excellent. Much better than the original release back in 1977, but of course, technology for sound has improved vastly since then, so it's not a surprise. Still, it's amazing how the sound can make a difference in how a movie is presented.
To have this on DVD is a must. Now, if Spielberg would release the Indiana Jones movies and Lucas would release the 2nd trilogy of Star Wars as well on DVD, my sci-fi/action DVD collection would be almost complete.",3.0
"'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' is more of a children's movie.  Although adults will appreciate it, most of them will wonder what was the point behind it.  On a crystal clear summer night, average citizens witness what appear to be UFOs in the sky.  For some the UFOs affect them more than others.  A child, his mother, Richard Dreyfuss, and a dozen other unnamed people begin seeing visions in their head.  They see a geographical structure, but can't make sense of it.  Later they find out it is Devil's Tower in the west.  Cut between these stories are small stories of strange events happening across the world; stretching from Mexico to India.  In the middle of the Gobi desert, a seaship is found.
Finally our heros, Richard Dreyfuss and a woman reach the Devil's Tower for the climax.  The climax is enjoyable if one of able to make sense of it.  Some people will look at it and say, ""Wow look at all the pretty spaceships!""  Maybe Speilberg was trying to entertain and mystify us for two hours, which he does at certain momements.  I guess what he's trying to say is, ""Aliens are not harmful.  They are here to make peace with us.""  But at the end, when the gigantic spaceship rises behind Devil's Tower, the only thing I was thinking was, ""Wow the only thing bigger than that spaceship is Speilberg's ego!""",3.0
"I remember seeing this at the theater and thought the DVD would be a good addition to my collection. My memory of the story was better than the DVD turned out to be.

If you find it on sale you might want to pick it up.",3.0
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind tries to pass itself off as science fiction, when actually it's a fantasy. The screenplay was based upon the book The UFO Experience, written by the professor of astronomy at Ohio State University, Dr. Allen Hynek. While the book sticks to the facts and doesn't jump to conclusions, the same can't be said for the movie. All goes ""according to plan"" until the ending-- when for some reason they decided to toss the book out and write a sappy ending. I guess the director felt it would be more entertaining that way. Also, why did he call it Close Encounters of the Third Kind? At the end of the film both species *communicate* using musical notes and hand gestures, thus it should've been called Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind.",3.0
"If you've got the time to spare (and who didn't back in 1977?) then re-watching this old timer with a good picture is probably worth it.

He's a family man now, so he says he can't make movies about faithless men who leave their wives for a bunch of baloney. Why not? I suspect he may, like Lucas, be being put out to pasture soon.",3.0

This is one incredibly overrated film.  Previous reviews were more accurate than I could be in describing its numerous points of weakness, but the one that stood out for me was the story, and in particular the over-the-top, contrived situations and characters that go beyond believable and just destroy the viewer's suspension of disbelief (assuming said viewer has a 3-digit IQ) no matter how hard they want to maintain it and stay in the film world.
I was very young when this film came out, so I have the luxury of judging this film on its own merits and not with the taint of childhood film hype or nostalgia.

"""Idle hands are the Devil's play things.""
There you have the basic concept of this film. Well, sort of. The basic idea is that a slacker wakes up one day to discover his hand is possessed and when it is not busy,  it is trying to kill everyone around him-including his best friends. He  does kill them actually, and they come back as zombies who mock  him.
Sound weird? It gets weirder. This movie is more of a horror-spoof  than an actual horror film, yet its scary moments are much better done  than, say, those of Scream. Then when it turns to comedy and parody it  excels! The movie is actually really funny, and it takes itself so lightly,  that you get the feeling the cast and characters they play are laughing  right along with you.

Close Encounters was his last film as a director with innocent creativity that brought great movies like Duel, Sugarland Express, Jaws and Close Encounters. From my point of view, the new ending did hurt the movie.  The original one was very satisfying, presented just enough and left much more for our imagination. Obviously Spielberg wanted to re-done this movie in his in ""cheesed up, at times childish, big bang Hollywood style"" which is evident in duds like ET (artistically), Hook (financially).Just leave Close Encounters alone, perhaps make another ET (hope not)if he feels the need for more alien, sci-fi flicks.",3.0

"The parentheses are because I believe, can't be sure, that this sub-genre has been erased in some form of political correctness; at any rate, ""weepy woman's picture"", which is what it is, is accurate in its descriptive power, if not in its acceptability. Julia Roberts, naturally, is very good to look at, Susan Sarandon is not bad either; despite this, they play the parts of the wife-to-be and the ex-wife excellently. The modern, hip, touch is that the wife-to-be is living with the ex-husband and husband to be, Ed Harris, in the role of step mom to his children, who, in the course of the things, will become her step-children.  Ed Harris, manages to keep smiling ,playing fifth significant person to the two women and, in point of fact, to his 12 year old daughter and ca, 8 year old son. This is the kind of film in which men are just a backdrop to the two women (as in the days of Davis and Hopkins).
The film goes on too long for what it has to say, becoming tedious by the Christmas Day ending. Whether it will seem tedious to viewers who like this sort of thing, I cannot say. At any rate, as far as I can tell, those who like this kind of film, will like this one.",3.0

I find myself getting bored very quickly through movies, but I did not get bored in this movie, and I still don't after seeing in multiple times.

"Rated P.G,this ultimate chick flick for all ages, is one movie which will definitley make the most cold hearted person reach for the tissue box,if not at the start,then definitley by the end.
  This is also one movie you wouldn't want to drag your boyfriend,(any typical male,etc),to as they will either find it to low on action,or they will fall asleep. But with that aside,this is an excellent movie to watch with your mum,sister,or friends for a fun girls night.
set mainly in the city of New York,this is one of the first films to show the pain and jealousy involved when you divorce,and your ex finds someone else,especially when children are involved and expected to treat their father's new girlfriend as if she were their mum,(which happens all the time in real-life).
  The only bad thing I can say about this movie is the complete lack of suspence,and action. There is virtually no action,mostly sad,hurtful scenes with lots of realistic looking tension between the leads.whilst I say there isn't much action and suspence,the suprises and shocks all through this movie,more than make up for it.

I was moved when Jackie (Susan Sarandon) said, ""Oh, sweetie, it's okay to miss me."" I thought everyone in the movie gave a very moving performance. In conclusion, I recommend this movie to anyone who's a fan of Julia Roberts.",3.0
"Before I start describing how good the movie was, I want to stop at both actors Julia Roberts and Ed Harris. If they are put in a silent movie, of no words and not even subtitles, they can make the film emotionally rich just by their facial expressions!

The is a light movie, that all family can enjoy watching together. It's based on emotional conflict between a family with two kids and a stepmom (Julia Roberts). In this movie you'll enjoy the emotional driven laughs and tears all the way until the end.
One of the things that you'll enjoy most in this film is that you'll enjoy your life better and appreciate more many things in your life that you have taken for granted.
THIS IS A MUST SEE FOR ALL FANS of Julia Roberts and Ed Harris. And if you loved this movie you'll love more Julia Roberts' movie ""My Best Friend Wedding"".",3.0
"My main reason for the low review was the story.  I found it hard to believe stepmom and X wife were interacting regularly to resolve issues regarding the kids.  I mean, you have a series of conflicts between the  two which finally lead to Julia's acceptance into the family?  Just didn't  add up.  I didn't find any of the events or all the events put together  fulfilling enough to justify the acceptance.  I don't know any stepmom that  would put up with half the stuff Julia's character did.  The DVD is fairly  decent.  The video transfer is good, the audio is nice and the extras are  ok.  But unless you're a big fan of Julia Robert's or Susan Sarandon's, I  don't see the point in watching this movie or purchasing it for that  matter.",3.0
"I am sorry to say that I found this movie just a little too far from the reality.  Julia Roberts (stepmom)  insisted so much to pick up the kids and drop off the kids by herself, even risk loosing her job. But why?  Did she  try to do it all to prove to her new hubby that she can be a good mom or  she simply happens to love these brats?  I found it quite unbelievable that  she is so willing to accomodate all the hardships.  The movie didn't really  show that the relationship between her and her new hubby is too great to  break (there is not much emotions between the couple except a few kiss  scenes) so where is all her feelings attached to the kids coming from? To  me she is just trying too hard that she only proves she is a very insecure  woman regardless of her successful career.  Near the end of the movie Julia  finally confess to the biological mom that she is worried that one day Anna  will grow up only wondering where her real mom is in her wedding, I found  this scene incredibly unpersuasive.  How old is Julia Roberts supposed to  be in this film didn't she think that one day she will bear child of her  own?  It is true that there are many wonderful and responsible stepmoms out  there but this one just tries a little too hard.  Too hard to buy it.",3.0
"I liked the movie pretty much, but the kids were really cocky and a little too old for their age..especially Ben.  Anna really treated the whole situation very unrealistically.  Some things that were said and done would  definitely not happen in real life.  Do not buy this, just rent it.  It's  worth that, but it's not worth it to own it.",3.0
"Well, the good news is that Sarandon and Roberts are such appealing and affecting actors that they are able to carry this fairly predictable film on their backs as long as they can.  Sarandon's character is so  relentlessly mean to Roberts through the first hour and a half that the  ultimate kissy-huggy life enhancing experience we are all supposed to have  towards the end defies belief (I mean, if Sarandon's character is such a  perfect mom, wouldn't she be at least a little kinder and a lot less  selfish/obsessively rude to Roberts, considering that her kids *will* be  spending time with Roberts and Harris).  Sarandon is such a -- well, you  know -- that whatever shortcomings Roberts' character has as a potential  mother, you forgive simply because she is so mistreated (Roberts also looks  strangely like Barbra Streisand several times; maybe it's the bangs).  And  compare the kids' ""bye mom, we love you"" scenes with the  comparable Debra Winger Terms of Endearment (incomparable, actually).  But  it's a big wallow and lots of autumn leaves and Ed Harris' blue eyes and  the two women -- be sure to watch this in widescreen/2.35 as I think it  will lose a lot in a pan and scan version.",3.0
"Ok, I rented this because I figured my girlfriend would like it, but so did I. Michelle Pfeiffer is her most riveting. I normally don't like Treat Williams, but I found his character very beleivable here. Also the young  man who played Vincent (17 yr. old) will do well to keep acting, he has a  road ahead of him. I know it sounds like a movie-of-the-week plot, but it  is quite effective. The DVD itself has a short (5 min) featurette, that is  about as enlightening as it sounds.",3.0
"This is the first movie where Tom Hanks really began to show his depth. It was a film that required him to open with the comedic chops he's honed so well but then, because of the deepening of the film's story from comedy to drama, requested so much more of him. He ultimately delivers in spades.

This is really a story about a son moving very fast in the fast lane of advertising. He's a pro and he loves what he does. He's also a personality that lives on charm and in the moment.  But when his parents separate after years of marriage, his life changes rapidly from no personal responsibilities to a multitude of them. It's also begs a question that rarely gets told well- how do sons and daughters deal with parents as life turns the tables and we suddenly start having to deal with listening to and taking care of them? The changing of roles and responsibilities. As the film unfolds, it presents those concerns with proper weight, depth, sadness, growth and understanding.

Gary Marshall directed the film prior to his mega hit with Pretty Woman but I really think this is the better film of the two. He draws the best from Jackie Gleason, Eva Marie Saint and Beth Armstrong and Hector Alonzo- each lending a real ensemble cast feeling to the piece and although Tom Hanks shines- so do they.

Jackie Gleason deserves special mention because he really plays a rather hard, sad man at the end of the road as a clothing salesman, and he digs deep, never lending anything false to how this man thinks, feels and operates. The exchanges between him and Hanks about how he was raised lend a real truth to the role.

If you're looking for a film that has some humor and some depth of feeling in the same breath, this is an interesting evening's viewing.

An underrated film that deserves a second look and a larger audience.",3.0
"Tom Hanks plays an successful advertising agent. His life is running smoothly until his mother leaves his father. Then his dad loses his job. He's trying to help both out but his relationship with his dad is rocky. Family problems start to effect his work. It's about how Hank's character handles this new development and also the the relationships of the two women in his life. One, the daughter of the owner of the airline and the other an childhood sweetheart he's still friends with.

This movie started out slow so I'm thinking I'm going to be disappointed. Finally, the story picks up and it gets interesting. I think with better editing this could have been a very good movie instead of just okay.",3.0
"Tom Hanks is the young yuppie in Chicago who is a big hot-shot ad man, and Jackie Gleason (in his last screen role) is his father who has just lost his meager job and is facing divorce. Gleason comes across as most unlovable, and the conflict between Hanks and him produces quite a bit of noise. The selfish Hanks has to make some sacrifices for his father, as expected--there's the message. The movie tries to do too much, though, and not much of it in any depth. It's all surface.",3.0
"I knew right from the first scene there was little possibility of overcoming Tom Hanks' stilted ""too cool for school"" impression of Bruce Willis and Chevy Chase.  Unfortunately, Jackie Gleason never has any dialogue that could have possibly challenged him or stretched him as an actor.  The only reasons I can even give it three stars is that the supporting actors all fare a little bit better and the attempt to show family being more important than career hits it's bullseye.  If you try to overlook it's obvious cliches, there is a lot of warmth around the edges that makes it worth watching once.",3.0

"I love Michelle Pfeiffer and she was amazing in this movie, but this movie could have been so much better.
The story was slow and boring, and very sad from beginning to end.

Beth has three small children.
Her three year old son (her middle child) is kidnapped.
She can't handle the loss and can't move on.
She neglects the two children that she still has.
Her marriage suffers.

I could feel Beth's pain at the loss of her child, but I felt more of her guilt over him being kidnapped right under her nose (which really could have happened to anyone, so she was way too hard on herself).

SPOILER ALERT..

The three year old, Ben, is never found by Whoopi Goldberg and the experts who were working for years to find him.
Instead, as a twelve year old, he actually walks up to the family's door and just rings the bell.
He had no idea that this was his real family.  He was simply going door to door, looking for work mowing lawns.
This kidnapped child remained in the same neighborhood all along, and later, both the older brother and younger sister admit that they had seen him around, many times.

Absolutely every character in this movie is miserable.
The irony is that Ben was the only character who was happy, that is, until his real family wants to take him back and away from the only life that he knows, and then, Ben becomes just as miserable as everyone else.

Ben was kidnapped by a woman who was an old acquaintance of Beth's, a woman who was aching for the death of her own child, and so she kidnapped Ben to replace her own three year old boy.
The woman died, and so Ben was raised by the woman's second husband, who had no idea that Ben was not his wife's biological child.
This stepfather described Ben as the happiest child that he had ever known, until it came out that he had been kidnapped, and then he became the saddest child that he had ever known.
For me, the most heartbreaking part of this movie was when the stepfather said this.

Ben is reunited with his real family, but everyone stays miserable.
Beth is thrilled to get her son back, but her joy does not last when she realizes that her son does not remember her and does not accept her.
The real father is relieved to have his son back, but he is also hurting and angry that Ben feels like the stepfather is his real father.
The older brother never wanted Ben back and has a lot of his own guilt and resentments toward Ben.
The little sister was only a baby when Ben was kidnapped, and so she is still too young to really understand what has been going on.

At the end, the family must admit that Ben needs to be with the stepfather, and they reluctantly send him back.
So, this movie begins with the sadness of the kidnapping and remains sad all the way through to the end.",3.0
"I am a big fan of Mr. Hanks and I am old enough to have watched and enjoyed many hours of ""The great one"" on television.  Both are very talented in their own ways.  I had not seen this film till today.  Not even sure why I suddenly wanted to watch it.  This is early in Hanks career and the semi-manic, rapid fire manner in which he juggles his way through a scene is already firmly in his grasp.  He is fun to watch.  The script is where I would prefer to focus my criticism because the actors were all quite fine.

There are other write-ups that will identify this as one of the best father - son relationship movies, ever.  I would hardly cast my vote that way.  For example, one of the most scorched earth movies that is everything that this film is not, ""Affliction"" with Nick Nolte and the late James Coburn is a smouldering, simmering volcanic dynamo.  ""Nothing in common"" by comparison is way too kosher, safe and aimed for middle America, taking very few risks and staying rather formulaic.  The comparison I draw might be unfair because there are many other father son movies and plays that far outshine this film.  For example ""Death of a salesman"", perhaps the greatest of them all, is an invitation to examine the dark side of family traffic.  Nothing in Common, watched now in 2014, seems by comparison to be a product of its time.  It suffers from not taking the emotional risks that real families in deep distress actually live through.

Gleason was robbed all his life of enough dramatic roles.  While a wonderful television icon he excelled in the very few really meaty dramatic roles and sadly we got to see too little of that.  In this film he is not given enough room to stretch his personality beyond the crabby old and sick man that he has become.  His character is not allowed to share the grief he continues to bottle up.  You spend a few minutes watching the interactions in ""Affliction"" and you can see what better scripts and raw gestalt can do for dramatic effect.

I think that this film suffers from trying to be two things at once: a very light comedy and a light weight drama.  It would have been better served, in my view, by sticking with one version and strengthening the focus.  These were actors who could perform, all of them and its a shame that they were not allowed to show the pains of family stresses in a more forthright manner.

I don't want to say that the film has aged badly.  It is a product of a Hollywood system that pushes product downstream into the market and cares much less about making bold statements.  By the reckoning of my own tastes, I enjoy a more visceral drama, one in which there is danger lurking beneath the rising blood pressure.  Will something suppressed, something urgent finally be said?  In fairness the strength of the film is in the last 20 minutes where the dramatic heat comes as close to a boil as the script allows.  I found myself sitting quietly and barely moved at all throughout the viewing.  It is a tepid affair and I would not recommend it too much, especially in light of what Tom Hanks went on to.  I needed to see something more substantial here;  perhaps I had nothing in common with the film?",3.0
"Looks of good actors and compelling stories.  I do get tired of this stereotype that young female professionals are heartless and lacking in empathy, and too full of ambition.  Overall, a good story, even though dated by the 1980's clothing styles and hair - yuk!  Did we really look like that back then? Probably so...",3.0
"Jackie Gleason, in his final film role, plays the icy, stonewalling father of a hyperactive, professional Tom Hanks. There's a good message at the core of this one, about the impenetrable veneer expected of men from his generation and the dire effects it bore on those around him. Hanks, a smooth-talking corporate '80s ad exec, and Gleason, a foot-to-pavement salesman struggling to deal with the end of his career, manage well with the heavy stuff while occasionally injecting a few welcome dashes of humor and sarcasm to the mix. The film is flawed, though, in its unbridled lack of restraint. Every last supporting character hints at a big, convoluted back story and many of them are halfheartedly explored. That diverts attention away from the key players and leaves us with what seems like one big, fuzzy, unfocused batch of incomplete or unfulfilling arcs. There's simply too much to keep track of, and too much time wasted with characters we don't care about. Noteworthy as the stage where Hanks showed he could be more than just a comic player, but otherwise it's too overstuffed and vague to recommend.",3.0

"I was pretty worried going into Nothing In Common earlier tonight.  I seem to be a VERY picky person when it comes to Tom Hank films.  Besides Forest Gump, I mostly only like his ultra serious films, such as Saving Private Ryan and a few others that escape my mind at the moment.

I still believe Tom Hanks hit the high point in his career around 10 years ago.  He didn't exactly start out as an incredible movie star.  It took him a long time to get going and win over movie watchers.

However, Nothing In Common turned out to be good.  Not GREAT by any stretch of the imagination- just barely good enough that I recommend sticking through the first hour of useless storytelling in order to get to the good stuff (the good being Tom Hanks' characters relationship with his father).

The first hour of Nothing In Comming features nothing but Hanks' character trying to sleep with a few different women, and he ends up succeeding.  I guess these moments are supposed to qualify as humor, or romantic-style humor, but for me it doesn't exactly work because there's no interesting storyline development while this is going on.  Some of the other characters he communicates with is rather unexceptional and pointless to include in the story as well.  Makes me wonder what movie writers were thinking back then.

The film is also SEVERELY dated.  It's definitely stuck in the mid 80's, right down to the ugly predictable pacing and the wimpy music that's supposed to pass the test as ""beautiful"" and ""fitting the mood"".  Prepare yourself for a huge smack of the 80's right in your face as far as the soundtrack and presentation is concerned.

At least the relationship between Tom Hanks' character and his father actually got good starting around the halfway point, otherwise this would have easily been a 1-star forgettable (and laughable) movie for Tom Hanks.  He moved on to *much* better things later on.",3.0
"The film itself is easily a 5 Star.. My opinion it's one of the most under-rated ridiculous action film parodies..  I gave it a 3 instead of 1 to be to the film, because as many have mentioned this is a half-assed poorly converted version of this film I have ever seen.. Not only because the rendering is a jerry rig to step up the quality but the sound as mention is not... well.. it's often muted in some spots while others it's extremely loud.. So if you crank up the volume to hear the faint sound of most of the dialogue the music and the gunshots might blow your speakers (exaggerating) BUT it is a very poor version of an otherwise great film. It's as if's mono sound.. It may be.",3.0

1. Characters are one-dimensional. Mom is hysterical and emotional woman. Dad is stoic and emotionless man. Vincent is a mean and evil child from the very beginning. Sam/Ben is the ""good boy.""

2. Movie depends upon really unrealistic coincidences.

3. Movie rushes to a forced ""happy ending.""

4. Movie was odd in how it approached the kidnapped boy's adoptive father. There was no effort to come up with a creative parenting scheme -- like shared custody. Instead, everything was either/or. Unrealistic and simple.",3.0
"One of the fringe benefits of a major format change is the inevitable markdowns of old stock of the old format.  I've been taking advantage of the VHS sales in local video stores for quite a while now.  Many of them are dirt cheap, and if you still have a functional VCR and don't demand all the ""extras"" of the DVD format, you can find all kinds of bargains.

And all kinds of dross too, unfortunately.  I purchased this movie recently, along with several other films starring Michelle Pfeiffer and was contemplating holding my own personal ""Pfeiffer Film Festival,"" but for better or for worse, I started out with DEEP END OF THE OCEAN and that pretty much nipped those plans in the bud.  I wound up shelving the other entries in the Pfeiffer filmography for another rainy day.  This one was just too depressing.  And I don't mean the content.

I think most people recognize that Michelle Pfeiffer is a talented actress as well as being a very beautiful woman.  But like many good actresses, she seems to wind up in mediocre film after mediocre film.  Maybe it was ever thus.  How many truly great films did a Katharine Hepburn or a Bette Davis really do in their day.  And Liz Taylor did clunker after clunker in the late 60s and early 70s.  But there was a significant change in recent decades.  Even our biggest stars of today don't carry films the way they once did.  No one goes to see a Michelle Pfeiffer film just because Michelle Pfeiffer is in it these days.  The pressure is on, then, for an actor to pick vehicles worthy of his or her talents.

A number of the reviews I've seen posted here and elsewhere have elaborated on THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN's storyline, so I won't belabor that here.  Suffice to say that the story of a child's kidnapping and the subsequent emotional trauma it inflicts on an entire family is a potentially powerful one.  Pfeiffer heads a strong cast, including Treat Williams as her equally grieving but more resilient husband.  They all have good moments and make the most of their screentime, but the story never quite gels.  And it doesn't get much better when after ten years, the family is abruptly reunited with their lost son.

The fact that the reunion is highly unlikely is not so much the problem.  I'm not out to revoke anyone's dramatic license here.  What makes no dramatic sense or even common sense is the family's handling of the situation.  In the Age of Oprah, how come no one even considers any kind of counseling for ANYONE in the family.  Many people (and many entire families, of course) are resistant to seeking psychological help, but under such extraordinary circumstances, it's hard to imagine this family not even considering the option.  If not for themselves, how about for the boy?  After all he's been through, even the proudest of families should feel little compunction about his receiving professional help.

Like many other reviewers who have not read Jacquelyn Michaud's acclaimed novel upon which this film is based, I am guessing that this is likely one more case in which the ""book was better.""  A novel, of course, can indulge in more leisurely pacing, and provide more background and, most importantly, can utilize techniques like interior monologue which contemporary cinema rightly eschews.  (Voiceovers don't cut it--and never did).  I wonder too if the book might not have provided us with some kind of explanation for the evocative title.  There seems to be a trend toward a kind of emotional topography in recent fiction and cinema (not only ""deep ends of the ocean"" but also ""maps of the world"" and of ""the human heart"").  Apparently, they mean something.  The book may make it clear.  The movie doesn't really bother.",3.0

"This movie is two movies really, and that is why it may appear longer than what it is. The first half deals with the loss of a child at a school reunion. The child does not reappear, and the way the family deal with it  is extremely well done.  Pfeiffer portrays the mother who never gets over  the grief extremely well.  The second half of the movie deals with the  family moving to Chicago, and by an amazing twist of fate, stumble across  their son. Naturally it is NOT all roses from here on.  The son is taken  out of the home he is used to, told that he was kidnapped and expected to  fit in to his new family. By this time, I was very sad as I just wanted it  to come together nicely for the family. For awhile the movie seeed to drag,  but it was still watchable.  Fine performances from Treat Williams as the  father who expects everything to fall into place, and as mentioned above, a  great performance from Michelle Pfeiffer as the mother who has to endure so  much pain. I agree with others, it seems like a telemovie only because many  telemovies focus on similar family themes. The movie will promise you this  though: in the blink of an eye, your whole life can change.",3.0

"This is a review of the 2014 Blu-ray release.

I never understood why this movie didn't do better.  Perhaps because it didn't take itself seriously - it is, after all, an Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie mocking Arnold Schwarzenegger action movies - so maybe we feel like we shouldn't take it seriously either.

Arnold by this time had well established himself as an action hero, indeed THE action hero to many.  But he had also starred in several successful comedies, such as Twins and Kindergarten Cop.  And while there is plenty of action in this movie, it is more a comedy than an action movie.  It is surprisingly (and refreshingly) self-aware in its analysis of the fictional reflection of our real world that exists only in the movies - sort of a modern-day Alice Through the Looking Glass.  Whether mocking that there are no ordinary-looking women in the movies, only gorgeous models; or the impossibility that all phone numbers begin with ""555"", this movie asks us to examine the holes in the fictional reality we are fed in the movie theater, rather than overlook them.  It is not often that we get a refreshingly honest script as this.

Unfortunately, this Blu-ray presentation leaves something to be desired.  The transfer is a bit soft, with weak blacks, and even some fuzzy blurring to the edge of the image in at least one scene (the last projection booth scene).  There are ZERO extras, (not even a trailer), and the menu consists of one choice - ""Play Movie"".  No soundtrack or subtitle options.  Obviously Columbia has not shown the love to this movie.  So, much as I regret it, this Blu-ray only gets 3 stars, due to the quality of the transfer.  However, don't let that dissuade you.  This really is a gem of a movie.",3.0

"This film may be a tribute to all things action in Hollywood, but there were some other things worth enjoying.  Right from the start, I wish that there had been more of Danny Devito as the cartoon cat, but that may just be because I'm a Danny Devito fan...Arnold just doesn't do it for me.  The ridiculous nature of the ""action movie"" was quite enjoyable (sadly, action movies in our world aren't that far off) and the villain, played by Charles Dance, didn't quite stray into an area that I like to refer to as ""stereotypical creepy"".  I enjoyed the satirical elements of this film, though I stop and wonder how the makers of real action films come up with some of their stuff.  I mean, I thought all the satire was right on the money, so have action movies really strayed so much?  Anyway, I found the leading lad, Austin O'Brien, okay, though he seemed to stray from whining to annoyingly over-confident the whole time, neither of which are appealing traits for me.  I actually found Robert Prosky as the theatre attendant more interesting...Danny Devito still wins though.

It's good for a laugh, especially at the action movies it's making fun of.  Enjoy.",3.0

I'm a big Arnold fan, but this kind of role just wasn't meant for him.  He's a great action star, but the depth of emotions the main character has to go through would have been better served by another actor.  I didn't think the story was horrible like some one star reviews state and the action was sufficient.

"Considered to be one of the biggest summer disappointments of 1993, Last Action Hero tried to get its name out there by being the next big name action flick, and it sure did disappoint many. Here's a thing to keep in mind though: this is actually a PARODY of the action genre that just happens to have Arnold Schwarzenegger in it. It's not trying to be a replica of the big names such as Terminator, Predator, or even Commando (which was unintentionally hilarious, by the way). Instead, it's an inside joke in the style of a sketch comedy skit, except it's drawn out much longer. While I personally don't think that Last Action Hero is terrible by any means, it doesn't mean that's it flawless.

Arnold manages to play two characters in this film: the far more present cinematic world character Jack Slater, and the real life version of himself. He is obviously the reason why you would want to see this movie, and throughout the film, he makes fun of his stereotypical character by using over-the-top one liners and using unorthodox methods of action scenes. There's some hilarious jokes that he says throughout, and along with him, we even manage to see other film icons playing some of their trademark parts, including Robert Patrick dressed up as the T-1000, Sharon Stone's role as Catherine Tramell, and one of my personal favorites, Sylvester Stallone as The Terminator on a cardboard cutout. While I do enjoy the comedic, over-the-top bits that obviously point out the Hollywood cliches, this film suffers from drawing these out too long amongst its script. Sometimes they tend to be unnecessary and at others rather boring.

Also, I found the child protagonist played by Austin O'Brien to be rather annoying. Part of me thinks that they used the idea of him teaming up with Schwarzy from T2, where Edward Furlong was the child protagonist. While Furlong was clever, funny and acted well, O'Brien tries too hard to be a mastermind behind the typical action film. I understand that the role of a child was necessary for this to work, seeing how he managed to magically appear in the movie with his favorite action hero, but it could have been done far better with someone that could pull it off in a far less annoying fashion.

In a way, I tend to find Last Action Hero to be an enjoyable popcorn flick that tried something new by being a hidden parody. It was a major risk for director John McTiernan, screenwriter Shane Black (who ironically rewrote the script despite Zak Penn and Adam Leff having it a tongue-in-cheek reference to Black's style), and Arnold, but as a parody, it works. It's just a far cry from what we would expect from a cast like aforementioned.",3.0

"A year after Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", in 1993, he followed up with the summer action film ""Last Action Hero"".

The film was directed by John McTiernan (""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"", ""The 13th Warrior"", ""The Thomas Crown Affair"") and a screenplay by Shane Black (""Lethal Weapon"" films, ""The Monster Squad"", ""The Last Boy Scout"") and David Arnot (""The Adventures of Ford Fairlane"").  The film featured cinematography by Dean Semler (""Bruce Almighty"", ""The Alamo"", ""The Longest Yard"", ""2012') and music by Michael Kamen (""X-Men"", ""Band of Brothers"", ""Frequency)"".

An expensive film which cost around $85 million, the film was literally a spoof on action films and would feature cameos from many stars around that time.  From Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ian McKellen, Tina Turner, Robert Patrick and many more.

The film revolves around a boy named Danny Madigan (played by Austin O'Brien) who is a big fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger action films, especially his character Jack Slater.

The problem with Danny is that he rarely goes to school and it's become a problem since he spends his time watching movies and his mother covers up for him.

With the release of ""Jack Slater IV"", his friend Nick (played by Robert Prosky) who runs a very old rundown movie theater that is not doing so well, Jack gives him a sneak preview to catch the movie.  Nick also talks about how he was given a gold-ticket by Harry Houdini but never used it.

Nick tears the ticket in half and gives Danny the other half and as Danny is getting involved and enjoying the film, the ticket starts to magically work and next thing you know, Danny is inside the film for ""Jack Slater IV"" and in this world, things work like the movies and not real life.

As the film progresses and Danny sticks with Jack Slater and the two take on the bad guys which include the evil Englishman Benedict (played by Charles Dance).  But somehow along the way, Benedict steals Danny's ticket and has now cross over to the real world where Danny has come from.

In the real world, Benedict starts to learn that bad guys can win and starts killing people and noticing that the police are not there to stop him.  So, Benedict comes up with an idea to stop Jack Slater and that is by killing off the real actor that plays him...Arnold Schwarznegger.

Can Jack Slater and Danny stop Benedict in time?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Last Action Hero"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has given this film a pretty good treatment as they have with ""Cliffhanger"" and ""Air Force One"" in which they kept the film as close to what we see on the big screen, including the fine layer of grain.

For a film that is 17-years-old, the film looks good for its age and because there is so much happening throughout the film.  For example, in Danny's world, you can see how run down the theater is, old-style seats and everything is dark and there aren't any vibrant colors.  Until he goes into Jack Slater's world, then colors are vibrant and much better visuals.  Definitely a major improvement from the 2003 DVD of ""Last Action Hero"".

Now, where this film shines is with its lossless audio soundtrack.  Featured in English, French, Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1, one thing that ""Last Action Hero"" had when it was first released in theaters was the fact it was the first film to utilize Sony's Dynamic Digital Sound.  Granted, at that time, many theaters weren't equipped to play SDDS but there was concentration on the film's audio and that is where this Blu-ray shines.

The opening sequence alone shows you that the film is going to utilize all channels and thus bringing a more immersive soundscape as you hear gun shots, explosions, crashing metal, booms all through your front, surround and rear surround channels.  Subwoofer utilizes the booms and for the most part, this is the best I have ever heard from this film.  The lossless audio soundtrack for this 1993 film is very well-done!

Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Last Action Hero"" comes with no major special features but is BD-Live enabled with movieIQ which allows people to obtain real-time information of the cast, music, trivia while watching the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When ""Last Action Hero"" first came out and when I watched in the theaters, I figured a pairing with director John McTiernan and Arnold Schwarznegger (known for their action films) would be a wonderful pairing.  But I can remember how impatient I was getting because the film seemed so long (especially at 131 minutes).  I felt that the arc where Danny is in Jack Slater's world tend to drag quite a bit.

But I admit that I enjoyed how it was a satire of action films and also featured cameos by many celebrities.  By the third and final arc, things started to get more interesting as Jack Slater is pulled out of his magical world and now having to deal with this new world that he is quite unaware of.  For the most part, ""Last Action Hero"" was a good popcorn flick but I do remember that since it came right after ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", there was high expectations.

Needless to say, despite what the critics may have felt about the film, ""Last Action Hero"" did well in the worldwide box office and even some appreciating the film much more now than when it first came out in theaters back in 1993.

For those who purchased the 2003 DVD and are big fans of the film, you maybe wondering if the Blu-ray is worth buying.  The bad news is that there are no special features on this Blu-ray unless you have BD-Live and you can take advantage of the movieIQ function.  But other than that, I'm still amazed that for a film that was quite expensive, featured so many talent did not have any featurette created for it.  No commentary, no theatrical trailer, there is no special features and to me, that's surprising.  But the Blu-ray is a major step up in picture and audio quality and that is where fans of the film will appreciate its HD release on Blu-ray.

Overall, ""Last Action Hero"" on Blu-ray is literally a barebones Blu-ray release but for Schwarzenegger or McTiernan fans and those who truly enjoyed this film will definitely enjoy it much more with its video and audio upgrade.",3.0
"This is certainly not one of the good Schwarzenegger movies.  Arnold plays a parodie of himself in this movie.  His ""partner"" is a 12 year old boy, and together they decided to fight crime in their town.  Really, that's about it for the plot.  And the acting just isen't any better.  When I saw this back when it came out in the 90s I was really disappointed.  I mean this is the guy who did classics like Terminator I & II, Total Recall & The 6th Day, just to mention a few of his glorious movies.  This is comparatively a real let down, don't believe the hype of most of the other reviews.  If your expecting something even remotely close to the just mentioned movies, then forget it, you won't find it in this movie.",3.0

I am one of the people who grew up watching this movie. Overall this is actually a good action film. Anyone who doesn't like it, obviously didn't get that it was meant to be a satire of all the typical, cliches of action films.

John McTiernan, whether or not it was his approach, knew that the only way to truly satirize something, you must be as close to the subject matter as possible. Although he directed such great action films as Die Hard, Predator and The Hunt For Red October, he still manages to pull off his style and being true to the genre, while still managing to turn out a smart parody.

I am one for urging Sony Pictures to release an anniversary edition of this film, to be represented in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio and having a DTS mix in it as well. All fans of the film at least deserve that much. along with some interesting new special features with more then just a trailer.",3.0
"This movie has such a clever plot that never quite lives up to its potential, but does provide a few laughs and smiles along the way.

I saw this movie in the theater when I was the same age as the young protagonist and I thought it was awesome! My how things have changed since those carefree days when a million cameos and lots of explosions could make up for terrible writing and weak direction.

The Good: Tom Noonan as The Ripper is genuinely creepy and makes a great arch-foe for our Hero.  Jack Slater is a character with hilarious moments, especially when he calls himself, ""Arnold Groundschmuger, the famous comedian"". The spoof on the action genre is much funnier in retrospect than at the time of the film's release. Bridgette Wilson in cut-off jean shorts, 'nuff said.

The Bad: Danny Madigan goes from being cute to annoying so many times it makes you wish Benedict would just shoot him already.  Once the movie crosses over into the real world and Jack's ""crisis"" with being a fictional character the movie loses its focus and gets to wrapped up in whatever moral it failed to get across to the audience.

I would be willing to own this movie for the first hours worth of fun and comedy if not for the terrible pan & scan work that was done on the transfer (and I'm not shelling out $27.00 for the widescreen version).  Maybe someday when they release the LAH: Big Mistake Edition where we get an apologetic, film-roast of a commentary over a widescreen cut of the film, I'll fork over my dough, but until then: PASS!",3.0

"After MUCH deliberation, this was deemed an appropriate DVD to watch - after turning down all my other suggestions. And it turned out to be quite good!
This was filmed before Austin O'Brien became truly cringeworthy, with a god-awful haircut in My Girl 2. He's exactly the same here, and there were times I wanted to take a pair of scissors to his hair! (I've just seen a more recent photo, and he looks totally different!)
Last Action Hero has an almost Willy Wonka quality to it. There was a golden ticket that Charlie Bucket had to find and Danny Mannigan also had to find one - or actually got handed it. I was so waiting for Oompa Loompa's to come out! Now that would have been cool.
The whole story climaxes in Arnie being brought out of the movie, and getting to see the 'real' world, which is a very interesting concept, as it could be seen as we're not the ones in control. (I totally believe that) So his whole life was one big lie, and controlled by someone else - not the big man upstairs, but a film director. Arnie basically takes the p*ss out of his whole on screen persona in this, including lots of his trademark sayings, including: ""I'll be back!"", ""Trust me"" and ""Do it"". There's also a very funny scene where Jack Slater meets Arnold Schwarzeneggar - make sense of that!
Also look out for a whole host of cameos in this movie - ones which are easy, to spot, some which aren't! Some of these include: Chevy Chase, MC Hammer, Sharon Stone, Little Richard, Maria Shriver, Robert Patrick, and Jean-Claude Van Damme!
There are some great lines in this. Some of these are:
Danny Madigan: You think you are funny, don't you?
Jack Slater: I know I am. I'm the famous comedian Arnold Braunschweiger.
Danny Madigan: Schwarzenegger!
Jack Slater: Gesundheit.
Jack Slater: Kid! Who does the doctor treat?
Danny Madigan: Patients?
Jack Slater: Look at the elbow of my jacket. What is it doing?
Danny Madigan: Wearing thin?
Jack Slater: Bingo!
Benedict: Gentlemen. Since you are about to die anyway, I may as well tell you the entire plot. Think of villains Jack. You want Dracula? Dra-cool-la? Hang on
[takes out the ticket]
Benedict: , I'll fetch him. Dracula? Huh. I can get King Kong! We'll have a nightmare with Freddy Krueger, have a surprize party for Adolf Hitler, Hannibal Lecter can do the catering, and then we'll have christening for Rosemary's Baby! All I have to do is snap my fingers and they'll be here. They're lining up to get here, and do you know why Jack? Should I tell you why? Hmm? Because here, in this world, the bad guys can win!
So if you're not keen on Austin O'Brien, see how many celebrities you can spot, and how much Arnie acts up in this movie! It's so funny!",3.0
"A BOY [AUSTIN O BRIEN] IS GIVEN A MAGIC TICKET, AND WHILE HE'S WATCHING HIS MOVIE HERO'S LATEST FILM, HE ENDS UP BEING A PART OF THE ACTION.

When I found it on amazon, needless to say I was thrilled, until I watched  it. You cut out the major scenes from the movie like when Fozzie does his  stand up comedy act with the snowmen and when the Muppet babies video is  cut short. I don't mind little edits, but editing out these parts is  absolutely ridiculious! I would have given the movie five stars, but since  it has been butchered, it only receives three stars. People who have never  seen this movie would never notice the edits, but if you're like me and you  have watched this video about 5 million times, you will definetly notice  the edits. You shouldn't even be selling the movie like this! It ruins the  whole story! Therefore, I will continue to look for my old copy and watch  the one I recorded off Odyseey instead.",3.0

"While I had marvelous service from the seller, this did not turn out to be the version I was hoping for. There are known complaints about the heavily edited nature of A Muppet Family Christmas, so I should have done my research better before buying it, but it seems that the all-regions import version is not the same as the UK version which supposedly has the unedited, original show. I made the assumption they were the same and didn't think to contact the seller and ask, so this is purely my own fault.

While I am glad to have at least a partial (although confusingly edited) version, and I really did get quick and excellent service as well as a great buy from the seller, I am still in the market for the elusive, full-content version of A Muppet Family Christmas. This particular version (due to copyright law and everyone wanting a piece of the financial pie) was very heavily edited before being sold in the US and many of the best songs (and thereby best scenes) are missing. This leads to non-existent scene transitions, random jumps in the story line, and an overall confusing film. Rather than a classic Muppet film and a nostalgic hearkening back to younger days which you can't wait to share with your family, it ends up as messy Muppet mayhem which fails to live up to memory's expectations.",3.0

I know this is a rarity, I just don't know why. Having had this video since I was a lad, and keeping it to bust out every Christmas, has earned me a lot of fans in the little tikes circuit. Every kid ever has really loved this one!  The one hour(ish) special is hillarious, and features not only the Muppets, but also the entire cast of Sesame Street, and Fraggle Rock (if you weren't a kid in the eighties, you may not know those guys, but they are there!) Antics are served up all around. Like when the swedish chef tries to cook big bird for dinner, after the turkey gives him the slip and starts hitting on Gonzos girlfriend Carmella.
There is a scene where Kermit and his nephew attempt to sing a touching, heart warming rendition of Jingle Bells, but (always to my delight as a kid) get cut off by The Electric Mayhem who crank up the volume for a wild version of jingle Bell Rock.
Anyway, too bad this thing is virtually unaquirable (seriously, I think you could find the video somewhere... try the used section at Blockbuster!) The DVD deletes some key scenes... like the snowman (""let me in! It's FREEZING out there!"") or the continuosly running icy patch gag. (???) they're in the video, not the DVD.

"Hey everyone - thanks for saving me from buying this DVD of my favorite Xmas show (admittedly, I've never seen the Jim Henson special). Anyway, I have a pretty good copy on VHS tape that I transfered to computer file. There's a tiny bit of tracking problem. Anyway, I also downloaded the DVD files on sale here. Obviously, the DVD version is MUCH higher quality than an old VHS tape. So what I did, is I took the DVD version and spliced in the missing scenes from my VHS copy - literally to the 1/100th of a second split. Unnoticable cuts except in terms of audio/video quality, which doesn't dip TOO much I must say. The result is a complete quasi-original version of this movie, 90% of which is DVD quality.

My question is, the only three scenes I edited back in from the VHS version are the snowman duet, the extended Muppet Babies home movie, and the Miss Piggy ice slip. I know these are the major ones. Are there any other smaller edits I should know about that I should correct? (I considered adding back in the 80's Transformer commercials, too, but decided against it!) Happy to provide my work to others. Not sure how though, it's a HUGE file.

I am highly disappointed not only was I not aware that this DVD had scenes cut from it so when watching was in total shock to find them missing but to see others have found out as well the hard way. The wonderful scene with Fozzy bear and the snowman cut is horrible that was one of my favorite scenes and to have the scene with the home movies so horribly cut it's obvious as well well I think the company should have at least told us on the packaging that scenes were deleted due to copyright problems so that customers were aware of this now I own a DVD I most likely will NEVER EVER watch again. Thanks a lot to whomever decided to produce this horrible DVD!!! Make it all intact or not at all. Makes me wonder if I can find the same things with the other Muppets DVDs as well. If you want the entire movie as is intact DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. A wonderful movie ruined i'm crushed.,3.0
"I remember watching this special when it first aired on television back in 1987. What I remember most about it was that it brought together all of Jim Henson's Muppets (at the time); not only were Kermit and Company there, but the whole Sesame Street gang, and the Fraggles from Fraggle Rock. Fortunately, that togetherness remains intact. Unfortunately, about ten minutes worth of footage has been edited out and therefore makes this DVD inferior and uncomplete.
Besides the Muppet family all getting together, I fondly remember a comedy act Fozzy practices with a snowman and about a minute's worth of a Muppet Baby family video. Both of these have been edited out of this DVD. Also missing is a scene when Miss Piggy slips on some ice.
Nevertheless, the film is still enjoyable to watch. After all it is the Muppets and even when they are cheated from their just screen time, they make 40 minutes worth of viewing much more enjoyable than most of what can be found on television today.

"I am with the rest of the crowd on the editing. It seems to be that most of the editing was the removal of songs (I guess some publishing companies refused to let them use their songs anymore).

My hope is that some legal jerks got in the way and that it's not just Jim Henson Productions. I would HATE to see Jim's company do this to such classics all on their own.
The show itself is delightful (edits or not). The plot is funny, the way all the Muppets come together is ingenius, and I will NEVER forget the Swedish Chef attempting to cook Big Bird (that alone is enough to make me forget that the DVD was edited!).

I have no idea if it is the original or not, but I am hoping it will be. Check your local listings to be sure; I could not verify the time so don't hold me responsible if it's not correct! I hope this helps anyone looking to see the correct version like I am. Best of luck and here's hoping it's the right one!",3.0

They think theyve won a FREE trip to a crappy resort in the Bahamas.  A resort almost barren of guests and staff.  Nothing suspicious there!  And its not the least bit worrisome when bloody bodies go missing, someone having cleaned up the crime scenes in an instant: spotless!  Blood is not that easy to clean up!  The rest of the movie requires a lot of running, screaming, hiding, dying..............

Logic aside, this is standard fare, entertaining enough in its own right, but nothing special.  The extra, tacked on ending, is a bit of a cheat and doesnt really work.",3.0
"One of the staples of the slasher genre has been the quick turnaround for a sequel.  While the 90s resurgence in the genre tried to change many things about the genre, the quick sequel was not one of them.  Thats why, a year after the first came out, we got I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.  It needed more time to iron out some serious plot issues (and considering this is a slasher, thats saying something).

As the movie opens, its been a year since fisherman Ben Willis (Muse Watson) stalked Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and Ray (Freddie Prinz, Jr.)  and their friends and two years since the four friends hit Ben with their car and left him for dead.  Julie is still struggling through all that has happened, which is why she finds herself struggling with grades while in summer school again and having recurring nightmares.

Things are looking up when her friend and roommate Karla (Brandy) wins a trip for four to the Bahamas over the 4th of July.  When an invited Ray doesnt show, Julies friend Will (Matthew settle) joins Carla, Carlas boyfriend Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer), and Julie for this trip.  They arrive on the island just before the first storm of the season hits, leaving them stranded as the only guests on the island.  But a message for Julie leaves her convinced that they and the skeleton staff are in danger.  Is she right?  And what happened to Ray?

The film actually gets high marks right away for addressing the tag from the previous film and trying to give us some character development for Julie and Ray.  Unfortunately, in an effort to increase the tension, we get several painfully obvious false scares before we get to the island and the movie really begins.

Now heres the part where Im going to be painfully stupid.  One of my problems with this film is all the people who are killed when Julie and Ray are the real targets.  I get that this is a slasher film.  I truly do.  That means lots of people have to die.  But I don't get why we are going after the people who do die.  In the first film, the collateral damage victims make a little bit of sense, but not quite as much here.  And this doesnt bother me in the Scream films like it does here, either.  Go figure.

So leaving my personal issues aside, we do get some decent stalk and kill sequences and a mix of sympathetic and annoying characters to be eliminated.  This part is all well done, and when the storm hits and the killing starts, its easy to feel the tension building.

Which brings me to the part that feels rushed.  In an effort to provide a twist to the story (required of all slashers, especially during the 90s), we learn a bit more about Ben, but none of that makes sense.  Even watching the movie knowing what will unfold, it feels like it is forced into the film.

And, despite efforts to set things up earlier, the climax still feels a bit du ex machina for my tastes.  Then theres one characters fate, which makes no sense.  Plus don't get me started on the final scene.  What worked in the first film definitely doesnt work here.

The acting is still decent, and I don't find anything to pull me out of the film.  Thats impressive considering the script the cast had to work with.

And Id be remiss if I didn't point out that the accident that started the whole rampage was actually two summers ago now, so the title really doesnt work either.

The thing with 90s slasher movies is they tried to be more intelligent than the ones that had come during the slasher mania of the 80s.  Sadly, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer fails in those efforts.  There are still some decent death and chase sequences, so die hards of the genre will want to check it out.  But be sure to turn off your brain before you start watching it.",3.0
"I am an eighties baby so being how I was born in the golden age of horror films it should be no surprise that I'm a huge fan of the genre, in fact it's my favorite genre by far. I think it is human nature to be nostalgic about certain things. It's why the WWII generation hated rock & roll, and why baby boomers hate hip hop, because it's not from THEIR
time so somehow it's inferior. Because of this when the 90's came along and all of the great horror series of the bygone decade were running out of steam (Halloween, Friday the 13th, A nightmare on elm street) horror movies were still around just not being pumped out week after week at the cinemas. That's until scream arrived in '96 giving the horror genre much needed jolt in the arm.

Seemingly overnight they were back again, one new film after the other and we as horror fans couldn't have been happier!

Okay, okay, okay, I know what your thinking, this is suppose to be a customer review of I still know...and this guy is giving us a history lesson on the genre as a whole, but there's a method to my madness, you see I remember being excited when I saw the first I know what you did...I remember enjoying it, and of coarse when I heard of a sequel I was more than sold on going to see it, which I did, and enjoyed it! Enjoyed it when it came out on video, hec, I even bought the DVD which I still have to this day, but all of those years I watched the actually thinking it was a quality film, it ISN'T! What changed my mind you ask well a little thing called growing up, and when you grow up hindsight is 20\20.

You see I know now why I really thought this film was good when I was a kid, HORROR was back back in a big way so I would, and did go to see any and everything back then and usually enjoyed the movies, but know as an adult I realize this movie is goofy at best.

I think I first realized it one night a few years ago when I caught it on tv. Nothing else was one so I decided to watch
it. It was like I was seeing it for the first time with new adult eyes and I realized how ridiculous it was.

I could go into the plot in more detail but if you guys are reading this you probably already know the deal. Let's just say JLH survived ""slicker guy"" in the first film and now his back to finish the job, but this time there on an island with a scary old guy, someone who I think may be Jack Black in a bad wig, and POP STAR BRANDY! It's ridiculous from start to finish, from how they are lured to the island, why they are lured to the island and the goofy kills that happen throughout.

There are things that happen that are so ridiculous(Freddie Prinze Jr's character hijacking a boat at gunpoint and sailing through a storm, at NIGHT no less to save his ladylove but I mean it's JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT after all, you wouldn't do the same?

Despite realizing now as an adult that this movie was simply just a way to cash-in further on the who's the killer genre before the public lost interest it still is entertaining and fun to watch!

If you've been living under a rock and somehow have never seen the I know what you did...films watch the first one first (a much better, well made film) than watch this one next, but when watching the sequel forget about LOGIC, and good storytelling, just seat back and enjoy a bunch of pretty actors running around an island being chased by a guy in a raincoat!

Is this movie good? - Not in the slightest bit!
Is this movie entertaining? - HELL YES!!!!!!

P. S. Don't forget to checkout a certain character's death by hook that is quite possibly the WORST CGI ever in the history of CGI, it's hilarious!!!!!!",3.0
"I have seen this movie when I rented it years ago.  It was ok, but It just wasn't that great to me.  What would of made this a better movie, is to have kept all four of the main characters alive from the first film and probably have kept the scenario in Southport, then maybe kill off two of them in this second installment.  One thing I didn't like was out of nowhere, added the two new characters to the movie.  Notice on the third installment of this franchise, 'I Always Know What You Did Last Summer', they added a whole new group of people.  This to me just killed off the movie all together and the interest to.  I might buy this DVD later on.  Still deciding.  I will always treasure the first movie in this series.",3.0

"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer takes place one year after the events of I Know What You Did Last Summer. Julie is now in college, taking Summer classes in Boston; trying to avoid Southport to put the past behind her. The past still haunts her on a regular basis however as she constantly has visions and dreams of the murderous, vengeful fisherman, Ben Willis coming after her.

That afternoon, Julie and her best friend, Karla win tickets for 4 for a getaway to the Bahamas for 4th of July weekend via radio station call-in after answering the question of the capital of Brazil correctly.....or incorrectly. While Karla brings her boyfriend, Tyrell along on the trip; Julie plans on asking Ray, her boyfriend from the previous film to come along, but he initially declines out of frustration of her refusing to visit him in Southport. With Ray's ticket now on the table, Karla brings along her best friend, Will, who has a crush on Julie---and off they go!

Once the 4 arrive in the Bahamas, they discover that others have left due to a tropical storm on the way. With it just being the 4 of them plus hotel staff, things seem to go great so far...until Julie begins receiving mysterious notes, reminding her of ""what she did"" and until the staff and crew begin getting gruesomely killed off one by one by a familiar hooded figure with a hook for a hand. What Julie hoped to be a peaceful and relaxing Summer has now turned into another hellacious nightmare. Some things you just can't bury.

Overall: This was an okay sequel. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer moves away from the suspenseful thriller kind of movie that viewers witnessed in its predecessor and transitions to more of a slasher horror. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. reprise their roles from the first film as the couple of Julie and Ray. Logic doesn't seem to play much of a factor in this movie which definitely deducts stars from this rating. For example the entire radio call-in scene is questionable in terms of answering the question correctly. Also, Julie is constantly receiving reminders saying ""I know what you did last Summer""; but in this case, shouldn't have been 2 Summers ago, considering that's when it all started? Or is the killer now mad about supposedly getting killed off last Summer? I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is one of those movies that have you asking too many questions throughout the duration of the film. The acting is subpar on certain levels as well. This would mark the last of the I Know What You Did films to feature any of the original cast and crew as a third sequel released in 2006 titled ""I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer (avoid at all costs) featured a fresh new cast. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer gets a B+ in terms of gore and kills but the movie overall deserves a C - or maybe even a D",3.0
"This is one of those movies that got a second shot probably because Scream did.  The only difference was that Scream was actually creative and made fun of silly movies like this one.  Throw in every horror/slasher movie cliche this one had it.  I am all for having to suspend disbelief when watching one of these movies, but things like the killer being able to movie bodies around in a short period of time, and leave no trace of blood is just stupid.  Unlike the plot twist revealing the killer in the first movie, this one was easy to spot a mile away.  Plus we are subjected to Jack Black as a dreadlocked stoner.

The two things that this one had going for it is that the dialog was not as schlocky and stupid as it was in the first one.  And, despite the tease at the end of the movie, they thought better of making any more of these.  Like the predecessor I do not think this is a must see or must own.  If you are looking for a horror movie to watch for an hour and a half, it is not the best and not the worst.  Not something that you would really watch more than once though.",3.0
"okay what i mean is
*SPOILER ALERT*

It was a decent slasher film.  It has some thrills and chills, running, suspense and all that good stuff.  The acting wasn't bad though mehki pheiffer got on my nerves but that wasn't him it was his character was obnoxious.  i was actually waiting on him to die so he would shut up.  Jack Black was a nice suprise.
heres what i hated about it.  It was predictable and over done but the worst, the absolute worst part is that ben willis suddenly became immortal.  The different thing about ben willis is that he was a real guy who could be killed they just didn't pull it off.  They killed him though.  Bullet ridden and you know what at the end i knew they were gonna do it.  i knew they were gonna bring him back and they did.  Let the killer die and get a new idea writers.  Be creative, come up with something new because by the end of the second sequel if you don't let it go, it just gets pethetic.",3.0
"I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is a huge let down. Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) & her new best buddie Karla (Brandy) win a holiday to the Bahamas. Once there they are stranded after a hurricane warning. The fisherman shows up & starts slicing & dicing.

The sequel is nowhere near the same level as the original. Also the style is different. I KNOW was a clever build-up of tension. I STILL KNOW is all about needless gore, bikinis, tight clothes & cheap scare tactics.

I'll be fair and say that I wasn't bored by I STILL KNOW, the jumps did get me & when the action started I was drawn in to the drama. The film was OK, but it's a let down after seeing what was done first.

The thriller versus the slasher. There is a huge difference. Judge for yourself.",3.0

bad points:
-the first thing you will notice in this movie is the overly dramatic music, which i think is a little over done, compared to the first
-the fact that evry time someone opens a door ( for no apparent reasen)
a dead body falls out. by the 3rd time im like ""dont bother, theres a dead body in there"". this gets really old by the end",3.0
"I quite liked the original to this sequel, being of course the cumbersomely named I Know What You Did Last Summer, and so was hesitantly looking forward to seeing this movie for the first time. Being basically a reply to Scream, this series (which I am sure will continue) is your standard pretty looking teens get terrorized by superhuman unstoppable madman intent on killing them in as gruesome a manner as possible. Any surprises here? Unfortunately not - the formula has been squeezed just a little too much for any real shocks, but it does maintain a steady pace and is a pretty watchable and thankfully short movie.

Starring the cleavage-based talents of Jennifer Love Hewitt, this movie is essentially a vehicle allowing said actress as well as Brandy to wear the skimpiest clothes possible. From this angle, the movie does not disappoint. The producer Neal H. Moritz claims he wanted this movie to be scarier than the original; in my mind he failed by a long shot. However, the production is slick and tight, the sound is glorious and the image is close to perfection, and I am sure many will enjoy it; men maybe more than women though - sexist remark as it may be, but Jennifer Love Hewitt didn't land this role for nothin'!",3.0
"That's what this movie is all really about, right? The girl is hooked on her little tight vest top. Which she bought two sizes too small in the first place. And she parades it and everything contained in that top about all over the film. All the guys are drooling in the audience. And all the girls, who are mere mortals, and do not have hair & makeup artists, great clothes off a rail which you don't have to pay for, and who are not blessed with such generous ... good looks :) are going green with envy!

OK, so that's my rant over. Considering this is a horror movie, and it's a sequel to a horror movie, you'd think there would be a third too right? Wrong! For some reason, the makers didn't follow the Scream route, and make a trilogy (or the following Scary Movie), but decided to go down the Urban Legend route, and only release two films. When we all know these horror movies are supposed to be trilogies! All great films are trilogies, come on! OK, maybe I'm going OTT. Actually, I should be reviewing the first one, but the disc of that, has sprouted legs, and gone walkabout. No doubt following Broken Arrow, and my necklace - hopefully not! Up to the DVD stealing/gone missing place in the sky! I still have the case, just not the disc. And I can't rewatch/review the film without the disc!

The great thing about this movie? To have all the characters filming in the pouring rain most of the time! (OK, except for Jennifer Love Hewitt, for the guys, you'll be concentrating mainly on the contents of her top to notice the rain) For some weird reason, I find water a cool effect in movies, whether it's pure rain, or the water itself. I'm weird. Love me!

Some people say there's too little of Freddie Prinz Jnr in this, and instead he gets replaced the hot'n'horny Mekhi Pfifer. Frankly, I couldn't care about either of them, nor do I care much for Brandy. She can't sing, and whoever thought she could act, should have been locked up in a looney (tunes) bin.

I like the movie, I just don't like the actors in it all that much. They're watchable that's about it. They're nothing special. For any guys reading this, this movie needs to be in your DVD collection. You'll get your kicks out of the contents of Jennifer Love Hewitt's top. Us ordinary females, will have to make do with plenty of concealer, and padded beyond belief bras.

"I have always wondered why slasher films even bother making sequels...untill now. Yes, thanks to I Still Know, I REALLY wonder.
Ok, so it wasn't horrible. Julie (Hewitt) and Ray (Prinz) Return (but mostly Julie), along with the new faces of Carla (singer Brandy) and Tyrell (Mekhi Phiefer).
Not long after Carla wins a trip to the Bahamas from a local radio station, bringing along Julie and Tyrell, Ray comes face to face with Ben Willis, who he thought was killed the year before. Carla and the gang head off, as planned, when disaster hits: A big rainstorm. Bummer. Not able to get off the island, due to the mysterious dissappearence of the boats and dockman, dead bodies start piling up all over the place, from a slit throated maid to an open chested druggie. Ew.
They soon realize (or at least Julie) that Ben is back in black, and armed with his famous giant fishing hook. after nearly everyone on the island has been sliced and diced, the film finally starts getting good with pleanty of suspenseful chase scenes to keep you watching.
Pleanty of twists also keep coming, making to wonder just who is your friend and who is your enemy. Ooh, how exciting. Now, I won't say what happens, but I think the end of this film is perhaps the worst and most uncreative film ending in general that I have ever seen.
Oh well, it's worth renting, in my opinion, nothing more. At least the first one was a blast!",3.0

A storm comes and they cant get off the island, but not before the killer gets on the island.  Thats when the slashing begins.  Some deaths in this movie are gory and others arent.  I would say see the scream series before this movie.  Unless you wanna check out Jennifer ;)",3.0
"This movie was not as good as the first one, but it is still worth watching. Instead of Gellar and Phillippe, Mekki Phifer and Brandy are added to the cast. I only gave this movie 3 stars because it sort of did too much on the killing and made it look unreal and unbelievable, it also left out too much of Freddie's Character only having him appear in certain points and at the end. It also didn't make sense how in the ending the gun all or a sudden was stocked with bullets. Despite all that it provides a good plot and characters that work well together, following Julie, Carla, Tyrell, and Will on a radio won trip to the Bahamas where their in for a wild ride, of course too make the story sensible that is the real home of the last movies killer ben willis, out to get them. This movie also has a bunch of twists and you won't know whos an enemy and who will help when it comes down to the end.

Later, when Julie and her best friend Karla (Brandy) win tickets to go to Hawaii, Julie thinks that she will have a relaxing vacation.....boy, is she in for a suprise. I don't want to give anything else away, so just go out and rent this movie if you are a fan of teen slashers.",3.0
"(NOTE: Partial spoilers of earlier movie)
I'll rank this a three on a 1-5 scale I've devised particularly for use in rating sequels for which I liked the original. The scale would work as follows: 1: So bad I'd now just as soon have not liked the original. 2: My liking for original is intact, but sequel adds virtually nothing to my enjoyment. 3: Sequel enjoyable mainly on the strength of how original made me care for the characters and their continuing story, not a great movie in its own right. 4: Sequel satisfying, coming close to or rivaling the original in quality. 5: Exceptional sequel, surpassing the original in quality. So, in the case of this movie, the sequel leaves considerable room for disappointment but maintained my interest because the first made the characters interesting. Even at that, Jennifer Love Hewitt came much closer to having to carry the movie this time, because Freddy Prinze, Jr. was reduced to cameo-level appearance this time, and most of the rest of major players in the original played characters that didn't survive that movie. Particularly missed in the sequel for the latter reason were Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and especially the undercast Brigette Wilson. Other things that detracted from this sequel are that the screenplay, editing, and/or direction seemed amateurish at times. The main Character Julie (played by Hewitt) sings ""I Will Survive"" as a karaoke song, a scene better omitted. I can't speak for viewers unfamiliar with karaoke, though I suspect they might have limited appreciation for its inclusion in movies. But those of us who are karaoke singers and/or listeners know that ""I Will Survive"" is one of the most run-into-the-ground of karaoke songs and we're sick of it. Also her scene where she gets into the sunlamp box is also awkward and probable not too pleasing to anyone. Those not liking scantily-clad scenes will find it ""exploitative"", but those who do will find it tame and unrevealing. Other awkward moments would become ponderous to enumerate. Julie's new boyfriend in the movie, who accompanies her to the Bahamas (the reason for Prinze's sparse appearence in this) is played in an awkward way, and his character's transitions along plot twists are lame and not highly believable. As for the scenes set in the Bahamas, they were actually filmed in Mexico and it shows. They show good-sized mountains, non-existent in the Bahamas. But in that department, this sequel in no way outdoes the original in impertinance, for the original had some mountain scenes too, even though ostensibly set in and around Southport, NC, an area where all land within view is at least as flat as the Bahamas. The most memorable new character in this sequel, though even he has been called ineffective and/or miscast, is a resident pothead in the Bahamas, played by Jack Black. His character has some mildly funny moments, though they missed a chance to give him what could have been the movie's funniest line. In the movie, most every character at one time or another falls under suspicion of being the killer on the lose; when it came the pothead's turn to be suspected, he should have said, ""Don't look at me - I don't even know what I did last summer!"" The end of the movie seems a possible set up for still another sequel. If one is made, I hope it can come closer to recapturing the quality of the original rather than languishing at the level of this first sequel.",3.0
"The sequal to I know What You Did Last Summer is unfortunatly not nearly as great as the first one. In this movie Julie(Jennifer Love Hewitt)is in college and is just not doing to well.

The movie starts out very promising,but drags out in to another slasher sequal. The twist in the end was very well done. There were a few suspencful scenes. But the movie also had some holes,draggy pointes,and a horrid and very predictable ending. The acting wasn't nearly as good as the it was in the first.

In I Still Know, we knew the story and who the killer was and why he wanted to kill. We were just shown some new chase scenes and a bit more gore.  Not that the movie is bad, it's just that they could have come up with something a little better. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. reprise their roles as the survivors from I Know, Julie and Ray. New faces are Brandy, Mekhi Pfeiffer, Matthew Settle, and Jennifer Esposito. All give a little less than solid, but not bad,  performances.  The ending does give a nice twist, and doesn't fall flat on that.

And also,  they ran over the fisherman, dumped him in the water and yet he's still  alive.  I mean that COULD happen but it most likely wouldn't.

Fortunately, seasons 2-5 were better, and I was getting chuckles and sometimes laughing out loud at the episodes.  The introduction of the character known as ""The Peeper"" was, for me, a misstep, because he was too over-the-top silly to be amusing.

"Bob Newhart's trademark dry humor shines throughout the show's sixth and final season (although Newhart's frequent absence by mid-season, due to other filming obligations, doesn't go unnoticed).

Aside from Bob and Emily's move to a new apartment (because apparently the old one wasn't ""spacious"" enough!) and then magically having Howard move into a neighboring apartment (which is never actually explained - Howard just resumes his regular routine of barging in every day) the season continues much as before. Bob meets regularly with his clients, particularly the infamous Mr. Carlin; he and Emily socialize with Howard, Carol, Jerry and others. Although plot-wise there is little that is truly unique or surprising, the show still works. The actors' chemistry, Bob's traditional straight-man shtick against the blundering Howard or goofy Jerry, the ridiculous statements of Mr. Carlin (all delivered in deadpan) continue to amuse and entertain.",4.0

"While not entirely true to the classic TV series, this movie is very true to the theme of an ultra-British spy spoof.  The villain's house is VERY well-appointed, and the heroes have an interesting way of crossing the Thames to go after him.  It's just too bad that the film makes for a tricky search, with all the Marvel superhero films showing up.  It's worth finding!",4.0

"An awesome action adventure. Creative and involving. Sean Connery delivers a great performance as Sir August DeWynter, an maniacal genius and former British Intelligence agent (?) with an axe to grind with the Royal Empire. He has stolen control of a satellite that allows him to control the weather everywhere on the planet. He is holding the world hostage and has a hefty ransom. So British super agent John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) is called into action to stop him, and he is first advised to bring in Dr. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), a noble prize winning physicist and the number one suspected ally of DeWynter after video footage of her surfaces implicating her in the murder of a high ranking member of the British business community. After he brings her in to meet Mother and Father, they determine she is innocent. But if so, then who is the woman on the video? They decide to team up to get some answers, and start at the home of Sir August DeWynter, where they quickly discover who their enemy is. But he is ready for their every move, and has them both at his mercy in a hurry. But they also soon discover he has a friend on the inside who gave him vital information to help him steal the weather satellite. A mole in British Intelligence. But who? This a exciting and involving action film that has every bit of the charm and charisma of the popular 60's TV series, and all the gadgets as well. It gets a 90's update, of course, but still keeps true to the show at the same time. Thurman and Fiennes have great onscreen chemistry, and as I mentioned, Connery was awesome. The idea of him being a former British agent was a bit cheesy, but still worked well. Brief nudity and mild language are all parents will have to worry about. There's a ton of action and snappy banter, as well as tea. Their was no sequel, which I felt was unfortunate. It didn't exactly kill at the box office, which might be its only downfall. I found it enjoyable and fun.",4.0

I don't usually watch videos a 2nd time but this could be one that I do.  Just to enjoy the clever playing against each other.",4.0
"Good quality recording, audio a little fuzzy (5th season).  The very loud first screen on each disc (shows a countdown) could be done without.",4.0
"I wish there were half stars available because this set is not quite good enough for 4 stars but too good for 3.
As others have said, this last season isn't as funny as previous seasons and Bob Newhart is away for many of the episodes. With that said, a mediocre episode of The Bob Newhart show is still better than most of what's on TV these days. I would give the content of this season 4 stars but, as much as I hate to say it, the quality of many of the transfers on many of these episodes only deserves a 3 and some less than that. I can handle grainy but a couple of episodes are so washed out that everything in the scene looks sepia toned and the colors are barely there.
So, I agree that this season is a must for those of us who have been waiting to complete our individual sets and appreciate Bob Newhart in any form, but the quality isn't quite up to previous seasons.",4.0
"Everyone's glad the final season of this venerable classic finally came out on home video as a stand-alone release, so hurrah for  the completists!  That said, despite some fine moments, the show begins to look tired in this season. Right away, the Hartleys move -- but only to an apartment on a different floor! So nothing really is changed except the decor and some of the off-screen layout. Howard is still THERE all the time, which becomes more and more ridiculous (even the new title sequence seems to poke fun at this) and I swear he  was made dumber and dumber as the series went on, resulting by season six  in a Howard Borden man-child personna  who is no longer a believable adult character (this man is a navigator for an airline?!?).  The plotlines and stories seem a bit shop-worn and many episodes near the end of the run  just trail off without any big topper or clear resolution.  Finally, and most unforgivable, Bob seems to be literally phoning in his appearances to the point of hardly even showing up in many episodes. Was it a sarcastic message to viewers,  how often the token Bob Newhart scene in a host of episodes is him on the phone in an airport or hotel, checking in with Emily?  Three minutes of Bob doesn't even allow for a decent ""Hi, Bob"" drinking game!

Even the finale is very abrupt and undeveloped, and then, that's all folks.  Kind of a wheeze-out for a show that in its prime was the sharpest written sit-com on television and still one of the best of all time.  Season Six is not the place to begin for newbies, but once you've watched this far, you might as well collect 'em all.",4.0

"I watched all The Avengers way back when, and own all of them now. As John Steed and Emma Peel, Patrick McNee and Diana Rigg are and probably always be irreplaceable and unsurpassable.

Should you watch/get this movie? Depends. Can you accept that Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman, as Steed and Peel, are not McNee and Riggs, and are not trying to imitate the TV actors? That, as with King Lear, different actors can bring different qualities, different interpretations, to a role? If you can, yes, get this movie. Fiennes is diffident, where McNee was suave. Thurman is titillating, where Rigg was provocative. Some of the movie is silly; so was some of the TV show. (And remember, The Avengers was picked up by US TV not because it was good, but because it was the 60s, it had spies - and it was cheaper than making a show in the States.)

This will never be the definitive The Avengers. But if you have an open mind, give it a look. Better (IMHO) than another couple of hours with another 'reality' show. Then, if you haven't, watch McNee and Rigg too. And if you have, watch them again, after some well-spent time with Fiennes and Thurman.",4.0
"I don't know what all the fuss is about.  This is a fun and stylish homage to the great TV series of the 60's.

I can't imagine any harder task than to try to compete with Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg, and face the inevitable comparisons.  No mean task, to be sure, and a brave one.  But Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are wonderful.  Of course, there are many parallels in their characterizations, but they still manage to create their own style and chemistry.  With the back-up of great supporting actors and a witty, caustic script, they make the characters and story their own.

Jim Broadbent is brilliant as Mother.  The sets are superb.  The CGI is well done, and not phony-looking.  Sean Connery is devilish.  The story is clever.

Hell no, especially since there seems to be a lot missing (judge for yourself by watching the theatrical trailer). But it's so much fun. Let me say right now that I have never seen the old television series, so I went into this movie a novice. And I was entertained. It's campy, over the top and a little silly. But it's okay.

But the irony is Season Five was the best...by far...no question. They jumped the shark by season 6, even though there were some good episodes. Haven't seen what's on the bonus DVD...that could make the $100 I spent for this worth it, not to mention the $200 I spent on the other four. Pretty low budget graphics for the box. Yeah, my 2nd favorite American sitcom. But at LEAST it's out. Even if they say the DVD is dead, well I'm not far behind so who cares? Gotta have season 5. Been watching it, up to 6 episodes so far. When this show was good, nothing was better. I know in six months I can get a VG copy for $40, but hey...been waiting a LONG time for this and I don't regret the money I spent.

"The problem is that I have been waiting for ever to get the last two season of the Bob Newhart Show. I already had seasons 1 through 4, but to get the last two seasons you have to buy the entire package. That is really a smarmy way of making the customer pay more money.",4.0
"This is a very watchable action flick, with Uma Thurman doing what she does best - wearing something tight and kicking the bad guys around. Sean Connery goes over the top as the mad Scottish scientist holding the world ransom. Mostly, though, it's comedy of manners. Steed and Dr. Peel (that's Thurman, but her friends can call her Mrs. Peel) maintain a relaxed tea-time manner no matter what the chaos around them or between them.

I can't compare this to the original series, which aired more than 35 year ago. I suspect that fans will find this wanting. So be it. If you can take this for itself, you'll find a decent piece of humorous action entertainment.

"This movie was actually my first exposure to the Avengers, and although it has received mixed reviews, I am perhaps one of the few that enjoy this film.
I do not try to compare the movie with the television series, which is why I think so many people dislike the film.
If anything this is something that is unique and stands on its own much in the same way 'The New Avengers' cannot be compared with the original series.
I will admit that I think the film could've been a little better in parts, I have a feeling that there are many deleted scenes from this film, and this is something that is simply begging for a Director's Cut Special Edition.
Anyway, I think Ralph Fiennes does an exceptional job in the role of John Steed in that he combines the darker parts of who Steed was when the show started with Ian Hendry, with the charm, wit and sophistication on display during the Diana Rigg era.  Plus, he looks absolutely smashing with that suit and bowler hat.
Uma Thurman is no Diana Rigg, but does make the role of Emma Peel her own in this film with beauty and grace.  And I thought the chemistry between her and Fiennes was excellent.
I think Sean Connery relished playing an over-the-top diabolical mastermind in this film, and you can see that he was just having a ball.
The special effects are awesome, and I think this film could very well be a cult classic, just as long as it isn't compared with the orignal series.  The film obviously won't be for everyone, whether or not you're a fan of the show really doesn't factor into whether you'll like it or not.
I just like it for what it is, entertainment.",4.0
"Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and Sean Connery star in this film based on the 1960s television series.  Sean Connery stars as Sir August de Wynter, an evil scientist who plans to threaten the world with his hi-tech weather machine which produces such phenomena as tornadoes, hail storms, extreme temperatures, and mechanical insects for good measure.  He makes his intentions known to world leaders and tells them that they must ""purchase"" their weather from him at a very hefty price.
Enter our two heroes, John Steed, played by Ralph Fiennes, and Mrs. Peel, played by Uma Thurman.  Steed is a Bond-like special agent working for a British counter-intelligence agency.  He and his partner Mrs. Peel have been assigned to destroy De Wynter.  Uma Thurman is excellent in her role.  From her high speed driving skills to her cat-like climbing reflexes, she's the perfect counterpart to Steed's intellect and no-nonsense approach.
The special effects were the high point of the film, especially the spectacular weather effects.  The tornadoes and hail storms looked very realistic, and the final battle between Steed and De Wynter is astounding.  I enjoyed this movie for several reasons.  The special effects were the main one, but the rapport between Steed and Mrs. Peel was excellent.  The two clicked throughout the film, and Steed's continuous snide but light-hearted comments made the move that much more enjoyable.  Watch this fun film and experience some cool effects while getting a laugh along the way.",4.0
"Chemistry is Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman (who was pregnant during the making of this). It's quite deliberate on the part of the director, but it's still enough to light up the screen.

Home Ec... or maybe Home Dec. This movie is all about style. This makes the suspension of disbelief necessary to get through this movie go down with a honey coating.

"I have seen this movie more than once and I am trying to understand the hostility it has generated. I am old enough to have seen the original TV series the first time around and while I remember it fondly, it was definitely a product of its time. What makes this film so enjoyable for me is that it is not merely trying to copy the old series but to reinvent it. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are John Steed and Emma Peel this time around. No they aren't Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg nor should they try to be. They have created their own version of the characters and they work quite well together. Their overwritten dialogue is overplayed with just the proper restraint. Sean Connery as Sir August, the principal villian, seems to be underplaying his role until you notice his eyes. Watch the eyes of all the characters. They are an important motif throughout the movie. Jim Broadbent's liquid eyes as ""Mother"" are full of knowledge and sympathy while Fiona Shaw's traitorous ""Father"" is literally blind to everything. Patrick Macnee (the original John Steed) has an important cameo as an invisible man. He holds the key to the mystery but he cannot be seen.

Director Jeremiah Chechik (BENNY AND JOON) has created a modern day fairy tale out of the old series while retaining the droll humor and the surreal touches (the brightly colored teddy bears are a good example). Much of the look of the film resembles the illustrations of modern day children's books especially THE POLAR EXPRESS. My only real complaint with the film is Eddie Izzard's use of the f-word. It is totally out of character with the rest of the film and was added solely to get a PG-13 rating. I was hoping the DVD would include the missing footage cut from the film before its release but no cigar. Sources close to the film say that it would clarify a number of points including the two Mrs Peels. Perhaps we will see it in a future reissue. So for the meantime put away your preconceived baggage and try and take the film on its own terms and you may be pleasantly surprised as I was. After all seeing is believing. Tea anyone?",4.0
"Unfortunately, the wonderful episode ""Escape Through Time"" is paired with the clunker ""The See-Through Man,"" but, well, you can't have everything.  They're nicely paired in one regard, which is that they're both faux sci-fi pieces about bad guys playing on the credibility of others with elaborate frauds.  ""See-Through Man"" is too see-through plot to maintain the suspension of disbelief, where ""Escape Through Time"" is far more cleverly done.  ""See-Through"" is largely an intentional comedy, which makes matters worse, since it's painfully unfunny  -  it's idea of humor is a comic-opera Russian idiot, who, ironically enough, is the same Russian idiot used in one of the previous season's equally spectacularly unfunny scripts.  What it does have is Diana Rigg charming her way nicely through the mess that is ""See-Through Man's"" script.
""Escape Through Time"" is by far the better piece, with Steed and Mrs. Peel trying to find out why several of England's most notorious criminals are being found dead of wounds inflicted by archaic weapons.  Seems someone is selling them the perfect escape  -  an escape into the past.  True time travel?  Or an elaborate get-rich-quick scam?

"Okay, this is not the best movie in the world. The same can be said for the TV show because it is a cult classic. Now I do admit that I am to young to understand the better parts of the show, I'm 24. Yet in terms to the movie it was not to bad. The acting could have been better, yet the costums were cool and had that over the top feel that the orginal show had.
Although the toung and cheek humor was a bit lame in the movie and could have been developed a bit more. Uma Thurman did do an okay job playing Mrs. Peel, yet more could have been said about her and personality because she does differ from the TV show. It would have been better of the movie to keep her with the same persona as the orginal Mrs. Peel then add to it to make it more 90's. The same for Ralph Fiennes. He does seem to lose his temper more in the move in contrast to the show. There are plot holes but what movie doesn't have at least one. Most people are right in that some things needed to be explaned better. The editing is really bad in the move.
The Art Department did an amazing job for the look and feel of the move. The same with the FX too simple great. Also with the Visual Effects were stunning. The cinematograph is another thing that saves this film from being a total bomb.
This move seems to wanna reach the post 60's crowd and apeal more to the teens of the 90's. with that in mind this really is not a really bad movie. For the die hard 60's kids this will be painful, but the new generation this is a pretty good flick.

It's a decent film, if you don't take it too seriously.  The film may be a bit disjointed, and not entirely believable at times, but it isn't boring.

As someone else commented, this show has always had problems where that's concerned.

However, on the bright side, we finally have every season in a well-packaged box set!  I think Shout Factory deserves a pat on the back for giving it to us after such a long wait.  Please don't let the minor video issues keep you from this set.  If you're a fan of the show, I don't think you'll regret this purchase.",4.0
"The whimsical spirit of the classic TV series is retained in this unbelievably poorly treated adventure film. The studio hacked away about a half-hour's worth of footage after a bad test screening, meaning some may find the plot hard to follow, but all the stuff you need to know is there if you pay attention. Basically, it's the traditional spy story- our heroes battle a diabolical madman with an elaborate scheme for world domination- overlaid with some of the most imaginative, inventive and downright charming imagery seen in any action film. You've got gun-toting grannies, killer teddy bears, robotic bees, Escheresque mazes and all other kinds of hallucinogenic imagery, as suave superagents John Steed and Emma Peel try to foil Sir August De Wynter's plot to control the world's weather. Throw in a Mrs. Peel clone and a traitor in the agents' midst, and you've got a dreamlike narrative that proceeds to a wonderfully tempestuous climax. Fiennes and Thurman are no Macnee and Rigg, but they've got their own appeal and a nicely tender chemistry. Sean Connery as the bad guy appropriately hams it up, and there's a superb supporting cast. The visuals are wonderful (avoiding the phoniness of some attempted camp-fests like BATMAN AND ROBIN), the characters fun, and the overall effect is quite exhilirating. Highly recommended.",4.0
"Dry, arch...this could be Monument Valley, but tis an apt description of an underrated film.

The killer bees, suprising nuns and decapitated teddy bears are in the  spirit of the original show, as is the fencing in the gentleman's  outfitters.  Only mistake, and huge mistake at that, was at the end,  allowing Steed and Peel to... Innuendo abounding, subtle and witty  thoughout, so why? tell me why was THAT necessary? Smacks of pandering to  the lowest common denom'. I can only hope a ""Director's Cut"" will  be issued; in the words of Steed, '...hurry back'.",4.0

I always liked this show when it originally aired.  Bob Newhart is at his best playing a low-key everyman that quietly reacts to all the lunacy that surrounds him.  In this series he plays a psychologist which is a creative way of introducing some quirky characters for him to respond to (not that his friends and co-workers aren't quirky enough themselves).  The show ran out of steam the last couple of seasons when supposedly Newhart wanted to end the series but was talked into staying. It is still a fun show with a lot of good memories.,4.0

"There are several people who are critical of ""The Avengers"" and how differently it is from the series. I myself have never seen an episode from the series and can't say if it lives up to the original. The movie  itself was good. It was more enticing to those who have never seen original  episodes then to those that have, because those that have were expectant of  the exact same style. Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Mrs. Peel (Uma Thurman)  work well together. There's a certain chemistry there. Steed seems somewhat  cold, however. He never seems to connect with anybody on an emotional  level. (The same could be said of Mrs. Peel, however, but we see her go a  little crazy at interrigation. Come to think of it, they do seem to know  eachother farely well. They tell eachother about themselves through the  entire movie.) Connery was exellent as Sir August de Winter. The action  seens were good as well, flying mechanical bees and exploding buildings and  balloons. The biggest downfall of the movie, besides not following the path  of the series, would be the confusion it generates. How does the clone of  Mrs. Peel survive the fall? How does Mrs. Peel survive the fall off the hot  weather balloon? How does Steed grab hold of the steel railing after he  falls? Other then unrealistic jumps and stunts, the movie had humor,  action, and class. The only issue that I have trouble swallowing was the  single kiss between them, which Steed throws off as ""scientific  inquiry"". It was a nice kiss, but unnessicary. However, if this is how  Mulder and Scully are portrayed 20 years from now, I will personally go  down to the studio and shove a microphone through the director's forehead.",4.0

"The Avengers. The words alone conjure up specific images of a never never London. Ralph and Uma step silently into the shoes of McNee and Rigg and attempt to reignite to explosive series of the 60's. The movie is a visual  frenzy of good ideas. The acting is appropriately over the top as is the  script. It has been given an unfair press, not even being revued prior to  release in England. Anyway, I liked it. It is fun, its silly, its  exciting... and Sean Connery is in it. What more do you want ? Does it have  a script ? No. Was it well planned ? No. That's what makes it work. Its  chaotic and wild. I only have one complaint. There is not enough of the  original music in the movie, and none of the songs on the OST appear in it.  Now that I've made this revue, I'm going to buy my own copy and have a cup  of tea. One lump or two ?",4.0

"Many passionate Jane Eyre fans hate this adaptation. I have read the book more than once and I rather liked this version-- it doesn't maybe glorify the story to the fans, but it does accurately represent what the book looks like to the rest of us. The fans get upset about inaccuracies, but these are all just details. The essence of the Jane Eyre story is captured in this movie. An unhappy single woman falls in love with a rude cranky older guy. Turns out the guy is married, but it works out. There is beautiful scenery involved and a big house. Some spooky scenes.
The production is lavish and the actors excellent. Ciaran Hinds may not be the dashing hunk Rochester of legend, but he is the older man of the book. Sometimes I wonder if the Jane fans are mixing Rochester up with Teen Wolf.  And Samantha Morton makes an elegant, attractive Jane.

"I bought this DVD because of the extremely silly episode with the long title. I remembered watching it in 1968, and being amazed at all the talent on show, and always had it as a favourite. It wears as well as you expect, which means I love the stagey sets, outrageous clothes (yes, we wore stuff like that), the cars. I'm a hard-core Emma Peel fan, but Tara, while not being quite so forceful nor as sexy, has her own appeal. The other episodes are like new to me - maybe I didn't see them back then, but I was such a regular every Saturday evening ... memory fades.",4.0

I like Samantha Morton as Jane Eyre she portrays Jane as the solom young lady that she was in the book. Not expecting much from the world but determined to make out there. I was not real crazy about Edward Rochester he seemed to be a little to harsh from the character in the book,4.0

They finally got two interesting actors for the lead roles in this movie adoption - I enjoyed watching it - they really played their parts well.,4.0
"Not surprisingly, the reviews of this movie are all over the board.  I have to say that I think the actors playing Rochester and Jane did a great job.  Rochester has been described as a screamer, and while I can see why people say that, Rochester IS a very emotional character.  I didn't find that a problem.  I did find the language and liberties taken with some scenes unfortunate - I am not against modifying dialogue to help the flow of the movie, but too many liberties were taken here!  That being said, I really, really enjoyed this movie.  I enjoyed seeing a short Jane Eyre, and all the stuff that was cut out were the things that you tend to want to hurry through when you're reading it anyway.  In fact, I have been guilty of skipping through Jane's childhood in one or two of the versions that I own.  :D  This movie also totally skips the whole issue of Jane gaining an independence, which in the grand scheme of things, doesn't really matter too much to the meat of the story.",4.0
"The actors are true and quite believable to the author's characters in this rendition of ""Jane Eyre"". Although some of the story lines are left out due to production length, it is non the less for it and the emotional connection between the two main character's is never lacking. I've seen many adaptations of this Bronte novel, and this is by far the best in my opinion.",4.0
"This is a loose version, some things were added that were not in the book, much was left out.  but a book such as this would have to be a mini-series to remain true.  That being said, I like this version.  Ciran Hinds never disappoints, and is so handsome.  Yes he's stiff in the movie, but so was Edward in the book.  I like it, and will probably buy this version, maybe.  still a couple more versions to see before I select one for my personal library.",4.0
this show was the talk of the town  when it fist aired.  It will always be a classic.,4.0
"I love this version, although I am biased because it was the first adaptation I had seen.  I adore Ciaran Hinds as Mr. Rochester, and although Samantha Morton captured the fairy quality of Jane Eyre, I never felt she represented the fire she had inside, and there is little chemistry between the two actors onscreen.

Having said that, this condensed version of Jane Eyre moves very quickly, is never boring, in completely enjoyable to watch, and truly captures the spirit of the novel. (SPOILERS AHEAD): the scene when Jane leaves, crying, and you hear Edward call out that this was the purest love, and he should know, he's waited long enough for it, it's just heartbreaking.",4.0
"I enjoyed this movie version except that Jane played by Samantha Morton was not the strongest Jane. Jane is a solid and strong inside herself type of person. I love the 'look' as Jane but her acting is just not there. It is like she is too faint and disembodied in the role. Jane is a substantial person with depth. Samantha captures the fairy unworldy part but never is strong and resounding in her performance. It is almost like the role was too much for what she had inside to give to it.

Ciaran Hinds on the other hand carries this version.  He is a GREAT Mr. Rochester! I love the novel and have various movie versions; I was totally surprised by him. He totally carries the flick! With the exception of the kissing scene where he reveals his feelings for her after she returns from being away - the side of the face fake kisses (don't look!).  How did they let all THAT stay in the final? It was so entirely awkward. Forget that part when you see it as it was a total disaster.  But, I was totally surprised by how great he was in this movie.  A good look for him as I did not care for him much in the Jane Austen adapation of Persuasion.

I very much like Gemma Jones who plays the best Mrs. Fairfax; this version fills in the blanks as far as did Mrs. Fairfax know what was going on?  This is the only vesion that does so.

I say this version is good for Jane Eyre fans; Mr. Rochester is what makes it good, not Jane.",4.0

"Admittedly, this is a truncated version, which is not entirely faithful to the novel.  If this is a problem for anyone, this is not a version for you (many others to choose from).  However, I cannot help liking just about anything with Ciaran Hinds in it.  IMO, he IS Mr. Rochester.  I also loved Samantha Morton as Jane.

I kind of just wish that they used these same actors and plugged them into a more full length miniseries, rather than a feature length film.  Jane Eyre really needs to be done as a miniseries.

That said, this is a workable, enjoyable version well worth a view for Hinds and Morton.",4.0
"A finely cast Jane (an early role for Samantha Morton) and Rochester (a gruff, wry Ciaran Hinds) make the difference in what is quite a short retelling of the story. In particular, the verbal fencing that goes on as they sound each other out in the early part of the film - an important element in the book - is played expertly.  The 2006 version (Ruth Wilson) has more time to develop detail and a first-class Jane, but perhaps too civilised a Rochester.",4.0

"This is the FAST FOOD version of Jane Eyre!!!  Still it is quite entertaining.  Music was very good, much better than the BBC 1983 version.  This Jane is the BEST Jane I have seen so far.  She is an incredible actress who portrays all of Jane's emotions.  I am disturbed by so much change in the wordings though.  Also I found myself disliking this Mr. Rochester because he SCREAMS all the times.  ICK!  He definitely looks over 20 years older than Jane.  The best Rochester is the PBS version.  This movies is still worth a look for its entertaining value!",4.0
"Jane Eyre is a classic.  On the depressing side, but if you are in love with Victorian books made into well-made films, this one is a must for your collection.",4.0
"I really like this version of Jane Eyre.  Fans of romantic/historical movies will enjoy the detailed sets and costumes as well as the high drama.  Fans of the novel will appreciate a script that's true to the book without ploddingly recreating it word-for-word or--just as bad--peppered with anachronisms in an attempt to make Jane Eyre hip and modern.

Samantha Morton brings Jane's underlying strength of character to life and Ciaran Hinds, as Mr. Rochester, does very well with a character that can easily be overplayed to the point of silliness.  They are supported by a strong cast, including Gemma Jones as Mrs. Fairfax.  The overall production value is as high as the caliber of the acting.

This is a good, strong production, though I do wish that the DVD came with some extras.",4.0
"Given that a book of this length and complexity would be a challenge to film in less than 4-6 hours, I found this version as good as could be expected. Samantha Morton made an excellent Jane, with her innate pride gradually giving way to her deep love for the haughty Mr Rochester, excellently played by Ciaran Hinds. A life-affirming adaptation of a very complex novel, the only raw touch for me was the character of St John Rivers, none of whose coldness and manipulation was shown. The scenery was stunningly filmed and formed the right impression of brooding foreboding. Excellent value for money.",4.0
"This was the first version of Jane Eyre I had ever seen and I enjoyed it very much.  There was a chemistry or ""passion"" between Jane and Rochester.  Samantha Morton played Jane better than anyone to date.  Jane had personality which I think she lacks in other versions.

I thought Ciaran Hinds as Rochester was wonderful.  He was very close to how I imagined Mr. Rochester in the book.  Not handsome but rugged and likeable.  He did tend to be a bully somtimes and that was a negative but he also had a tender side that came out through his facial expressions in a number of scenes between he and Jane.

A few negatives I found with the film are: 1. this version doesn't stay true to the book, much of the dialogue between the characters is rewritten, 2.  sometimes Rochester is a little too angry and 3.  I wish it were longer so that more of the book could be included.

I loved the ending and had butterflies watching it.  I found the passion between the actors moving and can easily watch this version again and again.

If however, you want a version of Jane Eyre that keeps closer to the book, then the Timothy Dalton version (1983) is a better choice.  It too is very good but is a bit dated (I felt like I was watching a play rather than a movie).

Ideally, I would love to see a production of Jane Eyre that is as well done as the A&E version of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.",4.0
"Cirian Hinds resonates with the dark, seething energy which is Mr. Rochester.  His portrayal is fantastic!  Samantha Morton is a fairly good Jane, and definitely meets the physical expectations of the small, plain governess.  This version is a good attempt at capturing the beautiful relationship shared by Jane and Mr. Rochester, but falls short, mainly I think due to time constraints.  It is impossible to cram all the plot development, intense dialogue and stirring emotion of this book into a 2 hour movie.  If you are wanting a more faithful portrayal of the book, check out the version with Timothy Dalton.  The Cirian Hinds/Samantha Morton version lacks in plot and character development, but is a valiant attempt at capturing the essence of the classic book.",4.0
"I can't say that this version of Jane Eyre followed the storyline closely.  Because of time constraints, large chunks of the novel had to be cut out or streamlined.  This includes not only some key plot points, but a lot of the best dialogue between Jane and Mr. Rochester as their relationship develops.

That said, I still think this is an enjoyable film, so long as you enjoy it in its own right and don't compare it to the book.  Both Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton commit to their roles with passion.  Like the characters in the novel, neither is conventionally beautiful; they are riveting because of the emotional force they bring to their parts.  At times, Hinds was a little too gruff as Rochester, but it never went over the top; he looked the part of Mr. Rochester and in my opinion acted it incredibly well.  And Samantha Morton is luminous - she may wear plain clothing and sport a ridiculous hair style, but she shines.  I did dislike some of the belabored dialogue the screenwriters introduced though.",4.0
"Very good. I wished we had watched when it first aired.
Enjoyed watching.",4.0
"Yes, I've read Jane Eyre, for the first time when I was twelve.  And, yes, I liked the book.  But this movie isn't the book and I liked it as well.
One thing the movie did very well in the beginning was to condense years of abuse by Jane's aunt and Mr. Brocklehurst into a few key horrific scenes that also point out the affection that Jane felt for her friend Helen, the few kind teachers and later her pupils.
Ciaran Hinds as the hero begins with a great deal of roaring and bluster, but here and there are hints that this is a screen he uses to protect himself from the pain of intimacy.  The key to Mr. Rochester's character is in the scene in which he tells Jane about his ""grand passion"" and how he was betrayed by the woman he adored.  Juxtapose this against the first Mrs. Rochester's passion for him that overset her reason.
Samantha Morton does a lovely job of portraying an innocent who is not ignorant of the darker aspects of human nature-- Lowood School taught her more than reading, writing and geography.  Her plummet into the pain of the truth and then her coming to understand the power of the passion that grips her is very well played.
If I want to re-experience my version of Jane Eyre I will reread the book.  That does not mean I cannot enjoy another interpretation of the story.",4.0
"Well, I  just watched this movie today again after not seeing it for a couple of years and again I loved it.
No, it is not as true to the book as some other versions, but it captures the spirit and tells the story in a very compelling, moving-it-along way. I enjoyed the rapid transitions, cut-aways and voice overs. It tells the story of the novel in a most interesting way.
I think Samantha Morton makes an excellent Jane Eyre. She really captures Jane's innocent yet vibrantly alive spirit. Morton exudes the very fairy-like, impish qualities that Mr. Rochester is always describing her as having in the book. I think she is the best Jane I have see portrayed although I do enjoy Charlotte Gainesborough's and Joan Fontaine's work as Jane as well.
Ciran Hinds did equally as well. I think the two actors really displayed the chemistry that existed potently between Jane and Rochester. This kiss under the tree was remarkable!
The settings and lighting in this version are much better than in the 1983 Timothy Dalton version. And although Hinds is quite handsome in Persuasion, he actually becomes the more unattractive Rochester in this movie. Dalton, although a powerful performance in the miniseries in which he played Mr. Rochester, could never really be considered ""ugly."" Hinds is a more credible Rochester and very true to Charlotte Bronte's novel.
I highly recommend and enjoy this version of Jane Eyre. Although not as true to the book as other versions, I think it included the most crucial scenes in a most convincing way. It was truly a fresh look at a classic and timeless novel.",4.0
"A notion that a movie should be true to its literary predecessor is often unnecessarily emphasized. Some degree of creative freedom should be tolerated, especially if the result is as moving as this one. The omission of some significant points does not bother me, because the core of the interplay between the two main characters is sustained. The film doesn't deal with the heroine's spiritual developement; it is concentrated upon one, albeit the most important, aspect - her relationship with Rochester, and in that respect it is extremely successful. Chemistry between the leading actors is undeniable, and the developement of their characters' mutual affection is smooth, easy and beliveable, although it takes place within only a couple of scenes. Morton is a personification of the literary Jane - reserved yet emotional, insecure but brave. She makes her 'small Quaker-like' heroine as 'plain' as she possibly could. Since many of Charlotte's allusions to Jane's independence were omitted, it was necessary to make her more outspoken so that her true nature could be perceived. In the 'first-encounter scene' literary Jane is more assertive and thus sets the tone for her future relationship with Rochester. This blunder is remedied soon afterwards as the characters' verbal intercourse becomes more spicy and direct. Mistical connotations in the aforementioned filmed scene follow the surrealism of the novel, otherwise almost completely overlooked in the film. Hinds is a true Rochester, both physically and spiritually. He dominates the screen with his powerful personality: the original character is not at all handsome, he's often emotionally abusive, but still manages to be fascinatingly charismatic and sexually desireable. Hinds is a perfect image of a dangerous, romantic, imposing Byronic 'doomed hero', a rake eventually tamed and redeemed by marital love. Furtermore, this Rochester is even more understanding than his literary counterpart in relation to his mad, imprisoned wife. Regrettably, Blanche Ingram is (again!) blond and sophisticated, while she is supposed to be 'dark and majestic' - a beauty prototype which should remind us of Bertha Mason's former self. I welcome the omission of the gipsy scene; it is, after all, Charlotte's overly romantic and highly unbelievable diversion. The kiss, on the other hand, is a major disappointment - in this modernized and not at all timid version this climactic profession of love should have been rendered more realistically. It would have been the perfect icing on this romantic cake.",4.0
"Having only seen the Timothy Dalton and William Hurt versions also, this is decidedly my favourite adaptation of the novel so far.
Although the Dalton and Clarke version is the most faithful rendition of the novel, I still can not help liking this adaptation more. Dalton's performance as Mr Rochester is superb and flawless but he is far too handsome for my liking. Clarke is just satisfactory - her Jane is too weak and bland. With respect to the Hurt and Gainsbourgh rendition, I was unfortunately quite bored after Anna Paquin departed from the screen. However, this was mainly attributed to improper screenplay and direction and  the lack of chemistry between the two lead characters.
After seeing Ciaran Hinds' brilliant performance in `Ivanhoe' and `Persuasion', I had to watch this version. However, I was quite disppointed as he portrays a rather savage, arrogant and simple Mr Rochester and fails to depict the absolute complexity and glamour of Bronte's character as others have mentioned in their reviews. For this I solely blame the directors though, for Hinds' undoubtedly has the capacity to provoke the audience in the same manner that Bronte's Mr Rochester does the reader ( - evidence from his numerous awesome performances clearly suggest so).
Samantha Morton is undeniably my favourite Jane though. She is far more vivacious and yet more solemn than Zelah Clarke and exudes much more passion than Charlotte Gainsbourgh (but for that I also blame misguided direction & screenplay engineered by Zeffirelly & Whitemore). Morton is perfect for the part and Hinds would be to if only proper direction was given and pivotal dialogue was included. Nevertheless, apart from these failures I still enjoyed this film.
Thus, if you want to see a good film, I definitely recommend this, but if you want to watch a totally true adaptation of Bronte's novel then it is better to see the Dalton and Clarke rendition.",4.0

"Welles did such a definitive Rochester for me, exactly as my mind's eye saw him in the novel, that it is hard for me to appreciate anyone else in that role.  However, George C. Scott did a very good, very restrained Rochester in his later version and this version presents a very good Rochester as well.  Morton as Jane Eyre confirms my earlier opinion from her performance in ""Sweet And Low Down"" that she is an actress to watch.  As far as faithfulness to the novel, I really don't demand that from films which are a very different creative medium from novels. The basic story has become a timeless classic, often copied but never equaled.  Jane is a poor orphan who becomes a governess for Rochester's ward.  He is a wealthy man with a beautiful estate.  They fall in love but a horrible dilemma from his past comes forth to haunt them both.

"This is the 3rd adaptation of Jane Eyre I saw. I liked this one more than 1983 and 1996 versions, because the characters were very likable, and the passion on screen was moving. Some reviewers found Ciaran Hinds stiff; I  disagree. He was a wonderful Mr. Rochester, as was Samantha Morton a  perfect Ms. Eyre. This is something you would want to watch over and over  again, if you are a romantic person, preferably an Austenite. However, the  adaptation is really loose, and important details from the book are  omitted. So if you are looking for a faithful adaptation, or watching the  movie to avoid reading the book, this is not the one. 83 version is very  loyal to the book, but they are almost reading from the book. 96 version is  generally loyal, but the omitted parts are the romantic parts, so where is  the fun? This one is the best one I have seen until now, but I will keep  looking for a miniseries that includes all the main details, and brings the  passion in the book alive. (I am not obsessed with loyalty to the book in  general, but Jane Eyre is a perfect book, and I miss all the parts that are  left out.)",4.0
"This is a beautiful film. I think that A&E does a good job in picking out the scenery and places. It is a masterpiece if you like to watch films simply for the scenery. It needs more detail and a lot more time added to  it. They seamed to smash everything into one movie and you can tell. It is  a good, clean, family film and I would certaily recomend it. I don't know  about buying it though. You would need to watch it first. The actors did a  good job, except Rochester could have been a little less forceful. I leave  it up to your decision if you like it or not. Enjoy! (I hope!)",4.0
"I disagree with the viewer from Cambrige Ontario. I found this version lovely! Samantha Morton was excellent (I need to see ""Emma"" now), reserved, thoughtful, just as Jane was in the book. Jane had high emotions  but did not strike out often...the childhood was a small part of the book,  and though important, it is not the major part of the story.

"I'd been hearing about Upstairs Downstairs for years. Somehow I never saw it when it was aired on PBS and the discs were a bit pricy for a 'hope it's good' purchase.

Finally I found this 40th Anniversary set -- produced by Acorn -- at an irresistible price and took the plunge.

My wife and I sat down and watched episodes 1 through 3 and each of us had the same reaction. What was all the fuss about?  Upstairs Downstairs seemed to be a mediocre, low-budget, Brit sitcom and nothing more. We took a few days off and then decided to give it another go. And are we glad we did! For starting in episode 4 the entire feel of the series changed from a cheap sitcom to thoughtful human drama.

Okay, the ""cheap"" feeling stayed for somewhat longer. Only as the years went by did the production values start to go a bit upscale.  Never near the level of something like Downton Abbey, mind you, but good enough to become invisible.

The production and mastering of the Acorn set is so-so at best, both as to image and sound quality and the interface. (Oh, the junk you have to sit through on each year's disc one before the program starts! Ugh!) And instead of defaulting to having no subtitles 4 out of the 5 sets defaulted to subtitles on. Grrr!

But the drama itself is the thing and all that technical stuff pales into insignificance once we got absorbed into the characters and the stories. This is human drama as real as life -- full of the complexities, ambiguities, triumphs, joys, disappointments and sorrows of real life and told with feeling and an underlying appreciation for what it means to be human.  As such Upstairs Downstairs is highly recommended.",4.0

I also liked the extras you get with the set, it is nice listening to Jean Davies describe how the idea came about and also listening to writers, producers was, as I found, very interesting. As for the stories themselves -- each episode could stand on its own -- although they do follow. You meet delightful characters and also there is a lot of pathos, I have cried a few times -- and laughed. If you enjoy well written, well acted, stories about Britain's past then buy it.",4.0
"SUBTITLES IN ENGLISH ARE MANDATORY IN THESE SERIES. While we watched our current DVD collection, it was not a particularly satisfactoy experience. For us the audio was the main problem, considering the british'pronunciation and not the best audio quality transfer it was really difficult to follow and thus a pitty, and I could say it was nearly a wast of money.  We love ""Upstairs, Downstairs""-- I would like to repurchase it if and only if the new version comes with english subtitles.",4.0

"Brilliant view of the social history of England  (and probably of many other countries in Europe) in the early 20th century.

"I, like other reviewers, found some ""unique"" audio and video effects to be a bit distracting - the series starts out in color, then to switches to black and white, then back to color. I am left to  wonder, primarily based upon the fact that it started out in color and immediately went to black and white, if the producers ""assumed"" the series would be short-lived, therefore it was not cost-effective to continue filming in color.  There are a few other video oddities sprinkled about - a strange, albeit very small, bar that reminds me of the ""this is a test"" signal bar one sees (or used to see) on the old analog stations - it was usually up in the top right corner, noticeable only because I suspect I was paying keen attention to such things given some of the other reviews.  I worried my new TV was experiencing some color/tone issues, but when I moved the same disc to another TV/DVD, same thing.  None of these ""issues"" are deal-breakers - but I must admit I was a bit disappointed that with all the amazing editing tools used these days, no one felt it necessary (or worthwhile/cost-effective perhaps) to ""clean up"" some of these little items.  The audio quality seems to ebb and flow - sometimes crystal clear, other times I found myself rewinding to replay - now, these audio snips could have been less than crystal clear simply due to the location of the particular scene (e.g., racing scene, outdoors vs. indoors, party scene with many ""chatters""), still, not a deal-breaker......besides, it's not as though this series was recently filmed :)

The series itself is wonderful - lessons in social classes and the economic impact thereof remind me of history lessons - without the homework :)  The attention to the smallest period details is impressive, from clothing to cookware, from food to architecture, from healthcare (or the lack thereof really) to amenities such as transportation and communication, ""someone did their homework"", and I appreciate the effort (the historical research,and recreations, must have been an significant undertaking unto itself).

The Thomas and Sarah ""series"" leaves me indifferent - if anything, it seems to be a rather disjointed collection of the two main character's ongoing achievements followed immediately by some sort of horrible failure - somewhat predictable (make some money, lose that money, secure a job, lose that job, find some lodging, lose the same). However, both are fine actors and the same attention to period details carries over in this ""mini series"" - a nice ""bonus"" feature, but on it's own, I'd say this series would garner a generous 3 star rating, not bad, but not wonderful.

This collection is one in which I'm sure I'll find myself watching again and again, even if just a disc or two, even out of sequence - enjoyable just the same. No regrets on the purchase and yes, I'd recommend it to others and would definitely make the identical purchase - were I offered a ""do over"" :)

Overall: 4.5 stars (the ""ding"" is due to the video/audio ""issues"")",4.0
"Heard about this series all my life...finally bought it..and have problems understanding dialog....cast seems to mumble at times...and at others, talk so fast with the British accent that this Southern gal has problems hearing/unstanding dialog.  love the cast... but am tired of ""backing up"" trying to get the gyst of the script",4.0
"Bought this for my wife for Xmas and the theme's are very good and the acting excellent but I was hoping it would be something we could watch as a family but it was not the case.  The stories deal with very mature topics.  For example just the first 5 episodes dealt with the subjects of rape, abortion, adultery and homosexuality.  This was a little too much for our children.

There were a number of reviews that gave low ratings because of the quality of the video and sound. We did not find any problems with this.  Except for a few that were not color there was really not difficulties.  It would have been nice to have caption since the varying English accents were difficult to understand at first and we had to keep rewinding to figure out what was said.",4.0
"What a pleasure to be able to watch every episode of ""Upstairs Downstairs"" at your own pace, with NO commercials or fundraising breaks!

I was surprised watching this megaset how many episodes I don't recall ever seeing.  I'm not sure whether that's because I was out of the house at the time -- in the days before VCRs -- or because some of the episodes have elements reflecting the racism, anti-semitism, or other unfortunate aspects of the Edwardian age which U.S. networks elected not to broadcast.

At any rate, one need look no further than the brilliant first episode to see why this series is one of the best -- if not the single best -- historical drama ever, and every bit as captivating today as when it was originally broadcast.

With clockwork precision, the first episode introduces us to the aristocratic Bellamy family who live upstairs at 165 Eaton Place, and their staff of devoted servants working downstairs.  We see how the house functions, in particular the duties of the servants through the course of the day -- and we are introduced to one of the richest casts of characters this side of Dickens.

The steadfast and resourceful Hudson the butler, played by the late, great Gordon Jackson... the fastidious Mrs. Bridges the cook, played by Angela Baddeley... Rose the parlor maid, played by series co-creator Jean Marsh... Mr. and Lady Bellamy, played by David Langton and Rachel Gurney... their children James and Elizabeth, played by Simon Callow and Nicola Paget... all are indelible creations magnificently realized.

In the course of the series, the years from the first quarter of the twentieth century come to life with an unerring eye for detail, from the advent of electricity in the home to the adoption of the automobile to the crackle of the first crystal radios and early victrolas to the sinking of the Titanic to the horrors of World War I and the crash of the stock market in 1929.

Watching the series again, I was moved to tears on a number of occasions.  I felt as if I was spending time with a dear family I hadn't seen in many years.

This megaset also includes a twenty-fifth anniversary special that reunited many of the cast members to reminisce about the production.  One of the most amusing anecdotes comes from series co-creator Marsh, who recalls that there were ""upstairs"" dressing rooms for the cast and ""downstairs"".  The former had windows and boxes of tissue; the latter did not.  The Bellamy family cast were automatically assigned the ""upstairs"" dressing rooms -- until Marsh finally spoke up and noted that as series co-creator, she deserved a box of tissues as much as Rachel Gurney!

Then there is the spinoff series, ""Thomas and Sarah"", featuring the ever-scheming, never-succeeding former chauffeur and maid of the Bellamy household, which I consider more of a curiosity than a drama as compelling as ""Up Down"" itself.  Still it is a welcome inclusion for dedicated fans.

I have deducted one star for the technical problems of this DVD set, which have been cited by other reviewers as well.  A&E obviously didn't lavish the same attention to detail on the mastering of these discs as the writers, directors, and actors who created the show, and it's a shame.  Especially annoying are the little boxes of ""digital dither"" that appear in the upper right corners of many episodes, plus the nonexistent color correction in others.

Still, these technical issues detract only slightly from the breathtaking panoply of the drama unfolding here, and at a price around half that of the box set when it was first introduced, this megaset still merits inclusion in a British television enthusiast's collection.

One hopes, as others have noted, that A&E will eventually release an improved megaset that clears up these technical issues and perhaps includes another set of reminiscences from the series creators and television commentators.

Until then -- ""look sharp,"" as Hudson would say, and order this spectacular set to enjoy with your family!",4.0
"As you have probably read there are indeed quality problems with this set. Sadly the criticisms are true and for some people will be a distraction. I found I could live with the technical difficulties and if you don't need a technically perfect digital transfer you will be rewarded with one of the most outstanding television series ever broadcast. Superbly produced, finely written and splendidly acted by a magnificent cast  of British actors who give the characters a life that will remain in your memory long after  a first viewing and going back to this set will be like visiting old friends.",4.0

"I can't help myself, I just love this series.  I missed it the first go round in the 70's on PBS due to ""life events"" that were going on for me, but it is such a stellar series -- and it is so affordable in the ""Complete Series"" package by A&E that I have to tell you that despite the poor poor quality of the DVD, the stories are too fantastic to not view and own if you are on a budget.  I do notice the DVD ""panning"" or ""slowing down"" or even the fuzzy notation for the next reel in the upper right corner, but I just acknak it and let it go, and let the story and character draw me in and in and in and on and on and....",4.0
"I am enjoying this series very much.  It's been 30 years since Ive seen it so it's like seeing them for the first time,  well almost. I am very pleased with these DVDs. Some have said the transfers were bad, but I have not found that to be the case at all. The color is good and the sound is excellent so far as I've seen. After all these were made back in the 70's.  One should appreciate this set for what it represents, a much loved series with much loved characters, filmed in the 70's for television.",4.0
"I don't have the US version of the Upstairs Downstairs box set, but, if the UK releases are anything to go by, they'll be very good. Technically, the picture and sound quality isn't 2005 standard...and, I suppose there will be some degradation in converting 625 line PAL colour pictures into 525 line NTSC. As regards the black and white episodes, they were NOT made by the BBC. The entire series was made by a commercial TV company called London Weekend for the ITV network. Colour production on ITV started in late 1969, but, in late 1970, technicians took industrial action, refusing to produce colour programmes. The action lasted months and every ITV programme screened or recorded during that period was in black and white. Thus the reason for the monochrome episodes. To return to the series...great in its day and still worth watching. Incidentally, Gordon Jackson, who played the butler Hudson, later starred in a series about undercover agents called ""The Professionals"". It's well worth seeing.",4.0
"All the previous reviewers seem to have covered it all. This two DVD set is essential viewing for everyone. The colour and quality of these two DVDs brings to life the horror and grim reality of WW2. They give a brief and tragic insight to what it was like to experience the second global war, not only from a soldiers view point but also a civilian's one. The focus is more on the human element of the war rather than strategic or tactical view and makes good use of diary and letter extracts to compliment the unforgetable colour images.
The only disappointing feature was that the review on the back of the first DVD suggested there would be combat coverage of the Battle of Staingrad, however this coverage was merely in the form of colour still shots unlike all the other images in this DVD set.
Potential buyers from Australia and New Zealand should note that this has viewed on T.V. as ""The Color of War"" and not to confuse it with something different.
Everyone should view this DVD to get a feel and an appreciation for this particular period of time.",4.0
"I have seen several adaptations of Nero Wolfe novels over the years, including the horrid failed TV series in the late 70s or early 80s.  The movie GOLDEN SPIDERS comes very close to capturing the true nature of both  Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe.  When I started watching the movie, I  thought, here we go again, another failed attempt at putting these guys on  the screen.  Tim Hutton and M. Chaukyn really surpized me.  They really had  the characters down and even though I have read GOLDEN SPIDERS several  times and knew the ending, I could not take my eyes off the screen.  BRAVO.  It is about time somebody did a good job adapting Nero Wolfe to the screen.  Any screen. I especially liked the fact that the movie was set in the time  frame of the original novel (late 50s I think).  Excellent movie.  MAKE  MORE IN THE SERIES PLEASE!",4.0
"Much of the footage in this 2 DVD set is spectacular. It really makes the events of WW2 seem like they could have happened a couple of years ago. Some of it is so good that it looks as though it might have been faked! Not all of it though. A few clips appear grainy, yellowish, etc. Also, I was truly surprised at how few of these clips I had seen before. Some of them I recognized but the majority were totally new to me (and I have seen a lot of ww2 documentaries). A word of caution: like most war docs, there are some pretty gruesome scenes.
As far as the content, it was pretty good. It was a little like ""The War"" by Ken Burns in that actors would read letters, diary entries, and the like. Indeed,the writings of Quentin Aanenson and Eugene Sledge make their rounds here too (you will know them well from ""The War""). It was kind of funny that the actor would read the letter in English but with an accent from the author's country of origin. I guess it would remind you that the speaker was German, French, Russian, Japanese, or whatever. Kind of goofy but I got used to it. Also, keep in mind that it is only about 3 hrs and they were limited to only showing color footage. Because of this, there is very little detail and some major events are barely mentioned. This is primarily a visual experience. If you're a WW2 buff, you won't learn anything new. Then again, of you're a WW2 buff, I highly recommend this DVD.",4.0
"Based on reviews I'd read beforehand, I expected something big with this 2-disc set.  To its credit, it runs 2 hours and 51 minutes.  But it's on the pricey side and a lot of what's shown here has been on other more recent (and less expensive) DVD's, like ""Hitler, in Color,"" which is really outstanding.  I also expected this DVD set to be better than ""World War II in Color, the British Story.""  On the contrary, the latter costs less than half of this one, ran over an hour longer and had more unique footage and commentary.  The ""British Story"" is all on a single, collector's edition, digital disc.

For those building a DVD library on World War II, especially color features, this 2-volume set belongs in your collection.  For those operating on a budget, choose the two DVD's noted above, first.  Then, consider ""Visions of War, Vol. 2--Hitler, in His Own Words,"" and various pieces on Winston Churchill, for greater value.",4.0
"I loved the true story of courage.  I objected to the cursing, because the reading I have done about Washington describes him as an introvert, and a God fearing man who constantly encouraged his men to pray, repent, fast and seek divine guidance for the cause of the revolution.  I think the frequent cursing was added to the story by script writers who thought the language would add drama to the situation, which it did not!",4.0
"With his Continental Army shrinking around him George Washington has someone 'requisition' some ships to get his men across the river so they will not be as easily accessible to being demolished.

For his last act he decides to attack Trenton, New Jersey where Soldiers of Fortune are stationed, to accomplish that they will have to get a thousand men across the river, at night in the cold for Christmas! They arrive at dawn and attack. Interesting and insightful. War violence, swearing.

Yeah, it was a little too much in light of GW very rarely using foul language.  Is it 100% accurate?  No it is not as pointed out by other reviewers.  Does it have the production values of ""John Addams"" or ""Band of Brothers""?  No but I doubt ""The Crossing"" had the same budget.  But it is the only movie I am aware of that is about the battle of Trenton and why it was so pivotal.

It does a wonderful job of portraying what really took place during the crossing of the Delaware and the Battle of Trenton.  The movie is more of a Hollywood action/drama style movie than a ""boring"" biography/non-fiction history movie. However, it does contain quite a bit of crude language, gratuitous violence (when they surprise the Hessians), and adult scenes.  If you are a teacher or parent and plan to show this to your children, you'll definitely need to watch it ahead of time and fast forward through a few of the scenes.",4.0
"The only thing keeping me from giving this movie a 5 star rating is that the production was obviously on a limited budget.

Sadly, given the present attitude in America, this isn't the case.",4.0

"In all honesty, I expected this to be a so-so movie, however it turned out to be well done and very enjoyable. Jeff Daniels gives a wonderful performance as Washington and lifts the movie above the usual mediocrity of most made-for-TV-movies. All too often, actors are cast to play historic characters they just do not fit. In this case, not only does Daniels bear a passable resemblance to Washington, but he conveys the concern, insecurity, impatience, and determination the general admitted to feeling in his letters and correspondence.

I enjoy reading about history, particularly the colonial/Revolutionary War period, and am generally wary of historical movies due to their tendency to fudge on facts. While I do not claim to be a historian, I found The Crossing to be pretty accurate. I do wish they had brought in more soldiers since the battle scene appeared somewhat skimpy in that regard.

The sets and costumes fit comfortably with the time setting, as does the language and mannerisms. The picture is clear and clean, not distorted by fading colors or other problems. While it was made for TV, I did not find the breaks to be annoyingly obvious as with some. The DVD includes extras, including an interesting account of the movie being made, as well as interviews. One part shows how stunt men made the battle scenes appear real- something younger viewers might enjoy.

There is neither objectionable language in the movie, nor any sexual themes. The battle is not particularly bloody or violent, but would probably be PG if rated. It would make a nice addition to a homeschool history curriculum as well as the family video library. I will certainly be watching this movie again.",4.0
"Good films on the Revolution are hard to find.  This one was packed with action and the drama of Washington's last roll of the dice when the odds were so severly stacked against him.  The film is truly worthwhile, if only to further instill some patriotism in your kids and remind yourself what our ancestors went through to gain our independence.  And Washington would be a hard character to play:  unless your Jeff Daniels.  He nails it and truly captured the heroic aspects of that great man.",4.0
"There are some historical inaccurracies in this film, to be sure. The Wikipedia entry for the movie has most of them. And like most movies dealing with any war, there are not enough men on the screen to portray the actual number of soldiers involved. Washington had more than 2000 troops when he went into Trenton, up against about the same number of Hessians. Of course, without computer-generated graphics, there's no way a made-for-television movie can portray that.

I have to question the casting of Jeff Daniels as Washington. I know Washington was a flesh and blood person, but somehow Daniels (or perhaps the script he had to work with) does not communicate the gravitas that must have personified Washington. This was a man chosen practically unanimously by the Continental Congress to lead the army. Daniels does not come across as that sort of person.

Although it is known that Washington had a temper, especially in extremis, most of the time Daniels' Washington comes across as merely petulant or even bitchy.

The dialogue between most of the characters seemed at times to be pretty anachronistic. American screenwriters should take a lesson from their British counterparts (Andrew Davies, for example) on how to write 18th Century dialogue that sounds authentic but not stilted or phoney.

Finally, THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. We watched it with our 7 and 9 year olds because they're studying the Revolution in school. We were dismayed by the bad language, sexual references and the over-the-top bloodletting. Why did the director think it a good idea to show closeups of bayoneting and swords going all the way through people? Showing it is one thing -- but closeups? C'mon! At least the DVD should have indicated what's in store so parents could be informed.",4.0

"I enjoyed this movie and show it to my American History classes.  The kids liked it.  It is very historically correct.  I have to admit that I kept thinking about Jeff Daniel's Dumb and Dumber character when I saw him as George Washington, I don't think the students noticed.  Other than that distraction.. I would recommend it.",4.0
"I purchased this film to use in my classroom while discussing one of the most pivotal moments in the American Revolution.  Upon previewing the film though I was very disappointed in the amount of, what I felt, was unnecessary cursing.  The words, I am guessing, were placed there to help the viewer understand the desperation of the situation, but unfortunately, this made the movie unviewable for my classroom.

With regards to the movie's overall impression; Jeff Daniels does an admirable job as George Washington and projects a very convincing presence.  You are witness to a man who has been beaten and defeated in every battle and skirmish for the last 18 months, and Daniels denotes this very well in his body language and demeanor.  Many of the men who would become his original cabinet are also seen (Hamilton, Knox) by his side in this story.  Would have been a great history lesson had it not been for the language.",4.0
"""The Crossing"" was a great made for tv film from the A & E networks.  While some may quibble with the historical accuracy (which in these adaptations there is always something missing that someone doesn't like) it does show the desperation of the forces in the winter of 1776 and how this small victory began to help turn things around in the ""rebels"" favor.  As others have stated Jeff Daniels plays an outstanding George Washington (better than Kelsey Grammar IMHO).  While I think the roles of Knox (at least they got an overweight actor albiet one that is about 15 years older than Knox was at the time) and Greene (also too old for the real Greene) were miscast the rest were fairly well portrayed.  Yes, it would have added to the story to show Rall putting away the note informing him of the  Continental  advance, it's something that isn't really missed (again IMHO).  There are also many historians who quibble over whether or not the Hessians were somewhat hung over or not which was somewhat implied but not shown.  The music does add to the story as others have mentioned.  I show this to my middle school students every year and they seem to enjoy it (it also gives them the opportunity to find the truth vs. fiction in the movie).",4.0
"GW is a very hard man for Americans to warm up to the. The Man is like another Virginian that comes to mind, Robert E. Lee. Both seem to be Marble Men (Not of real flesh & blood). All I can say is Thank God we have men like them when we needed them. Mr Daniels does his best to create the persona of out Founding Father and I feel that he comes pretty close to the mark.

This films captures what I feel is the key moment of Washington's life as a General. In a bold and courageous move he won a good solid victory that helped keep the cause alive. No one else could of done it. I also feel that it showed accurately for a movie at least what ot must of been like to have been there. The uniforms seemed correct as was the weopons and tactics.

  All around a good addition to ones collection.",4.0
"This is a made-for-TV movie produced by the A&E television network in 2001.  It was adapted from a novel by Howard Fast and I assume it is historically accurate.  It's about a defining moment in American history - that of George Washington crossing the Delaware River and attacking the well-trained German soldiers hired by the British, at Trenton, New Jersey.
I recently visited a friend who lives in that area and walked across the bridge where George Washington made this historic crossing.  Of course there was no bridge back in 1776 on that cold December day -- just the dark and the cold and an ice-filled river.  The Continentals, which was what the Americans were called then, were losing the war. They had not won a battle since they declared independence six months before on July 4.  The troops were weary and starving.  It looked like the American Revolution was lost.
But Washington took a huge risk, and in his own quiet and determined way, made a decision that changed the course of history.  The scenes of the actual crossing were done in fog and shadow, as the boats moved towards the opposite shore.  But there were no scenes that looked like the famous painting with Washington standing in the front of the boat.  In this film, Washington was sitting throughout. Naturally, this made me re-think my own historical perceptions.
Jeff Daniels is cast as Washington, and I found myself very critical of his performance.  He seemed aloof and wooden and, even though there was constant danger, he never lost his cool, calm leadership abilities.  I understand, though, that this is exactly the kind of person that George Washington was. If this is true, then he did portray him well.
Basically, though, even though there was some conflict between the various generals as well as a bit of bawdy language and some violent scenes of swordplay, the film never rose above that of a history lesson, one shown in classrooms or while visiting museums. I tend to like my drama more complex though, and for that reason this film, while well done, has to be viewed for what it is.  I therefore give it a modest recommendation.  It's certainly worthwhile seeing.",4.0
"My girlfriend and I enjoyed this film and felt as though we'd really seen George Washington.  The film begins in 1776 and ends with the conclusion of the surprise attack on Trenton.  This is one chapter of history we feel intimately acquainted with now.  Although it doesn't seem to have enjoyed a great budget and although it has just a hint of an educational taste to it, the Crossing seems far more historically relevant than films like Patriot or Pacino's Revolution.  Daniels displays incredible posture especially while riding a horse and as a passenger in a boat through all hours of the night and thus quietly impresses upon us the dignity of America's first and fearless leader.",4.0
"During the winter of 1776 members of the Continental Congress abandon Philadelphia and run for their lives as the American Revolution begins to unravel. The Continental Army has lost every battle in defence of its positions, and has never dared to attack the enemy. Now, a american general who is considered to be a buffoon by the British, and ineffective by many of his own officers, is about to lead a ragtag army of 2000 tired, hungry and sick men across an ice-filled river at night to attack the best trained and most feared soldiers in the world. Pulp fiction? Historical fact??
This little gem captures the essence of what many military historians believe to be the most daring battle strategy ever undertaken.
All the cast members deliver solid and convincing performances, especially Jeff Daniels as the brooding and short-tempered George Washington. Although, a couple of the scenes do contain minor historical flaws, even the purist cannot question the overall accuracy of the events unfolding. The sets, period costumes, and battle scenes are accurate even if some of the fight sequences are a bit exaggerated. Robert Harmon's direction is tight, and the photography by Rene Ohashi makes you feel that you are actually there. Gary Chang's music is also very effective in setting the mood for this non-epic film.
This movie is not your typical adulterated hollywood production that plays foot-loose with the facts. It stays on it's historical course as it tells the story of a near-miraculous event that was to become the turning-point of the American Revolution.
The Crossing is a must see for anyone who enjoys historically accurate entertainment.",4.0
"I often show ""The Crossing"" to my political science classes and invariably they are enthralled.  It is an intriguing, almost shocking film.  The most striking surprise is that Jeff Daniels pulls off a portrayal of the great Washington with humanism, determinism, unparalleled leadership, mixed with a little testiness and bawdiness - in sum, a man with flaws who took his life and his mission seriously, while winning the loyalty of his rag tag troops.
Washington was somewhat wooden, which Daniels again plays well, because he took every aspect of his life with dead seriousness and a clear vision of the nation he almost single-handedly created.  Present at the creation of the new nation, commander in chief, he rallied his men at the battle of Trenton in December 1776, the subject of this film, avenging his early loss of New York City.
The inaccuracies in the film are of little consequence since its essence is Washington.  His audacious crossing of the treacherous Delaware on Christmas eve in the depth of night, completely surprising battle-hardened, but hung-over Hessians, helped turned the tide of the war at a time when America's victory teetered on disaster.  Daniels creates a man, not a myth, giving him just the right amount of stiffness and caring for his men, and a determination that would win the very long war.
James Kidnie as the Hessian Colonel Rall is the perfect foil to Washington.  As the attack rages, he meticulously dresses himself and then panics at the American onslaught, hardly believing his eyes.  Director Harmon's pacing is plodding at times, but the crossing itself is full of suspense, the battle scenes more than passably exciting.  The cinematography and supporting cast are adequate. But the star of this film is Daniels. In sum, a fine A&E production well worth seeing.",4.0
"When a civl war rages through a country, the line between the good guys and the bad ones is blurred.  Such is the case in Men with Guns.  Both sides in conflict abuse others, even the innocent ones, to secure their goals.",4.0
"Absolutely one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Especially when the 747 drives through the ramp and parking area, skidding around corners, making 'vroom vroom' noises.  Hilarious.  END",4.0

Good entertaining movie. Harrison Ford is not disappointing in this action movie.,4.0
"Old but a classic worth watching.  This movie was made in the days when the plot was thinner and the violence was less gruesome (there's still plenty of killing).  I thought the acting was above average all around and Harrison Ford's was his usual excellent.  A good movie when you want some action with a little plot, but aren't in the mood to see heads getting chopped off and blood  spurting everywhere.",4.0
One of those films you can watch over and over again.,4.0
Harrison Ford as President? You can't beat it.....Great movie,4.0
