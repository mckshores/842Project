Lines too narrow for writing,2.0
"It's a tiny notebook, so I guess it should make sense that the lines inside are super narrow, but I don't write microscopically, and it is annoying to me how closely spaced these lines are.  I use every other line for writing.  Also, the lines are super dark, I'd prefer they were lighter lines.  Anyway, I wish this seller would have put a picture of the insides of the notebooks as one of the photos because then I would've known what I was getting, and likely would've gone elsewhere.  I like the size of the notebooks and the portability.  Plus they are cute.  But the lines bug me and I won't get these again.",2.0
"These notebooks are cute, but definitely overpriced at almost $10 for a pack of 8. I ended up returning them and getting something for a much better value from the dollar store. They do measure slightly under the advertised measurement of 3.5x5, and aren't eligible for free returns.",2.0
"I did not expect it to be so small, difficult to write in
  I should of paid attention to the size if it was stated",2.0
"Good collection of colors, however the scent is fading on most of them. Only a few actually smell ""yummy"" Hahaha.

Also, the gel bleeds on some. Not great quality, I recommend ""GEL BEE"" glitter pens over these.",2.0
"Writes well, colors are pretty and they work nicely. But the smell is super faint, practically non existing.",2.0
"I was excited to get these for my 6 & 11 yr old daughter'sfor their stocking. I got the totally taffy ones. I tested each pen out, and had to go over most letters, and words. One pen out of each pack wrote smooth, and the rest were kind of scratchy. The purple pen is the only pen I could really smell, and it smelled kind of flowery. I did like the smell! I wish I could have smelled them all, tho. Even after writing with them all, I couldn't really tell there were scented pens used on the paper. I tried smelling each pen as I was writing, as well, and there was a tiny, faint something on some, but I couldn't tell what because it was so honestly, so faint. The majority of them felt scratchy when writing. I tried to loosen them up, and scribble some, and there wasn't much change. The 2nd pack seemed a little better, so there's no consistency. You can see the dry marks if you look closely on my pic. I rarely got through a letter, and only 1 or 2 words without blank spots, or having to scribble to losen the ink up. I realyy wanted to love these. They are appealing to the eye, and look cool. I'm sure kid's would still enjoy these, either way. I decided to return mine.",2.0
All of them smell the same and they just smell like pixie stix. The pens don't write very well at all. A lot of the colors barely even show up. I would not recommend these pens to anyone.,2.0
"I have used this brand before and never had the problems that I have had with this set.  The Gel is settled in the barrel pf the pen, and will not come out.  Waste of money and I found the Brand of My Color that is incredible plus over a 100 of pens and refills.  For those that have been using this brand (which was my 3rd set) my advise is to move to My Color set of Gel Pens.  So worth the trouble of reordering.",2.0
"I give these 2 stars only because the smell is not very strong, but the pens themselves color well.",2.0
"As a gel pen, operates fine. I was disappointed as a sample I had that drove me to look for the Yummy Yummy  pen is quite different from the ones I got, altho have the Yummy Yummy name on them.  The sample wrote with a glittery ink, the ones I received  had no glitter to them at all. The glitter is why I ordered the pens.  Now I have new gel pens but NOT glitter pens.",2.0
"They do not smell and I had no idea they were mini pens!!! I think the description SHOULD NOT include ""scented"" but SHOULD include ""MINI""!! Not happy.",2.0
"Pens work, colors are nice. NO SMELL. I bought these for fun and was excited to have ""scented"" pens. Don't know if it's just the quality of product overall or if mine are defective.",2.0
"These looked fun so I bought them to go with a journal for my daughter, but the gel doesn't come out smoothly or enough. You have to write over parts of the letters all the time.",2.0
"The ink skipped too much for it to be usable. I tried every pen in the pack to check if it was just 1 dud pen. Unfortunately not, so I ended up returning it. I don't recall the pens having distinguishable smells. They smelled pleasant to me in general though.",2.0
"These pens don't write well.  They are pretty, but useless.",2.0
the odor was very low. never knew what color you were going to get the color in the pens skipped colors you could be coloring purple and suddenly be in the color orange very frustrating.,2.0
They do not write well at all,2.0
"These pens smell nice and the colors are pretty, but they barely write. I've tried on black and white paper. They skip constantly then pool ink in spots and smudge.",2.0
They are nice but only problem is they don't give you backs to them and ive tried so many backs and they just slide right off and the earing falls out,2.0
"these pens write horribly, they're very skippy and don't show up well on white paper when they do happen to write. the only upside is that they smell pretty good (kind of like fundip?) and write on skin decently. if you're looking for quality pens (though they're not scented) sakura jellyroll pens are pretty great and not much more expensive than these!",2.0
Skips! No Smell!,2.0
They don't have a scent and the ink didn't come out very well.,2.0
"These leak and blob, do not write well at all.",2.0
"These pens are a cute idea; however,  I do not notice the scent and I do not notice the yellow ink when writing it is very hard to see. These pens also didn't take any time at all to leak. I would not purchase them agian.",2.0
"Smells good, but NOT pastel.. They are neon & very bright neon colors.. I been looking for true pastel.. These are not it!!!",2.0
"Not what I expected.  I was expecting those old pastel pens with the color all mixed so as you are writing one word you see 3 or 4 different colors.  These are not like that.  It's more of multiple colors in layers., which doesn't give me the effect I was looking for",2.0
"These are not a very good quality, they do not write smoothly.",2.0
they don't color/write well,2.0
Wouldn't buy these again...,2.0
"Flows easily but gloppy, resulting in too much product. Colors are soft, bordering on dull, which was a surprise because at first I thought they were almost neon.",2.0
"Did not write with a nice smooth flow, the ink skips a lot. The colors are very vibrant and even show up over printed black ink.",2.0
love the ink colors of these pens but there isn't a constant easy flow of ink. I'll be writing and the ink stops and takes a few scribbles for it to start again. Sort of defeats the purpose of a pen.,2.0
"The color is great, they write smooth but the whole point is that they were supposed to smell and they don't smell. the scents that do smell don't smell like anything but ink.",2.0
These pens are rainbow pens with sectioned ink. I was hoping to get a marble effect upon writing but there was no such effect. I could not smell anything either. Overall just average pens.,2.0
"I got these for my daughter-s Easter basket. I was very dissapointed with the product. When my daughter opened them.she liked the colors but they were not yummy thats for sure,my daughter said they yucky scented. It smelled like rotten apples . I don't think its right to excite kids because the pics said they were supposed to smell like fruits.",2.0
"These notebooks look really beautiful and they seem really well made - until they fall apart. This notebook didn't last very long in my backpack before ""decomposing"".",2.0
"I bought this ""composition"" book to log problems with my boat and make notes, etc. Thinking that it was a real composition book with the wood cover photo and it being made from with the enviroent in mind.

The item arrived with little to no packaging and got slightly bent during transit.

The back black binding is just tape that already fraying and starting to fall/peel off.

The corners of book are ""Rounded"" It looks like someone did this with a pair of dull scissors by hand. Looks very choppy and home made.

The book is twined together with string. The string goes straight down the spine in the middle of the book. Making it so the book does not close properly leaving the top half pages floating above the bottom half leaving a giant gap.

The top of the book where the paper was cut is at a slant and frayed looking due to being made with poor equipment.

I do not trust this item to hold the important info I was going to put into it. I would be surprised if the pages started falling out in a couple months or less.

Not happy with this product.",2.0
"Another journey into the Kim Jacob's world of sweet, cozy, fantasy.  The pictures are as charming and girly as always(though some are repeats from earlier calendars).  But the low quality is shocking.  Unlike other Cobblestone calendars this one is printed on cheap, thin paper.  I'll be surprized if it lasts the whole year without tearing or curling up.  Overall, overpriced.",2.0
"My tween daughter adores dragons so I purchased this for her for Christmas. I was dismayed when it arrived to see that some of the pictures were not appropriate for children. I am not too prudish, but one month features a topless woman, and I am not comfortable with the other suggestively drawn women for my impressionable preadolescent daughter. I tried to look closely at the provided images before I purchased it, but the images are too small to see these details, so I am posting this as a heads up for any other parent of a dragon lover. I was disappointed because the art is truly beautiful and vibrant; the dragons are stunning.",2.0
"Very disappointed with the quality and variety of images. Taken from what I can only assume is a mixture of concept art and display art, there are so few of my favourite characters present. There is one I don't recognise at all! The calendar certainly doesn't live up to the epic promise of its cover art. Not even certain I will bother putting it up on my wall.",2.0
Not as lovely as I expected,2.0
"I would have given more stars, but so many of the pages were stuck together.  When I tried to pull them apart, to get to the next week, they ripped and some even ripped off the spiral binding.",2.0
I was super excited to get this calendar because I needed to order a new one for work. I made sure beforehand to order one that was advertised specifically for 16 months. Since I need to use this everyday at work it's imperative that I can write things down on each day. Instead the four remaining months of 2014 are placed on one half of a page! I was furious. It's a great calendar for one year however I think it was falsely advertised and will not buy this again.,2.0
love the pictures disappointed with the quality very flimsy pages,2.0
"I have used engagement calendars since 1992 and I don't think I've ever seen a poorer-quality engagement calendar.  Upon my first inspection when opening it to look at it, I found many pages glued together and that ripped off the metal spiral when I tried to unglue them (trying to be as delicate as possible so as not to damage them).  No matter how careful I was, some pages are now half-ripped off the spiral.  This alone is enough for me to get rid of this cheap piece of rubbish and get a decent-quality one.

Although not a deal-breaker, the photos are ho-hum.  They appear faded and many are out-of-focus.  I don't know if this is a byproduct of the publishing process, or whether the originals are as lifeless.  Mind, I can't stand over-saturated over-Photoshopped kitsch so my saying this actually says a lot.

EDIT:  Upon my complaint, the publisher was very quick to apologize and sent me a new copy.  The pages were not glued together or ripped on the new copy.  So the customer service definitely gets kudos.",2.0
"Needs more photo variety. I was hoping there would have been a month with just maggie on it, but they put her in a photo hugging glenn, and that's it. Rick and Daryl get like 2-3 months each to themselves. I need me some more maggs in my life..",2.0
"Nice graphics, just hoped it would've had some inside facts/trivia or something more about the show or its history",2.0
"This book contains much useless information-birthdays, seating plan suggestions,map of school, sub info page, student roster page (not needed since the names are entered for grade & personal info is in office and accessible on computer-personal student info should not be accessible to anyone walking by & able to look at planner on teacher's desk) and tiny monthly calendars. I like having monthly calendars, but these are ridiculously small, with little room to write anything, including the tiny ""Notes"" column. The seating suggestions are pointless-if one cannot figure out basic seating plans, teaching is the wrong profession. Schools all have maps and this inclusion is just stupid. I think Teacher Created Resources was better when it was Materials and this planner/grade book is an example. I wondered why there was not a photo  of the inside of the planner but since I looked at it, I don't. The left column of the planner is a Notes column. This type of column is usually on the right, after the days of the week. I will have to write class times in this column because there isn't another place to do so. Using hyphenated lines (some call them dash lines) in place of solid, bold-faced lines to distinguish between periods is more stupidity. It is very difficult to take a quick look & distinguish the separation. I will have to use a Sharpie to fix this. The grading chart is odd. As many states use CCSS I expected a 1-4 chart to reflect this. The way the chart in this book is set up is awkward and not user-friendly, like most. The only positives of this item are: It is spiral bound, the days of the week for the planner are listed across the top of the double-page spread and the cover is cute. I would not buy this again. It is unlikely I will buy from this company (Teacher Created Resources) again.",2.0
"Just rec'd calendar.  While pictures are great I found the months of Feb and March have misprints which makes the dates and days of week not correct.  Each of these months are showing 2 days each for the 7th which dates and days of the week do not ""line up"". Whoever printed these calendars should have proof read them!  Hopefully this problem will be corrected. I am sure my copy was not the only one!",2.0
"I love MJ so I want everything that says MJ! However, as beautiful as this calendar is, the dates are incorrect for some months! I would like a replacement calender because this is not what I paid for. If I wanted a calendar with incorrect dates, I could have done that myself! Who do I need to speak to about this!? Buyers, ask questions before purchasing. This error threw off my entire week!",2.0
The information was of some use but most of this info is presented during exams anyhow.,2.0
"I honestly was not a fan of this quick study.  I found it to have multiple formulas that I did not need in my masters program and it lacked the simple equations I had forgotten.  I kept this equation packet out throughout my class, but do not think I used it more than one the entire semester.  I hoped it would simplify the class, but instead it had too much information that I did not need and the textbook ended up being easier.",2.0
not what I expected. Hard to read,2.0
"I ordered this calendar after having read the description carefully.  Instead of the 11 x 12 calendar in the description, I received a much smaller calendar that is 6.5"" x 7.125"" when closed.  This does not even allow for the plausible explanation that the description was in centimeters.  The description is just wrong.  Buy this product if you are looking for a calendar that can fit in the palm of your hand.",2.0
The type of paper used makes it exceedingly difficult to write on.  Not at all like the paper used 2 yrs ago-which is why I purchased it!,2.0
Always go here for journals!,2.0
Good quality but not the one i ordered!  Let down!,2.0
"While this is a gorgeous planner, it does not open and lay flat, which made it not useful for my needs- I can't use a planner that is constantly closing and has to be held open",2.0
"I live the idea and content, but when I received it the stitching was already starting to come apart.  The content was fantastic, only issue was the stitching",2.0
"Pages are VERY, VERY, thin. Impossible to use any type of marker, can see outline of pen if you write hard. Also not as pretty in real life as on screen. Will be purchasing a new planner.",2.0
"I thought this was going to be photos, but it's artist renderings instead.  Disappointed. :(",2.0
"The calendar doesn't have the normal calendar type of display where you can write in birthdays and appointments.  The days are written from top to bottom in a list on the left side of each month.  And the months are printed duplex on a page, so there isn't even the ability to flip forward or back a month without taking the calendar completely down.  This is fine for the pictures, but useless as a calendar.  No wonder there aren't any pictures of the calendar on the Amazon site.  If you knew what it was like inside, you'd never get it.",2.0
"This is really not a very good calendar. There is no grid to write on. It just list the days of the month next to the picture. So if you are looking for a calendar to keep track of appointments, schedules and so forth, this is not the one you want to get. Very disappointed.",2.0
Not up to par for the franchise.,2.0
No room to write stuff on it. Great art.... but not useful as a calendar at all,2.0
"I like the pictures very much, however I really wish the description for the calender had said it was in Spanish.  Can't read any of the months or anything else written on the calendar. The only clue is that it is sold by Trends International.  Oh well, it is a great looking calendar. My daughter opened to make sure it was all Spanish so we will keep it. Now we are going to see who notices it is in Spanish.",2.0
"Just got ours today. Yes, it's in Spanish. At least my son is taking spanish and figures it will help him out in school.",2.0
Not so great! it looks really impressive online but i was very disappointed when it arrived. One of the magnetic clasps is loose and the cover is not as antique as it seems.,2.0
"This is a lovely planner with many features that are not found in similar products. Unfortunately, those features make this planner extra thick. The description uses the word ""slim"" over and over again. I don't consider a hardcover book that is just shy of one inch thick to be slim. The weight and bulk makes it unsuitable to carry in a purse or tote bag.",2.0
"This is very gorgeous, but the closure does not hold up the way the other type of paperblanks planner does.  I have used these same planners every year for 5+ years and they usually have a closure that is more like a strap rather than the flap on this one (both are magnetic).  I got this one for 2013 and it was the first year the closure wore down and broke off entirely after about 6 mos.",2.0
"Well I found this journal on Amazon by searching under the category of ""Leather bound Journals.""  This one pops up in the top 3 under that listing. It looks like a beautifuly crafted black leather book with amazing texture, metal studs and gold trim.  I am very disappointed to find after recieving it, that it has a cardboard cover with a cheap textured paper picture of the book I thought I had purchased on it.  For $66 after shipping and handeling it is not worth it.  Also after recieving the book you find out that the book is actually green.  Not black as the picture depicts. BOOOOOO!!!  BOOOOOO!!",2.0
"The paper is way to thin!  I love these planners normally, but the paper in this one is too thin so ink will leak through as well as highlighter.  :(",2.0
not what I expected,2.0
"Probably Amazon's fault rather than the mfgr or seller, but this one was lumped in with the larger sized ones.  Be warned.  IT'S TINY.",2.0
"According to my boyfriend, they felt fine, but they stopped working within 2 weeks.",2.0
"I had a similar Paperblanks planner for 2013, and when this 2014 arrived, I was a little disappointed. The horizontal set up is great with lots of room to write for a little planner, but the design on the front was a little crooked on mine. Not as cute as it looks online.",2.0
Not a smooth cut,2.0
Cheaply made covers.  Buttons have popped off two of our bottle covers in just two weeks.  Cheap price still didn't make it worth the purchase.,2.0
Nah!,2.0
What a deal... Couldn't ask for any better. Highly recommended for an everyday water bottle. Good for coffee in the morning and water for the rest of the day.,2.0
"Bike Parka Cover did not fit my Navigator TREK Bike as promised;  was too tright across the 27"" handlebars, not as advertized",2.0
clasp was broken when I received it,2.0
"I was so disappointed!  It couldn't be replaced, so I will have to keep looking for a different brand of book.",2.0
"It's a nice size bookmark. It looks exactly like the picture, with added silver detailing, which is nice.
My problem with this, is its VERY cheaply made: the bead on it looks crappy. It's made out of thick paper, so if it were to get wet it would be useless, and it bends super easly.
Mine was poorly packaged and had a big bend marking on it, and that part of it is always slightly crooked.
It is definitely not worth nearly $3.00",2.0
Very small.,2.0
"Broken lead, broken lead, broken lead.",2.0
"Bottom line: book darts are orders of magnitude better than these.  They are thin and inconspicuous, don't affect or weigh down your pages, stay in place, are cheaper, and you can use any number of them... they are in fact better than anything that serves as a bookmark that I've seen. I just wanted to get these to check them out. Only give this 2 stars because it's a cool idea... but they are a waste compared to book darts. There is no way the higher reviewers of this product have used book darts, they would think the same (unless they just think it's cool, in and of itself - you have to compare, everything is relative after all).

Look up ""Book Darts"" in amazon:

"I looked forward to receiving this set of bookmarks, but they disappointed me.  They are too insubstantial to be effective.  They are really just a nuisance, and I'll donate them somewhere.",2.0
"This is an example of a good idea that has been poorly executed.  You should be able to move these bookmarks easily from one spot in the book to another, but you can't.  Because the front and back of the clip are the same shape, it is hard to separate the two magnetic sides.  All they had to do was have the two sides not completely overlap. A better solution would be to have the two sides cross as is done with hair clips, so the device opens when you squeeze the part protruding from the book.  Also the material is too thick so the clip is on the heavy side, and will deform the pages it is near if left in the book for a long time..

For years I have marked my exact place in a book by adding a line to a paper bookmark.  I will go back to that.",2.0
"so small, had to send back :(",2.0
"Quality leaves little to the imagination. It says bookmarks on the description, but these are acutally small page markers. When I bought these I was assuming they would be bigger!",2.0
not funny,2.0
"Bought this as a gift. I was hoping for some really funny qoutes, but mostly left with a dumbfounded look like ""Either I don't get the joke or its just not funny at all"". Some of the qoutes don't make any sense at all. I won't be purchasing this again",2.0
I ordered three of these calendars. Have been buying them for years. This year one of them had the first 6 days missing! I don't know how hard quality control is but it was embarrassing as I gave this as a gift to someone in Italy and it is kind of hard to return it from there!  We will have to scan the first six days from our calendar. I hope that this never happens again.,2.0
"The calendar is great! The actual comic strips are wonderful. However, the product arrived in a crumbled box and the calendar was ripped in half. I'm sure I could have sent it back to Amazon for an undamaged product, but I didn't want to bother with the hassle. I can still read the strips.",2.0
"I love Pearls Before Swine and I always order this calendar but this year---after I'd tossed all the packaging---I noticed that this calendar begins in July 2015, runs through the end of the year and then does it again.  So I have two calendars from July through December and I have no packaging to return it and no idea of what happens January through June.  I know it's a printing issue and not about the Pearls but it's very disappointing to receive this kind of quality.  Teaches me a good lesson about throwing away packaging before thoroughly examining a product so not a total loss I guess.",2.0
About 1 funny one a week at best.,2.0
"Wayy too cheesy.  Every year we order a new calendar for the office as a little perk up each morning.  The jokes are roughly in the realm of dad jokes, if not worse.  ""The Colby Cheese says he's very fondue of you""
Out of 25 people, only 1 person found the jokes funny.  The rest of us simply read and say ""I understand, but it's not that funny""",2.0
Was crunched in corner when it arrived,2.0
"Cute item, but when I received it, the book seemed ""warped"" and cheaply put together",2.0
"it's flimsy and I can't see it lasting all the way through high school like it is supposed to. I thought it was only through 5th grade which is what I want, but I was wrong. I'll be looking for something else.",2.0
"Sorry to say it arrived damaged, so I really did not get the advantage of using it.",2.0
"We have been looking for a new address book for some time and couldn't find one that was comparable to the one we were replacing.
So when I saw a Susan Branch book I thought this would be the one.  (We love her crafting line of stickers, etc.)The book size was much smaller than I expected and I was hoping for a much better paper quality of the pages for what I paid for.
Not sure if we will keep this book or not.",2.0
"I loved this calendar last year when I bought it for my desk for the first time, so I was really looking forward to this year's calendar, too. Unfortunately, (and already so early in the year), I find that many of the student answers are exact repeats from last year's calendar that have been recycled over to this year. I am very disappointed. I won't be ordering this calendar again next year because it will likely be recycled student work all over again then, too.",2.0
Looked through desk-top calendar.  There is Not enough humor for the price.,2.0
Not the greatest choice of words for the alphabet. It's hard for my 2 year old to guess the word based on the picture and letter since he can't read yet.,2.0
"Pretty thin board book. I thought it would be Minnie showing the colors, but it's all the Clubhouse characters. I was looking for more Minnie for my LO.",2.0
Very flimsy book.  The front cover is coming apart right out of the box.  It's very thin and there isn't a story just the letters with pictures next to them.  Not sure it'll help my little one learn the letters that don't have pictures she likes next to them but it's too much trouble to return.,2.0
"I rented the Kindle version for a class and IT'S MISSING THREE PAGES (67-69). It says that section cannot be made available in digital format due to copyright issues. I am supposed to read those pages for class and now I cannot. If this issue had been posted in the description, I would have rented the print format instead, but in fact the Kindle version is titled ""Print Replica"". This will certainly discourage me from future Kindle purchases.",2.0
"Its a good book , but i got it damaged like if at certain point during the shipping got wet.. /i didn't returned bc i really needed that book for class.",2.0
"I gave this product two stars because it might fit someone's purposes.  However I would not recommend.  Each day has one page and two lines per subject (maybe 10 subjects in all).  Not enough space to plan, make notes, or really hash anything out - perhaps only to reference activities you want to try that are explained in further detail elsewhere.",2.0
Not too good for just one or two children. There's entirely too much going on with it.,2.0
"tedious to use, and not enough space to really make meaningful notes",2.0
nothing special,2.0
I need more space and more pages for events and other information.,2.0
This is very plain.  Next time I will order a journal with more detail inside.  All the pages are the same and ideal for someone else besides homeschool instructors.,2.0
This isn't the newest calendar and the pics are old. Was sad to see it wasn't their new calendar .,2.0
returned.  letters not as big as I needed.,2.0
not that big,2.0
I didn't read the fine print. 7 x 7 was not what I wanted,2.0
The print wasn't big enough like I needed for my grandma. But has beautiful pictures!,2.0
Still not what I needed.,2.0
"The product description is misleading... this planner is undated, not 2018 planner.",2.0
We love this calendar series...hung them in the guest bathroom for years; however did not enjoy a $9.97 sticker affixed to a calendar for which I paid $15. C'mon man!,2.0
"Incredibly disappointed in this planner! I'm only about 2 months in, and the binding has completely fallen apart (see image). Granted, I use it every day, but it is a daily planner, so it should withstand such use. I have not abused it - haven't used it in any manner other than it is intended and it mostly sits on my desk, though I have occasionally traveled with it.

Additionally, the front pocket is coming unglued, so I feel as though the whole planner is about the fall apart on me. This planner is intended to be used for at least six months and I know already it will never last that long.

There are features about it I do like, such as the multiple bookmarks and thoughtful layout of the daily pages (not as crazy about the weekly planning section). However, because of its poor quality, I cannot recommend this planner.",2.0
"This planner is only 6 months long. Had that been clear, I wouldn't have purchased it. I lost my initial planner and was so excited with this one arrived. I was so disappointed when I began to fill out the pages and learned that it is only 6 months long, meaning I can't plan out a complete year. Who does this? What a waste of time!",2.0
"The quality is good. But I don't like the way it's organized: all the month pages are together, as are the week pages and the days. It's basically like they are in their own chapters, which means that I have to do a lot more flipping around to what I need to do. This is not a great layout. I hope that the company creates a book that's organized in a different way.",2.0
"FOR THE ALREADY ORGANIZED, this organizer must be wonderful.  Not for me, though I do admire it,
A caveat, folks:  Its name is Organizer, but it won't do that for us.  Buy a little spiral bound notebook.",2.0
"Great format! Found it very intuitive, gets the job done with just the right level of detail without all the fluff and distractions.

HOWEVER, the book has started to separate from the cover!!! I sure hope it lasts as Ive been using it less than a week.",2.0
Way too bulky,2.0
Nice organizer but only covers 6/7 months and not a whole year..didnt figure this out until I filled this out so now I cant return it.  Very disappointed.,2.0
"I hate to go against all these raving reviews!  For those people that like it, Great!  However it does not work for me!  I don't like the isolation of Weekly, Monthly, Daily etc.!  I want each day to have all of the options available daily!  Just my thoughts, your experience will most likely be the same as all those that have rated it so well!",2.0
"I wanted to LOVE this planner. It has monthly, weekly and daily and its great.  BUT, its 7th months. NOW... did I read, probably not.
But its not even long enough to cover an academic year. Its odd to have a 6/7 month calander and I don't want to carry 2.",2.0
"This planner actually makes no sense.

Part 1 ""Monthly"": 7 months worth of calendars to fill in.

Part 2 ""Weekly"": 23 weeks worth of weekly plan/goal pages.

Part 3: ""Daily"": 150+ daily pages.

So you'll eventually run out of months, then weeks and be left only able to use the day section?

Quality is nothing special. The cover was bent on arrival in the upper right corner, and you can only use a regular pen on the pages or it bleeds through (ex. no sharpie pen, or ball point or gel pens).

It has potential but... the parts make no sense. They should be equal (ex. 6 months of calendars, with enough corresponding week and day pages)",2.0
"It's okay.  As mentioned in the other reviews, it does have a lot of space for writing on each day of the week.  BUT, I really need each month in a two page spread before the individual weeks begin.  I do like the pocket in the front.  Again, it's okay, but it just doesn't work for my brain.  I need a summary of the month, a place to scratch out the month as appointments come up.  I can't see ahead in this planner without flipping through a bunch of pages.  A  planner without the month in view with boxes?  Doesn't work for me.",2.0
"It was probably my fault but I was very disappointed in this planner. Every year I order the Mom's Plan-It Planner but there was a misprint and the description added the word deluxe (which meant it was the big planner). This one is very small.

These things are HUGE!!  They are about 20-36 inches.  We bought them for a pocket organizer hook replacement and they are awful for that unless you want your pocket organizer to hover about an inch above ground.  I'll post an update or answer a question if anyone wants the exact dimensions which the post SHOULD have.  Plus they are freaking expensive for the price.,2.0
"This wasn't really what I was expecting. Two big drawbacks to this item are 1) the little schedule pieces come in sheets and you have to cut them apart. No perforation, they have to be cut. And 2) I expected the plastic to be pockets. They aren't. It's little plastics strips that hold the bottom and the top of the schedule pieces, but don't cover the whole thing. The downside to this is twofold. First, they fall out pretty easily, especially when you are trying to move or hang it. Secondly, because the sheets aren't totally covered, my kiddo can touch them and smear them. Not the best made/most well thought out thing I've ever purchased, but it will do for now. :/",2.0

I like the heavier weight, I bought this because the previous reviews said they were comparable to moleskin and they are NOT.

"From the photos I expected different but still functional clips in an easy to get at container. The container ITSELF is good, but the circular paper clips are lacking.

2 of the 106 were made from creased metal that snapped when trying to slide them over the 4 pages.  So 104 usable out of 125...

The clips were mostly entangled and took a long time to get them apart to use them.  They also had oxidized so they left a black mark on all my white pages when attached.  Not cool.  The edges are square not rounded, so they leave some definite impressions on the paper.

I've used spiral clips in the past, but these were inferior in so many ways.  I wouldn't buy them again and I don't recommend them.",2.0
"These are a great idea, but the execution sucks. These look great, but when you start to peel them off they leave a residue on the sheet beneath. Sometimes they don't take ink well. And the notes come in one big block; you don't get five separate pads.  It seems like 3M is the only company that knows how to make sticky notes that work. Given the price of these, you'd think the people at Cavallini could afford to buy high quality blank note pads from 3M and then put their images on them.",2.0

"I usually use the Lakeshore planner but I got this one because my grade level team uses it.  I dislike that there is no monthly overview before the actual lesson planning pages. There is, however, a ""Year at a Glance"" page but it is in the front of the book with the useless pages about measurement and states and capitals. There is a large pencil printed on each planner page that is filled with teacher tips and suggestions.  I wish that the pencil was blank so that I may jot down a ""To Do"" list or other quick lists.  I can't imagine (with Pinterest in existence) that teachers will actually read or use those suggestions. I would not purchase this planner again.  Again, I only purchased it for consistency purposes when planning with my grade level.

Also, the cover had a large scratch across the front (like someone cut it when opening a package) when it arrived.  There are also small scratches dotting the cover as well. At first I thought it was part of the design but they are actually spots of ripped paper.  I understand that the cover will get banged up in time but it would've been nice to receive an undamaged planner.  (I'm sure other teachers know the feeling of getting fresh, new supplies.) I would return it for a new one but I need to start my planning for the upcoming school year.",2.0

I took a chance on these, since I've been having some hand pain and thought something to help keep the pages open would be helpful.  These are too small and flimsy to work well, and usually just end up causing more hassle than necessary.  I tried with with several books and they only seem to work with lightweight ones and if you're more toward the middle than the start.  Otherwise, it's not able to hold back the pages enough to bother trying to get it situated.  As a note, the colors I received were different than the photo: blue, purple, and clear.",2.0

"They're a bit thin. I get the feeling that the plastic isn't the highest quality or the strongest. One was broken in the package. Also the ones I received were blue, clear, and pink, not the colors shown in the picture, so if color is one of the deciding factors, be wary, they're not guaranteed.

Don't get me wrong, they do in fact work, hence the two stars. At least, for paperbacks. Large, thick, hardcover books are more unwieldy. The page holding tabs are just too narrow and weak. Not worth the price at all, especially after S&H.

If you are looking for a thumb ring page holder, I would suggest passing off anything like these thin plastic things and get yourself one of the thicker wooden versions. I wish had. And I will be in the future because I'll be replacing these.",2.0

"This is a beautiful binder that comes with lined recipe pages and categorized divider pages as well as some very useful conversion charts. The divider pages have pockets that allow one to tuck in clipped or loose recipes. If you run out of the recipe pages, you can download a pdf file to print your own, so you never have to worry about running out of matching pages!

Although this is a gorgeous looking set, I find it more useful for a new cook or a new bride that doesn't have a huge collection of recipes yet. For the seasoned cook, I'm not sure it would be as useful with the limited space for pockets. However, if one added page protectors or other types of pockets to the system, it could be more useful, but not nearly as attractive.

This would be a great item to give to a daughter or other girl who is collecting family favorites for when she leaves home. Give it to the new bride as a welcome to the family gift with family recipes to start her on her way or give it blank to let her decide what favorites to add.

All-in-all, I see this mostly as a gift for a younger person starting out and more of a ""meh"" item for the more seasoned cook.",3.0
"I use this binder to keep track of all the recipes I print online and it's a much more attractive option than my prevoius but functional black standard binder. I like the category dividers, they really helped me be better organized, and the label on the spine (Recipe Organizer) makes it easy to tell what's in it if you have a lot of binders, which I tend to do. I give it 3 stars because mine arrived damaged, though perhaps some would consider that to be more the fault of the way it was shipped than the product itself, but I thought it was worth noting. I like it, but if it was made from plastic instead of cardboard I think it would hold up a lot better and for me something that I use so often needs to be more durable.",3.0
"This recipe box is very nice.  Unfortunately, it was not as deep as the recipe boxes you see in stores.  I was very unhappy about that and was ready to return it.

"This recipe binder is very pretty to look at, it's broken into useful segments, and the blank recipe pages are nicely designed with segments for ingredient lists, directions/notes, serving amount, and prep time.  Each segment's tabbed divider also has a pocket to store recipes that are not transcribed.  The inner covers have useful information regarding measurements and recipe equivalents.

My problem with it is that it is just too large to be useful on the counter when cooking or baking.  It is a basically a large 3-ring binder and I don't have enough free counter space when cooking or baking in my small kitchen to have a place for it.  I happen to have a similar type of recipe binder that I transcribed my mother's recipes into, but it is one third of the size of this V&A William Morris Recipe Binder, and that is just large enough.

This would be nice as a gift for a bridal shower or as a gift of treasured family recipes to someone moving out on their own, if you want to spend the time transcribing your recipes into it.  I would imagine that recipes could be printed out on letter-sized paper and just included in the binder via the use of a three-holed punch, since there's no template included to set up printing options to conform to the format of the blank pages included with the binder.",3.0
"This is a very attractive binder for organizing recipes. The binder is sturdy and thick with a good, strong, set of rings that would hold up well under moderate use. The colors are bold and attractive, and the prints vibrant and exciting. The binder itself is organized into eight colorful sections separated by pocket dividers (Fruits & Vegetables, Breads & Pasta, Meats & Poultry, etc.) Each section has a different colored William Morris print, so you can visually tell the sections apart at a glance. Recipes can be three hole punched, tucked into the binder pockets, or copied onto recipe sheets that match the colors of the binder pockets (5 sheets per category, 3 recipes per sheet). Sheet protectors would be a useful addition to this binder to keep printed pages clean and accessible. The front and back covers have helpful information like metric equivalents, a roasting chart, and oven temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius.

This is a nice binder, and probably would be useful for someone far neater and more organized than I am. I am no Martha Stewart, and my kitchen is a busy, messy place where my children are as likely to be cooking as I am. To me, this binder is attractive, but basically useless. Firstly, as most of my recipes are printed off the internet, I would get little use out of the printed sheets. Even my old family recipes have been typed, and other recipes remain in the annotated cook books I got them from. I don't have the patience to hand copy recipes, and I prefer to type because my handwriting is messy. The binder has a fairly durable cover, and is treated so as to be water resistant, but I suspect that in MY kitchen, at least, this binder would quickly get dirty from spills. In addition, I question the utility of a three-ring-binder for long term use. Although I have not tested this one extensively, I generally can count on a year of use from a high quality school binder in daily use. Since this won't get nearly the same level of wear and tear, then perhaps I could get a few years before the binder stops smoothly opening and closing, gets caught, or the cover becomes overly damaged. I doubt this would survive long enough to be passed on down to my children. The binder is also stiff, and inflexible, and doesn't fully close so all my recipes are constantly slipping sideways or to the bottom. I can't easily put the binder on its side either because it is so bulky it takes up a lot of space on my counter, and does not fit easily into my cabinets. In addition to the pointless recipie cards, the pre-printed recipie sections are more or less useless to me. They would have been better off allowing us to customize the dividers ourselves. An entire section dedicated to beverages? Really? And breads combined with pasta when most of my recipies involve either breads or pastas? Clearly this binder is way too fancy for my kind of cooking.

I am not sure this binder, as attractive as it is, warrants a cost of $22. The recipe cards are useless to me, and although the charts in the cover are useful, I could print my own. Also, the recipie subdivisions don't match the way I actually cook. So really what we are looking at is a very expensive, albeit beautiful, binder. I suspect I could find a pretty binder, with a plastic cover, far cheaper than this one. Then I could purchase my own dividers and make the system more appropriate to my cooking style. All in all, I'd pass on this one.",3.0
"I found this recipe binder to be okay. It has various tabbed sections where you could organize your recipes into different categories and is very pleasing to the eye. The only problem is that you have to use the blank inserts provided (or go online and print out additional copies) to manually write your recipes. This isn't necessarily a huge problem because I can just three-hole punch my printed recipes and organize them in the folder. However, it would have been nice if you could alter the document available online if you wished.",3.0
"I received the V&A William Morris Recipe Binder for an honest review. Heres my take on it.

The binder is attractively designed in a William Morris floral print, lime green and two shades of teal on a white background.. Similar matching floral prints adorn the eight pocket dividers categorized as Fruits and Vegetables, Breads and Pasta, Eggs and dairy, Soups and Salads, Meats and Poultry, Fish and Seafood, Desserts, and Beverages. In addition to each section, there are four additional double-sided pages in a heavy weight paper for handwritten recipes (two on the front, one on the back). The binder and prints are lovely and would make a delightful gift for family members with favorite recipes included. However, the binder has limitations for my recipe collection, namely, I do not file my recipes under these headings and theres no section for sauces and marinades or pickles and preserves. I have added additional tabbed sheets for these. Also, the binder is constructed of heavy cardboard that is not impervious to spatters that stain so will need to be stored and used away from the cooking area.

These shortcomings are overcome-able, but the three ring section that holds the recipe pages is flawed in that theres no tab at the top or bottom to assist in opening the rings to insert more paper. It can only be done with brute force, something difficult for someone with arthritic fingers.

I like the binder idea and wanted to like it more, but these items make it hard to use and not very practical. What I like are the four conversion charts in the inside cover and the oven roasting and temperature charts on the inside back. So, while not as useful for my purposes as Id like, it still would make a cherished and thoughtful gift.",3.0
Not totally what I was looking for but totally nice and acceptable,3.0
"I keep decades of recipes in an old manila folder, or tucked into the pages of cookbooks, or stuffed into a drawer in my kitchen.  It's always a challenge to find the ones I need.  So I figured the V&A William Morris Recipe Binder would be a wonderful way to organize my recipes and store them together in one convenient place.

The binder itself is very attractive, larger than I expected, and very sturdy.  It's basically a three-ring binder with a heavy cardboard cover and eight pocketed dividers organized by type of recipe (i.e. ""Fruits & Vegetables,"" ""Breads & Pasta,"" ""Meats & Poultry,"" etc.).  Recipes can be tucked into the binder pockets or copied onto pre-printed recipe sheets (each of the eight categories includes five of these sheets, printed front and back - each sheet actually provides space for three recipes, one on the front and two on the back).  Inside the front cover of the binder are charts showing ""Food Equivalents,"" ""Liquid Measures,"" and ""Dry Measures"" (showing metric conversions).  Inside the back cover is a ""Roasting Chart,"" and another showing oven temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius.  The William Morris floral patterns used for the cover and the dividers are lovely.

But is this a convenient way to organize recipes?  Maybe.  The majority of my recipes have been scribbled on pieces of notebook paper, printed from the Internet, or clipped from magazines (some as long ago as forty years!).  I could certainly copy these disintegrating recipes onto the pre-printed recipe sheets in the binder, but I'd like it better if I could type them out, save them, and then print them (the sheets are not formatted in a way that would make this work).  What I plan to do is ignore the pre-printed sheets and just print my recipes out on standard paper, which I can then hole-punch and place into the binder.  But that means a big part of this binder system isn't being used as it was intended.  Please note:  a PDF version of the insert pages is available free of charge from Galison.com, so you can print out unlimited pages; had this not been a PDF file, it would have been possible to type recipes directly into the template, and then print them.  Since it's a PDF file, however, that's not possible.

Basically, this is a fancy-looking three-ring binder with pretty dividers and pre-printed recipe sheets that aren't really necessary.  For less than half the price you could buy a binder and some pocketed dividers, and then set up your own system.  Now that I have this, I will use it.  But I probably wouldn't have purchased it on my own.  It's definitely pretty.  It's just not as practical as it could have been.

UPDATE 1/20/2014:  After working with this a bit, I've found that the categories listed on the dividers don't work all that well for the recipes I collect.  I have a lot of recipes for sauces and marinades, for example, and there is no divider for that.  Additionally, there's no place to put rice dishes or snacks/appetizers.

I was in the market for a new recipe holder so when I saw this one using William Morris' artwork I got it.  It is well made but I find that it isn't really deep enough for someone with recipes from over 40 years of marriage. My own fault for not measuring my previous broken box. I had to really edit my file cards in order to fit them into this new box.  Maybe there are larger boxes out there but after my editing I am content for now with this one.  It is attractive and goes with my kitchen colors and I was able to get it fast with Prime. But perhaps it would make a better wedding or shower gift.,3.0

"Note: This review is for the *Kindle* version of the 2012 Peanuts daily calendar.

The 2012 Peanuts daily calendar features a cartoon strip for each day of the working week and then combines Saturday and Sunday on one page with one cartoon.  So you end up with six strips per week.  I'm not sure how they picked the strips, although it does seem as though they were from the same time period as several ""plots"" are followed over the course of January.  The featured strips are amusing and often quite thoughtful.

The only problem is the formatting for the Kindle.  I own a Kindle Keyboard and a Kindle Fire, and the calendar is a vastly different experience on the two instruments.  The strips do not work well for the Kindle Keyboard's black and white format.  The result is rather drab, depressing, and difficult to read even when one uses the zoom function.  The calendar works much better on the Kindle Fire.  Using the zoom function, the strip ends up at least 1/3 larger than before, which in the color format is quite nice.  The font ends up a tiny bit fuzzy but basically readable.  In both formats, you can take notes on the calendar pages, so one could record meetings, holidays, or important tasks to be completed.

For the Kindle Keyboard, I give it 2 stars and suggest skipping this calendar; hard core Peanuts fans should consider the calendar in another format.  For the Kindle Fire, I give it 4 stars with the caveat that the strips are still imperfectly formatted.",3.0
"I've been getting this calendar for some years, and came to enjoy it even more about 5 years ago when I left my office to take a job in a cubicle farm.  Before this calendar I had alternated each year between different calendars such as The Far Side and whatever was the big movie of the previous.  Once this one landed on my desk, it quickly locked me in to wanting another each subsequent year.  Maybe it was the uncanny similarity between the pointy-hair boss and my real life boss, or maybe it was the spot on parody of situations too silly to happen in real life and yet they've somehow happened to me and to you (admit it!).

And besides the ongoing assortment of brilliant office parody which never seems to run out of great material, somehow this calendar continues to introduce improvements year after year after year, even when that year I wonder whether all possible improvements have been made and this is roughly what we'll get next year, only with a new assortment of funny.  But look at what's offered:

<< list of improvements deleted as pretty much all of these have been removed from 2011!!!! >>

***** EDIT FOR 2011 EDITION *****

For whatever reason, the Daily Extra was removed with the 2011 edition.  I'm so disappointed.  This was a fantastic addition to 2010, and each day I looked forward to seeing what was on the flip side of the page.  The Sudoku puzzles were a nice thing to do during a break, and the other puzzles and quotes were delightful.  Hopefully this will make it back into the 2012 edition.

ADD'l edit for 2011:  I just noticed that the Saturday and Sunday pages have been combined into a single weekday-derived 3 panel
cartoon and that there are no longer any of the longer Sunday cartoons that graced the calendar last year.  I'm terribly missing reading those longer weekend cartoons on Monday morning as a sort of consolation for having to deal with Monday morning.  Is this a cost-cutting measure, with 52 pages eliminated from the calendar?  If so, why not just go with the longer Sunday cartoon on the combined weekend page instead of the shorter Saturday one?  I'm not especially pleased with any of the 2011 changes.  If I didn't enjoy the cartoons so much, I'd consider going with a different calendar next year.  I may yet, in fact.  And one further note is in order.  As I went to pull off the first few pages to get myself up to the first day back to work, the paper cover at the top of the glue strip just fell off as if no glue had been used.  The calendar doesn't look as if it's going to stay on the plastic backer for long.

Cost-cutting has really gone too far:  52 fewer pages, less ink due to not going with the 8-frame Sunday panels on weekends instead of the 3 panel Saturday, less ink due to not including the Daily Extras on the back, and less glue to hold the thing together.  Ridiculous.  Next year I'll wait for the reviews before I buy one.  Hopefully the other calendars are coming from another publisher who is using an ample amount of glue and not shorting us on the content.",3.0
"Why are there only 6 comics per week?  They didn't put in the Sunday 8-panel strips.

I fully understand that most people have these at their work desk, so they see these 5 days a week (one hopes), or maybe 6 if you're unlucky.  But to not have 7 comics a week is rather lame, or dare I say weasel-ish.

The quality of the paper and stand are just fine.

I do think the Dilbert logo in the lower right corner is a bit loud.  the 2010 was nice, not overly showy or distracting.",3.0
"I have been buying this day to day calendar for several years now. The quality of the product is ok, it does not feel like cheap plastic, and the pages tear fine throughout the whole calendar. It has a good manufacturing quality.

The bad part is on the content itself. While on recent years the calendar had been improving (adding a double strip on Sunday, adding color, having additional content on the back of each page, etc...) this year they took back several steps and removed severa of those details.

First there is no more additional content on the back of each page. This was a nice feature that provided additional entertainment. While some info was really just fluff, some of the puzzles were fun to complete. The second (which I feel is the cheapest move) was removing the sunday strip, and mixing SAT/SUN in 1 page only. This means not only you don't have the double strip, but you have 1 less comic per week. Didnt really like this change.

OTher than that, the jokes are funny as usual, I work on the manufacturing industry so I can really relate to most of the jokes in there. I hope they realize those changes were a mistake and improve the calendar for next year.",3.0
"For the most part this calendar is good.  My only complaint is the lake of Sundays.  Oddly enough, usually I get the 1 in a 1000 manufacturing defect, but this time I seem to have gotten one of the few that does not have a defect.  Maybe I got an earlier or later production unit.",3.0
"I give it 3 stars because Dilbert is always a great read.  I don't give it more as this year's calendar is worse than the 2010 version.  This year's edition has no Sunday strips (sat/sun are put together on one page), there are no puzzles or interesting bits on the backs on the sheets, and the whole calendar block was not glued to the base (nor was the cover glued to the top of the calendar block).",3.0
"I have always loved Dilbert, and have bought the Day-to-Day Calendars for myself and as gifts for my colleagues for many years now. I must say I am a bit disapointed with the 2011 Day-To-Day Desk Calendar - The 2010 Calendar had one page for each day of the Weekend, and Sunday's page had a joke that was longer, with more panels. The 2011 calendar, on the other hand, has combined pages for Saturday and Sunday into one page, and it is one of the shorter jokes. You are basically getting 52 pages less (one page less for each week) for your money.",3.0
This year the publishers have combined the weekends into sat/sun combination - hence there are about 50 less pages of comics compared to previous years.,3.0
"I would recommend you think twice about buying this. Unlike previous years, the Sunday comic is missing; they combined Saturday and Sunday into one page and provided only the daily strip there. Also, unlike last year, there is nothing on the back of the pages.
The new calendar is a daily reminder of corporate greed.",3.0
"This is not a review about the Dilbert content - most people reading this review will already know whether they like Dilbert or not and that's a matter of taste.  (I like the strip which is why I like the calendar content!)  I've been getting these calendars for years now and consider it a mandatory part of my desk.  I also like to use the previous day's page as scrap paper which makes me feel like I'm not really being wasteful.  Fortunately, the 2011 calendar returns to blank backs - the 2010 calendar had junk on the back that made the pages less useful for reuse.

The big problem with the 2011 calendar, though, is that there are only 6 strips per week.  There are no Sunday strips included in the calendar!  Instead, Saturday and Sunday are combined on one page with the usual 3-panel daily strip.  What a loss!  Granted, I don't spend time at my desk on Sunday but I do enjoy those strips as a bonus on Monday.  (And no, I don't read ahead!)

Also, my particular calendar arrived with the calendar separated from the binding that holds it to the backer.  The pages are still stuck together like a pad of paper but they just rest on the backer rather than being attached to it.  I may try gluing it.  Maybe just an isolated occurrence or maybe evidence of cheaper binding process.",3.0

Daily contacts, appointments, things to do before 11, water, exercise, reflection etc. I do carry my planner with me though and I know the cover will not survive. I am currently looking for a way to protect it. I also think the pages are quite thin. I do use a gel pen, but it is a micro writing style, very thin lines. There is no bleed through but I can see the writing slightly through the page. For people who use pen styles like me, this could be an issue. I do think overall, this planner will lead to improved productivity. I hope they will improve the production materials.",3.0
"I thought this material would work for me but it didn't. It wasn't bad stuff, its just not where I am in life.",3.0
"The calendar is beautiful and I have framed the print that was sent as a bonus.  However, I have purchased the Lang calendars in stores and I was hoping that I was getting the narrow one like the ones I purchased in the store.  The two I purchased were smaller and had a nice hanger attached.  I thought when I clicked on the picture that showed a narrow, smaller calendar that it was the one I would receive. In that respect I was disappointed.  The calendar I received is too big to hang on the wall.  It just does not have the appeal that the narrow ones have.  The narrow ones are much lighter because they are printed half the year on one side and then you flip the pages over and the other half of the year is printed on the back of the pages.  It is much easier to display.

I ordered the calendar through Amazon and it arrived in a very short period of time.",3.0

"For parents or teachers looking for a daily review book, this is a good choice. It has one page of stories and the second page focuses on questions.

Others do not seem that fun: flash cards?

I just kept reading thinking ""Okay, I will have to decide what out learning styles are and choose ideas based on that.""

"As history, Sgt. Pepper merits 5 stars.  As pure music, I don't agree it's as important.  The songs are silly (""Lovely Rita"", ""Sgt.

But the punk revolution reversed most of the so-called advancements (and brought back 50's style production).  The album is not that much fun to listen to.  I'd argue the White Album is a better Sgt.

I've heard that Paul McCartney listened to The Beach Boys album Pet Sounds and that Sgt. Peppers grew out of that.
Post Sgt. Pepper and clearly influenced by it, came The Byrds album The Notorious Byrd Brothers, which is one of my top 5 albums of all time.
Listening to Sgt. Pepper today after a long time of not hearing it, I'm surprised that the quality of recording is not better.
Favourite track is She's Leaving Home.
To get this up to 4 or 5 stars, the earlier double single Penny Lane/Strawberry Fields Forever could have been added as bonus tracks.

Why would someone want mono when stereo is so much more enjoyable? Maybe mono is desirable if one is not sitting in the middle to get the best stereo effect?

"How I wish that all the songs on this album were as good as ""A Day in the Life."" I remember back in 1967 when everyone couldn't wait for the new Beatles album. I think the ""long wait"" made people nutty and obfuscated their criticism. What shocked about this album back then was the sheer sound of it. Sounds no one ever heard before! Backward tapes! Cleverly mic'd drums! Granted, the production of ""Pepper"" deserves five stars; it literally changed the way music would be recorded from then on. But, ah, there are more weak tracks here than strong ones. I'm more of a fan of early Beatles, but the inclusion of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and ""Penny Lane"" would have improved the record, no doubt about that one. So, this is the watershed album everyone was waiting for, yes, but the Beatles usually created trends, not overtly follow them (read psychedelia). Oh heck, it's only one record. Weak by Beatle standards. Which are high. And is it only me who thinks that ""A Hard Day's Night"" is one of their strongest records? Pop perfection. The Beatles got certain things out of their system and bounced back with ""The White Album."" So it's not like they were washed up or anything.",3.0

"Okay.  The Beatles and their albums have been talked to death.  Their and Brian Wilson's mature work continue to be among my most beloved music.  A year or two goes by when I might not listen to them as much, but less so in recent years.  Not that they're alone, and not that I haven't got a thousand favorite musical tracks from hundreds of artists, but they certainly always hold a special place in my heart.
The Beatles from Rubber Soul to Abbey Road and the Beach Boys from Pet Sounds and Smile through Holland are I think their most durable and remarkable works.  I've listened to them from their original vinyl pressings (except Smile which I heard on bootlegs) to repressings to Mobile Fidelity virgin vinyl half-speed remasters to CD's to the CD remasters.  I think that considering that the sonic work done with each new release of Beach Boys material has been revelatory, coming to an astounding peak when Pet Sounds was accorded a DVD AUDIO release.  It fills the room with clarity and presence.  (Don't miss Elton's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road in DVD-A, it's even more of a sonic wonder, coming from a newer source)
Now for The Beatles.  Constantly trotting out the unvarnished original mixes is pretty much a waste of time.  Even when George Martin went back to the tapes for the boy's ROCK N ROLL album, he centered the vocal mixes rather than stay with some old phony ping-pong stereo and opened up the mixes.  When others tried their hands (The Yellow Submarine Songbook - rather than the original soundtrack, and The Beatles #1 - the original CD), they cleaned up, sharpened, and sometimes repaired mistakes (like Eleanor Rigby on Submarine), opening up the tracks beautifully.  Listen to Yellow Submarine - the movie - on DVD or Blu-Ray.  The songs are breathtakingly new.  What do we NOT have on the ""remastered"" CDs?  That.
Will SOMEONE with some imagination go back to those tapes and hear them with new ears?  We'll always have the original mixes. Especially from Help! onwards, and those primitive first two, we need to open up those mixes to sound fresh and alive.  Now even #1 sounds like an old release.  The original vinyls sound better.  Let's give the Beatles the sonic enema they gave Pet Sounds and release them on DVD-A or SACD (which I don't have so I don't push it).  Many of us have DVD players, and some of us have them hooked up to home theatre sound devices.  The format should be accessible, I agree.  But at the VERY least give them the goose that Beach Boy lovers have been able to track through the songs' many incarnations, each better than the last on basic CDs, not muddy the sound as was done with #1 (the remaster).  Somebody send this out to Paul, who may show some interest in this approach.
I'm not complaining about George Martin's extraordinary work with the Beatles, but even he saw the possibilities of freshening the sound with Rock N Roll and others, not forgetting the shattering mixes on Cirque du Soleil's LOVE.  We're not talking radical song mixes and medleys and sound effects that weren't there.  Just, as I said, the clarity and presence of sound.  Making the buried vocal of the stereo ""Rain"" a little clearer and maybe a trifle more up front, for example, or centering the band's vocals on the early material.  Martin has done that himself.  It's not blasphemy, it's understanding the possibilities of stereo sound in a way that was fairly foreign when they recorded.  The Beatles weren't even there for the stereo mix of Pepper, and you can hear many differences in mixing and even in takes and speed (She's Leaving Home, the galvanizing mono version of the Pepper Reprise) that Martin and his assistants mixed into stereo in a short time.  (See THE BEATLES RECORDING SESSIONS by Mark Lewissohn) Go back to those tracks and fix them (he reintegrated the louder laughs that were supposed to be apparent at the end of Within You Without You, why not treat their other sonic decisions with as much respect?)
When The Hollies hits were collected in a 3-CD set, almost all of the songs were remixed from ping-pong stereo to soundstage stereo. It was wonderful.  And when a song or two wasn't allowed a remix, you could hear it's age.  Ever since Submarine and #1, I hoped for something similar for the Beatles.
Even the mono mixes, though accurate in balance, have a muddy sound.  Listen to The Beach Boys mono mixes on their various CDs.  They're as clear and distinct as their stereo releases. (Mono was how Brian heard them) And their stereo reimaginings on later releases have been sterling.  Pet Sounds was missing several independent tracks, so you need the original mono to really hear how some tracks were envisioned.
I bought a few of The Beatles albums in mono first, and found them wonderful and clear.  Now all the high ends are dull.
All the Beatles CDs should shine.  Hey, just an opinion.  Now the recordings and releases have been talked to death.  Best wishes all, and cry out for real, imaginative craftsmanship.",3.0

"The music on Sgt. Peppers is great (5 stars).  But there is a problem with the lyrics.  Every song on Sgt. Peppers is about drugs.  So I can't recommend it to anyone.  There should at least be a parental advisory warning on the label.  Here is a list of the songs and the drugs that they are about:

1. Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band (amphetamines)
2. With A Little Help From My Friend (pot)
3. Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds (LSD)
4. Getting Better  (uppers/speed)
5. Fixing A Hole (heroin)
6. She's Leaving Home (Quaaludes)
7. Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite (heroin/'horse')
8. Within You Without You (hashish)
9. When I'm 64 (crystal meth/'crank')
10. Lovely Rita (psilocybin/'shrooms')
11. Good Morning Good Morning  Good Morning (PCP/'Sherman')
12. Sgt. Peppers (reprise)(caffeine and datura/jimson weed)
13. A Day In The Life (LSD and tobacco)

Instead of re-mastering this album again in a few years, hopefully what the Beatles will do is change some of the lyrics so that the songs are not all about drugs...  Hey Paul and Ringo, are you listening?  We want new lyrics for this album.

Note:  It should be mentioned here that I don't hold it against the Beatles that they wrote songs about drugs.  Back in the 60's, they didn't really know how bad drugs are for you.  In fact, The Beatles (and other hippie bands) believed that drugs are good for you.  So it is understandable (even commendable) that the Beatles encouraged kids to take drugs.  After all, it is the thought that counts.  The Beatles thought that they were helping kids by turning them on to LSD and grass.

It wasn't until later (the 80's) that doctors realized how bad drugs are for you.",3.0
"Received in good condition and quite promptly with no glitches on the disc.

I found the sound of the remastered CD to be surprisingly poor in light of the bright '#1s' and 'Yellow Submarine Songtrack' mixes of recent years.  Though more bassey and the vocals more to th fore, the sound otherwise was almost muddy and required significant equalization on my part.

My 'Nero' ripped and sound-enhanced copy proved more crystelline and definitive.

The video add-on was stylishly produced though too short and insubstantial to be worth further discussion.

The CD outlay itself however is well designed and quite informative.",3.0
"I have been a fan of The Beatles for many years and enjoy Sgt. Pepper to a certain degree.  I enjoy other Beatle albums more.  My enjoyment of Pepper is tempered slightly by the gap between the legend of the alleged months it took to record, the layers and layers of multi-tracking musical ""innovations"" that are proclaimed to have been achieved on Pepper and what I actually hear on this release. I find pre-Pepper Beatle albums superior partially because they did not have half a year to work on them.  They contain more immediacy and zip to them because they were working on stricter deadlines.

There are some nice songs on the album.  The title track, With a Little Help, Lucy in the Sky, A Day in the Life and When I'm Sixty-Four are good ones in my opinion.  All the songs for the most part are the same tempo, though, which makes the album drag. Many of the songs seem phoned in, and in most cases simply competent rather than outstanding.  I find the album flows well until running into the syrupy track She's Leaving Home which I rate as a misfire attempt at another Yesterday and Eleanor Rigby, in that it is a strings-only socially conscious ditty that to my ears simply doesn't work and disrupts the flow of the album.  Within You and Without You is interesting, and on some occasions I find it enjoyable and other times find it tedious and want it to be over with.  My non-Beatle fan friends loath it.  Getting Better, Fixing a Hole, Being for the Benefit, Lovely Rita and Good Morning Good Morning are simply pedestrian filler songs that offer, to my ears, nothing musically or lyrically interesting.

As many have pointed out, this album is often rated highly because of the impact it had at the time of release.  And others have pointed out the album has not aged well.  I agree with both of these points of view.  So the question is, should someone who does not posses this album but is thinking about getting it, do so?

Beatle fans of any age should acquire this album at some point.

If you are under thirty and not a Beatle fan, I would not recommend it.  As time goes by, and musical styles and means of expression evolve, I would think may young people of today would find this album mundane and uninteresting.  I find it slightly mundane and uninteresting.  I would liken the idea of Pepper to young people today to my thoughts on listening to Glenn Miller or Frank Sinatra when I was fifteen. (I'm in my mid-forties.) That was ""old people"" music with cobwebs and dust on them.  Though this album has significance to a large percentage of perhaps the 40 + demographic, young people, particularly those of perhaps 25 and younger think of this album and The Beatles for that matter, as positively pre-historic.  I would qualify this, however, because of the release of The Beatles Rock Band game.  It is possible that presenting The Beatles music in the context of a video game could generate interest in the 25 and under crowd.

If you are over thirty, and not a Beatle fan but want something safe and non-threatening to listen to, you should give Pepper a shot.  It's pleasant enough and does have it's historical significance.

As for the quality of the remastered Pepper I find, with a side-by-side comparison with the earlier generation Pepper CD little to no difference.  I am no audiophile so I am basing this simply on what I am hearing.  It is perhaps a little louder.  I don't here any more pop in the drums or a significant improvement in the quality of the bass as many have reported.  If you already have Pepper as part of a comprehensive CD collection but are not a Beatle fan(atic) I would advise you to save your money.  If you are a Beatle fan you will probably end up purchasing the remastered Pepper and most if not all the remasters anyway.",3.0
"So much has already been said that I write this merely to agree with the two reviewers who have given the album just one star. I think one star is a bit of an overstatement, but let's give it something like three stars, because after all, it is quite pleasant to listen to. Important or impressive in any way it isn't. Sure, as someone pointed out, every little thing on it was an innovation at the time, but innovation is not always great music: electronic sounds, too, are an innovation, but unless masterfully put together to say something, they're cousins of all the electronic blips your computer makes - hardly music you can't live without, methinks. Sgt. Pepper was so overhyped at the time that openly not liking it could get you physical injury from both hysterical girl fans and aesthetically offended boy fans - a situation nearly incomprehensible today, if nothing else because hysterical girls have been replaced by women with independent tastes. That's why I hail the new reviewers, who don't give a damn about the hype of yesteryear - you guys cannot imagine how ostracized you would have been back in the day. Sgt. Pepper just isn't that great an album; it is, instead, an example of what happens when you're so rich that the cost of studio time is of no consequence and you can just come in when you please, having had your gentlemantly british breakfast or something, play with toys and gadgets for a few hours, then go do something more fun and return whenever you feel like it. It's a collection of playtimes by the rich and talented, recorded for posterity. Talented, of course: we won't deny that these playtimes sound much better than my playtimes. And just to make sure we're on the same page: yes, A Day in the Life is pretty incredible. Wish the rest of the album were on that level.",3.0
"A Scratched CD is why I only gave this awesome compilation of Beatles music only 3 stars. It's not Amazon, It's not the Beatles... It's the packaging. The CD on it's own would have received a well deserved 5+ stars. Maybe I'm different than most, but I want my brand new CD to arrive in mint condition. No cracks, no fingerprints or dirt, and NO scratches. Unfortunately this was not the case with Sgt. Peppers. The packaging is terrible. Someone, or some ""thing"" shoved my CD into the ridiculously hard paper sleeve and caused a deep scratch over the first two tracks, which makes them ""pop"" and skip. I've since downloaded the two fracked up songs (not from Amazon) and I've recompiled this beautifully remastered CD. All is well so far, but I caution you to be very careful taking these 13 remastered CD's out of their sleeves to avoid scratches on your CD. I assure you, you won't be happy when one of your remastered tracks skips.",3.0
"Improvements are greatly overstated. Having a large Beatles collection I wanted to test a CD to see if it was worth buying the box set. Having  a hi end $25,000 stereo system I was ready to test the cd against non remastered copies and was disappointed. It just doesn't measure up to the Hype. Its just repackaging of some good music.",3.0
"A friend of mine bought this cd today and brought it over to my house. We compared his new ""remastered"" copy with my original. The only difference is that his was louder. That's it. No clearer, no more noticeable bass or drums. Nothing. Don't waste your time buying this ""remastered"" version, since you're not missing out on anything but a few decibels. The reason I still give this a 3 star is because it is one of my favorite Beatles albums, and is well worth your time to listen to.",3.0
"My sister is a huge beatles fan and i've heard so much about this album.  It seemed too poppy and is not a concept album by any reach of the mind.  Though, she's leaving home, getting better, and good morning, good morning are my favorites on the album.  Lucy.. A day ... blah blah blah.  My love for George Harrison proves well with the crazy within you without you, my favorite.  Its good but the most essential album is revolver or rubber soul",3.0
"""Before Sgt. Pepper, no one seriously thought of rock music as actual art. That all changed in 1967, though, when John, Paul, George and Ringo (with ""A Little Help"" from their friend, producer George Martin) created an undeniable work of art...""

Really?? Before this album NO ONE considered rock music art. I didn't know. Guess they were just all wrong then weren't they?! Huh. And to this day it is ""undeniable"" that Sgt. Pepper is a work of art. Maybe...but *undeniable* is such a strong word. In anycase I find this album came at exactly the perfect time to maximize it's success.

""I declare that the Beatles are mutants. Prototypes of evolutionary agents sent by God, endowed with a mysterious power to create a new human species, a young race of laughing freemen."" ---Timothy Leary

Yeeeaahhhh. Well, people were getting into somethings and this album seemed to really connect. Does it still matter so much? Does it stand the hard test of time? The answer is NO to that question. Obviously it's  place in history is secured as one of the most important and influential albums in late 20th century pop music. Sgt. Pepper is undoubtedly an interesting album with the concept of creating alter-egos and an imaginary band for The Beatles as well as the studio innovations that went into the songs. Honestly though, the one song that truly stands out and I find interesting circa 2008 is ""A Day in the Life"". Why that is I can't put my finger on it, but that's how I feel.",3.0
"It's funny how history works. When it came out in 1967, Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was a seismic event. It was an instant cultural touchstone, a musical icon, a psychotropic chunk of pop art product that glistened with possibility and newness. It was, famously, the album that signaled the rise of rock `n' roll as an artform rather than a teenage flavor-of-the-decade. It was bold, energetic, and state-of-the-art. It was conceptual- even the packaging and cover art were part of the journey. It was innovative. In a visionary synthesis of Chuck Berry and Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson and Karlheinz Stockhausen, the Fab Four sought to combine experimentation and melody, innovation and whimsy, futurism and present...ism. It was the album that made it officially OK for popular artists to use tape loops and weird (read: non-European) instruments and genre hopping. Sure, other bands had been experimental before them, but the Beatles were the first megastars to do it over the length of a full album. Impressive.

So, I'm not going to deny the historical significance of this album. I'm not quite insane enough to do that. I won't try to refute its influence, either. But what I am going to complain about is its listenability. Its raw musical value, if you will. Evaluating music on an intellectual level is interesting and useful, but it's all academic if the stuff doesn't make for a good listening experience. And by that measure, the Beatles have done much, much better than Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

It hasn't aged all that well, you see. I can do without a lot of this stuff: ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" is a cutesy music hall exercise that, all these years later, sounds cheeky and not all that entertaining. ""Lovely Rita"" and ""Good Morning Good Morning"" sound absolutely generic, and ""Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite!"" is (how do I put this delicately?) annoying and stupid.

Even some of the album's better songs aren't exactly top-drawer material: ""She's Leaving Home"" is sad and pretty, ""Getting Better"" is pleasantly bouncy (good lyrics, too), and ""Within You Without You"" shows off George's sitar fascination to trippy effect, but none of those three are particularly special. Same goes for the rocking title track.

But having said all that, I still do think that this is a pretty good album. If the review so far has seemed harsh, it's because I've learned to hold the Beatles to a pretty high standard. A five-star Beatles album (Rubber Soul, Revolver, etc.) needs to be saturated with pure gold. On this disc, I only count a few true gems. ""A Day In The Life"" is the shiniest. It's an absolutely gorgeous song, a symphonic tale of quiet desolation and muted melancholia. I also like the quintessentially psychedelic ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds,"" and the inexplicably delightful ""Fixing A Hole.""

Rock historians, Beatle maniacs, and those who are trying to collect all of the obvious touchstones of musical history should certainly pick this up. Otherwise, think twice.",3.0
"First off, let me say I AM a Beatles fan. I have owned everything they've ever released in one form or another, and a great number of solo releases
as well. So, this review is not coming from a Beatles hater or a casual fan. Sgt. Pepper is, in my opinon, the most over rated Beatles album they released. It has worn thin over the years. I can listen to Abbey Road, Rubber Soul, Revolver, or even Magical Mystery tour and never think ""What's the Deal?"" Not so with Sgt. Pepper. There are good songs, to be sure, but the overall effect is one of a band trying too hard to be different from thier previous albums. There were better albums released in 1967, including one by the Beatles themselves. Magical mystery tour, to be exact. At this point, I think the band was not acting like a band as much as a group of muscians trying not to SOUND like a band. I understand that the concept was to be SGT. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and not the Beatles. I get it. I just don't get why this album, more than any other Beatles release has endured. People go ga ga over this album in ways I just don't get. Sgt. Pepper didn't change popular music. ""Please Please Me"" did, and every Beatles album after that.
Pepper is over-rated. It's not their best work. That disticntion should go to Rubber Soul or Abbey Road.",3.0

"If you grew up in the sixties and liked the Beatles at all, you'll want this. If you didn't, you probably won't ""get"" it. Not their greatest selection, but Lonely Hearts Club had its own sound at a time when the Fab Four were 'evolving.'",3.0

""Sgt. Peppers was a ""concept"" or ""story"" album, which was a fad that year 1967...the beach boys did one too ""pet sounds"" they both suck, but people say they're their best albums of all time.""

Beatles Expert :)

I totally agree with those two quotes, it is very overrated and one of the most known albums and the one that everybody talks about, but albums such as Magical Mystery Tour and Yellow Submarine, and its  predecessor, revolver are much better. Now if strawberry fields and penny lane which were supposed to be on Sgt. Peppers it would have made it a bit better but it still wouldnt have compared with the Beatles other albums. With A Little Help From My Friends and Good Morning Good Morning are two very good songs, the rest of the albums tracks are songs I'll occassionally listen to, but they really aren't that good of songs.",3.0
"It's been called everything from the Greatest Rock Album of All Time to the Soundtrack for the Summer of Love (1967). It's also been called the first ""concept album."" But if you take away all the ""hippie zeitgeist"" that accompanied its release, then it, like other Beatles albums, is just another collection of songs. John Lennon even admitted as much, saying that, other than the ""theme"" song and the reprise of same toward the end, the album's songs could have ended up on just about any other Beatles album. No ""concept album"" here. And inspiration? ""Good Morning, Good Morning"" was stolen from a corn flakes commercial. ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" was lifted almost word-for-word from a circus poster. ""A Day in the Life"" was two song fragments that would have ended up on the cutting room floor had they not been ""joined"" together by George Martin. All this and a song about Meter Maids, too.",3.0

"This is a classic case of misplaced admiration, which starts a bandwagon into motion which so many seem compelled to jump upon.  Who knows what got it started.  It doesn't really matter.  Now for the truth.

Sgt Pepper, Lucy in the Sky, A Day in the Life, are good songs.  Not great songs.  Just good.  The rest of it is boring, forgettable mediocrity.  Shouldn't the ""greatest album of all time""  offer at least a wee bit more?  This is not a knock against the Beatles.  McCartney and Lennon truly deserve the accolades they're received as songwriters.  I suspect those two got a laugh over the years at all the praise for what they probably secretly consider only an average work.

You want a truly ""great"" album, from the same era?  Try ""Aqualung"" by Jethro Tull, or other Beatle albums, at least four of which are better than Sgt Pepper.",3.0
"Although somewhat disappointed that a few of the original songs seem to be recorded differently than on the original album, the clarity of the music and lyrics are as clear and fun as ever.  I keep it in my car permanently and listen to it whenever I need to ""let loose""!",3.0
"Not having been much of a Beatles fan, I was intrigued about assertions that Sgt Pepper & ""The White Album"" were so influential in the rock genre & on the entire world of music.  Maybe I had too high of expectations... I ended up really liking about half the sangs (the first listen was dissappointing but they grown on me).

Now, my review is written from the perspective of a casual listener and not as die-hard Rock & Roll fan.  My previous exposure to Rock & Roll went something like:

> As a child I grew up with the MTV bands... Iron Maiden, Motley Crew, Van Halen etc.,

> I outgrew those bands by the time I was 12... but a year or two earlier I was introduced to Led Zeppelin and Creedence Clearwater Revival... they have certainly survived my musical maturity.

> In my mid twenties I ""discovered"" The Doors, Simon & Garfunkle, Cafe Tacuba, El Tri, Caifanes and more recently Real de Catorce & Jimi Hendrix.  At the same time... I have ""discovered"" bands like the Rolling Stones & others... but haven't been impressed.  I am still in the process of expanding my collection of this type of music... and just started searching for stuff by The Greatful Dead & Frank Zappa.

So from that limited perspective my opinion of Sgt Pepper is:

>  Some catchy, eclectic, smart tunes like With a Little Help, Getting Better, Fixing a Hole, Within You, When I'm Sixty Four, Good Morning Good Morning

>  The Beatles musicianship is moderate on this album.  They aren't quite as limited as their early years... but they certainly aren't anywhere near bands like Led Zeppelin or Real de Catorce.

Now in terms of the assertions that this album has a great deal of historical significance... I am certainly not an expert on Rock & Roll history... but I really don't buy its historically importance:

>  Crazy Psychedelic arrangements with strong ethnic (particularly spice route & blues) influences... the concept was pioneered & well promoted by Esquivel a full decade earliery.

>  Thourough fusion of Psychedlic elements with Blues and Rock & Roll... The Doors had already issued two very successful albums before Sgt Pepper

>  Psychedelic Folk Rock.... already successfully recorded by Simon & Garfunkle prior to Sgt Pepper.

Again without claiming Rock & Roll expertise... it seems to me that The Beatles were merely an opportunistic pop band that rode the bandwagon of The Doors, Simon & Garfunkle and many others.

With that said, if you happen to like The Doors AND Simon & Garfunkle... you will definetely find a handful of songs that you will absolutely listen to regularly.",3.0
"Let me start by stating that I have always been a Beatles fan, and to me they will always remain the best band of all time.  That being said, I don't know why everyone has always heaped so much praise on this album - to me it is not even in The Beatles top 5.

Would anyone listen to Fixing A Hole or She's Leaving Home if they were not by the Beatles?  Come on now, how good is Within You Without You or When I'm Sixty-Four?  Granted that Lucy In The Sky and A Day in the Life are pretty darn good and have held up well over the years & With A Little Help from My Friends is okay, but overall I rather listen to Rubber Soul, Abbey Road, or a lot of other Beatle albums before this one.",3.0
"This album opens with the title track followed by ""With a Little Help from My Friends."" Both of these tracks are great. The album starts to creep downhill after that. The vocals on ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" purposely sound strained, like they held their nose closed while they were singing. Overall, it's still an alright song. ""Getting Better"" has a poppy, optimistic tune. It's pretty cool, though the lyrics ""I used to be cruel to my woman. I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved"" I find somewhat creepy.

So, there are some cool Beatles tunes on here to listen to. The other half, however, is a burden to listen to. ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" is just plain annoying. ""She's Leaving Home,"" is an attempt at another ""Eleanor Rigby,"" but it's not even half the song that ""Eleanor Rigby"" was. ""Within You Without You,"" is an eastern sounding tune. But their previous album, ""Revolver,"" already some eastern sounding tune that wasn't very great. Who needs another? This one's even worse. The whole song just sounds like a vocal warm up. And there's just too much to say about ""Good Morning Good Morning."" Roosters crowing, people shouting ""Good Morning!"". A lame melody accompanied by blunt brass. It just all makes me tense-makes me want to scream, ""Shut up already!"" It's all a bunch of noise. What is this, a sound effects album? Good grief! Then there's nothing special about ""Fixing a Hole."" It's somewhat good, but unfortunately has an annoying chorus melody.

I have nothing bad to say about ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" and ""Lovely Rita"", but nothing good to say about them either.

The last two songs are pretty good. The reprise is a good rockin' tune. ""A Day in the Life,"" is a mellow tune interrupted by a creepy orchestra every so often.

So forget all of the bias about how ""revolutionary"" this album was or whatever. I'm giving it to you at face value.",3.0
"At the risk of being a lone voice in the wilderness,
I feel like enough time has passed for ""Sgt. Pepper""
to receive an objective musical assessment, free from
the hyperbole and hype that have surrounded it ever
since its initial release in the Spring of 1967. To
begin with, this ""original"" concept album took as its
template, Brian Wilson's watershed opus ""Pet Sounds"",
released by the Beach Boys in 1966. Despite the fact
that Paul McCartney has openly admitted this fact
numerous times in the music press, The Beatles are
unfairly being credited with pioneering something
they clearly did not invent. In terms of continuity,
Side One flows meticulously from the neo-garage of the
title track, to the Tin-Pan Alley musings of ""With A
Little Help From My Friends"" to John Lennon's deserved
psych-pop masterpiece ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.""
""Getting Better"" follows, still rife with pop overtones,
but lyrically covers some dark territory: ""I used to be
cruel to my woman/I beat her, and kept her apart from
the things that she loved.."" It leads into McCartney's
sweetly introspective ""Fixing A Hole"" and then into
Side One's true revelation, the quietly majestic ""She's
Leaving Home."" A truly discerning listener will cite
this track as a textbook example of how The Beatles
appropriated Wilson's genius, from their vocal harmonies
right down to the orchestral arrangement. Side One ends
with the charming novelty ""Being For The Benefit of Mr.
Kite"", a tune that could easily have been a throwaway, if
not for Lennon's cheeky delivery, and the trippy sonic
flourishes peppered throughout. Side Two however, is a
different story. The fact is, despite its Middle Eastern
ambience (or more likely, because of it) George Harrison's
mesmerizing ""Within You, Without You"" feels strangely out
of place here. McCartney follows this with two of his most
boilerplate compositions to date: the so-cloying-it-should-
be-an-AARP-jingle ""When I'm Sixty Four"" and the awkward
pop-funk of ""Lovely Rita"", which is nearly saved by its
intriguing instrumental ending. And in retrospect, however
groundbreaking the three-part suite ""A Day In The Life""
seemed in 1967, listening to it now I see its musical
ambition far exceeded its actual execution. As a example
of a 60's concept-album that succeeded on aesthetic terms
alone (and not the rock-hype frenzy) I'd recommend ""Pet
Sounds"" by The Beach Boys, ""Sell Out"" by The Who, or the
lesser-known but equally brilliant ""SF Sorrow"" by The Pretty
Things. I realize nothing I've said here will ever change the
journalistic mythology that envelops ""Sgt. Pepper"", but that
doesn't mean such reservations shouldn't finally see the
light of day - for crying out loud, its been almost forty
freakin' years, people!",3.0
"It's hard for me to give this an under five star review being that I am a Beatles fan but there are just some problems I have with this album.  I think most of the people giving it 5 stars are giving the Beatles 5 stars not the album.  Most of the songs are hokey and throw aways.  Fixing a hole and Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite specifically are weak tracks with nonsense lyrics.  Yes they're catchy, its the beatles, if you want catchy listen to Help or With the Beatles.  A lot of the lyrics are purposefully obtuse to turn of the squares of the time but today sound like some lame inside joke.  The only realy great memorable songs are She's leaving home and A day in the life.  Those two could go on other albums and shine but put lucy in the sky on Abbey Road and it would stick out like a sore thumb.  The other problem is the overproduction.  Hopefully they will someday come out with a stripped down version similar to Let it Be: Naked, which is so great.

  Beatles fans seem to come in two varieties Pre Sgt. Pepper's and Post Sgt. Pepper's.  I am DEFINATELY a Post Beatles Fan.  The White Album shines with the sublime Dear Prudence, the haunting While my Guitar Gently Weeps, one of their rockinest songs back in the u.s.s.r, the absolutley bueatiful Blackbird,  the evil sounding Helter Skelter,  and the classic Revolution.  Even the throw aways are good, like cry baby cry and julia.

Abbey Road, my personal favorite, is great top to bottom.  Come Together rocks, Oh Darling shows of Paul's pipes better than almost any other song.  Something was described as Frank Sinatra and Elvis as one of the greatest love songs ever.  I want you is so much heavier than anything they ever did. And the ending medley is why people keep writing albums, to come up with something that great.  Don't forget hear comes the sun.

Let it be has Get Back, a truly great rock song with the amazing keys by Billy Preston.  Two of us is one of the best examples of harmony vocals ever.  The long and winding road is hauntingly beautiful, accross the universe is a better trippy song than anything on Sgt Peppers or magical mystery tour (with the exeption of Strawberry Fields and possibly I am the Walrus).  Then there's the title track where Paul shines and you can feel his passion.  I dig a pony has some of the greatest John vocals of any Beatles song and a great guitar riff, listen to it again.  Even the one after 909 is a good rocker.  Ok Maxwell's Silver hammer sucks but it would fit right in on Sgt. Pepper's.

  I'll never understand the mop top fans.  The beatles were so saccarin sweet they are almost hard for me to listen to for the first four or five albums.  With the Beatles is pretty good and Help has some great hits too.  Rubber Soul is very solid front to back but a little poppy.  Revolver, to me, is their second most overrated album after pepper's.  Yeah its got great tunes but also some throw aways.  And it doesn't have any absolute classics like Come Together or Get Back or Strawberry Fields or Hey Jude or Let it Be.  The sitar stuff gets old quick.

  In the moptop years John's songs seem almost out of place because of their honesty and realism compared to Paul's pop fluff.  Listening to Rubber Soul is wierd cause they alternate songs and Paul sounds like he's trying to beat a dead horse and ride their past success while John is making art.  Another reason I prefer Post 67 Beatles is that George is SO much more accomplished on those albums.  A lot of George's songs stand the test of time better than paul's.  Also post 67 at least they had the balls to admit they were using drugs and go with it rather than hide the fact they had been using speed and hash and bagging groupies since the Germany days.  Those early albums are not true reflections of the band because Brian Epstein sanitized everything for the public.  After he died they were on their own and did much better creatively.

  I think the reason Sgt. Pepper's gets mentioned as being great so much is because its the last album the mop top fans like and its one of the first albums that Druggie Beatles fans like.  I like it better than their pop bs but not as much as their later stuff.  And a Meet the Beatles, or Help fan can still appreciate the poppy bubble gum songs on Sgt Pepper's like It's Getting Better.

  Listen, its a good album and when I was 13 I would have argued it was the greatest ever.  Because of the drug references and the melodies and the wierd effects and the fact it was a concept album and the alblum art.  But since then I've listened to a lot of great music that is better in all of those categories.  If you want a concept album get Dark Side of the Moon.  If you want melodies and harmonies try Crosby, Stills, and Nash.  If you want album art try pink floyd or even tool.  If you want wierd try Frank Zappa.  If you want drug references try anything that came out after this album.  Maybe that's why people like it cause it started the drug music revolution.

  I bought this album when I was in 8th grade and loved it.  That same year I also bought Dark side of the Moon and Legend by Bob Marley.  Right now dark side and legend are both in my six disc changer because I can listen to them anytime, all the time and never get sick of them.  I lost my Sgt. Pepper's copy about TEN YEARS AGO.  Never replaced it and never missed it.  I don't plan on buying it anytime soon either.",3.0
"This is not one of my favirote Beatle albums.  Rubber soul, The whit album, A hard days night are.  Two many drugs going on at this time, but songs like Getting Better, A Day in the Life, and the Title track are timeless songs.  GodBless",3.0
"As a music listener I fall into that rare group thats kind of ambivilent towards the Beatles. Don't hate them nor worship them. Some songs are good others less so, but at the end of the day I could take them or leave them. However I'll still review 'Sgt. Peppers'.

In recent years this albums taken a critical battery among some fans and musical journalists. Well when I say battering I mean its dropped in their esteem to being one of the merely good Beatles albums. Though considering it was once held up almost universally as the pinacle of pop accomplishment that is somewhat of a battering. Part of this could be due to the fact that recently Paul has claimed the album was mainly his inspiration and the Lennon worshippers have reacted by giving the album a downgrading, especially of Paul's contributions.

Or it could simply be that its not that great. Sure 'With A Little Help From My Friends, She's Leaving Home, Lovely Rita' and of course 'A Day In The Life' are some of the Beatles best, but some of the other songs are pure filler. The 'Sgt. Pepper' inserts (which give rise the idea that this is some how a concept album) are fun better rather redunant and not that essential. 'Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds' the albums only real delving into psychadelic sounds is rather average for a psychadelic sound of the era, and certaintly not that orginal. George's contribtution 'With You Without You' drags on without doing anything and you kind of want to smash that damned sitar on his head by the end. 'When I'm Sixty-Four' that song that for so long has raised the ire of fans and casual listeners a like isn't all that bad, as a joke ditty, but its not something you want to hear again and again. While some of the other tracks are good, others are forgettable, and all in all album that with only four great tracks isn't worthy of a top rating.",3.0
"For me the mark of a great song is its ability to stand up to any interpretation, arrangement or production.  Perhaps that's why there have been so many covers of ""Yesterday"".  The songs on ""Pepper"" do not meet that standard.  Many people feel this album is a pinnacle for the Beatles.  While that may be with respect to their innovation in the studio, without the dazzling production many of the songs do not hold up.  Proof of this can be seen on Elton John's cover version of ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"".  In the pop combo arrangement it loses all effect.  Lennon's witty, arcane lyrics are propped up by the equally arty arrangement.  This album is a step down from the previous ""Revolver"" where production didn't overshadow the strong songwriting.  Here production is a crutch for some of the weakest songs the group ever wrote.",3.0
"No doubt about the relevance and importance of this Beatles record,but it's not the greatest album ever made. Still,it is a very good album with some beautiful songs. The Lennon songs(written by the man himself)are the greatest songs. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds(the LSD song)is truly stunning as is Day in the Life. My favorite song is Within or Without You with that Sitar sound,which came from the Beatles trip to Sitar legend Ravi Shankar. The McCartney songs are not even close to the Lennon tracks since they are pretty cheezy and not experimental.

Important,very important,but not a masterpiece. It is also not a typical Beatles record,cause if you listen to their best of records(I've got the album 1)not a single Sgt. Pepper song is included. Not that that's a problem though. For Beatles starters I would recommend the great 1 album that shows a more recognisable Beatles sound.",3.0
"Sgt. Pepper's defined the era of the late 1960's. It was a phenomenon, a cultural event, the music that went beyond music's boundary. I remember a musician said in a documentary that he listened to this record again and again and wondered how they could make this kind of sounds.

However, those days of 60's psychedelia are long gone and Sgt. Pepper sounds too much outdated. I can understand some formatic aspects of this record (special effects, concept structure, theme of dream, drug, etc.) must have sounded revolutionary to 60's listeners' ears, and that shock have made this the greatest albums ever in rock history. But the very fact of that peculiarity of Sgt. Pepper harms its status as a timeless standard.

Most of the songs are actually in the rank of the Beatles' music. Some of them are truly great. ""A Day in the Life"" is a great song, still shocking and mind blowing. ""Getting Better"", which Paul included in the catalogue of his latest tour, is another strong rocker. ""Good Morning, Good Morning"" is the hidden gem that not many fans appreciate its greatness. ""Lucy in the Sky"", though I don't believe it is really that great because of its druggish laziness, is still a fine beatles song.

However, many other songs do suffer, which is quite extraordinary, considering this is the Beatles. ""Sgt. Pepper's"" is interesting but silly. ""With a Little"" is cute but childish. ""She's Leaving Home"" is another (and repeated) attempt of classical music like ""Yesterday"" and ""Elenor Rigby"", but does not have such energy and nobleness. ""Within You"" is an almost disaster, too long, too exotic, too out of context. ""When I'm 64"" is another childish throw out. ""Lovely Rita"" is a mediocer song except the ending coda, which is quite strong.

As one can realize, most of these weaknesses come from Paul's overshadowing whole project. He is a music genius, with so much achievements and revolutions, but in Sgt. Pepper's, like his solo career stuffs, his music gets too flat and silly. It is a line of cheap melodies and shabby ideas. When Paul is too much involved or demanding, Beatles almost always gets lost in the way.

I heard this record in 1982 for the first time, so I was way out of the context of late 60's culture and so in a position that could render me a more objective view on the record. From the first listening, it was frankly not that great, and still it is not. I would recommend other great Beatles records to new generation who'd like to appreciate Beatles' music. If I would rank official Beatles albums, the top 5 would be;

1. Abbey Road : Alright, Paul was overwhelming in this record, too, but in a positive way. For me, this is the greatest, without any filler songs.

2. A Hard Day's Night : Great, great, great. You can feel the energy of rock music when it was pure and simple. No songs to throw out.

3. Rubber Soul : Romantic and personal. So beautiful.

4. White Album : A little unfocused effort, with a few experimentals. But overal, great record.

5. Revolver : Another drug record than Sgt. Pepper, but with more good songs like ""Taxman"", ""Elenor"", and ""Tomorrow"".

By the way, it is Rolling Stone that keeps on saying this is the greates album ever made. Other magazines, especially British, generally do not recognize Sgt. Pepper that great.",3.0
"I know about 30 to 40% of the beatle's fans will argue tooth and nail, but Abbey Road is a lot better as a whole than this classic. Yes it is a classic and still probably the best record of that year. The song writing (as always) is 5 star to say the least. In 1967 it was a landmark and damn well should have been. I look at the Beatles and think what songs I like and go from there. They were never a band to put out and entire album of great songs. They were a singles band. As ambitious as this effort was, it falls short. If you are a Beatles nut, I can see how you think this is the apex of all recordings. If you really listen to this record you will find how sloppy it was recorded. With all that said I am still glad I have a copy of this",3.0
"I can't believe Capitol dug this one out of the vaults for re-release!  Bands like this are supposed to sink into oblivion!  Seargant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band's album ""The Beatles"" is worth a listen for collectors of obscure & underground 60s music.

Seargant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was a short-lived group of comedians and experimental musicians from Chicago who centered this, their only album, on the comic concept of a supergroup called ""The Beatles.""

The only shades of this album that can be found elsewhere in music would be in The Residents' ""Meet The Residents"" album. And I suspect this one may have been an early influence on that group.

""The Beatles"" is a song cylce intended to parody the overblown pretensiousness of the teen-idol craze, showing us what happens to bigheaded young men when they actually believe the hype surrounding them.  And so, Seargant Pepper imagines them taking nonsensical topics such as a circus run by ""Mr. Kite,"" or condescending to date a pretty meter maid called ""Lovely Rita"" with her close-minded sisters, sitting on their petty sofa (How cute! They sit on sofas just like us!).  ""The Beatles"" spin theirselves into so much self-absorption they usually take plebian yet catchy melodies that could have come from a television musical at the time (""When I'm Sixty Four,"" ""With a Little Help From My Friends,"" ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,"") and then go over them with layers of sound-effects and studio trickery and consider it art.  Hilarious are songs like ""Getting Better"" and ""Good Morning"" in which the lyrical content is so laughably pointless, but wrapped in symphonics so sweet yet so simplistic it's a little creepy.  At the end of the song, you feel that you've just woken up after a night in which you've been slipped a date-rape drug!  Here, Seargant Pepper presents us with a serious statement on the dangers of pop-culture.

If you pay attention to the narrative of Seargant Pepper's album, you get the sense that this make-believe band, ""The Beatles,"" started out no differently than any other garage-group... young and not exceptionally talented nor exceptionally original, but charismatic and willing to exploit the market for popularity.  Sadly, self-conscious of their short-comings, they begin shrouding their typical-sounding songs in religious mystique and overdoing the production in order to veil their lack of substantial ideas.  It is a heartbreaking story of what can happen to a young band who get trapped by fame before they are mature enough or artistically capable enough to handle it.

Seargant Pepper has thought through all the fine points; we see self-doubt and longing for something more substantial in meditative tracks like ""Within You Without You"" (a side-thought ""composed"" by one of The Beatles' backing musicians) and ""A Day in the Life,"" in which one co-leader of the band (""John"") is actually interupted in the middle of developing a deep thought by another co-leader (""Paul"") halfway through the song in order to dumb it down for audiences (""Woke up/Grabbed my hat/a-doodley-doo/in seconds flat..."" he rambles desperately, pointlessly)!  One wonders if ""The Beatles"" could have managed sustaining such success had they been real!

While ""The Beatles"" is not an easy listen by any means (Seargant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band were so anti-commercial listening can be a painful experience) and you certainly won't be hearing these tracks on your oldies radio station any time soon, this album is moreover worth the listen if you can find it cheap.",3.0

When I think of all of the records that fall into either category, ""Sgt. Pepper"" does not jump out at me as one that I would like to go listen to. In terms of the listening pleasure that I derive from the record, it is almost completely inconsequential to me.

SP has its good and really bad moments. Note that I did not say *really* good and really bad moments. The best moment for both Paul and John is their one collaboration, ""A Day in the Life"". In terms of their individual songs, three of Paul's contributions nearly sink the entire record. John's songs might be better than Paul's while they are playing, but are pretty much completely forgettable to me otherwise. Ringo's turn at the mike is generally harmless and a bit amusing, but my man George delivers a pretty decent performance with his one contribution. All and all, there are 3 or 4 songs that I don't mind sitting through. (Perhaps it was wise for The Beatles to pose as a different band for this record.)

What all this means is that SP is lacking the basic, most essential element of a great album: a batch of great songs. Innovation and influence are certainly major contributors to an album's greatness, but they do not - individually or in combination - equal greatness. Without at least a majority of equally great songs, an album cannot be considered wholly great. Songs that sound great sonically are not necessarily great songs lyrically and musically. Having said that, let us consider the songs on SP.

(But first, there are those who argue that ""Pet Sounds"" - there I go again - is a more impressive technical achievement. Since that album was released a year before SP, they also argue that it deserves more or at least equal praise. This is all very fair, but SP was a much larger seller, so its influence was more widespread. So can we all agree that SP is sonically brilliant and hugely influential - even if it had less recognized peers - and on those grounds it is an indispensably important achievement? Good.)

The aforementioned good moments are, alas, few and far between. I would say that the top tier of songs is made up of ""Fixing A Hole,"" ""Within You Without You,"" and the brilliant ""A Day in the Life."" Paul's voice sounds great on ""Fixing A Hole,"" but maybe the fact that it is better than his other songs on SP is just a welcome relief. ""Within You Without You"" gives us George's under appreciated voice, and his trademark Eastern instrumentation and philosophical lyrics. And ""A Day in the Life"" speaks for itself, but I will interrupt it briefly. Paul and John's voices are in fine form, the slow acoustic guitars draw you in with curiosity, the orchestral swells build tension, and the ""ba - baba - ba ba"" riff before the final verse brings the song back down to earth. This is the album's one true saving grace.

However, it cannot quite redeem the entire album, going to show that perhaps not all that ends well is well. First of all, since it is the last song on the disc, the listener is forced to wait around for it, probably overrating the other songs as they yearn for the greatness that they have been promised is on the record. Second, it appears after the ""Reprise,"" which gives a tacked-on feel to a song that already seems like it isn't an integral part of the album. Finally, the fact that it is SO much better than every other song on the album makes the other songs seem even paler by comparison.

So far, not so good. Now, let me take a deep breath and discuss Paul's misfires and flat-out stinkers. ""Getting Better"" should be a feel-good song, perhaps the one most in the spirit of the album's overall optimism. But Paul's lyrics - assuming that they are meant to be listened to and not merely heard - muddy the waters. As he sings ""it's getting better all the time,"" John sings ""it can't get much worse"" in the background. So what are we to believe? Are things getting better because things are good and on an upward trajectory, or are things so bad that anything different at all is an improvement? And if the former is the case, as I think that we are supposed to assume it is, why express the latter sentiment at all? Finally, how is one supposed to take the lyrics, ""I used to be cruel to my woman/I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved/Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene""? Oh good, so you're no longer a wife beater. Your old woman, wherever she is, must be thrilled, and your new one must be relieved that she was able to change you enough so that you don't beat her. It really does everyone involved a whole lot of good.

""She's Leaving Home"" is not really that bad of a song, but for an album mostly full of cheer and whimsy, it is a real downer. It makes no contribution to the theme or musical unity of the record. It sounds completely out of place. Had it been placed on an album without any arguable pretense of thematic unity (buried on The White Album, perhaps), it might have packed more of a punch. It is a really good song on the wrong album.

Finally, ""Lovely Rita"" is just annoying and confusing. (What was up with Paul's attitude toward women on this record?!) He thinks she is lovely, and is clearly smitten with her, but he says that when he experienced his love at first sight, he thought that she looked like an older military man. Now, to each his own, Paul, but I sure hope that you didn't tell her that. Then, when he does go out with her, she says he wants to see her again, but doesn't get the check at dinner. At long last, as if he hasn't sunk low enough, he is disappointed by his failure to score a mnage-a-trois with her sisters. OY! (Remember, lyrics are meant to be listened to, not just heard.)

Now, what about John's songs? Well, I don't really find them to be good enough or bad enough to merit extended discussion. They are, like Paul's songs, certainly not among his best or even better Beatles songs. Which forces me to ask, how can this be the best album either of all time or of The Beatles' career if the two main songwriters do not turn in some of their even *better* songs? Search me.

Basically then, I do not get a lot of pleasure from listening to this record, and I am not sure why I should. It is pleasant enough in spots, but while The Beatles claim to have arrived at maturity with this record, they come across sounding more middle-aged. I cannot and will not deny that this album has ""greatness"" to it -- it is innovative, influential, and considered by many who take such a question very seriously to be the greatest album of all time. It is essential listenting for these reasons alone. But in my opinion, not enough of the greatness is the result of the songs themselves. Moreover, the other elements of greatness are not enough to keep me from wanting to listen to any number of other CDs, either by The Beatles themselves or any other artist. (Love's ""Forever Changes"", the psychedelic flipside of SP, comes to mind.) Therefore, I can recommend SP mainly for its importance as a major document in the history of popular music. Like that book that you have to read for your English class, hear this CD because you have to. You will most likely appreciate it, and may even enjoy it. But also like that English book, you shouldn't feel obligated to like it. And if you don't, finish it up and move on to something else. (""Something Else"" by The Kinks, maybe.)",3.0
"THe beatles where a band with some talent and they did write a few good songs but this is not the best album ever over even close to the rock and roll spirtit. First of the title track sgt. peppers. That song flat out sucks. Second the betles never really influenced any one after 1975 and their influence is not heard at all today. They where the first band to write music that would be popular not good and lasting. THey did not even have the best album of that year which belongs to the velvet undergrund Who where not a bunch of hippies that did not fallow trends and did influence a million more people then the beatles ever thought of. The beatles where like a paperback writer they write good music for the time and the era and sell millions of copies but that does not make their music good or bad,it make s it middle of the rod, but there is more music out there. That puts the beatles to shame and has more of that rock and roll spirit.",3.0
"First, the concept of albums will soon become obsolete, what with MP-3 and CD burning.  The original vinyl SGT PEPPER released in June '67 coincided with stereo releases and headphones replacing mono and transistors for the younger set. And George Martin's production (Bob Dylan always said it was over-production) brought forth sounds that popular music hadn't experienced before. But if today's CD buyer were to analyze this album by the songs, he might think about half are good or even great, and half aren't, so why all the fuss?  Frankly, I always felt that the Beatles should have combined SGT PEPPER with MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (released only 6 months later), because SGT PEPPER was overrated and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was underrated.  The best tracks on PEPPER are ""Day in the Life"" (still a classic Lennon-McCartney song), ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"", ""Good Morning Good Morning,"" ""Fixing a Hole"" and ""With a Little Help from My Friends.""  But they should have left in the dust bin ""She's Leaving Home,"" ""When I'm 64"", ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,"" and replaced them with the stronger 1967 tracks of ""I Am The Walrus,"" ""Strawberry Fields Forever,"" and ""Fool on the Hill"" from MYSTERY TOUR.  In fact, this is how I would have made their 1967 release of SGT PEPPER'S MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR:  Side A -- Getting Better, With a Little Help from my Friends, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Fixing a Hole, Hello Goodbye, Flying, I Am the Walrus.......  Side B -- Strawberry Fields Forever, Penny Lane, Within You Without You, All You Need is Love, Good Morning Good Morning, Fool on the Hill, A Day in the Life........  Now tell me Beatle fans, is that one STRONG 5 STAR album or what ?  They could have released their throwaway tracks of ""She's Leaving Home,"" ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,"" ""Sgt. Pepper,"" ""When I'm 64,"" ""Lovely Rita,"" ""Magical Myster Tour,"" ""Blue Jay Way,"" ""Your Mother Should Know,"" and ""Baby You're a Rich Man,"" on some ANTHOLOGY UNRELEASED TRACKS OF '67 CD thirty years later.  As for me, I listen to SGT PEPPER'S MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR in my car all the time, and I don't skip any tracks.",3.0
"sgt. peppers lonely hearts club band is without a doubt the singular most overrated album in the history of popular culture, music, or rock n roll. it was recently rated as number one on rolling stones top 500 greatest albums ever. no. no it should not have been. revolver is without a doubt the definetive beatles album. although this album changed many things in the way music was made. the production, the overall concept, the whole thing changed music forever. but still i ask myself how, and why. sure there are some real good cuts on here. the title track, lucy in the sky, little help, and a day in the life are really the only good cuts on this album. of course if you're trying to collect all the essential albums every band has ever made, of course you need to get this. but if you're just getting into the beatles, get revolver, or the white album",3.0
"You know, I can't entirely fathom why this album continues to captivate the legions of Beatles fans to the degree that it has. Yes, it was somewhat innovative for the time with its orchestration and (at the time) second-to-none production, but those factors alone don't make it a classic, much less ""influential."" And to those who have heralded this as the first ""concept"" album--no, it isn't. 1966's Freak Out! (Frank Zappa And The Mothers) probably deserves that honor, and The Who Sell Out was also released in 1967 which also had a unifying concept to it, and then there are a few Kinks records that were conceptual too. All Sgt. Pepper has is a brief reprise of the title track followed by A Day In The Life to end the album, which I guess suggests some loose thematic element, but not really. Overall, this is my least favorite ""studio-era"" Beatles record, and while it's better than the early pop records before Rubber Soul it can't stand in the same company as say, Revolver.

There's nothing particularly objectionable about the music--most of the songs are pleasant ditties. But calling them ""innovative"" just because they've been slathered with all sorts of studio effects simply doesn't hold water. If you strip the gloss away, most of the songs are subpar. At heart, the Beatles were (let's be honest here) pop, but it worked thanks to strong songwriting and solid hooks, not excess gimmicry. Rubber Soul, Revolver, most of The White Album, and Abbey Road still hold up today for that same reason. Sgt. Pepper (and its companion Magical Mystery Tour) don't.

Despite all that, there are still a few decent tracks on Sgt. Pepper. The title track is very good, with some great guitar from Harrison, and so is the reprise. The Ringo-sung With A Little Help From My Friends isn't bad. She's Leaving Home is a rather touching ballad, and Harrison's Within You Without You is an enjoyable and underrated raga-rocker. And then there's A Day In The Life--breathtaking. The rest alternates between saccarine and twee (When I'm 64, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds), or nonsensical and overproduced (Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite, Good Morning Good Morning).

Both Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour represent the Beatles in an uneven spot; their highs were amazing (Strawberry Fields Forever, A Day In The Life, I Am The Walrus), but the lows were some of the worst in their career. If the best material from both LPs was pieced together into one album, then it may have been a classic despite the dated production. As it stands, Sgt. Pepper is really nothing special. If it's psychedelia you want, consider Hendrix's Are You Experienced?, Pink Floyd's Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, and The Doors' debut; all were released in the same year, boasted some genuine innovation, and have aged remarkably well compared to this bloated Beatles opus.",3.0
"When i first heard this album i thought i was going to find a musical icon, a masterpiece of rock pshycadelia as every rock music critic and Beatles' fan say. The result of my listening, except for a few tracks, like 'Fixing a hole' and 'Sgt Peppers Reprise', wich woke me up, is that i felt asleep for the complete record's duration.
The problem is , beside that it sounds like the tipical british pop sound of that time, is that there is nothing you could take out from the set that would stand out, for example, 30 years from now, or even today.
This record is not 1/2 as good as Hendrix's 'Are you Experience?'or Pink Floyd's 'Piper at the Gates of Dawn', music gems of that year, there was a lot happening elsewhere, and the Beatles sound had lost the freshness of the first records (specially 'Revolver', which i love). I'm sorry but this record is the tree that blinds you from seeing the forest.",3.0
"The Beatles were arguably the greatest rock band ever, and certainly the most significant, but they weren't perfect. Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, while it was groundbreaking and did influence many, receives more recognition and admiration than it deserves. People say that 'oh, people saw rock music as an art form w/ this album,' or 'this album changed the world,' but even w/ REVOLVER or some songs off of RUBBER SOUL, rock was seen as an art form, as well as artists like Bob Dylan, and underground legends Frank Zappa and the Velvet Underground.
Here's a song by song review:
1. Sargent Pepper's: This song is an excellent intro to the album. It just flat out rocks. 5/5
2. With a Little Help from my Friends: Sung by Ringo, which isn't as bad as Yellow Submarine. It's pleasant to listen to. 4/5
3. Lucy in the Sky w/ Diamonds: By far the best song on the album, and one of Lennon's most tripped out songs. The imagery he uses is like Bob Dylan on LSD, and the music reflects the lyrics, and it makes me feel I'm seeing 'the girl w/ kaleidescope eyes.' 5/5
4. Getting Better: ""It's getting better all the time..."" Paul's song about changing his life around. Not a bad song, but not their greatest either. 3.5/5
5. Fixing a Hole: This gets a lot of praise, but it gets repetitive. The song really doesn't go anywhere. The lyrics are pretty cool though. 3/5
6. She's Leaving Home: This song just annoys me. 2/5
7. Mr. Kite: Uhhhh.... wow? Another tripped out,bizarre Lennon song about some ad for some... freakshow or something. Not to be listened to while intoxicated! 4/5
8. Within You Without You: George's lone track on this album, further exploring his infatuation for Eastern music. Some say it drags out way too long, but I like it... a LOT. 4.5/5
9. When I'm 64: A good song for weddings, but Paul's sentimental balladry goes too far. It's the 'Honey Pie' of this album. 2/5
10. Lovely Rita: Another Paul love song, except more bouncy. It's good, not great. 3/5
11. Good Morning: Lennon returns after a 3 song absence w/ this rocker. I like the time changes in the middle, and the lyrics are very interesting. 5/5
12. Sgt Pepper (reprise): Kind of the introduction to A Day in the Life. 3/5.
13. A Day in the Life: By far the highest point on this album, and quite possibly the best Beatles song ever. You go through so many moods and textures on this entire album. perfect way to close off an album! 5/5.
So, there's my review of the album. Many of the songs on this album were excellent, but with a few mediocre songs, it only somewhat takes away from how essential and great many people make it out to be. It's worth listening to, and for a lot of the songs it's worth owning.",3.0
"I see why the Beatles were popular and held in high esteem.  The songs pretty much define what a hit sounds like: simple, catchy, concise, universal.  There is personality and good production and chops and novel ideas.  Pretty much every song on ""Sgt. Pepper's"" embodies all these things.  For that reason, I cannot imagine giving this record less than three stars.  I also cannot imagine enjoying this record.
My First Impressions and Thoughts:
----------------------------------------------------------------
My parents had no Beatles records, and no radio stations I listened to ever played them, so today I am hearing Sgt. Pepper's for the first time.
Not having grown up saturated with the music of The Beatles is difficult to understand for some people, I'm sure.  I imagine you couldn't walk down the street in the late sixties without hearing them.  Somewhere, as you read this, there is a man in his fifties with a salt and pepper beard and a ""Cosby sweater"" sitting in a leather chair in his living room, looking out the window at his kids playing.  He put on this record to relive his youth.  He hears Sgt. Pepper's and remembers trying pot for the first time, kissing that cute girl he had a crush on in high school, his dear departed mother and the fantastic meals she made, fearing he'd go blind from his activities behind closed doors, etc.
I hear this and think of sesame street, because it is simple and a child would enjoy it.
Boy, John Lennon sure had a whiny voice.  I read in other reviews on this site that Lennon claims Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds has nothing to do with drugs.  I believe him, because this is the the most childish description of a trip I have ever heard.
The only song I recognised on here is the one Joe Cocker covered,  the one they used for the Wonder Years.  How appropriate, since this record is much like that show: someone else's drab nostalgia.  At least the Wonder Years had Winnie Cooper.
Simple, catchy, blah, blah, blah.  Despite a bit of experimenting, this record is bland like wonder bread.
The sitar is a terrible instrument.  I hate India very much.
At least this last song has some cool tape loops.
----------------------------------------------------------------
After listening a couple more times, my opinion of this record improved, but I still won't be listening to it ever again.  In music, I look for beauty, energy, atmosphere, and edge.  A record doesn't have to have all those qualities in order for me to like it.  For example, Folsom Prison Blues by Johnny Cash has tons of energy and edge, and just a bit of atmosphere and beauty.  I feel that the songs on Sgt. Pepper's have enough beauty and energy to get by, but not enough to make up for a lack of edge and atmosphere.  You might look for something else in music, and disagree with me completely.
In short, great pop songs that make me feel nothing.",3.0
"To me this is when The Beatles ceased to be a band. Both this and Magical Mystery Tour are their two worst records,especially after the brilliance of Rubber Soul and Revolver, which had a good mix of their ""band"" sound and studio experimentalism. Pepper goes overboard with orchestration to the point where it sounds like some guys just singing with the orchestra ,rather than a rock band being accompanied by one. The songs from this period are better heard on the Beatles Anthology, where you get the demos minus the orchestra,you really appreciate the material for what it is and what Pepper could have been. Sorry guys I think Mick and Keith got the upper hand in the Brit battle at this point, at least they kept it real as a live group.",3.0
"For years Sgt. Pepper has been considered to be ""THE greatest album of all time"" by fans and critics alike. However, I believe that the time has come to re-appraise its true value in Rock history in context of 30 years of musical development since its release. Many have said this album cannot be bettered - I believe this statement to be entirely false.
Firstly, the praise. It cannot be denied that this album pioneered many of the production techniques used in music today, from compression, tight bottom end punch (achieved through Starr's drum kit tunings and McCartney's bass integration), reverb techniques (vocals through Leslie speaker cabinet, tape echo and delay on instruments) and the use of exotic instrumentation (sitars, tambura, swordmandel etc...). Equally, some of the sounds created for this record are genuinely innovative and still impressive today; the chopped-up and looped caliope and organ sounds on ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite""; the indian instrumentation on ""Getting Better""; the orchestral passages of ""A Day in the Life"".
In terms of the songs, there are some genuine classics; ""With a Little Help From My Friends"" is a chirpy and well-integrated number which is perfectly produced and performed (unlike Joe Cocker's hideous interpretation); ""Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite"" is an excellent piece of impressionism, even if it may be rather slight; ""Getting Better"" is an optimistic song with an insistent beat and a clever arrangement; ""When I'm 64"" shows McCartney's grasp of genre and ""A Day in the Life"" is still impressive today, although I take issue with the musicality of the orchestral passages.
The packaging is worthy of mention, for it introduced the same level of innovation and thought to the packaging of the music as with the actual manufacture of the music itself. The original sleeve was printed in colour, included full lyrics, some cardboard cut-outs and the fantastic Peter Blake front cover. All of this added to the perceived value and integration of the product and dramatically increased the scope for artistry in music.
Now, the criticisms. Despite the production and the presence of some excellent songs, there is no denying that the average number of pieces on this record is inferior to that on the predecessor, Revolver. Many of the songs are either repetitive (""Good Morning, Good Morning""), unintegrated(""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds""), boring (""Within you, Without you"") or dispensable (""Sgt Pepper Reprise""). When compared to the album which inspired it, The Beach Boy's ""Pet Sounds"", there can be no comparison between the songs. The pieces on this album have none of the sophistication of Wilson's masterpiece, nor do they have the intricacy of those on ""The Beatles"" or ""Abbey Road"". The lyrics too, are largely trite and inferior to the average number on ""Revolver"".
As an integrated concept, the album does not hold up at all. There is no consistency between the tracks aside from the first two and the final two. It fails to come close to it's original inspiration, in fact, it misses the point completely.
Furthermore, in terms of the claims that the album has never been bettered, The Beatles themselves bettered it several times over with their following albums and artists such as Queen, Tear for Fears and Genesis have released ambitious albums which have toppled this release.
In summing up, Sgt. Pepper is a good album which has great historical significance, but it is by no means a masterpiece and it is probably one of the most misunderstood and overrated albums released.",3.0
"A day in the life is amazing. With a little help from my friends is very good,but the rest is yust ok. Rubber Soul,Revolver,Magical Mystery Tour,The White Album,Abbey Road and Let it be are all much better. Sgt. Pepper`s Lonely Hearts Club Band must be the most overrated album of all time.",3.0
"I'm afraid this has to be the most overrated album of them all . Ironically it is the cutting edge technology of the time that the Beatles were using that makes this album sound so dated today .
The majority of these tracks are lightweight , with a hint of the cartoonish about them , but I'm afraid too many gullible people have swallowed the hype that the entertainment business has dished out to the public , to perpetuate the golden goose that is the Beatles . Talk about the tail wagging the dog !",3.0
"Sgt. Pepper's is a good album, IMO. But it's not Abbey Road, Rubber Soul, or Revolver. And as far as it being a concept album, sure it starts out that way and kind of ends that way, but not really. I will say that I love the title tracks (both the opening and reprise) as they are great fun with Sir Paul leading the way. With a Little Help From My Friends has grown on me (I just love Ringo's voice;)I can't explain it). I also love the underappreciated gem When I'm Sixty Four, a great throwback to the 20s and 30s. Lastly, I have a thorough respect for A Day in the Life, an unusual but interesting composition.
The rest of the album, however, is kind of unmemorable to me in comparison to these great songs. I think the whole ""concept"" deal overhyped it and kind of hurts the album in a way. It seems more like a loosely conceptual idea, but the middle sort of shies away from the theme and then comes back (somewhat awkwardly) with the reprise. Then it messes the whole thing up with A Day in the Life (good song, strange placement as far as a concept goes). Abbey Road is actually a much stronger example in concept, flow, and cohesiveness than Sgt. Pepper's.",3.0
"This album was spoiled to death in the studio!  The trickery and excess junk used on this album is too much!  The songs are mediocre, only ""A Day in the Life"" sticks out as notable. You would expect better from this otherwise wonderful band. Only the Beatles could have gotten away with this overindulgence.  Most of the songs seem to be the product of excessive drug use. Where did such magnificent writers get the idea for songs like ""Fixing A Hole"" and ""Good Morning Good Morning"" ?",3.0
"well, the only over rated beatles album. the only songs on here which are great beatles songs are a day in the life and within you without you, the latter being badly out of place. the rest of the songs are silly little tunes such as Fixing a Hole
Pepper has been touted as being such a revolutionary album. exactly what is revolutoinary about it?? it was not the first concept album(Sinatra was releasong concept albums in the 50's). the truly revolutionary beatle albums are revolver and rubber soul(which was THE FIRST album in history). those two are also the best. if you can acknowledge Pepper for what it is, a failed attempt at making a concept album, the album can be entertaining but not very fulfiling.",3.0
"This Beatles recording was no doubt groundbreaking. The record itself brought albums to the forefront in the rock music world. The creativity of the music was very high for its time. The different textures that each song brings is fairly stupendous. Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite and A Day In A Life are perfect examples with the surreal organ effects. Even George Harrison's song Within Without You is a pretty good composition with all the sitars and special effects.
However, some of the songs are just a bit too giddy or in the case of She's Leaving Home too depressing. Is this last song really what Rock N Roll is all about? Where Paul McCartney could compose a well structured song, the style is just sooooo bland. The Ringo sung, With A Little Help From My Friends does fit the drummers easy going personality. However, the tone is so mamby pamby that my impression is.... how pathetic is this? Joe Cocker's version adds some badly needed oomph and emotion which greatly improves upon the original version. Getting Better is not exactly that much better especially with the overly simple instrumental support.
If you love the Beatles, you are probably best off ignoring my comments and just buying this CD. It did start an album revolution and I will admit its creativity deserves some merit. More open minded fans and those who are non or casual fans may want to take an open perspective and not just love everything because everyone else declares this record as so reverred. I greatly prefer the White Album, Abbey Road, Yesterday And Today, and a few other records of the Fab Gang to this as the songs on these releases have a more consistent instrumental support and a more captivating style from song to song. Keeping that in mind, you make the call.",3.0
"Have a feeling that my dislike of this recording relative to other Beatles recordings is the hype.  Not a bad record, just bloated with lots of ordinary songs.  Yet I was lead to believe it was their masterpiece. What a crock. The Who Sell Out, another ""concept"" record released that same year is far superior. On the plus side, Lovely Rita and A Day in the Life are wonderful, but 2 great songs on a Beatles record?  Heck, Let it Be had more than that.  Perhaps judged in the context of it's time it was great, but so were Abbey Road and Revolver and they still sound great.  I won't go into ""Within Without You"" because I if I do I will have to dock it another star.",3.0
"Sgt. Pepper was Paul McCartney's response to Brian Wilson's Pet Sounds in much the same way Pet Sounds was a response to Rubber Soul.  On Pet Sounds Wilson took the orchestrations of Phil Spector to another level.  Instead of just using the orchestra in the background Wilson made classical instruments a focal point the way others used traditional pop-rock instruments (guitar, drums, etc.).  While this may have resulted in a bloated bore in less talented hands, Wilson always handled this task with delicate aplomb.  What's more, Wilson never let his considerable musical talent overwhelm his songwriting.  Pet Sounds may be the first concept album.  Wilson's songs follow adolescent romance from it's early idealism, later concluding with poignant disillusionment.  Wilson meticulously blended the music to match his songwriting.  Since he focused on universal human experience and usually avoided trendy 1960s vernacular, Pet Sounds has matured into a timeless masterpiece.  Wilson's genius only becomes more apparent with age and Pet Sounds is now considered by many to be the best album in the history of popular music.  When it was initially released in 1966 Pet Sounds received little promotion and sold only moderately well.  Only in the last few years has it been widely acknowledged as a classic.
Sgt. Pepper takes the supple orchestrations of Pet Sounds to a grandiose degree.  The production is more bombastic, dynamic, and lucid (Pet Sounds was originally recorded in mono).  While this approach usually serves to create an invigorating sonic rush, it often sounds overblown and pretentious.  It almost sounds like McCartney thought he was composing classical music instead of making a pop album.
As the first ""concept"" album Sgt. Pepper is historically significant.  While Pet Sounds is somewhat of a concept album, the songs are only loosely interrelated by common themes.  Sgt. Pepper is the first album in which the songs serve to tell a literal story.  Many subsequent artists made ""concept"" albums with varying degrees of success.  Pink Floyd's, The Wall is really just an egotistic, self-consciously gloomy incarnation of Sgt Pepper.  In the 1980s, alternative bands Husker Du and Sonic Youth released ambitious, sprawling concept albums.  Radiohead's, OK Computer, and Kid A, are more recent examples.  While it's influence makes Sgt. Pepper a pioneering album, the actual story itself is remarkably ill-conceived.
The fictional character Sgt. Pepper is leader of the Lonely Hearts Club Band.  The songs describe his journey and various experiences.  While this isn't an intrinsically bad idea, the album is hampered by so many trite 1960s themes that it's almost laughable.  ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"", is a hallucinogenic ballad so generic that it could've been written by any psychedelic band.  Most of the other songs have a charming sort of appeal, but are ultimately slight.  ""With a Little Help from My Friends"", ""Fixing a Hole"", ""When I'm Sixty-Four"", and ""Lovely Rita"", are quaintly alluring, but don't convey much emotional resonance and are ultimately pretty forgettable.
The few transcendent songs are just enough to elevate Sgt. Pepper above mere relic status.  ""Getting Better"", and ""She's Leaving Home"" aren't overwrought with anachronistic jargon and actually transcend McCartney's conceptual confines.  The glorious exuberance of orchestral noise on the closer, ""Day in the Life"", actually serves as an effective conclusion.  Almost everything else is pleasant, but slight.  While Sgt. Pepper captures the zeitgeist of the 1960s it rarely transcends that era and often sounds antiquated.
Sgt. Pepper was widely touted by the record company and press as the greatest album ever made before it was even heard.  This greatly effected how it was perceived.  Largely because of the promotional hype that preceded it, Sgt. Pepper was deemed an instant classic.  Only a few discerned or acknowledged it's glaring flaws when it was released.  In recent years these deficiencies have become somewhat more accepted.  Ultimately, Sgt. Pepper is a historic, but flawed recording.",3.0
"Okay. People really need to stop and think about the very important distinction that one must make between 3 key terms: ""innovative"", ""influential"", and ""excellent"". Because they mean very  different things. Were the Beatles innovative? Absolutely. It is the  general consensus of pretty much everyone that they changed the face of  popular music. Were they influential? Of course! Everyone from Bruce  Springsteen to Suzanne Vega was influenced by the Beatles, and it does show  in many subsequent artists' creative output. Now, were they  ""excellent""? That's a tough question, because people have been  touting them as a rock superlative for so long that we've stopped really  *listening* to the music. I sat down and really LISTENED to Sgt. Pepper,  with a critical and analytical ear, and I must say that the Beatles [in  comparison with much of the music made SINCE they disbanded] were simply  alright. Now before you rush to click the ""this review was not  helpful"" button, hear me out. I acknowledge both their influence and  their innovation, but the reason I appreciate it so much is that it paved  the way for other artists to pick up WHERE THEY LEFT OFF. Did the Beatles  experiment with different sound textures? Yes, but later work done with  more sophisticated sound equipment was both more complex and more sonically  rewarding (i.e. Nine Inch Nails, Kate Bush). Were their lyrics  philosophical/interesting/original? Well, to a certain extent they did  advance beyond their early lyrical simplicity, but they NEVER wrote a line  as poetic as Joni Mitchell, as mystical as Peter Gabriel, or as expressive  as Ani DiFranco. Now down the basics: musicianship. Were they good  instrumentalists? Hmm...they could play just fine, but there weren't any  Keith Moons, Eric Claptons, Jaco Pastorius', or Van Halens lurking behind  those English suits. Could they sing? Sure, Paul McCartney had a nice voice  and John Lennon could carry a tune (although it was rather rough at times)  but they couldn't hold a candle to the likes of Jeff Buckley and Michael  Jackson, who would come along many years later. In short, the Beatles were  a decent group of musicians who wrote many catchy, occasionally innovative  tunes and DID in fact change popular music forever. But they merely set the  stage for GREATER things, and people must acknowledge that Sgt. Pepper,  despite being a unique recording *at the time*, is simply not that special  in comparison with things that have come along since. Now, you will  probably dismiss this review as the rantings of someone who doesn't know  what they're talking about, but do me (and yourself) a favor, and really  stop to think. Forget about your nostalgia and the musical dogma that  surrounds that matter, and be brave enough to suggest that the Beatles are  the the end-all of popular music. ""The Most Influential Album of the  20th Century""?  Quite possibly.  ""The Greatest Album of the 20th  Century""? Don't be absurd.",3.0
"The age old debate, Pepper or Pet Sounds! Well, on the basis of the definition of the ""concept album"" Pet sounds has to emerge as the winner.  Pepper made some  for some interesting technical innovations, but  they basically were just extensions of what Brian Wilson started in 1965.  As far as the whole ""Sgt. Pepper and his band"" thing, it's even  as Lennon said; that aside from the opening 2 songs and the reprise, those  songs could have went anywhere and really had nothing to do with the idea  of the imaginary Sgt Pepper and his band.  I wholeheartedly agree.  Pet  Sounds stays true to its theme of love, loniness and alieation...Pepper  kind of rambles about everything.  Taken out of its time the album loses a  bit of its magic.  If it works for you, thats great.  For me, its a  collection of really good songs thrown between the 2 Sgt Pepper songs and  the fantastic cover art...and they called it a concept album.  The idea  worked because, again as Lennon said, because the Beatles said it did.  Pepper is great and deserves its reputaion (well, somewhat), but from the  angle of musical composition and production innovation, it really doesnt  hold a candle to Pet Sounds.  And for the record, I am a life long Beatles  fan.",3.0
"I'm wasn't born when the Beatles were writing their songs, but I like some of their songs.  It's nice to see a Cd where not all the songs are love songs - I have nothing against love songs, but they get boring if there's  nothing else on the radio.  Anyway, the Cd's good, but not phenomenal.  Abbey Road is better, if you're looking for a Beatles Cd.  But this is the  next best Beatles Cd after Abbey Road, so if someone likes the Beatles (and  they already have Abbey Road), this Cd is a winner.  Otherwise, stick with  Abbey Road.  There aren't that many Beatles songs that are significantly  better than each other, but some Beatles Cd's are better than others.",3.0
"This album is good as a pop album, but it's just that. It's way too flashy and because none of the stuff they had on there (circus/indian/english ballroom/soap opera type music) is not authentic, the album does not hold  up over the years. I got it when I was about 13 or 14, enjoyed it for about  a year, then grew out of it and haven't touched it since...

"I agree with Bob Dylan, who said the songs really didn't need all that production; and Lou Reed, who called it ""gooey pap.""  The difference I've found between Beatles and Stones fans is Beatles fans,  especially those who rate this as their greatest record - it isn't, it's at  least third behind Abbey Road and White Album -- is that Beatles fans tend  to prefer those who started something, and Stones fans tend to prefer those  who perfected something.  Beatles fans prefer bloodless perfection, Stones  fans prefer the unguarded moment of genius.  Beatles fans prefer someone  trying to be as good as they can, Stones fans prefer someone having as much  fun as they can.  Beatles fans appreciate someone ""getting it  right,"" Stones fans appreciate someone ""doing their  thing.""
This is why in my estimation Exile On Main Street by the  Stones is the greatest rock record ever made.  I've thought that for the  past 20 years and my opinion won't change tomorrow.  Sgt. Pepper is the  apotheosis of pop, but it has very little to do with what I call  rock'n'roll.  It's not even the most pure pop album ever made -- Something  Else by The Kinks is that -- but it did usher in the age of craft over  inspiration, of polish over rough edges, of the nineteenth take over  ""all right, last time lads, let's do it.""
In other words, the  beginning of packaged, inoffensive, extrememly marketable corporate rock.  The Backstreet Boys, N'Sync and Spice Girls obviously draw heavily from The  Beatles and Sgt. Pepper in particular; you can easily imagine that they've  never heard Exile On Main Street in their lives.",3.0
"When I bought this album as a 12 year old in 1971 I thought it was the greatest thing I'd ever heard.  My older brother and sister were in raptures about the whole thing and were contantly humming it around the  house.  When I bought the CD in 1987 I realised that it wasn't the be-all  and end-all of rock music.  Abbey Road was much better.  In 2000 when I  blow the dust off it and play it again I have to wonder what all the hype  was about.  Sure there are classic tracks (A Day In the Life, Lucy In the  Sky) but there are also clunkers.  BIG clunkers.  How many times have you  heard Getting Better advertising the latest washing powder or electrical  appliance on TV?  We can thank Michael Jackson for that, I suppose.  Fixing  a hole, (God give me strength) Within You Without You, the title track - it  really brings you down to earth to listen to it all again from the  perspective of 40 years.  When I'm 64, Lovely Rita, Good Morning, Mr Kite  and She's Leaving Home are not the stuff of musical immortality no matter  how hard they try and are only marginally better than the previously  mentioned tracks.  The main interest in this album is the packaging.  The  elaborate cover, the printed lyrics, the supposed clues pointing to  McCartney's ""death"" - all were ahead of their time and seemed to  be the main reason why the project gained legendary status.  The CD is even  better - technical information on each track, photo outtakes of the cover  and other shots, this CD is one of very few which justifies its cost.  But  if you discount all that and judge it on the music alone chances are you  will be disappointed.",3.0
"A Day in the Life is good, some other songs are, too, but I think Rubber Soul or Magical Mystery Tour should have been the Beatles 'Album of the Year' award winner.  (R.S. in `65 and MMT in `67). I know that this was the most original concept but I don't see where it won album of the year.  I  love the Beatles, so it's not a crime for me to say this.  But other  Beatles albums should have won the '..of the Year' award.",3.0
"This album was written by a freak in Lennon and a retard in Mcartney. I mean who care about Lucy with her damm diamounds in the sky! What the hell does that mean anyway. Face it it was also over rated even as a concept  album, The Best album of 1967 was THE WHO SELLS OUT it had power volume and  it made a sense. Yes it was on the acid side a little but it always stayed  as a good rock album. The little radio commercials were a great concept by  Townshend and Entwistle. Plus THE WHO had a better drummer a better guitar  player a way better base player and a great front man . So all im saying is  that this album and the beatles suck and are over rated. I mean WHO lasted  longer?",3.0
"Regardless to what you have heard this is not the best album ever made or even the best Beatles album(The White Album has to be the best).Paul Mcartney heard the Beach Boys""Pet Sounds"" and was influenced to  make an album that musically broke all the barriers in pop music.  Unfortunately for Mcartney, you can't get any better than ""Pet  Sounds"". Sgt. Pepper has to be the most overrated album in pop  history. Save your money and buy ""Pet Sounds"" instead.",3.0

"This world map was purchased for a school project in which various locations needed to be noted with a pin. The picture on the website is a bit deceiving, as I had the impression that the continents, countries, states, etc. would be bigger and would be easier to differentiate than what I found upon receiving the map.

While the map is of good size, the continents and all therein seem small - it was hard to find where one state, province, or country began and another ended, as many city, state, province, and country names run over into adjoining states, provinces and countries and boundaries are not always clearly marked. For example, Kentucky is about the size of the tip of my little finger on the map. New Mexico smaller than the size of a dime (if it were squared off), California 1 1/2 inches long and as wide as a pencil, and so on.

We have another world map of a similar size but that seems to better size and differentiate between these areas. However, it is a kids map and has pictures of local dress, foods, exports, etc. all over the map so we could not use it for the project. We had expected this map to be sized similarly.

All said I'm sure it is a good map that is to scale (and likely why everything is so small compared to our other world map which may not be to scale), however, if you have a project that requires a more clear delineation between states, provinces, countries, etc. you may want to consider an alternate.",3.0

"It took me a while to discover that my kids were not going to learn any geography in school.  About the time my 10 year old asked me what the capital of London was, I started shopping for maps.

Because the world changes so rapidly now, I decided to order maps large enough for a 6 and 10 year old to look at and comprehend, but cheap enough to be replaced once the borders of various countries are re-done.

The positives - this map is correct, it's large (we tacked them up in the hallway to the kids' rooms) and it's very colorful, which is good for 6 year olds.

The negatives - it's not laminated, now if I was buying this for myself that would be fine, but the paper is also some strange form of paper that attracts and holds small sticky fingerprints.  Being maps, little fingers are naturally attracted like magnets.

If you are making the purchase for an adult or a classroom, or if you intend to frame it, then I highly recommend this map.  If you are buying for little ones, I'd spend the extra money to get a laminated version.

One last note - if you purchase from Amazon, they are not particularly well packed.  They put them in a tube that is too large for the map so it bangs around and the ends get a bit bent up.  Also they don't tape the ends of the tube so I had to have a second one sent after my first tube arrived empty and without ends on it.",4.0

"The map is large and easy to read.  It came rolled up in a tube, but there are no wrinkles and it flattened out nicely.",4.0
"Purchased to put on a wall. Map was detailed enough for mapping the entire United States. However even after months of use, the edges are still curled up and it won't lie perfectly flat.",4.0
"Wonderful, quality flag. My only suggestion is that they package the product a bit better. Mine was thrown into a box that was later crushed by USPS. It cause my flag to become flattened on one end, which will take work and time to get out. Otherwise, it is definitely worth the money.",4.0
Wanted to show my visiting friend from overseas just how big the United States is compared to their country. This was a very helpful aid. Excellent quality and size.,4.0
"Good quality poster. Nice and big.

Came slightly buckled.  Needs better packaging.",4.0
Great map!!,4.0
Up in the basement and the kids like it. Good map for price.,4.0
"Good, but Not laminated Map",4.0
very descritptive,4.0
"This is a nice map but it is either laminated or high gloss stock.  I was looking for a ""paper"" map, that I could easily write on.  It's nice enough that I won't be sending it back.",4.0
A useful map.,4.0
Map was delivered timely.  I thought the map was laminated but was not.,4.0
Very good detailed map.,4.0
"we want to vacation soon across our great country , so this will help my son with the states we visit",4.0
We have it hanging in our playroom with little blue pins for where my son has been and little pink ones for my daughter.  It's cool.,4.0
It was perfect and exactly what I wanted.,4.0
"I purchased this map so I could teach my son geography. I really like the size and the details of this map. Perhaps the font size could be alittle larger but maybe that is not possible with the all the detail that is included in this map.

I would recommend.",4.0
Make sure you measure out what 50x30 really is because it doesn't sound that big but it's really huge! There are no frames you could buy to fit this. Which was fine for us for our purpose. Really nice map but really big.,4.0
"This is a very nice map, especially for the price.  (Paid $10.17)  I was expecting just a regular paper map, but was happily surprised when it arrived to discover that it is made of a higher quality material.  Not laminated, but lightly plasticized (if that's a word).  The colors are rich, the detail good for a map this size (not too little, not too much).  Very pleased with this purchase.",4.0
"Great map of the United States. We purchased this map, along with a companion World Map, and mounted on foam board and placed in our den. That way we could pin places that we've been and the family could find (and dream) of new and exciting adventures to plan in the future. The map itself is great, but it's big enough that it's a little difficult to mount perfectly without any bubbles. That's not a negative against the map (you want it to be big after all!), but just something to consider if you are thinking about doing what we did.",4.0
Wall map was laminated and therefore quite nice for display and usage in searching points of interest for the person who received this from me as a gift.,4.0
It's a great size with excellent and eye popping color. I'm using it to chart all my travels around the states and it makes a great statement piece for a room.,4.0
"the color is actually darker than it looks online.
Still a great map. Yes it's very thin but it's laminated so you can still write on it with dry markers.
However since it's so thinly coated, I do think that if you leave the marks long enough, it will actually leave a mark even if you try to erase it.
I do not think it's worth a full price though (my friend got laminated U.S map + world map set for $10 at costco)
but so far I'm quite satisfied.",4.0
"I like it. Size of the map meet my expectation. Easy to look. Big printing, especially cities' names. Color is little bit dark. Lighter is better.",4.0
"It was a little too big for my purposes but a great price. Accurate and clear, it shows all the US, including its territories, and shows where major National Parks are too!",4.0
"It's a nice map. I have seen a same map in bookstore, I am a foreigner, so it's good for me to know USA",4.0
I travel for my job and wanted a map I could put pins in to see where I've traveled. This is great for that! It's also detailed but it too detailed. Now I just need a bigger wall for this map....,4.0
very good detail on this map for this price. lamenated coating is a plus. great for planning trips or just learning about our country.,4.0
This map is a really good value for the price you pay for it. Location names are easy to read.,4.0
"it's a good map, but i wish it were a little sturdier to hang.  regardless, a totally worth it purchase.  i recommend.",4.0
I bought this map for the sole purpose of planning a three month RV trip across the country.  This map is perfect.,4.0
"Despite other reviews, this map did come in a tube. It has a nice laminate finish, but is a little thin.  Well detailed with many cities included. Love the different colored states.",4.0
"I love the size of this map and it's a great addition to our home school.  However, it keeps ripping at the edges where it is hanging. Overall, we love it, just wish it was a bit more stiff so it didn't keep sliding out of the push pins.",4.0
Just the right size for my office. I plan multiple city trips across the country everyday so I find it very helpful for a quick reference.,4.0
"Got it as a simple gift to a friend. he liked it.. Good product and worth the money, specially it has some nice details for the cities.. the capitals... etc",4.0
"Bought this map to use for home schooling... My daughter and I love the fact that each state lists many towns (can be read without reading glasses or magnifying glass!), which gives us a better visual than just looking at the state as a whole. Typically, when I hang things up in the office, my husband comments on how I put more holes in the wall...this time he said nothing except that he liked the map too:) The only negative is that it is not laminated... It's on glossy paper.",4.0
Perfect wall map and fast shipping. Nice gloss coating and well color coded for ease of state distinction. This will work great to log our road trips!,4.0
"I've wanted a large U.S. map for awhile now and saw this one. It was laminated, large,cheap, and has useful info on the map. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because the ""lamination"" if you chose to call it that is very thin. I'm going to take it to my local print shop and have them laminate it with the thick stuff so it won't get wrinkles or any tears/damage.",4.0
"My husband and purchased the map to help us visualize our next move. The mountain ranges, bodies of water, large cities and some smaller cities are well depicted.  Counties, larger road ways and larger national parks are seen.",4.0
I knocked off one star because the lamination is a little thin.  For home use this works fine.  I don't think it would be very good in an office or school because it would get damaged.,4.0
"I LOVE that I found this on Amazon! I had gone to a ""teacher store"" and the US Map there was $23.00!!  WHAT?!?!  So when I saw this one at such a fantastic price I was very excited! I ordered the World Map, too. Nice, big size, and nice colors.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I wish it was laminated.",4.0
"Nice big easy to see map. Not as highly detailed as some AAA maps but it does the job. Only drawback is that it only shows major freeways and they are somewhat hard to see.

Besides that it's good if you need a map of the US. If you need a map of the US and all roads, this might not be what you're looking for.",4.0
I said it all in the title. A simple map of the USA.  Very big!,4.0
"The map is great and the packaging was also good.

I would give it 5 stars, but the lamination was a bit of a let down. When I read laminated, I think those laminating pages that you put on a paper and then send through a machine, resulting in a heavy, near indestructible page. This lamination is fine for writing or whatever, but it's very thin and wouldn't stand up to much abuse.

Not necessarily a fault. Just FYI to anyone else looking at it.",4.0
"The map arrived quickly and well packaged.  It is a paper map with no lamination, but it was exactly what I needed.  I did a trifold display for a conference with the map as a background for pictures I was posting of disaster response teams throughout the US.  It was the perfect size.  Thanks.",4.0
"Just what I was looking for, detailed, accurate ans surprised by its size. Recommended for teachers!",4.0
"I purchaesed this map so that my son could use it to mark all the places that he has received post cards from.  Great detail and size, but I didn't pay attention to the fact that it is not laminated.",4.0
"I was happy to see that this map had major roads on it in light-grey.  Not overpowering, but you can get a good view of them.  Map was in perfect condition rolled up.  (The plastic package was marked $4.95 and I paid $5.95, but worth it!)",4.0
"I purchased this and the ""World Map"" together from Amazon, since they are made by the same company on the same material, much of my review will be the same:

I was hunting for maps large enough for a 6 and 10 year old to look at and comprehend, but cheap enough to be replaced once things change or the kids did too much damage to it.

The positives - this map is correct, it's large (we tacked them up in the hallway to the kids' rooms) and it's very colorful, which is good for 6 year olds. It has time zones, capitals, waterways, and mountain ranges all clearly marked

The negatives - it's not laminated, now if I was buying this for myself that would be fine, but the paper is also some strange form of paper that attracts and holds small sticky fingerprints. Being maps, little fingers are naturally attracted like magnets.

If you are making the purchase for an adult or a classroom, or if you intend to frame it, then I highly recommend this map. If you are buying for little ones, I'd spend the extra money to get a laminated version.

One last note - if you purchase from Amazon, they are not particularly well packed. They put them in a tube that is too large for the map so it bangs around and the ends get a bit bent up. Also they don't tape the ends of the tube so I had to have a second one sent after my first tube arrived empty and without ends on it. (It was actually the world map that was missing from the tube, but this one was packed in the same manner)",4.0
Well done but is very large so I am having trouble finding a frame.,4.0
"I looked all over for a nice affordable map for my livingroom, and this one exceeded expectations.
The color is beautiful and the size is excellent for the price.

The only thing I do not like is that the packaging came a little dented and its not procted (can rip easily).
I plan on framing in and putting a nice protection over it.
For the money its a well spent purchase!!",4.0
"The map was just as beautiful as it looked online.  It came quicker than I thought.  They took good care to roll it in a tube for shipping, but the edges were still a little frayed on one side, the map was slightly larger than the tube.  But, it still looks great on the wall =)",4.0
"Ordered this map a couple of months ago and have really enjoyed having it on the wall.  I like the colors, typescript, descriptions, etc.",4.0
"This is a beautiful map, the picture here online doesn't do it the right justice.  The coloring is classic but appropriate, and printed on good quality paper.  It comes excellently packaged for shipping.  The only drawback I would say is that it's not laminated (if you're looking for that).  Having said that, if you're looking for a great map to frame then this is perfect.  I intend to have mine laminated, I'm happy to pay for that service as it's a beautiful map.",4.0
"This map is beautiful. I didn't want anything too large, but this is pretty big- the perfect size for what I wanted. It you want more extreme details like lots of cities, get something larger. The colors seem a little brighter than what the image shows, but it looks great. My only complaint is that I couldn't get the same map laminated. I knew this wouldn't come laminated, but from reading the reviews, the laminated ones came in plastic bags and were all bent up. That was the reason I went with this one. It was shipped in a protective cardboard tube and was in mint condition. I'll just take it to a store and pay a few dollars to get it laminated.",4.0
"i really love this map, its huge and full of color that is not overpowering.  the only bad thing i would say about it is that its pretty thin paper and because of its size i fear it ripping if i just hang it as is.  I don't want to laminate it because i feel like that would take away from its beauty but haven't found another solution yet",4.0
"When I bought this map, I didn't realize it would be so hard to frame. I got the largest frame possible and just folded an little over on both ends. It's a beautiful map with great color and graphics. It looks wonderful in our office and it's very easy to read. Well worth the money.",4.0
"the map itself is nice, according to the picture. however, the packaging was not right, because i have received the map all crisped up.",4.0
"map is a great size, but on very thin paper.  to laminate it at kinkos is about $40...  thus, it still sits rolled up in the package waiting to hang on our wall.",4.0
"the price is good, the map is good

"As my records may show, I ordered two maps at the same time. I have yet to recieve The World Map. I am aware that mailing overseas may take longer, but I recieved The U.S. Maps weeks ago. Is there anyway that I can have my requeat met. Thank You",4.0
We recently moved into our new home and were in desperate need of some inexpensive decor for our walls. This map with it's classic coloring and detailing looks great and really draws one in for a closer look. Great quality. Great price. Great product.,4.0
"It's a little thin, so it's easy to wrinkle the edges, but it looks very nice on my wall!",4.0
"I'm very pleased with my map, but I would like to mention that you can purchase a laminated one for just a few dollars more. I bought my map and then took it to staples to have it laminated, for the price I paid I could have bought the laminated map too, and still saved money. But the map is great, now I can look at places when I see them on tv or they come up in conversation.",4.0
"I have bought 3 world maps, by far this is the best one, very nice colors and quality, gives an impression of old style maps, but with current political status.",4.0
"Great Product, updated to reflect recent geopolitical changes. However, the box that AMZN shipped the rolled up map in broke in half while in UPS's possession, crumpling up the rolled up map completely. In true form to AMZN's great service, a replacement was sent along as a return postage for the damaged map. Unfortunately, the replacement was sent in the same exact type of packaging and broke in UPS's possession again! The second time, the damage was not nearly as bad, leaving only one small crease in the map, so I decided to just keep it. AMZN should probably change it's practice of using standard shipping tubes instead of long triangular boxes that can break fairly easily in shipper's hands.",4.0
Good map.  As expected.  Could be bigger.,4.0
"Excellent map with (as expected) very high-quality printing. I was surprised at how thin (and thus easily wrinkled) the map is, but it came rolled in a tube that protected it well.

I'm holding back 1 star for the following reasons:
- Much thinner than expected; even with the lamination, no heavier than some inexpensive folded paper maps I've gotten in the mail.
- After laying flat on the floor weighted down with heavy books over most of its surface for 48 hours, it still insisted on trying to re-roll itself while I was trying to glue the backing board on.
- There's a fairly large ""border"" of laminating plastic that extends beyond the actual map on all four sides. Depending on how you're using the map, it could be helpful or simply get in the way; I had to trim it off because it went beyond the measurements given & got in my way.
- Although not a problem per se, the laminating plastic is VERY glossy so (even though it's crystal-clear) at some angles there's a lot of glare on the surface.

I bought the map for a mid-scale test of a much larger (planned) fiber-optic travel map, only I'm using it with regular map pins to save money. I found the best backing board to use was a foam board with a thin layer of cork on one side; it attached relatively easily with spray adhesive (although I braced it with 2 pieces of cheap wall moulding cut to length). As you can see from the closeup, it stands up well to being used as a pincushion. However, if you look closely at the full-map photo where the finished project is hanging on the wall, you can see from the way the light reflects off the plastic that even with lots of spray adhesive & heavy books holding it flat on the floor for several hours after glueing, there are still several large wrinkles that simply would NOT come out ""no matter what"" that are the result of the map constantly trying to re-roll itself. Since this photo was taken, I've also had to tape down the edges all around because it was beginning to peel itself away from the backing.

All in all, a good learning experience for the planned larger project, and a good map for general use as long as you're prepared for both the thinness and its annoying habit of always trying to re-roll itself.",4.0
Great map!  I used in my classroom for the kids to understand where all the different countries for the Olympics are located in relation to the United States,4.0

This is nice to have.  Very detailed.,4.0
Good quality and size,4.0
Love it,4.0
I didn't realize how small all the countries would be.,4.0
"Good size wall map with lots of details. I laminated over the lamination because the lamination was more like a gloss than a lamination and I intend to use wet erase markers on it. Still thought a larger map would me nice to see the small countries better, but was limited by my space for it. If I had it to do over again I wouldn't have bothered paying extra for the laminated version of this map. I would have gotten the regular map and laminated it at Kinkos,",4.0
Wanted to show my visiting friend from overseas just how big the world is compared to their country. This was a very helpful aid. Excellent quality and size.,4.0
"I really like this map. But it didn't arrive in the best condition. I see lots of mentions in the reviews of bent maps, so I didn't complain because I imagine any replacement would be shipped the same way, in a cardboard box and would end up bent anyway.
But the map still serves it's purpose. So we love it even with it's wrinkles and the one tiny tear.",4.0
"I would have liked the name of the states to have been a little bigger.  We plan to travel to a few countries in Asia and would like to start pining our travels.  There seems to be a too big of an ocean and the rest of the land seems so much smaller, although in reel life that is what it is",4.0

"It's a little smaller than I expected, however, nice.",4.0

Decent map for the price.,4.0
Great quality.,4.0
Have it hanging in our dining room and with my 4 year old placed pins in all the places I've traveled too as well as where we have lived. I definitely am happy with this purchase and expect it to be of use for a long time with my daughters.,4.0
I like it. It's up in our homeschool room and a good size. I REALLY like that it is laminated otherwise it wouldn't last very long in my house.,4.0
This map has clear labeling and great readability.,4.0
"came in perfect condition and very fast! was a bit smaller then advertised i measured 49"" x 30"" and is a bit thin but it will do for what i need it for.",4.0
not thick enough. but works,4.0
Exactly as stated. I wanted to put tacks on it to show where in the world I have been but then I realized I haven't been to that many cool places.,4.0
Same as everyone. Crease but no big deal. Looks great,4.0
"Nice sized map, fulfilled the purpose. Was disappointed because when taken out of shipping tube, it looked as though it had been rolled then bent. Six inches down from the top was a huge crease all the way across. It is on the wall and looks good, but wished it had been in better condition. Appreciated the fact it was already laminated, so didn't have to take that extra step myself.",4.0
"I really like the size of this map, as well as the laminate coating, which allows me to use dry erase markers for educational purposes.  Also, bright colors are eye catching.  A great study guide for $15.",4.0
"It is full of countries and cities and colors and and lakes, and continents and rivers and Antartica and all thre peoples of the world",4.0
This was the map we were looking for. It was big in size and laminated. There was a plus and minus for the lamination thickness. I liked the thin quality of the lamination because it was lighter and easier to hang. The down side was that it was too thin that the weight of the map started to rip off the thumb tacks. We had to add reinforcing tape. Still love the map. My 7 yr old daughter enjoys looking at the map and finding far off places.,4.0
"Looks great!  Comes as advertised.  I'm glad I have it, and I'm very glad it's laminated.  Quick and easy reference.  What's cooler to have on my wall than a world map like this?  Not much.  4 stars instead of 5 due to very negligible imperfections.  Still, I am very pleased with it and if I could give it 4.5 stars I would.  Worth every penny.",4.0
"This is a good map and I am happy with it but for those of us who need accurate measurements... it is physically 50x30 on the outside edge. However there are two borders which if removed make the map itself 47x37.5. The borders allow for some leeway when mounting as you can trim to fit. I gave it 4 stars because I bought foam that was 50 x 32 and would have saved myself some expense had I known that 30"" would have been plenty.",4.0
"This was the size I was hoping for and the fact that it has little plastic things for the edges to keep it straight. My son will love this when he is finished his year of studying abroad, he can put pins in the the countries he has been to!",4.0
"Good map, only problem I'm having is, all the markers I've tested on it leave a stain behind, but its a good general map",4.0
"Shipping was great, the laminated map is easy to view. Very happy to have bought these maps for a great gift.",4.0
"Great map, clear writing, perfect for our office.  It has a clear picture and is large enough to mark everywhere we sell the Rukknet throughout the world.",4.0
"It is perfect for what I puchased it for, sitting on my wall and looking pretty. The only problem I have is that the bottom is still curled after 2 months. Overall very nice and easy to mount.",4.0
Very helpful. Now I know where any place in the world is. All homes where children are growing up should have one!,4.0
"A little flimsy, but still I like this map. I like how it is laminated too. It looks very nice hanging on the wall in my dorm room.",4.0
Only con would be that the map not very sturdy-good colors and all.  Would recommend for wall. My son loves the map.,4.0
"Really nice. It is worth the money it costs.
It's big and detailed, we bought it to beat our geographical doubts!!",4.0
"Nice world map, I had it hung up in my entry way for a while as I wanted to add marks on it for all the places I had and have yet to visit. It didn't really go with the other decor though so I took it down. It would look nice in a den, office or bedroom.",4.0
I have turned my daughters room into an office and there were many nail holes in the walls . The size of this map is great for hiding these nail holes since it doesn't need to be painted at this time. Plus this is a real point of interest in the room. Who doesn't need a world map??,4.0

Great big maps! Look nice and durable from what's can tell. My apartment doesn't quite permit so now i just need a bigger wall...,4.0
"I was a little worried after reading several reviews, but decided to take the risk in buying one of these. I was relief that my map arrived in good conditon, no damaged was found.  I'm giving it four stars instead of five because the material was cheap and filmsy, you have to be extra careful when hanging onto the wall. Other than that, i'm quite satisfied with my purchase.",4.0
I map was bigger than I expected but I really liked it. I want to keep track of the trips I go with my grandkids.,4.0
"This is a great map to have in the classroom!  It is laminated to be durable and I like the way the countries are colored and labeled (simple and clear).  I also like the way the international date line is shown.  The only problem I had with this item is that I received it bent on one end.  The company sending the map had used a hard cardboard tube unfortunately, it was still received damaged.",4.0
"I am very pleased with this map, although I think the title is a bit misleading when it says 'laminated'.  The map does have a bit of a glossy finish, so it's not paper thin, but it's far from what I would consider a lamination. I will probably end up taking this to Staples or somewhere and having it laminated with something a bit heavier.",4.0
It came perfect! It came in a large heave cardboard tube with no creases or folds in it at all. I am happy with the quality. The kids think its really neat because its so large and we have it hanging in the den.,4.0
The map was great - everything seemed to be in order and it fit perfectly on the part of the wall I had gotten it for. Good quality and all the writing seems clear.,4.0
The maps quality is great. The countries pictures  could be larger. The water takes up to much space in my option.  I bought this map to teach my son geography,4.0
"Nice lamination, not to small of print, colors are bold yet light enough to read print clearly.  All in all very good purchase.",4.0
"The item was not rolled very well, as a result there were some folds when sent by Amazon. But still in decent condition to be put up on the wall. Light so normal sticking tape is good enough to hold it in place. Good for ten bucks.",4.0

"I love maps, bought this to plan out my future travels. I'm hoping to go to Anguilla for a month's vacation, or maybe two but couldn't find it on the map,lol. So this big map is missing one location. The shipping was not the best, it had a crease right down the center of the map. It should have been put in a cardboard/PVC sleeve for safe shipping. All in all i give it 4 Stars.",4.0
"I particularly like this this over sized map of the world as it stands out in itself. The finish allows one to point to different places unhesitatingly knowing they will not mar the finish. Because the countries are in tones of varying colors and labeled with eye friendly sizes, it is easier to spend more time checking out places you wish to locate. You also get a better sense of distances versus looking on a globe. This map is not only a great reference and teaching tool, it lends itself to be on the wall of your study or office.",4.0
I gave this product 4 stars because Russia is still one big area not broken up into its sections. Guessing it was made before 1990? Expo dry erase markers come off very easily. Map is large and I it's just what I expected!,4.0
The hooks don't catch the edges and its not as durable as you think.  Rips pretty easily even though its laminated.,4.0
