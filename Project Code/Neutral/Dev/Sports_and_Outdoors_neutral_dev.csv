"Purchased this for my two young children to use at the beach. Very happy with product. Good size and kids loved riding it on the waves. Unfortunately by day two the bow broke where rope tied on front, making a large whole. Item will not last long if pulling around.",2.0
When in storage loses air..,2.0
very thin material,2.0
the paddles are ok I would give them a 4 out of 5 . the boat it self I give a 2 . it deflated slowly. and the pump broke.,2.0
"These boats are really great if they stay inflated. I bought this one to replace one that I had to return to a store because it wouldn't stay inflated. This one does not stay inflated very well either. We have one other one that has worked out well, but 2 out of the 3 deflate quickly.",2.0
"I was so excited to find this because the reviews were amazing but I was really disappointed.  We just moved to a place with a small pond in our back yard and I thought this would be perfect to paddle around in.

Holy cow is it impossible to steer!!!  I couldn't believe it.  I have experience with canoes and kayaks and I almost got stuck in our tiny little pond because the end of the oars kept unscrewing and there was too much give in the spot that holds the oars on the boat.  If you're experienced with row boats this might work out for you, but it was not fun for me.  I couldn't get home fast enough.

The bottom also ripped the first time we used it.  It was still pond-worthy (it just punctured one side) but it was unfortunate timing, and reminded me it was only a $20 boat.

I also felt like I was going to fall into the water.  I've been in inflatable boats before but this one felt like it was going to sink at any moment.  This wouldn't have been a huge deal except it turns out that while the pond is pretty from far away, it's absolutely disgusting when you're sitting above it and I didn't want to touch the water, let alone swim in it.  So if you're in a bathing suit, that's great, but if you really actually don't want to get wet this may not be the boat for you.

The idea of it being a compact set is really nice.  It does come with oars, a manual pump, the boat and a string.  There aren't instructions, which isn't a big deal except for that the valves were stuck and the pump has a weird hose thing you're supposed to attach to it, which isn't obvious (it's closed at the end so it doesn't look like part of a pump).  If we'd looked at the box we would have figured it out sooner.  So I ended up using a meat thermometer to puncture the valve to get air into the boat, and using a different pump.

Basically I ended up feeling like it was a total waste of $20, and my expectations were really pretty low.  I just wanted something I could row around in.  Now I'm thinking we may just spring for a kayak because this was decidedly not fun.  It might be okay in a pool or some other sterile environment, but it's really not made for nature.",2.0
Bought this as a pool toy for my 8 year old son.  The bottom chamber never held air which made the boat impossible to sit up in (and paddle).,2.0
I had this boat for 2 days and it popped. My kids were just playing with it in the pool. Thank god it wasn't in the lake.,2.0
"The first boat split at the seam inside by where you sit. So the seller sent me another one right away and a label to ship the first one back to them, which was really nice. But the second one won't hold air and was used in our pool for all of a half hour. Haven't contacted the seller a second time. Not sure I'll even mess with it.",2.0
"This is a toy, the material is thin, just like on any other kid toys you buy at the store, the ores are flimsy... As far as the size goes, it is too big and bulky to be a toy. It leaked air, so we ended up returning it.",2.0
"Used it about four times and a hole appeared, fix it but next time too more holes.
Its in the trash now.
At least it wasn't that expensive but ill spend more next time on a better quality product.
Disappointing.",2.0
"These boats are nice way to float with minimal packing space.  But as soon as we inflated both boats each one had a hole already in it (one in the sidewall along a crease from folding, one in the floor panel).",2.0
i took this to a lake camping trip with friends hoping we could float around the lake . I was too heavy and even under the weight limit .if your buying this for your kids then i could see this being fun .,2.0
"The weight limit for this boat is 210lbs.  That's ridiculous for a boat that says it's a 2-person vehicle - I even looked up the average height-weight tables to see if I was crazy.  The maximum age for two individuals of average weight to fit into this boat, according to its specifications, is 13 years.

It seems like it's an ok product within those limitations - the pump worked fine, and all the paddle pieces were there, but I'm rating it low because I would never have bought this model if they had given the proper specs.",2.0
Thera-Band 65Cm/Green Exercise Ball Sold by: Kay Rehab was delivered without the instructions for inflation and the poster. The Thera-Band Pro Series SCP Ball (Retail Pack) sold by: Amazon.com LLC that I previously ordered in a different size came with everything included.,2.0
Disappointed -got the ball but no PLUG for it (and discovered this after blowing it up).  Now the hassle of finding and buying a plug for a product that should have come with it.  :(  Much more hassle than its worth.  This will end up in the back of the closet in short order.,2.0
"The ball says it could cause serious harm if inflated without using the instructions, but no instructions were received with the ball.  very disappointed.",2.0
"Sorry, but this 65cm ball is so small that it might work for a child.  It is not for a normal sized person 5'6"" (I am) - 6'1' as stated.  I have never seen a ball this small at my gym. Fully inflated no more than 1'4"" tall.  Big disappointment and wasted $.",2.0
I was very disappointed in this product because I still have not been able to get it properly inflated so I can use it.  I have bought 2 pumps and neither have worked to get it fully inflated.  The manufacturer needs to tell you when you buy it that you need to use a specific pump.  Apparently I am not the only one with this problem because I was able to find online that there were apparently other complaints.,2.0
"Size is measured as Diameter (vertical line through center of ball), is VERY undersized.

I ordered yellow. Advertised as 45 cm. (17.75"")

Ball, fully (overly) inflated: 35 cm. (13.75"".)

Less than 80%.

Which is more than it sounds like:Compared to real 45cm ball at the gym, this little guy is about 1/2 the size.",2.0
I have bought two of the exercise balls that are 65 cm.  One is just the right size for me when we put air in it.  The second one doesn't seem to blow up as large.,2.0
"don't place the ball next to and against wall, you may rip the paint from the wall. This was what happened to me when I had this ball in my office against the wall. It ate a chunk of paint from my office wall and the paint still stuck on the ball.",2.0
"I ordered this ball to use in an exercise for physical therapy and it was the perfect size.  I still cannot use it because it is not inflated and I can't find anywhere to inflate it.  I guess I should have asked about that.

I could only recommend this if you have something to inflate or or know someone who will help you do it.",2.0
wrong size came and was a much thicker material than my older theraband ball ..,2.0
"Aside from not popping so far, this ball has little to recommend it. First, it's not so much a ball as it is an egg -- its long diameter is a few inches more than its shortest diameter. Second, it's surface is slicker than other brands, making it difficult to use it in ways that depend on surface friction. Fortunately, I bought another brand and have happily switched. You should avoid that detour. Move on -- unless a slippery, egg-shaped ball is just what you're looking for.",2.0
"Needed to replace a wheel on a daily driver, and so I ordered these. One of the wheels came with a rusted bearing, but I needed the other so I wrote it off as a loss and didn't bother with a return.

After a few months other wheel's bearing is no longer rolls smoothly, and makes noises. The plastic is also cracked... I'll probably need to look for something else soon.",2.0
"these were a pain to put on the back of our old razor scooter, compared to some custom light-up ones we had on there for four years... the hole the axle goes into is easily blocked by the spacer they have inside, because heaven forbid they use a thousandth of a cent more metal in there.",2.0
"Wrong product, my fault - wheels too big for my application",2.0
"After two weeks of using these awesome wheels, they got messed up and the wheel is not round like before instead it has a flat shape.",2.0
"Wheels have worn down way too fast, 2 months of light use and they're down to the level of the o.e.m ones that last 3-4 years. I'm guessing a soft compound urethane, doen't matter how good the bearings are if the wheels wear flat in 2 months!",2.0
"the decal is purple, not blue, so don't let your little boy be disappointed.  the tools that come with the kit do not fit the classic razor kick scooter, you will need a smaller one.  grips went on easy with some lube, did not come with end caps.  purchased directly from their site for cheaper shipping charge.",2.0
"I ordered these wheels in CLEAR, Package says CLEAR on it, but product is RED!  The item is packaged in clear plastic, so it is obvious that these wheels are not CLEAR, but RED!",2.0
"Unlike the picture suggests, these wheels are actually the NEWER version of replacement wheels which have SMALLER rubber width making it very easy to wear off. Just look at the customer uploaded photos of the product and you will see for yourself that the seller false advertised this item. I am very upset that they sold me these wheels.",2.0
I was not super impressed with these at all. After a week they started to get flat spots from braking and my son replaced them after about two weeks. If you are buying them for a young person under 9 it should be fine but my son is 13 and all into the stunts and they didn't hold up... although they looked cool. You get what you pay for.,2.0
"The hubs are much larger than shown in the Pic; They LOOK great... however, The wheels are Skinned over the hub and the urethane is thin - they came apart easily. So much for a quality wheel_
The bearings are ABEC 5 rated_
Kryptonics have a more standard wheel that is built as shown.",2.0
"We bought this right before a camping trip so that we would be able to bring all 4 of our bikes with us. We set it up the night before to make sure that it fit and would hold all of our bikes, which it did, but we did not take it for a test drive. I wish we would have. The day we left for camping, we decided to go to Chick-Fil-A for lunch and then head out. I'm glad that we made that decision and didn't go straight to the freeway. As we were in the parking lot, we went over a very small bump and the rack slipped off of the back of the trunk and everything was dragging behind the car (Ford Fusion 2017). I have a really bad back and it was extremely difficult to help my husband try to get the bikes off of the rack and get the rack back up on the car. It left a dent and some small scratches on our brand new car. Our 2 kids and I ended up riding our bikes back home, (which thankfully was only about a mile away), and my husband was able to get his bike back on and he drove back home where we just dropped everything off and went without our bikes.",2.0
"I bought this so I could carry two men bikes (a 29 "" and a 27"") a woman's bike and a kid's bike. All in al they weight some 120 Pounds. I bought it because I own a 2 bike Rack form the same brand and it works just fine. However, when this rack arrived, it turns out its dimensions are somewhat different (should have donde my homework better, my fault so far). It took me awhile to figure out how to fit the bikes on it, but I finally did. Its kind of ok for short trips, but after awhile, you have to keep on checking on the straps because they tend to become looser with movement (not good if you do mountain biking and plan on driving on somewhat rough roads), so you have to keep stoping often just to check on them or else risk loosing your bikes. Because of this, at some point I pulled a little too hard and it dented my car, not too badly, but visibly. I am planing a long trip with my family and I think I will have to get a different rack so I don't have to keep worrying about loosing a good chunk of money invested in our bikes.",2.0
It barely holds three bikes. Forget about four.,2.0
"I have 4 different size bikes - 1 girls 20"", 1 girls 24"", 1 girls 26"" and a man's mountain bike. The process of getting these 4 bikes onto a bike rack isn't easy. I'm pretty good at it now that I've done it a few times but it still isn't fun. That's the reason I returned this version of the Allen 4-bike trunk rack and purchased the Allen Sports Premier 4-Bike Trunk Rack.

This version has pins that you have to set after unfolding it. The Premier model, however, does not. It simply unfolds and locks into place. This version also has nylon straps to secure each bike. You must thread the strap and tighten. Whereas the Premier model has rubber straps that are very simple to secure.

This isn't a simple process. I am glad that I found a rack that is simple to use so as not to add to the complication. Go for the Premier model.

Note, the hooks on the straps to connect to the car are unprotected metal (on both models). I was afraid this would scratch my paint so I simply covered them with black duct tape. It is thin enough to still allow the hooks to slip in the crack around the trunk but soft and strong enough to not scrape metal-on-metal.",2.0
"I searched all over before purchasing adn was sure this was the one, only hte full list is on;y printed on the box and didn't work on the Dodge grand caravan!",2.0
"It worked okay on my Subaru Impreza, but has problems on a Honda Accord and Ford Fusion: Neither of these cars has a good place for the hooks to attach under the bumper -- I was always afraid they would fall off.  Also the clips on the side started to chip the paint of the trunk of the Fusion.  In the end I went to U-Haul and had them install a hitch on the Fusion and got a 4-bike holder that fits into the hitch.  This is a much better solution and holds the bicycles more stably with no fears of them falling off.",2.0
"We used this rack with a Mazda 5 minivan and a Jetta Sportwagen, moving it between the two as necessary. We primarily carried one adult bicycle, but sometimes two adult bikes plus two little kids bikes. We made several successful 3 hour drives with the rack. Then, the elastic parts of the side straps just broke one day, one while tightening during installation and the other just after a drive while we were disengaging the rack. Pretty scary to think that they could have snapped while we were driving on one of those long trips. So this rack served us well for six months, but I would hoped it would last a little longer than 6 months!",2.0
"Although the communication with the seller was 5 star, the item itself arrived broken and I have to rig it every time I use it. I do not trust the unit to hold our bikes securely due to the ripped off strap. So we are currently looking for other options to transport our bicycles.",2.0
The metal mounting clips scratched the edges of my trunk lid. I'm more meticulous than the average person and was still not able to place the clips in such a way that they would not wear on the lip of my trunk lid. This issue also made the mounting process inconveniently long. I since added a tow hitch and hitch rack and am very happy with that setup. Overall quality seemed pretty good.,2.0
"Well, this fell apart in 9 months.  And even though it was made for 4 bikes, they all had to be adult bikes as it isn't designed to hold kids bikes.",2.0
"My son loves this tricycle, however if he is biking down a slight hill and turns quickly,it jack knifes. He has fallen several times, fortunately he always wears a helmet. I'm glad I only paid $[...] for this at a garage sale.",2.0
"We have been very disappointed with this trike.  Not only will the steering wheel not stay positioned properly, but it is very tippy and dangerous.  My son has had this trike for a year, and now at 3 it is still a hazard.  Children sit up so high and the broad turning radius causes the trike to tip over very easily causing a big fall.  We are going to buy a Kettler instead and anticipate better results.  Cute to look at, but best left at the store, at least for 3 year olds.",2.0
"I play executive courses in Florida and many of these are located in housing developments.  Flags are frequently in front of houses and or trees.  It is difficult to obtain the correct yardage for these holes.  There also is very little support on how to align on the target whether it is the flag, flag pole, front of green, etc.  My iGolf GPS unit is much more useful.",2.0
"This unit works effectively only under 200 yds. and will not find a pin on the green.
In order to get a reading, you must focus on a golf cart, a tree, or a person on the green. The rangefinder can work well in hunting when a large stationary target is available, but for golf, although very accurate, has limited application.",2.0
"I had this rangefinder once and sold it, I miss it so I got the one I have now, but it seem this one take longer to get my yardages, also I feel it does not fine a long range like 200 yards and be on.and some times it does give me the yarders, could it be a bad battery?
Eddie Irlanda",2.0
This product does not lock on to flags over 130 yards with any consistency. I would not recommend this item.,2.0
"I bought this at a local Sporting Goods store for $150 because of the price and brought it to the range.  I could range the 50, 100 and 150 signs.  I was able to range the 181 yard flag...once only.  And the bright yellow 200 yard sign....forget it. I tried until the battery was dying, balanced it against a board and still couldn't hit it. Forget all the other pins.  I was able to return it and am waiting for a Nikon with it's First Priority program to go on sale.  Maybe good for other uses, but not golf.",2.0
Returned this pogo stock.  My son complained that his knees hurt when he tried to use it.  It is probably great for a larger person than he is.,2.0
"I really take time to read reviews before making any purchases on Amazon. This is not safe for teenagers, even experienced ones. This model is way too hard to jump on and way too easy to fall off of. The springs are too tight and even the hardest jumps don't make the unit move with ease.",2.0
"We had to return ours for a refund, fulfilled by Amazon quickly and without problems. The pogo stick wasn't structurally true, as the handles weren't parallel to the foot pegs! Additionally, one of the handles was shaped lower than the other and where the metal was curved/bent (handles and the body) it had small stress fractures. Beyond that, it seemed decent quality materials for the price. Did not contact the company for resolution/replacement, so uncertain if this is an exception for their product.  Hopefully this won't be your experience.",2.0
"This pogo stick is much too heavy, stiff, and bulky.  It is very difficult to jump on because of this.  I had to return it for my 14 year old son who is normally very coordinated.  Not so with this item.",2.0
They were used for 2 small kids under the age of 10 in a tent. Neither of them held full air all night and 1 stopped holding air all together after the 5th use. Kinda bummed.,2.0
Theyre just okay. Couldve honestly bought a pool float and it would work the same,2.0
Small not twin but more like a swimming pool floater but better than sleeping directly on groud.,2.0
Very heavy item and good for one use or trip. They fall apart easy after.,2.0
"First one we bought was good and lasted a few years, second one is slowly leaking from the first inflation and we can't find the leak, so it's useless. Poor quality control.",2.0
It DOES NOT STAY INFLATED!  Was so happy with it until enough time passed to make it clear it DOES NOT DO THE JOB.,2.0
Sent it back. Terrible and narrow.,2.0
"A good value but this pinch style air valve is extremely hard to operate and inflate. It makes it hard for the mattress to deflate, but very hard to inflate. I have stopped using them and purchased something else. It literally took 10-15 minutes to deflate the mattress, all the while having to lay on it to force the air out and I had to continually pinch the valve to release the air.",2.0
"Pros: The mattress, once inflated, held air and comfortable for my kids to sleep on for three consecutive nights of camping. It seemed sturdy/well-constructed. Neutral: It is heavy, intended of use at home or car camping. This mattress is much narrower than a standard twin size air bed, fine for a kid maybe, but probably not an adult. Cons: This sucker is really HARD to blow up and even worse trying to get it to deflate. Could not get our battery-operated Coleman air pump to work with the nozzle and had to blow them up by mouth, slowly. At the end of the trip, we had to try to pinch the nozzle open while simultaneously applying pressure to the mattress to attempt to squeeze all the air back out. It was so tedious and difficult to deflate one mattress that, even though I'm frugal, I simply sliced open the second one and threw it out.
(If this review was helpful for you, please give it a ""thumbs up"" below, thanks!)",2.0
"I bought like 6 of these and they all deflated within 2 weeks, tops. Only buy for a very short, short term use.",2.0
They were not as  supportive as I thought they would be for an adult. They are fit more for young kids or teenagers.,2.0
pretty large and comfortable mattress but mine got hole in it the next day using it in the house,2.0
"This is very difficult to deflate. You have to force the air out of it while at the same time pressing in on the valve, which is tricky and time-consuming. There is nothing worse than wanting to pack your gear and leave after a camping trip and having to take 10-15 minutes to deflate your mattress. I have three of them so it can take as long as an hour. Other than that, it works fine and does not leak very much air overnight.",2.0
"Very hard to blow up, even with air-pump.",2.0
"unfortunately its not comfortable at all, in fact, I ended up throwing it out of the tent and just sleeping on the ground.
Also, not a good buy for hiking/backpacking trips as you will literally pass out from going light headed while trying to blow this thing up. Last thing you want to do after a long hike.",2.0
Like A durable cheat float mat,2.0
I didn't look at the item specs before I purchased but this mattress is way too heavy for backpacking.  It weighs 3 lbs.  My tent doesn't even weigh that much.,2.0
I have bought 2 of these they both popped within 2 weeks with the weight of my 50 lb son.,2.0
Got a hole after using it once,2.0
Thought this was self inflatable which it wasn't but served the purpose.  A little slick so slick sleeping bags slide off.,2.0
Too narrow and flimsy.  Didn't like,2.0
"It feels much heavier than 3 pounds, it feels more like 8. Inflates and works as described but very heavy.",2.0
I wish I read the reviews more carefully - this makes a horrible backpacking / camping mattress because it's pretty much impossible to blow up without a pump. I have used inflatable mattresses on previous camping trips that are easily blown up using your mouth and just assumed this one worked similarly. Unfortunately not the case.,2.0
"These are so heavy! Then when you unpack it, it takes forever to blow up by mouth and then sleeping bags slip off of them all night.",2.0
Doesn't hold air.,2.0
takes forever to inflate.,2.0
takes way too long to inflate,2.0
"Very difficult to inflate and deflate.  I bought this and a self inflating mat to test out the difference.  I ended up not even using this as I didn't have a pump to inflate it.  If you buy one, make sure you have something otherwise you will end up light headed from trying to blow the thing up.  The valve also made it very difficult to deflate.  I think it will work for some but I found it more nuisance than it was worth.  Somewhat heavy and awkward when compared to the self inflating mats.  If you have a few extra $ I would spend a little more on a better one.  I will probably give this one away or use it as a pool float.",2.0
"This ""kids sized"" mattress is not kid sized. My son rolls off everytime he tries to switch positions. Just not big enough for him. Before you think it, he is a really skinny 8 year old.",2.0
LASTED ONE NIGHT,2.0
"You get what you pay for I guess. These worked great for the kids, less so for me. At 6'1"", 195 I can't keep inflated overnight.  Not super easy to inflate or deflate.",2.0
"I was very disappointed to open these finally for the summer season and find that one of them doesn't hold air, brand new.  As I bought them a long time ago, returning is not an option.  Too bad, because overall I like the comfort and ease of blowing up and size.  If you buy these, beware....blow them up right away to see if they are damaged so that you are within the return limits....",2.0
First time we used them my wife woke up in the middle of the night to a deflated mattress.  The seems were leaking air. For the price i guess you cant expect much.,2.0
"This product has a warning on it. 'WARNING"": This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. OKAYYYYYYYYY. You want people to lay and sleep on this thing and it can cause reproductive harm? Really? Get this crap off the market and OUT of our country! We don't need any more poison in any form in this country. I didn't even take it out of the box to see what it was like. I'm not putting my mouth to blow up a device that causes those problems. YUCK.",2.0
Not very comfortable,2.0
I would not buy this if you don't want to spend all day deflating this item! It was terrible air leaked out with the plug closed.,2.0
"The quality of the product is very decent, its a good folded size for camping - BUT - its very uncomfortable.
I suggest using this inflated only half way or even lesser.
There is a lot of movement by this mattress during usage and that contributes to a miserable night. I like Intex products a lot as they are a great value for money. But, I recommend using a wider mattress.",2.0
"This product was fine the day I inflated it. Actually it was fine two days after inflating it... Then it deflated. After Two days of use, this product would not retain air whatsoever. I say save your money and purchase something better, or just avoid this at all cost. Very disappointed in the durability of this thing.",2.0
"pain in the butt to inflate/deflate.

not very comfortable",2.0
"it deflates overnight and not comfortable .
if you want to use it in the pool or water , it is a great choice thought",2.0
"Do not use during winter, it gets COLD. Summer only for this guy. It is somewhat comfy, but a pain to blow up, and a bigger pain to deflate. It has no deflate valve, just one of those standard pool toy nipples that you have to squeeze the whole time to deflate. In fact, you may just want to use this a pool/lake toy, and something else for the mattress.",2.0
"I don't often give a poor review. Unfortunately, this product's biggest shortfall, the fill-valve, is the reason why. It (the fill-valve) is small, most difficult by which to fill and exhaust air, that the larger air mattress I used previously, proved far and away an easier product to use. This one will test the lung capacity of an Olympic cyclist, and if you're a smoker, or suffer from COPD or any other lung-related woes, this is not the mattress for you. And exhausting this turkey is just as frustrating, as the tiny valve demands constant massaging as you fold and exhaust, fold and exhaust. Bum Safari, man...Cost is not always indicative of a superior product, but there are better alternatives out there for your money. This one should definitely be avoided, in my (seasoned) opinion...",2.0
Developed leaks on first camping trip.,2.0
"I mainly use this to have for a snap after lunch. After two months, the mattress start to leak.",2.0
You get what you pay for.,2.0
"The ""pillow"" is no thicker than the rest of the mattress.  I'm going to have to go buy pillows because this was a real disappointment.",2.0
Not easy to blow up and keep it that way.,2.0
"I was torn when I read the previous reviews. I tried to listen to the more positive reviews.

Unfortunately, I have to agree with the negative comments: this one will not hold the air for too long. I can pump it up and lie down on it but after 1-2 hours my butt will touch the floor. I'm 165lbs, so I do not think it's because of putting excess weight onto it.

It's just not that great of a quality. If you are looking for a mattress to rest an hour or so on, this one might be right for you.",2.0
you get what you pay for,2.0
Had Hard time filling air in this .  Deflating is another big pain .,2.0
"Matress is air tight, tough quality, but is not very comfortable. Maybe use a piece of foam on top for extra comfort. It is softer then the ground tho.",2.0
"There are just too many other easier, better, and more comfortable air mats out there....even at this price. Pass it by.",2.0
Not as described,2.0
Lumpy and easy to roll off. Both of my kids had  hard time sleeping on this and they are both very sound sleepers. We used these for one trip and then sold them in our yard sale.,2.0
I do not like it.,2.0
Aired this up and it was flat next morning without even using it. Must have been shipped with a hole already,2.0
2 of the 4 we purchased held their inflation after the first camping trip.  Unable to return since purchased more than 30 days ago. Disappointed.,2.0
"Far too heavy for backpacking, but maybe good for guests at the camp. Seems like it's nicely constructed.",2.0
Looks ok but were loosing air over time,2.0
Too heavy,2.0
"The small nozzle is not very pump friendly.  I suppose it is better than sleeping directly on the ground, but not by much.  This will be the kids air mattress.",2.0
Too narrow. Buy a Coleman instead.,2.0
It lasted only a night.,2.0
"I so far am impressed to the quality of this mattress, it is more heavy than I thought it would be and more durable, was thinking it would be more of a floatation device type mattress but I was wrong it is much more durable than that. It takes about 15 to 20 minuets to blow up by mouth with rest in between breaths.  next time I blow up i will count the # of breaths it takes.

Edited review: after using 4 times in more that ideal conditions it sprang a unfixable leak.",2.0
"I picked up four of these for less than $30 total thinking they would be great for camping.  They are basically heavy duty pool floats.  I would not count on blowing these up using your own lungs unless you have an hour to spare and don't mind passing out.  They inflated easily enough with an electric pump but you must have an adapter that will work with the ""pool float"" valve.  I took a bicycle pump camping and even with that it took ten minutes of steady work to inflate one mattress.  Deflating them is equally difficult because of the valve.  These are big enough to sleep on unless you are huge but I don't think they are comfortable.  I did not sleep well on this and had a lot of sore spots when I got up.  I let a it of air out halfway through the night to make it less firm but that didn't help much.  I wound up cutting them with scissors and tossing them just so I wouldn't have to spend an hour deflating them.  I've got one left over, I'll use it as a pool float in the summer and spend more money on nicer camping mattresses.",2.0
"I am so dissapointed with these! You MUST get a pump or they do not blow up! We spent 20+ minutes trying to inflate one and were red in the face when we gave up. It was also very difficult to deflate too. The fabric is very thick and these are very heavy. I would never be able to take these on a long hike because of the weight. I thought I was getting something I could blow up with lung power relatively easy, this is not at all what I was thinking they would be.",2.0
"Comfy, good size, easy to blow up, but didn't hold air all night. Was very disappointed.",2.0
we bought two of them and ended up having to go buy an air matress because one of them couldn't hold the air very well. Ended up throwing them both away :(,2.0
Looses air over time,2.0
"Bought this mat last minute before a camping trip. It arrived swiftly, but that was the only good thing. Blew it up before bed and awoke on the ground. The air had seeped out during the night. Blew it up again, same thing happened the 2nd night. Great price, but unfortunately it didn't pass the camping test.",2.0
"This is not a 100% fabric mattress!  The bottom is just vinyl, which means if you use it a lot, the vinyl will stretch and shortly develop leaks.  I gave it two stars because under light usage, it would probably be all right.  But my last all-fabric air mattress lasted thirty years until a leak developed.",2.0
It's really thin width wise.  I'm getting something else.,2.0
"These were comfortable and stayed inflated all night.

They were a complete pain to inflate. We ended up bringing a bike pump with an adapter. The adapter didn't fit so I had to jury rig a gasket to get a good seal (not a great seal). We were able to inflate them but it took about 20-25 minutes each. Not fun. I wish we would have gotten self-inflating models, or at least something that came with a pump.",2.0
"This mattress takes forever to blow up by mouth. It has the valve that you have to squeeze while blowing into like a pool toy. While it seems pretty sturdy and held my weight well when I tried it out, this will not work for me for backpacking which is what I was hoping to use it for.",2.0
Tjis only lasted a couple of weeks before getting flatter than a pancake. Did not hold air long. Cheap.,2.0
"These are ok.  They have to be inflated by mouth, and our air pump wasn't compatible with them.  I wish I'd known that before taking them camping! Deflating them was worse, because you need to pinch the valve to let the air out- with two of these my hand started cramping up.
I'm keeping these as back ups, but will be buying a different air mattress for future camping trips.",2.0
"I'm sure this is a great when inflated, but after trying for 10+ minutes and nearly passing out I gave up on it.  A friend at the campsite had and airpump and we still wouldn't get this thing past 10% inflation.  I'd return it, but I didn't have room in my luggage and I gave it to someone else at the end of the trip who said they'd give it a shot.",2.0
"Don't buy this if you are on the large size, this product doesn't even fit a slim teenager",2.0
To difficult to blow into.,2.0
"Hard to inflate,to short ,losses air over night. Better than the ground,still has a purpose.",2.0
"it looks really good on pics of ad, but found it's hard to inflate and the other way. it's not thick/cushion enough to hold your body from the ground/floor - it would be enough for kids. if you want to use it, you would probably leave it to outside for at least a week to remove the strong odor.",2.0
Never used it after the first try at blowing it up.  Maybe I'm not the camping type.,2.0
feels like a swimming pool float. The ridges are too deep and when you move it will wake up the neighborhood ..even with a thick comforter on top.,2.0
Basically a raft one would use in a pool. Not much comfort when used while camping. Cheap enough to not demand a refund.,2.0
"This camping mattress is not uncomfortable at all, once it's filled up and you're sleeping on it.  That's the easy part.  The agonizingly long part is blowing it up, if you don't have an inflater.  It's heavy as well, and does not fold up neatly so as to fit in a backpack.

Although heavy, ironically this is also apparently prone to leaks, even when it is cared for quite well.  On the second or third using, ours developed a slow leak, which resulted in the user unhappily awakened at 2:30am and again at 7:00am because she was lying flat on the cold ground, forcing her to re-inflate it with half a dozen deep breaths.  No one needs that, not at 2:30 am.",2.0
"These pads almost achieve the great bang for the buck rating, except for one unbelievably annoying flaw.  They're nearly impossible to deflate, and really difficult to inflate.  Inflating them requires that you pinch the valve ever so slightly to let the air in, much in the same way you would a beach ball.  Deflation requires the same pinching of the valve, but here is the crazy part.  Since you want to roll the mattress up from the opposite end of the mattress, toward the valve, you've got to somehow be rolling the mattress, while stretching a hand to the opposite end (long ways) in order to pinch the valve and let the air out.  So, deflation is basically a 2-person operation - one person to roll, and the other to be at the other end pinching the valve.  Not cool.",2.0
too small  I could not get comfortable on it at all,2.0
i bought this to use when i go camping with my finacee. it fits perfectly in the tent we purchased but it went flat very quickly and we got one use out of it.,2.0
"I was looking to replace one.  I ordered the same product number as on the box, but this one is much smaller.",2.0
These only lasted three days on a building floor before they sprung a leak.  Disappointing product and wouldn't order again.,2.0
"Priced right, good construction, difficult and time consuming to inflate by mouth. I've had to exert way too much lung power, more than what should be necessary to inflate something this size, and there's nothing wrong with my lungs. For that one reason, crappy valve design, I cannot recommend this. The best camping mattress I ever had was a Vietnam era ""rubber lady"" If you can find one in good condition, grab it.",2.0
"After the third use, there are now leaks but I am unable to pinpoint where they are to patch it up. It did come with 1 patch.",2.0
"This mattress is too narrow to be comfortable. You fit on it fine but because of the air, I found that it was a balancing act to switch positions. I tried more and less air to no effect. I think if you sleep on your back and stay in that position it would be fine but unfortunately that is not how I sleep. The strong vinyl smell does go away after airing out though.",2.0
"Ok, I guess for a cheap mattress. Used twice in a tent and it failed. Haven't found a good airmat yet and this one is no charm.",2.0
They pop very easily so it's not worth the money.  It would be best to invest in a mattress pad or better air mattress.,2.0
"This did stay inflated and I guess it what you'd expect for the price- but the twin size was so narrow that my sleeping bag hung over the edges.  Good for kids, maybe, but I wish I had spent a few more dollars on something I could feel comfortable rolling over on while I slept.",2.0
"I'm convinced that these mattresses have the wrong type of valve. It has a small nipple and after you inflate the mattress you push in on it to retract the valve back inside of the mattress. The valve is just like the valve is on a cheap beach ball.
One other thing I didn't like was the size. The add say's it's 26.5 wide but when you blow it up it's less which makes for too tiny of a mattress if you're using it for sleep instead of a water floatation raft.

I had bought several of these for camping and returned them all and replaced them with the same companies ( INTEX ) extra wide mattresses. The valves on the extra wide are totally different. They're made with a hard vinyl valve that's recessed into a hard vinyl pocket. The valve is made so when you put air in it won't come out. It has a stop on the inside if the valve that's like a flap that closes when air starts to escape. To deflate you just unscrew the valve and it deflates in seconds.

I would highly recommend ( anyone interested in a great quality mattress ) the INTEX extra wide. Only 6 dollars more.",2.0
"My daughter and I each bought this mattress for a 2 day camping trip. Mine worked fine, hers lost a little air. We took them again on another 2-day trip and this time they both lost air. I was sure that Intex had a good warrantee but when I just looked it up the warranty is for 30 days from the date of delivery, IF you purchased them directly from Intex. I am disappointed.",2.0
After using the mattress for about 10-15 times it now leaks air.  It was kept inside my camper for the most part but now it will leak completely over the course of a few hours.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Beware!,2.0
too big for hiking trips. no go on backpacking trips. Too bulky and heavy. But would probably serve well on a regular camping trip. Good decent quality also.,2.0
Dissapointed that it is slightly too narrow.  Overall the product quality is great for the price.  It's just too narrow to lay on your back because your arms don't rest of the mattress they hang to the floor and that is very uncomfortable.  Only could sleep on either side.,2.0
"The reviews that criticized the valve design of this air mattress were much too polite. Yes the air mattress is a pretty good value, but only if you don't have to write off more than half the cost for return shipping, as I did. The problem is that the plastic inflation nozzle has some kind of inner valve that's apparently supposed to help prevent air escaping, even if the plug isn't inserted. It works only too well. I have both a manual and electric air mattress pump, neither of which could be used due to the oddball nature of this valve. To inflate, you have to squeeze the plastic nipple into a sharp oval while blowing into the mattress. Because of the 6"" thickness of the mattress, plus pillow, it's very tedious to air it up. Deflating it is even worse. Imagine how difficult it is to squeeze the plastic nipple into an oval shape with one hand, while trying to press the air out with the other and whatever body parts you can place on the mattress. Once inflated it's fine, but the hassle involved in blowing it up and forcing the air out when you're through makes it just too annoying to bother with. Be warned.",2.0
"This is a good camping mattress for small kids, but not adults.  I couldn't sleep a wink on it. Its very narrow and the ""pillow"" hurt my neck.",2.0
these are ok but they are too close to the eyes on the inside.  Adults can't wear them and my 12 year old isn't all that ok with them either cause she swimms on the swim team.  I bought them for her and I feel like I wasted my money.,2.0
We went out to purchase a nicer pair of goggles for our daughter and went with the speedo brand thinking they were superior to the cheap ones at the local big box stores. She has worn them three times and the third time she put them on they ripped half way apart at the nose piece. I am very dissapointed with the quaility I thought that speedo would take more pride in their product,2.0
My daughter is only 2 years old.  She has only ridden her trike 3 times and the cable has already broken.  Getting replacement was a pain.  What happened w/ the quality of Radio Flyer.  I bought this based on the name brand!!!!,2.0
"I purchased this bicycle for my 1 year old daughter so that I could push her around.  The rear handle does not control the steering.  The seat is so small that it only provides a little ledge for her bottom.  The pedals only go in one direction. If you pick up the bike from the handle bars, it pops right out of the front wheel component.  It is not very sturdy.  Maybe it will ride better as a tricylce when she gets older.",2.0
"The listing says 12-pack.  What I received was ONE ""cheapo"" frisbee.  The price paid just equals the value received [barely!].  It is not the savings as detailed / expected by the listing.",2.0
Not for use with a dog!!  Our small dog quickly chewed and damaged it within seconds.  Still flies but we quit using it because she kept removing more of the plastic each time she retrieved it.  Our son-in-law had some old frisbees and they stood up much better.,2.0
"For being a product of the original wham-o company, this frisbee is cheaply made and has a shallow dish.  Very disappointed with this purchase.",2.0
My lab destroyed it in 5 seconds.,2.0
"these are not like the ones of the good old days..They are flimsy, there are NOT even made in the U.S. I am sorry I bought 2 of them..",2.0
"Terrible quality, the frisbee arrived bent and barely flies.  For a <$5 purchase, not worth the aggravation to return it.  Build quality is just terrible -- the free discs that banks, etc. give away are sturdier.

Just another piece of junk plastic made in China.

Avoid.",2.0
"For people, these frisbees would probably be fine, but not for dogs.  Ours destroyed them immediately, leaving sharp edges.  We had to throw them out.",2.0

"I bought this item for my 2 year old grandson who lives in another state. He is average in size and height but the trike is too short for him. This product was suppose to be for a 1-3 year old. My grandson can't really use it as it was intended because his knees have to bend too much. After a few weeks (which was obviously too long) my son decided it would be best to exchange it for the classic red trike with pedals and a push handle. I tried to complete this exchange since I ordered it,  but it didn't work because the new bike doesn't show up in the items I can exchange it for (don't know why). So I tried the refund option. I would have to have the old trike sent in two days which is impossible, having to take it apart and it being a weekend. As far as I am concerned this trike is not usable for a two year old! I want my grandson to have a gift he can use so I'm ordering the replacement bike and taking the loss! I am disappointed in this whole transaction. I am a new prime member and a long time customer. I hope Amazon reviews what I have written. I told my son to give the trike away to someone else. At least it will make me feel better!!",2.0
"Very cheaply made, should have known better since it was from China and not USA.  4 of the screws were missing, so had to find some in my garage to replace them.  Some of the paint chipped in the process of assembling it.  Not very impressed, especially with this price tag of $65.00.",2.0
"My son received this tiny trike as a gift for his first birthday. It's absolutely adorable - there's no doubt about that. But it's just never been a good toy for him. When he was small enough that it fit him well, he didn't understand the concept of pushing himself on it. Now that he understands how to use it, he's too big and gets frustrated because his feet hit the front wheels. He's 18 months and about 34 inches tall and I feel like he's already outgrown it physically, even though he only recently grew into it developmentally.",2.0
i bought this for my grandson. The assembly of the toy is horrible. The screws will not work the way it is shipped. I had to drill larger holes and use wax for putting the few screws. The assembly of the toy took three times more time than it should take. The toy is smaLL.,2.0
"WAY too small for my 30"" 18-month-old.  When he sat on it his thighs were level with the ground and his feet didn't have enough room to push without hitting the front or rear wheels, sometimes getting tangled up under the wheels.  The seat is less than 8"" off the ground.  Other than that, it's a pretty solid build, easy to assemble (harder to take apart to return!) and a good price.  I would have gotten it for my son when he turned one or even earlier -as soon as he took his first steps- if I had known just how tiny it really is.  These people who say their kids are still riding them at 3 and four years and up either have tiny children or are being paid to write ridiculous reviews.",2.0
Works great. My dog hasn't destroyed it like she has other rings. The two I bought should last until spring unless they are buried in the snow. These rings fly farther and straighter than the Brand X rings.,2.0
"The bike is too small for most 18 month olds.  I'm not sure what ages this is for, but their tiny feet will get jammed up in the wheels.  The paint started peeling on mine after about two weeks.  I'm not sure about radio flyer's QC these days.",2.0
"The 4 wood screws that attach the steering assembly do not fully set into the predrilled holes.  Thus you can not complete assembly.  Have tried several known tricks to resolve.  This could be a defect on this unit as we have purchased before and not encountered this issue.  But, today is granddaughter's birthday and she will not be able to enjoy her gift. Of course, I can take to a shop and resolve with custom effort.  I am dissatisfied with this purchase.",2.0
"The metal piece inside the handlebars broke within a week of minimal use. The wheels are thin crappy plastic. The wood is very light, not solid like the trike I was replacing. I am very disappointed in the quality. I expected better from Radio Flyer.",2.0
"Flies well, but the inner hard plastic ring came with a break in it (I think), and broke in a couple of other places as well. Not durable, and I would not purchase again.",2.0
"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my grandaughter who is now one and a half years old. It was great in the house, however it did not fare well outdoors about six months later. There seems to be a problem with the steering column which broke while she was riding it on the side walk. I don't think this is the first time it has happened as I have read other posts with similar steering problems. I guess many people may have just thrown it out and the company is not aware of this problem. I am contacting customer service as they do have a one year warranty on this item.",2.0
"I agree with previous reviews. Our little one has been offered this toy and likes it very much, but got very upset when she tried to steer. The wheels do not follow the direction of the stiring wheel, it got loose and may even be dangerous for a kid; We tried to tighted the whole system so that it would not steer and she would only go forward or backward in one direction (less fun but more safe) but it did not worked since it keeps getting loose.

I would not recommend this product unless you have a solution to this problem.",2.0
"My son received this as a gift and my husband put it together according to the instructions, but the steering wheel does not move the wheel base.  They move independently.  Does anyone know the secret/or obvious fix for this?  He says he followed the instructions and has put together many other toys.  Radio Flyer customer service isn't open on the weekend.",2.0
"The size of this toy was too small for us.

Maybe it was because our daughter was tall for her age, or maybe the sizing is just off. At ten months our daughter was big enough to sit on this flat-footed and push it around. At this age though, she never got the feel for it. She preferred pushing it around from the side or from the front, which were both awkward.

By the time she got comfortable riding on it, the seat seemed too low and the entire process was equally awkward.

Overall, I was happy with the quality of the toy. Word of caution though, the wheels smell horrible when first removed from the package. If giving this as a gift, I'd recommend letting them air out some ahead of time.",2.0
"My son loved his Radio Flyer Trike when he got it. Scooted around all over the house. But, I noticed he outgrew it long before his friends had outgrown their plastic ride-ons (like the Little Tykes Push and Ride). Problem is the wheels start to get in the way of the feet--but that doesn't seem to happen on the Little Tykes design.

Then, the neck of the thing started going loose and eventually hopelessly wobbly. Steering it was then impossible. I called Radio Flyer--they weren't much help for this problem and we eventually got rid of the scooter in a garage sale. We also had a choking hazard problem with Radio Flyer's push wagon -- several screws came off and I would find them and the washers strewn about the house. Regrettably, I have now pretty much sworn off the brand.",2.0
"Nowhere on your site did it give the dimensions of this disc.  Consequently, the two that I ordered were too big for my dog and it isnot worth paying for shipping it back.  Luckily, I ordered one of the smaller ones so we can play with my dog until she gets too many bite marks on it.  My bad.",2.0
"I bought this small 10 inch sprint ring by accident, and I am disappointed. I knew how great the 13 inch ring is, but the small ring is no better than my standard frisbee. I also find it very hard to throw, it tends to tilt over to one side and drop down. I tried to follow the instructions and bend the ring slightly, but it doesn't help much.
So my recommendation is: stay away from the 10 inch ring, but get the 13 inch ring. The Pro ring is pretty amazing.",2.0
"My son received it as a gift for his first birthday. It was already too small for him. It didn't stop him from riding it all over though. Within a few months, a crack showed up in the steering column. It didn't take long to break all the way through and now the steering is loose. I haven't been able to find replacement parts. Sounds like I got a defective one since all the other reviews call them ""durable"".",2.0
"The front light was DOA and the back light took me a day to figure out. I resorted to finding instructions written by previous owners.

The back light seems to be working just fine. I've not yet mounted it but that appears to be the consensus with previous reviewers. Flipping through the various light modes I felt like Kate Reid in the Andromeda Strain. It's BRIGHT & I'm seeing more stars than this product's reviews.

You get what you pay for, basically.",2.0
"I used to use this lamp. The good: it throws some light. Bad: Fragile (stem broke after a couple of months), poor light output, short battery life and really, really hard to change the batteries! Poor Light: It is really only useful for low speed commuting in otherwise partially lighted areas, like with streetlights and such. Anything above 10 mph overruns the headlights, with the subsequent potential for nasty surprises.

We have to all realize that it is foolish to drive a bike in the dark with this type of near-toy lamp. For my safety I got a 200 lumen DiNotte to replace it for about $150. Worth it's (very light) weight in gold! There are many other similar lighting options, but I would avoid this unit unless you are riding slow and generally protected in low traffic areas. Forget about using it with traffic! Haven't you all seen a bicyclist with similar dim lamps and barely detect them at a relatively close range? With the DiNotte, sometimes drivers flash me to turn it down! I have heard the same for the MiniNewt and others in that light range. About 150 lumens seems to me to be the entry point for serious lighting.

I would not recommend it.",2.0
"I love the features offered by these lights, however, like several other reviewers, the headlamp stopped working after two uses. Apparently it had faulty circuitry that ""blew"" after battery power was put through it a couple of times. Too bad. If the product had lasted, I would have given it five stars. Maybe it was just a single bad batch from the factory since others have had good luck with theirs. Definitely worth the price ... if it works.",2.0
"The lights on this thing work.  That's nice.  However, neither of the fittings are big enough to fit my bike.  I have an Iron Horse Competition mountain bike.  So unless you have relatively thin handlebars and seat rod, I'm avoid this product.  I'm stuck with a useless set.",2.0

"thought they would be good, but quickly realized that the field of vision was distorted in some way. everything is flat with no shapes or roundness and the objects are all shorter than they should be. easy to operate.",3.0
"So, I opened the box, took out the binocs, and tried them out. Sure, they're only 22 bucks, but upon close inspection, though they seem to function fairly normally, and don't seem to have any optical problems, there's a bit of a ""stickiness"" to the ""left tube"" where it slides in and out of the telescoping piece, as you adjust the focus. The easily observable ""stickiness"" of the left tube is not in any way apparent on the right tube, so the left tube kind of ""rocks"" as it moves in and out of it's telescoping piece. You can feel it as it sticks slightly, just in this one place, as you adjust the focus.

  This seeming imperfection doesn't seem to affect the visual quality of function of the binocs in general, but simply goes to remind me that I only paid 22 bucks. I'm a bit too picky for that, so I'll most probably return them, if it doesn't cost me a penalty fee of some kind. I'll be looking for something else, unless I change my  mind and just ""settle"" for this one, warts and all.",3.0
Very nice & great buy for the money.,3.0

(The price has since gone up to 80 something). I do realize the 2 are not apples to apples.  The Bushnell optics is okay considering the price.  However, the eye relief is very shallow and makes it hard to use compare to the Nikon.  I'll wait for the Nikon to go down in price and get a 2nd pair.",3.0
They don't focus very well and are only good for objects a good distance away. If I'm trying to see something 20 - 40 feet away I can't use this.,3.0
"This product does as it says. If I ever need a pair of binoculars for more than casual use, I will purchase a set with crisper visual results. Sometimes it takes me a while to stop trying to readjust and accept the fact that I've met the max on clarity.",3.0
"These are my first pair of binoculars and I'm not sure if there is a learning curve or if these are just not for me.

I used these for a bird watching trip and they were sufficient for this purpose.  I often had to close one eye to locate the birds, then I would open both eyes.  As other reviewers have stated, the lens covers don't stay on.

For the price they are fine, but in the future I would pay more for higher powered lens and covers that aren't prone to getting lost.",3.0
"Bought a pair for my son for Xmas, they were great. Bought a pair for myself based on that, they were so-so.",3.0
I bought 2 pairs and after a few months use the rubber eye thingy is already smushed and won't go back to its original shape. I was not pleased. I sure hope the second pair lasts longer,3.0
This was awesome for a while. It lasted I think about 4 months before it just decided to break. I'm so sad about it!,3.0
"Optics are pretty good, more than adequate for bird-watching in my backyard.  My complaint is that the focus-bar has a ""kink"" in it so it's not very smooth to focus in and out.  It's not a HUGE deal, just annoying.  But, again, it's a clear image and a relatively low price so I can deal with the less-than-smooth focus bar.  (not worth the hassle to return/exchange)",3.0
"The Item's eye-contact side lens cover (one side only) is too loose, and is fallen off.
Would you kindly send me a good fitting cover, please?
As I plan to use this binocular for many years, that would help a lot.  Thanks very much in advance.  --hk.",3.0
No so great. Very difficult to focus on targes.,3.0
"Every thing is so darn cheap; everything made in China. My complaint is the the lens covers don't stay on to protect the lenses, They are made out of plastic that is to hard to stay in place, so if you want these and don't care about protecting the lenses go for it. After all, binoculars are purchased for their lenses.",3.0
"Fine binoculars for limited range. I have purchased this binoculars to take to a gun range with me. I am able to use it to see my groupings from 25 feet to 75 yards, it would not focus closer then 25 feet, which could be fine but what I am not too happy with, - I could not see my shots on the target at 100 yards... If you do not need to see such a small details as a bullet hole at 100 yards you should be fine, while testing it I could see some level of details on objects located at 200 and 300 yards but as I said the shots at 100 yards could not be clearly seen.",3.0
works okay,3.0
"Purchased 2 pair for a trip to Africa.  One pair worked fine, although didn't zoom in as close as we would have liked.  An eye piece on the other pair broke 2 days into our trip.  I will be sending these back to the manufacturer.  Only paid $50, so I guess we got what we paid for.",3.0
I love these things! It has everything I need to spy on my neighbors.,3.0
they are ok for the money but not great if your looking for ultimate performance look else where these will only make it appear a few times closer. I'm not complaining just sayin .,3.0
Not as good as my Nikon binoculars but work great for non-hunting applications. For the price they are not a bad buy.,3.0
"I get this for USD$26 back in November of 2013, had no single clue about the specifications of a Binocular but well I think I just get a cheap alternative.

they do the job but the images are often blurry and small from not a big distance, but also I'm not used to have something close to my eyes and well could be that I'm the problem.

Anyway I want them to see better the flora and fauna near my house and I can do that, I wish they will be a little more clear.",3.0
Zoom is not very far. You get for what you pay for.,3.0
Good for the price.  Don't buy if you expect high end product.,3.0
Not the best but better than my eye sight.  I can't see the eagle in the eye of a hurricane that's abandoned.,3.0
"I thought they would be a little better made. However, the work great for bird watching. The focus lever has spot that seems to catch. The movement is not very smooth. They are light and easy to adjust. I would have paid an extra five bucks to have had a hard case. The lens caps tend to fall off when removing / inserting them out of or into the case.",3.0
Sixteen year old grandson liked it.,3.0
They hurt your eyes a bit but have great strength.  They were a bit heavy for my mom whom I purchased them for.,3.0
"Enjoy, altho I do notice a yellow cast outlining the birds.",3.0
A bit heavy to hold or wear around your neck,3.0
"They seem fine. I just got them. But the lens covers do not fit well and fall off easily. Other than that they seem good...comes with a carrying case, a neck strap, and a lens cloth.",3.0
"These were a great price. I've always had problems with binoculars because my eyes refuse to work together, but I can focus with my stronger eye. Think I expected a wider area and they seem to make normal eyed people happy.  Probably a 3.5 or 4 in reality. Keeping for the car and grandkids.",3.0
"It does its job.  Kinda heavy if you want to carry it outside, but for backyard birding it is ok.",3.0
"I haven't used them, but I am excited of the chance.",3.0
harder to focus then I thought it would be.,3.0
It is very basic. I use it for short distance,3.0
Images seem a bit fuzzy.,3.0
"The binoculars work as expected. Sadly, they arrived with a scratch inside the left eye piece. I will need to return them for a replacement.",3.0
"I didn't study up on binoculars before I made this purchase.  The ""7"" stands for magnification which isn't much.  That being said, it's going to be a prop in a video and I can use it if I'm far away from my camcorder viewer and am trying to set up a shot, I'll be able to see the viewer w/these.",3.0
"Getting the covers on and off is annoying, but the binoculars are fine.",3.0
I wish they were a little stronger yet for the money you shouldn't complain. Pay more if you want things closer.,3.0
Not the greatest for stargazing but a great deal for $25,3.0
"It is just for beginner, I have to say. By saying beginner I mean one who has never used or even seen binoculars...",3.0
"Don't expect too much for 25 bucks! It is definitely worth the price but the optics are not great. When it comes to binoculars, you get what you pay for.",3.0
My wife and I use these mainly at LA Galaxy soccer games. We have found that the image doesn't come together as nicely as it does on a friend's nicer set of binoculars. My wife complains that it is hard to get them to focus but I don't have that problem. For the price it is fair but not excellent.,3.0
After looking at others I felt these were a bit heavy and clunky.  You can get similar and even better magnification with smaller binoculars from the same company.,3.0
Excellent value,3.0
"We used these for whale watching, and they performed well.",3.0
"decent...but, I guess it is what you would expect from a lower priced model.",3.0
Great value! My husband uses these for wildlife spotting and thought they were a very expensive pair.,3.0
"I have not used these yet, but they look like they are worth more than for the price they are sold.",3.0

"Unless you like seeing double, you'll likely need to adjust the mirror whatchamacallit inside, and good luck figuring out how. This shouldn't be necessary, but with mine it was. But it's fine after I lucked into the adjustment.",3.0
"Good basic binoculars, nothing special.  For the price I don't mind letting them get banged around in my ATV storage compartment.",3.0
I bought these for travel.  They aren't bad but just so-so. We never use them.  Others may have a better experience with these binoculars so I am waffling in the middle with my opinion.,3.0
"I was somewhat disappointed because I had difficulty focusing them. Also, they are heavier than I expected. They would be good for hunting but I wanted them for live concerts and shows.",3.0
Its just okay..,3.0
"They were good binoculars, just too bulky and heavy for what I was looking for.",3.0
"I wear progressive bifocals and that might be the issue here. I cannot focus these well enough to see the birds in my yard really close from 30 to 40 feet away. My son, however, does like them and he doesn't wear glasses. I do better with my 70-300 zoom lens on my camera, albeit it's heavy. And it's auto focus.",3.0
"wanted a pair of binoculars for bird watching, I have so many hummingbirds. I had expected them to enlarge more, so I am a little disappointed.",3.0
"Looks fake like, china made fake items...

some scratches on the items. Not that sturdy!

disappoints me with this item!",3.0
"I had this exact same model of binoculars made about 20 years ago. These show how companies farm out manufacturing to China, and how shoddy their products become as a result. The pair I received were very loose when it came to focusing. They just don't hold it well. The exterior finish is very cheap as well. I was pretty disappointed, as my previous binocs had been excellent.",3.0
"I got these from Amazon a little less than a year ago and they've served me well.  They are a bit bulky but with the neck strap, the weight didn't bother me.  I did have to tie knots in the strap to keep it from slipping out of the buckles...my binoculars fell several times due to slippage until I started the knot trick.  Still, the magnification is pretty good (7 times larger than naked eye) and the field of vision was large enough to find birds quickly and easily.  The focusing was a breeze.  I was already thinking I wanted to upgrade to an 8x or 10x to see birds larger when my binoculars fell off a shelf - about four feet -  and became misaligned.  I started seeing two of everything and the right lens didn't have the same range of focusing the left did.  Also, the plastic casing cracked. Bushnell warranty doesn't cover falls, and even if it did it would cost more to send the binoculars there and back than they're worth.  So even thought it's not recommended, I watched a youtube video and tried to fix them myself.  Upon opening them, I saw the prism itself inside had chipped, and the 'set screws' that you can tighten and loosen to try and fix the misalignment yourself aren't even placed correctly.  Usually set screws control the placement of the prisms,and by tightening and loosening them you can control how the prisms are aligned. These screws seemed only the serve the purpose of keeping the plastic case on.  Really cheap, Bushnell.  So, they were great starter binoculars but now that I'm really going birding every day, it's time to upgrade to some better quality optics.  You get what you pay for, especially in the binocular world.",3.0
You can't get a good far view and it's hard to get focus correctly.,3.0
I got for my child who likes bird watching. he is only 5 and pretty rough. so I wasn't going to buy anything expensive for him right now. this binoculars need to be used outside only because they have very far range and closer things are pretty blurry. it is a good starter binoculars for kids and I would definitely recommend it for this purpose.,3.0
Bushnell is the premier maker of Binoculars.  In this case these were advertised as having auto focusing - which are actually manual.  In the end they were light weight and magnified as expected.,3.0
Decent binoculars.  Case is very cheap.  Lens caps are very low quality and worthless - they just won't stay on.  But the binocs are OK and the price is right.,3.0
I purchased these to go and watch my 49ers beat the brake off of the Saints last year and they worked fine for that...however I'm a big guy over 250lbs  and I played football so I think I'm above average in strength and after wearing for a few hours I definitely knew I had something on my neck and a couple hours after that my neck was hurting so if you are smaller than I am then you probably don't want to carry these around your neck.,3.0
"It works ok for daylight observations, but when I point it at the Moon, at night, I see two of them...",3.0
I found that it is difficult to focus and then to maintain focus.  This item might be fine for a child's play toy.,3.0
"It does work for the purpose I got it, but then when I use the lens cover to prevent them from getting scratched, it keeps coming off loose. Not sure if I will come back to this product. Thought, Bushnell was a quality product producing company, hmm?",3.0
"I bought these because I wanted something fairly good for not a lot of money. These are just that. If you want a decent pair of cheap binoculars, these will do. I echo what another reviewer said, however. You would think it would be possible for Bushnell to make or buy lens covers that don't fall off. The front ones are OK, but the rear ones are too big for the eyepiece and fall off just by your lifting the binoculars. Sounds like a minor thing, but it does get annoying.",3.0
"Received shipment promptly, but when I tried to use the binoculars, one of the lenses would not focus.  Returned them and received a replacement, which works well.  Not up to the image quality of more expensive binoculars, but fine for the price, and they will serve our purposes as a second pair when we both need them.",3.0
"They're ok for the money.  I should have bought a more expensive pair, guess Mom was right ....""you get what you pay for..""  Moms are like that.",3.0
"After years of suffering with dark, weak, wobbly binoculars (thank you, Magnacraft), I found myself needing two types:  the best quality I could find (1) at any weight but under $250 for use within a drive of home (home binocs), and (2) under 10 oz, easy to travel with in tour groups, simple for impatient family members, and ideal for night concerts and day baseball games (travel binocs).

After studying reviews and comments thoroughly, I concluded there are brilliant experts commenting regularly on Amazon - much more insightful than the professional reviewers who focus on expensive, heavy devices purchased by others of their ilk. From my fellow consumers' insights, I purchased 11 binoculars with at least 70% five-star ratings that fit my general specifications for home or travel.

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.  After exhaustive examination - reading a DVD box at 46 feet, finding individual cattle from a moving minivan, and watching stars and planets in my backyard - I concluded the essential attributes for binoculars across categories are:

(A) Plenty of Light brought to your eye.  Light is determined by the diameter of the light-gathering lens divided by the magnification.  In other words, an 8x42 pair has a ratio of 5.25 and produces LOTS of light, while a 10x21 pair has a ratio of 2.1 and always appear dark.  Conclusion:  About 3.0 is adequate and the best available for compact binoculars.

(B) Good Stability of View. View stability depends on (i) the degrees of field of vision (can you find what you are looking for), (ii) the depth of visibility (do you have to refocus for every few feet of depth), and (iii) wobble (which is itself determined by (i) and (ii)).  Conclusion:  field of vision is rarely as broad as advertised, depth of visibility depends on the lens quality and you just have to check it out, and any binoc with a magnification of 10 or higher proved to have poor stability of view without a tripod, at least for me.  There is a big difference between 8x and 10x, particularly below a 42 lens diameter.

SPECIFIC CONCLUSIONS.  (Home Binoculars) The best Home Binoc was the Nikon Monarch ATM 8x42, and it outperformed all other 10 by a wide margin. I could read a DVD box at 46 feet, keep a broad and stable view to find the cow with three white spots while bouncing in a minivan, and find and watch Mars.  At 24 oz, it's too big for constant lugging, but oh what a treat. At $230, it was comparable in price to the Vixen 14502 Foresta 8x42 and the Bushnell Ultra HD 8x42, but it performed noticeably better, particularly on view stability.  Several cheaper, heavy models under $100 had cloudy lens.

(Travel Binoculars)  The Pentax 8x25 UCF XII and the Olympus 8x25 PCI were best in class, although the Pentax had less wobble, more clarity while the Olympus provided more light and more accurate color tones, but a smaller field of vision. (Forget finding the cow, but if you found it, you could count its ear hairs at dusk).  Both were 10 oz, and about $65; the Pentax, which gets slightly better overall reviews, is larger but felt better in my hand.  Small hands, viewing at dusk, standing still = Olympus.  Larger hands, viewing in daylight, on a bus = Pentax. Lastly, the itty bitty Olympus 7x21 PC III at 7 oz in metallic blue is adorable and $24 (refurbished), with fantastic clarity and ease of use, but a very narrow field of vision, despite its 7.5% claim.

So what did we do?  I decided to travel with the heavy Nikon Monarch, but kept the Pentax 8x25 in reserve.  Different members of my family preferred the Pentax 8x25, the Olympus 8x25, and the Olympus 7x21, each predictably on the basis of the decision maker's age, size, and goals. None showed any interest in the other six binocs.

As a final note, Beware of imperfection and non-Amazon sellers.  Two of the 11 binocs arrived with lens imperfections.  The heavy Bushnell Falcon (7x36) at $30 had a cloudy lens, and Amazon accepted the return promptly. The lightweight but expensive Nikon Travelite 10x25, already with little light and a small field of vision, had a defective lens, making it darker.  The vendor wanted me to pay shipping in both directions plus a restocking fee to return the defective item.

Good luck with your decision. I hope my odyssey was helpful to you.",3.0
"For thirty dollars, not bad, but they are obviously cheaply constructed. The piece holding the eye lenses is rubber, and so bends at the slightest pressure, slightly angeling the eyepieces on the tubes. This doesn't seem to affect the image, but it makes it feel cheap. The eyepiece focus mechanism is too loose, making the picture slowly go out of focus if any pressure is applied when viewing. There is obvious blurring towards the edge of the image. If they are pointed near a point light source there are obvious internal reflections. Despite these flaws, the image is crisp where you need it, and preforms adequately for 30 bucks.

I'm going to be looking for better quality soon.",3.0
"Great value for the money. I use it mostly for ball games, but it comes in handy when hiking and sailing.",3.0
"Binos are OK for the money paid - you get what you pay for. However, there is a big downside to these cheaper binos as they are neither fogproof or waterproof. I also own Leupold Green Stripe binos and there is a huge difference in the optics(although they are a lot more pricier). I opted to take the Bushnells to a UM football game last week, and they are still unusable a week later due to the rain we encountered during the game.",3.0

ANYWAY THE DECALS ARE CROOKED THE PAINT JOB LOOKS LIKE MY GREAT GRAND DAUGHTER DID IT WITH A BRUSH. THE UNDERSIDE OF THE DECK IS ONLY HALF PAINTED, THIS IS PROBABLY INTENTIONAL SO IT WILL RUST OUT QUICKER!

My kids love them though!",3.0
Great little tricycle to look at and ride (not me...a 2 year old.)  However there were sharp shards under the seat that Daddy found before the 2 year old.  Needle like shards are painfull in dad's hand let alone a child's.  A good going over all parts by an adult should be done to protect the child.  This should have been done by the quality control  prior to shipping.,3.0
"This is a classic tricycle.  We bought it for our our 3 year old's birthday.  A year later, she's finally able to sit on the seat and reach the pedals.  So, it's big...in retrospect, I probably would have bought something smaller if I had been able to try her out on it before buying...In fact, I've seen small 2-wheeler bikes with training wheels that are smaller than this.",3.0

Now this is a well built bike and yes my granddaughter loves it, just wish it looked better.",3.0
"I bought this for my nephew and took it all the way to the Philippines only to find one of the lock washers that attaches the wheel to the axle was missing. The little guy was so excited he was jumping up and down and didn't notice that the trike was unrideable. You cruel, heartless... !
Luckily a department store gave me a generic lock washer so I was able to finish assembling the trike. The assembly instructions are very poor. The rear assembly was a little bent from being forced into the box and it would have been impossible to insert the axle if you assembled the pieces in the order suggested by the instructions. Once you get past the horrible assembly issues this is a fairly decent bike, though I would note that the bell, however good, was designed for adult hands, not children's. A child could only operate the bell using two hands.",3.0
"The paint on the seat was red and white and where the line divided the two colors the red bled into the white. Also the white wheels on the tires bled into the black. The tassels on the handlebars are chintzy. I was very disappointed with the detail. If I didn't have a birthday party tomorrow I would return it but I need this gift. Also, it is disappointing that the  classic radio flyer was made in China.",3.0

My grandson just started riding this and we think the one we received is defective.  The screw for the seat doesn't go all the way through so we have problems with the seat staying in place.  I have passed the point of being able to return this.  So we'll have to live with it.  But if you order it make sure you check all the holes and and that everything stays in place.,3.0

When needed their uncle will re powdercoat or chrome; perk of a body man as a brother. Still, what a  disappointment. Overall, happy with purchase.

Nice and sturdy. Good quality. Unfortunately arrived with missing parts.,3.0
"We gave the tricycle as a 3rd birthday gift for our granddaughter.  She loves the bell and rides on the back porch.  Sadly, the seat paint was flawed.  It wasn't worth sending back for a replacement, but it just wasn't as good of quality as expected.",3.0
Assembly not at all easy--even for someone adept at putting things together.  Do like the look of it--very retro.,3.0
"The chrome colored pieces had nicks/specks/ kinda rust colored.  The paint job on the tires was not done well, there were sections which were smeared.",3.0
"Great tricycle. My 2 year old son loves it. It was easy to put together and seems to be of really good quality. The reason I gave it three stars instead of five is that the tricycle smells really bad. It smells like smoke from a fire. Very strong smell. I assembled it in our house and it took a day with windows open to get the smell out. We are leaving it in the garage now and the smell seems to be improving but the whole garage has been smelling like a fire. If anyone from Radio Flyer or Amazon read this, is there any way to improve this bad smell? Love the trike, hate the odor.",3.0
"This bike smells so horrible, I almost returned it. The smell was absolutely toxic. If you are going to purchase this bike, make sure you open the package outdoors. I unfortunately did not. My apartment smelled so awful my eyes were burning. I aired this bike out for a MONTH and it still smells. Unfortunately, taking it apart would have probably damaged it. That's the only reason I decided not to return it.
The bike itself is very nice and sturdy. My niece loved it. That's why I gave it 3 stars. I'm going to give it a few more weeks to air out before I let her ride it.",3.0
This little tricycle came with a broken bell as well as a dented fender.  Since it was for my grandson's birthday there wasn't a way to return it before I needed it.  I was disappointed.,3.0
This was a gift for my son's birthday.  It was a really good purchase but after putting it together the back axle squeaks and i have tried many different things but it was a difficult fit in the first place and i think it was just a bit off. You can definitely hear where your child is and is going though!!!,3.0
as soon as my 5yr old sat on it the set broke.he loved it i wish it were better constructed.we will try to get part for set still a good buy,3.0
"Nice bike.  Was overly hard to put together (and I'm an engineer) and it arrived with one broken pedal.  The first time I called to have a replacement pedal sent I was given a hard time, the next day I called again and they agreed to ship out a replacement pedal.  What can I say, I'm nostalgic over this product, nearly half a century ago I had a radio flyer trike and wagon, just wish they had better quality control on the parts, and better instructions for assembly.",3.0
"It's hard to find a decent trike these days apparently, or for under 200 bucks anyway.  I'm sure my son will get a lot of use out of it though  --when he gets tall enough to ride it.",3.0
"We purchased this trike for my 2 1/2 year old son. He loves the trike. He is 37 3/4 inches and is just tall enough to reach the peddles and is learning how to use them. Sometimes he just puts his feet on the floor and kind of ""walks it"" around.

Unfortunately, we've had some problems with the bell. The band that runs around the middle where the tab for ringing is, has a sharp jagged edge on one side. My son has cut himself twice on this. It swelled up and bled. His hand was red and swollen for about 24 hours. I contacted the doctor and they said since he's up-to-date on immunizations, we shouldn't have to worry about tetanus. We were directed to wash out the cut. We also initially applied ice for the swelling and later some antibiotic ointment to prevent infection. However, after the second time it happened, we obviously had to remove the bell.

I contacted the manufacturer and the apologized and offered to send a replacement bell. They also indicated the would be including a postage-paid envelop for me to return the bell so their Quality Assurance department can examine it.  The package finally arrived today (I called them almost 2 weeks ago). The replacement bell has the same problem - in the exact same spot. Also, they did not include an envelope for me to return the original bell.  You'd think after calling them to alert them to this issue, they would carefully examine the replacement bell before shipping it to me.  The problem is fairly obvious - you can visibily see the edge is jagged. Also, if you run your finger along the edge, you can tell its sharp and jagged rather than smooth (like the other side).

I plan on contacting the manufacturer again to try and resolve this, but please be aware your child could become injured if using the bell. I would suggest examining the bell before attaching it and letting your child use it.",3.0
"By the time your child can menouver this heavy, tall trike they should have a 2 wheel bike. Not a first trike. It is good quality but I agree with the other users with having to find a way to stablize the handlebars to keep them from turning. The white walled tires weren't painted within the lines very well but it does look nice. Just waiting for my daughter to grow tall enough to enjoy it.",3.0
"My twin girls (2 1/2 at the time) were thrilled with their new tricycles this summer.  We all had visions of family outings with the kids zooming along in front of us on their cool RF trikes as we walked to the park.  I'd say the visions weren't entirely fantasy, but the reality was not all I'd hoped.

First problem was with the manufacturing quality.  Assembly was not difficult, but neither trike was quite ""square.""  One had (and still has) a glaring amount of skew -- the handlebars weren't quite perpendicular to the front wheel.  Over the next few months we tried making various adjustments, but to no avail.  After really close inspection, I think I've finally discovered that the front wheel itself is poorly constructed -- the circumference on one side is different than the other side's. As a result, the rest of the assembly is skewed.  The bolts also tend to loosen a bit over time, so the steering bar slowly gets off-center.  You just need to watch it and re-tighten occasionally.  Also I've noticed that if I grab the trike under the seat, there's a sharp piece of metal sticking down, which wasn't properly sanded or smoothed.  I've cut my hand on it a couple of times.

Next problem, as noted in other reviews, is that the center of gravity is quite high, and a tight turn, or even a fairly gentle turn at speed, will cause a spill.  Our kids have tipped over on their trikes, multiple times.  For one of my kids, this is not a deterrent to pedaling her heart out, but the other is much more cautious, which kind of bums me out.  She just doesn't enjoy her trike as much as I know she would if it were more stable.

That said, the trike seems pretty sturdy.  When the kids get too tired to pedal, I'll put my foot on the lower step and my hands on the handlebars, and push them home, putting all my weight on the trike.  I try not to do this for long stretches, but anyway have not noticed any ill effects -- no bending or warping.

One other note is about its height.  At 2 1/2 my kids really had to stretch their legs to pedal, and usually have to stand up part-way to build enough force to push the pedals.  Getting the trike started is a challenge, as is riding it up any sort of slope (say, the tiny ramp from the street onto the sidewalk at a driveway) unless they already have momentum.  They manage, but often need a push.  Now they're 3 and it's slightly easier, but not by much.  Probably this model is more appropriate for an older toddler (3-5), not a younger one (2-3).",3.0
I love RADIO FLYER - they are built to last and they stand behind their products and you never have any issues if you need a spare part... however I was disappointed with this tricycle. It tips over way too easy...we live on a cul de sac and just the part of the side walk that dips a little for the driveways makes it want to tip. Maybe its not a problem with an experienced trike rider but for my child its always a problem. I bought a big wheel instead and found its much easier to peddle... for a whimpy kid like mine :) Plus no problems with tipping.,3.0
"We got this trike to teach our two year old how to ride. At the time he was around the same size as typical 3-4 year olds. Even with the seat all the way down, he had a lot of trouble reaching the pedals. As he got older and bigger, he was able to ride more successfully, but I would say still not comfortably. Also, getting on the trike is actually harder for him because of the stairs in back.

I'd go for a different shaped trike if I had it to do again.

Pro:
- Solidly built
- Looks great!
- Fairly easy to assemble

Con:
- Hard for my son to get on and off
- Too big for the kids most likely to ride a trike instead of a bike, IMO
- Bell is quiet stiff for smaller hands
- HEAVY!",3.0

"Front fender dented, no big deal should still work fine. Then got to rear wheels,pole that goes through wheels was bent causing a squeak, nothing I thought wd40 could not fix, but after allowing grandson to ride for a while I noticed the rear wheels coming out of round and appears to wobble. Grandson does not care but I wonder how long it will still be rideable.",3.0
"I bought this tricycle for my daughter's birthday.  Very good quality and easy to assemble - less than half an hour, so it was great to roll out with a bow on it (versus unwrapping a box with a picture on it that tells your child how much fun they are missing out on).  The word ""classic"" definitely applies as it has a cool retro look.  The pictures do not accurately show this, but anything that looks white is actually off-white, which adds to the classic look.  The bell is a nice touch too and has a classic ring that one would expect.

The problem is that my 3 year old daughter has problems reaching the pedals and she is in the 98th percentile for height.  The product should be labeled for an ideal height, not an ideal age.  She can pedal once she has a little momentum, but cannot start on her own.  I cannot comment as to its ""tippiness"" yet, but would suggest reading some 1-star reviews for others' comments.  I gave it 3 stars because it is nice-looking, well-built, but not quite usable.",3.0

Assembly wasn't too bad, but as others have said, you really need to tighten up the handlebars and seat well to keep it aligned.

She was almost big enough this year (at 35 months) and would have been able to ride it if it hadn't lost a battle with our Honda Element (hence only one star for durability :p ).",3.0
"In case anyone is about the make the same mistake I did: The pictures posted here for this product are very misleading.  One of them shows a push handle, where a parent can hold the bike and/or push it.  However this bike does not include that piece, and that was the whole reason why I bought it.  Very frustrating, Amazon needs to make sure that the pictures which are posted for a product are actually pictures of the product being sold...

I'm editing my review to say that although the bike being sold is different from that in the picture, this particular bike is fine.  That product in the picture is the ""Radio Flyer Classic Red 10"" Tricycle with Push Handle"".",3.0
"If possible, I would RATE THIS ITEM 3.25 STARS

The Radio Flyer Classic Red Dual Deck Tricycle was not double boxed when shipped. Instead, the factory box arrived heavily worn (see photo) with both ends showed signs of having been compressed.

1) When I picked up the box, I was a disappointed to hear parts in the box moving about. Once opened, I was surprised to see that Radio Flyer chose not to use an engineered packaging solution. One that would have kept the heavy parts in the box secure and in place during transit. Because of that, some of the parts for the Radio Flyer tricycle arrived damaged, and from what I could tell were caused by the unsecured parts. This sort of packaging is unacceptable for items bulk shipped from China and a quality control process that Radio Flyer was unwise to ignore.

2) The fender for the front tire fork assembly was twisted and bent out of alignment with respects to the tire and fork (see photo). This happened because the heavy double step assembly was free to move about and damaged the fork assembly. I was able to straighten out most of the damage to the fender, but not all. I was concerned that if I over flexed the steel fender that I risked breaking off the fender mounting point. This sort of damage negatively impacts the end users experience.

3) The front lip of the steel fender appears as though it was not properly prepped during manufacturing, prior to chrome plating. Hence, portions of the fender lip arrived with sections of chrome plating already flaked off (see photo) with the surrounding areas showing signs of blistering. Such cosmetic blemishes are an indication of very poor manufacturing processes.

4) Although I suspect the minor damage was caused by rubbing with another part in the box, a portion of the paint on the peddle crank arm (see photo) had already rubbed off. This sort of damage was completely avoidable and from the nature of the product, size and shape of the parts, should have been anticipated to happen.

5) The main steel tube for the tricycle was placed in the box under the tricycle double step assembly and the front tire fork assembly. During transit, one of these two items hit with some force, the steel tubing for the frame, and produced a 5/16 inch long gouge (see photo) in the tricycle frame. Again, minor, but avoidable.

6) The bell that comes with the Radio Flyer tricycle is a large full size bicycle bell (see photo) and not at all what I was expecting for a child's tricycle. With this full size bicycle bell, it takes 5 pounds (measured) of force to move and rotate the bell thumb level. Five pounds is allot of force for a small child's thumb. Also, since the bell is full size, the distance from the handle bar to the bell thumb lever is a bit large for a small child's hand to reach.

On the positive side, it's possible to assemble the Radio Flyer tricycle and keep all of the factory bubble wrapping in place (see photo) to preserve that new gift look and feel.

In conclusion, given all of the small shipping related defects and minor damage issues with this product, all of which were avoidable, I feel Radio Flyer needs to reexamine their current packaging and make the time and effort to design an engineered packaging solution. The chrome plating on the front tire fender is below average in workmanship and does not help with first appearance. I wonder if the tricycle I was shipped is the sort of tricycle the President of Radio Flyer would like to proudly gift to a child?

"We got this for my son who never warmed to it and then handed it down to my daughter.  She does not use it much either.  As others have noted it is big - too tall for the little kids who really want a trike.  By the time they are big enough for it - they want a bike.  Lots of visiting kids seem to like it - kids in the 2-4 year old range.  It LOOKS like fun - big and red.  No matter what anyone does to it I can repair it.  It is simple and tough.  I find it touching too.  Didn`t everyone have one of these when they were a kid?  I try to carry it into the garage every time everyone is done (and boy is it heavy).  It`s steel, so if you leave it out in the rain it will rust.  Then it makes the familiar ""squeak squeak squeak"" sound when someone rides it.  Just like when I was a kid!",3.0
I have to agree with the previous comments about tipping.  My daughter has fallen off a few times.  It will tip on quick turns.  The only other con is it rusts very easy.  We always bring it in the house at night to avoid exposure to the humidity.  I purchased it for my daughter when she was 2 1/2 and she had no problem reaching the pedals.  My 19 month old also loves to try and ride but she has more difficulty reaching.  If you're going to by this trike it will need special care in terms of maintenance but your kids will love it!,3.0

Amazon took good care of us though, which made the whole situation more bearable.  We opted to purchase a knock off 10 inch bike rather than have him fall off the 12 inch classic.  Once he's tall enough it will get a lot of use.  The streamers and bell really add to the fun of this bike.",3.0

"I wanted to replace my Gerber Multi-tool for personal reasons and remembering the SOG with it's compound leverage, decided to go ahead a purchase one.

I'm afraid to admit I'm a little disappointed. Yes, it is easily opened with one hand, but it seems that's where the convenience ends. If you want to use any of the assorted tools, it's somewhat labor intensive. First, you have to open the tool cover, select the tool you want, then pull it into the open position.

The problem I have stems from the fact that not all of the tools are easily opened individually. Pull one open and several of the others come out too. Depending on what tools come out, you have to be careful when pushing the unneeded tools back so as not to cut yourself. And no, I didn't, but it was close... ;-)

I am way less than impressed with the locking mechanism. You have to make a conscious effort to ensure that any given tool is actually locked. Yes, another close call. By contrast, the tools on my Gerber are all easily accessible and are locked into position with (in my opinion) a better locking mechanism. In all it's years of use, I never had a single tool fail to lock automatically nor has the locking mechanism ever failed. Given, too, is the fact the with the Gerber, although it does take two hands to open a tool, I can unlock, put the tool away, retract the pliers and re-holster it single handedly.

Now, I honestly bought this truly wanting to like it. To me, in the beginning, the SOG was the Holy Grail of multi-tools. It has no weaknesses in terms of the variety or quality of the tools. The saw is like, 3"" of pure wickedness! It's simply their implementation I don't care for.

I will get use out of this tool, to be sure. But I'm going to replace my aging Gerber... with another Gerber.

Now, a quick word about the seller I went with. Tooltopia. (Website by the same name) I was quite happy with the transaction, and in fact, I will be purchasing my new Gerber from them... um... well, next payday...",3.0

It is clever though ... Was fun to play with but not for everyday carry ...",3.0
"Buyer beware. The item pictured may NOT be what you get. The pictures on the discription clearly show both the shields covering the compound leverage gears, and the ""piano style"" locks(not the single plate lock). These features indicate that this should be the NEW model.

The older model had the compound leverage gears exposed(vulnerable to being bent if dropped) and the single plate lock which had signifigant play up and down (DO NOT BUY THE OLD MODEL). I emailed amazon and requested someone to CONFIRM it was the new model. I received an email that it WAS, but apon arrival mine had the single plate lock.

I didn't return it right away because it did have the compound leverage shields, but I could NOT get over the amount of play in the other tools so I returned it. I plan on ordering the B61-N hoping it has BOTH of the features Im looking for. I still rated it a 3 because it had 1 of the features, and if you can get over the play while the tools are locked you'll be ok. I couldn't but thats just me.

Aside from the issues above, I think its a great tool overall. I do see some issues with the covering slowing down the tool deployment, and the fact that ALL tools are inside the tool itself. I did not test the tools much because at that point I had planned to return it, but its a hefty tool which is a good thing. I nice compliment to my Gerber suspension. Please use this as a data point. Thats all. Thank you for reading!",3.0
"Updated: Wow, my whole opinion changed about this tool once I loosened the screws.  Now it opens much easier.  I just unscrewed the hex bolts a little bit, and added some oil, and presto!  this thing looks usable now.  It's nice and compact and I can open the pliers with one hand.  Should have tried lubricating and loosening earlier.

It's still true (as I pointed out in my earlier review below) that it's useless when the plier head is not fully out; I had wrongly thought, from the marketing pictures, that you could actually grab things with the plier heads offset at an angle.

But now I can actually open the thing with one hand, and I can even get out the other tools, too, some of them with one hand.  Now that I don't have to apply nearly so much force, the knife blades don't seem as dangerous, though I still find it awkward.  But I still don't like the fact that the tools all come out clumped (like on SOG's other products, and unlike Gerber or Victorinox); it's hard to pull one out without pulling out more than one.

As others have pointed out, the tools do not lock.  For the most part, that's not a problem; plenty of other multitools do not lock either.  But it's actually dangerous for the awl, which is pointing the wrong way on this tool.  If you apply any force to the sharp side, it will fold in on you.  Definitely bad design; probably only usable for poking something, not working it around.  For the other tools, the lack of a lock is not a fatal flaw.

For reference, here was my old opinion, when I first got it:

SOG products are hit or miss; some are really good, some are not.  This one is definitely not.

I got it because I was intrigued by the offset pliers, hoping I could actually use them to get at things in awkward positions.  Turns out that does not work well if you have to apply any reasonable amount of force, because the act of squeezing the handles causes the plier head to rotate inward if it's not locked straight.

Out of the box, the plier head was quite stiff, so it was very difficult to open it with one hand, or to close it with one hand.  I assume it will loosen up with use, but it was definitely not a one-hand opening plier out of the box for me.

The other tools (knife, etc.) are *really* hard to get out.  The knife in particular is almost impossible to get out without cutting myself.  I have a SOG power-assist multitool, and that works far, far better.  (In general, the other tools on SOG multitools, even the ones that I would consider good multitools unlike this one, are not all that fantastic, anyway; the can opener works much worse that can openers from Victorinox or Leatherman, and I much prefer the Victorinox files; but SOG knife blades are excellent, if you could get them out easily.)

As others have pointed out, none of the blades lock.  This might not seem so bad, except that they don't even snap out (like Victorinox knives); they simply rotate with no sort of catch at all.  And the even weirder thing is that the awl is oriented in the wrong direction, so if you actually use the sharp side, it will fold itself in.  A clear design mistake.

As usual with the SOG products, the materials *appear* to be pretty high quality, though I'll never know because the poor design precludes me from actually using this one for real.

Sorry, this multitool looked cool, but it's just not very functional for much of anything.  If you want pliers that can be opened with one hand, then you should get a SOG power-assist or power lock, or one of a number of Gerber multitools, or the leatherman OHT, or a CRKT zilla; but don't get the SOG paratool.",3.0
"I finally bought the SOG paratool after sitting on the sidelines for more than 5 years. Each time I handled a paratool in a store, I was struck by how awkward (if not dangerous) its design seemed. In the end, I bought one because Amazon had it for the right price (do NOT pay full price for this), and I was curious.

The paratool has remained virtually unchanged since it was first introduced in the 1990s. Its central feature, a truly peculiar set of pliers that fold out from the handles without fully opening the handles, is something of a fossil among today's multitool offerings, as it was designed to provide smooth-handled pliers (the original Leatherman did not have comfortable handles). There are literally dozens of multitools from various makers that now have both comfortable handles and more normal pliers.

It's difficult to describe the way in which the SOG paratool opens without using a video. So, I recommend that interested parties search youtube for examples. The critical thing to mention, however, is that the design results in uneven pressure on the pivot points of the pliers.

This stool is made of stainless steel, which is great, and it's got a fine set of tools. It's also lightweight (less than 7 oz.), which is also great. However, there are some serious flaws: the tools don't lock, which was normal when the tool was introduced in the 1990s, but which is not acceptable today. Also, the complicated method of opening the pliers increases the chance of being pinched.

The final verdict:
This tool is a must for multitool collectors; it's unique and an interesting example of the ingenuity that has gone into the American multitool industry since it was begun by Leatherman. It's also an appropriate tool for those who want a lightweight, all-steel tool with a modest set of pliers with comfortable handles and decent set of blades and tools. It is also awkward to open and close--if not dangerous!--and the pliers are the weakest made by SOG (and perhaps the weakest ones produced by any maker).

I should add one more thing: SOG allows the owner to modify the assemblage of tools of the paratool (as SOG does with all its high-end multitools).",3.0

"Good sturdy trike. Front tire wouldn't inflate and found inner tube defective with hole from factory.

"I am happy with this purchase. The fact that each band has it's own clip that can individually attach to the handles is really convenient if you want to use several bands at once. Other bands I used (like the ones at beach body) don't have clips and each band has it's own handle. If you want to use more than one band at a time, you have to try and hold several handles at once, which is not comfortable at all. The clips on this product avoids that problem and I'm very happy with it.

The manual says that the bands can safely stretch up to 400% of their natural length. My measurements are not completely precise, but if you simply measure the length of the stretchy part of the band (not including the length of the clips and black cloth that is attached), they are about 40 inches long. If you include the lengths of the clips and cloth at the ends, they are about 48 inches. Some of the exercises I do  seem to go just beyond the 400% stretch range of the bands, but after a few weeks of using them, they seem to be just fine, at least for now.

Perfect to stay on track while traveling and can't take the weights with me.  Would recommend this product and company to friends and family.,4.0
solid product for a fair price,4.0
I used them a couple times per week during certain workouts & I love them. Very easy to use & switch or add bands. They feel pretty solid to me.,4.0
"I got these as a gift last Christmas, and have really enjoyed working out with them since.  They are easy to use, durable, and versatile.  And I haven't even made my way through all of the suggested exercises yet.  I can get a good workout in 20 minutes with these, and the variety of bands makes it easy to progress up to your optimum level of resistance.  I would certainly recommend this set as an affordable, easy way to incorporate resistance training into your fitness regime.",4.0
"I've been using the bands for a few weeks now and the bands meet my expectations, great product!",4.0
"I got these for Christmas and have been using them multiple days a week since. The resistance is great. I would agree that the low resistance is pretty worthless but maybe some use it?? I was a little skeptical about the customer service given the review but I called to inquire about these before purchase and they answered right away which gave me a little more confidence. So far so good, I will let you know if there are any issues with the bands themselves after continue usage between 3-4x/wk.",4.0
"Bought this for use while I was in physical therapy and am pretty happy with it for convenience factor.  It can be cumbersome, though, when having to switch out different bands over an hour or hour and a half of working with them.",4.0
"Need to buy stronger resistance bands almost right away, but it's a good starter set.",4.0
Good but not for me,4.0
"I looked at several similar sets of resistance bands, some boasted beautiful packaging and high quality materials for 10 or more dollars then this product. The packaging was basic and the carrying bag was mediocre,  but inside was a very high quaility and complete set. Exactly what I was hoping for when looking for a set, I also really appreciated the booklet on possible exercises and the thick foam handles; although one more set of handles so you could work with a partner would be nice. I really want to give 5 stars but couldn't,  the point off is for the conflicting information in the booklet. Inside the booklet it states the band's can be stretched 400%, even saying that translates to 1 foot of band can be stretched to 4 feet. Then in the back warnings section, in slightly smaller font it states to only stretch a maximum of 3 times total length. Just saying some clairification or a rewrite are in order. Although , if properly using the band's it seems unlikely anyone could even extend the band's that far. Thusly 4.5/5 stars if I could.",4.0
"Work well, and a nice variety!",4.0
"I bought 2 sets of these so I could simultaneously work my left and right sides equally.  The quality is great.  I gave them four out of five because I would gladly give up having 5 slightly different resistances for an option to have duplicates or to be able to choose the 'colors' I want.  This is a VERY good product it's just that for my needs, I had to pay twice.",4.0
"I have been using these for the last 10 months without any issues. I do not like how the clips have started to rust, but that is my fault for not wiping and cleaning my sweat off a workout. The most important thing for me is that they do not abruptly snap during a workout and lash me like a peasant.",4.0
"Excellent construction leads me to believe I will be able to use it for much time to come. Earlier resistance band set (not from Black Mountain or Amazon) broke the first time I tried to use it.

Nice to know I can buy additional bands as necessary.

Would like to see the suggested exercises grouped by muscle function, preferably in an digital downloadable format.",4.0
"These are really great for at home workouts.  They can start to develop little tears in them if you really use them heavily, but they still work with the tears.  The handles and straps are actually better quality than some of the competitor models. The only other downside is that they just come with one of each color/weight.",4.0
"I would have loved to have kept them. They are a really good quality item.  The reason why I returned them was because an item was missing from the package.  If I pay for something I expect to get everything that they mentioned on the web site.  I did reorder the resistance band through a different vendor, and I'm very happy with my purchase. If you purchase through Black Mountain Products make sure you check to make sure you have everything.",4.0
I have been very pleased with this purchase.  I like all of the different ways I can use these bands to add more resistance to my workouts.  I have used the bands attached to a door and to my ankle as well.  I really like the variety these bands provide for getting a great workout in.,4.0
This bands work very well.  I wish there was a bit more resistance to each band individually.,4.0
"I am happy with the product quality. I have used it for a few weeks. The user manual was helpful to start. I am sure I will discover better materials as I advance in using resistance bands. Foam handles are easy on hands. The ankle handle has been particularly helpful, since I am focusing on them as part of my treatment. As of now, I am mostly using red and blue bands, as they are providing me with the right resistance.",4.0
"This is a great set of resistance bands.  The number of bands allow for many levels of resistance, and the set is very versatile.  The clips make it easy to add or take away resistance during exercise.  I also bought the harness and waist belt, which are very comfortable during resistance training and have loops that allow easy attachment of the bands.  My only complaint is that the set includes just one ankle strap, and that strap is very uncomfortable if you are not wearing pants or some sort of leggings.  It is very abrasive next to bare skin.  Having two ankle straps would allow for both legs to be used at the same time, adding to the number of exercise that can be done with this set (such as prone leg curls).  But overall, this is a great exercise tool.",4.0
Great assembly. Good quality,4.0
I use them for p90x and the interchangeability covers the range of resistance I need. It does take a second to change bands but it's well worth the versatility. They seem to be quality products and come with a lifetime guarantee.,4.0
"This is one of the nicest workout equipment I got! I've been using these for about a year and a half, and they still work fantastic. The handles at the ends are able to rotate, which could be good or bad, depending on whether you want to workout your wrist, but I like it because it is appropriate for resistance bands. It comes with the bag as shown, so you are able to conveniently store it or carry it around. I haven't used the ankle strap much, but it is secure. I like doing bicep lifts with these, and I notice the results more quickly than using traditional weights. However, it won't help with lifting weights, as weights require you to use your wrist as well, which you don't get much wrist workout with these. I use them in addition to lifting weights.",4.0
"Quick Delivery.  Well constructed, high quality bands.  Nice addition to your home gym equipment",4.0
I have been using this daily for physical therapy for a shoulder injury for at least a month now. I have only used the door anchor thus far. No signs of wear and tear. Seems to be of quality.,4.0
Really enjoy this product.  Easy to use and set up.  Durable.,4.0
very satified with 90% of everything,4.0
Loved it!!!  Great compliment to the current workout of mine.  Super easy to set up and very convenient to work out in my room.,4.0
Met my needs.,4.0
"It's been about 5 months since I bought this and started using it. I love the content of this pack, really has a huge variety of different resistance bands and straps. You can get creative with exercises by either using the door hook, leg strap or handles.

I am not crazy happy with handles though. More often than not, the sides of the handles rub against my hands, especially if the band is behind you (doing back workouts). Many times it rubs so hard that my skin rubs off and start bleeding. I guess the material used is to hard and could be improved.",4.0
Good,4.0
I'm a shorty and wish the bands were shorter but otherwise it's a good product.,4.0
"Quality bands and clips.  Can easily clip all the bands to the handles, even all at the same time",4.0
Im satisfied.,4.0
"Nice set of resistance bands, be careful when disconnecting these as the notched part is very sharp, that is the only reason this product didn't get 5 stars from me, the sharp edge is only seen when opening these to add and remove and does not pose any danger when using the bands.",4.0
"Easy to use, equipment seems durable enough to be stepped on and stretched.  This kit is good for beginner to mid-intermediary fitness level.  I'm a 135 pound woman who lifts at the gym 3-4 times a week.  This would be a helpful kit when traveling and there's no gym for a mild warm up.  I would not count on using these resistance levels for folks who are more advanced.  You may have to purchase supplemental bands that have higher resistance for more of a workout.",4.0
Good quality bands.  Nice to have the little back - just need to be better about using them. :),4.0
excellent product,4.0
Works. We'll see how long they last.,4.0
"Good product, works as described, no problems",4.0
Traveling 100 days a year for business means that it's difficult to get in workouts consistently. Now I can do 45 minutes of cardio and then follow it up with some resistance band training. Perfect to travel with and a good sweat!,4.0
Great product. I work on an ambulance so I don't have a lot of room or a lot of options for work out equipment when I am on the rig. The interchangeable bands make moving from one weight to another very easy. I have not used any other interchangeable bands so I don't have a lot to compare it to. This product serves the purpose I need. Shoulder injuries are very common in my line of work and these bands help me strengthen my shoulder and prevent injury.,4.0
"Good but do NOT wrap the band's around anything like a post, they will wear and they will get ruined",4.0
appear to be made of great materials,4.0
very nice,4.0
"Great product, great quality.",4.0
Well made nice product,4.0
Working out with these as opposed to actual weight training has been incredible for my tone and definition. Don't get without a program but even youtubing you can create one yourself.,4.0
"Great product and exactly what you would expect.  Simple, and yet extremely helpful",4.0
Exactly as described.,4.0
"Ordered this set a couple weeks back and my wife and I both love this set to supplement our weight training.  Would give 5 stars if BMP made a fore foot cover with attached D ring for dorsiflexion (calf raises), but or now the ankle strap will suffice.  Very well made and the carabiners are very handy for quick changes.",4.0
Good products.,4.0
GREAT TO HAVE,4.0
"I think the fact that I can only give these 4 stars is partly ""user error"" - I haven't quite figured out how to best attach these for the workout I had imagined. They are of great quality, and I'm quite happy with the variety of tension selection in the one package; I just have to learn better how to use them.",4.0
Amazing construction.  Great price.  This is the quality you want in your exercise equipment. The weaving on the handle straps and at the ends of the bands can get irritating on the skin if it rubs too much.,4.0
"for the price are OK, I was wondering solid Rubber but they are Rubber Hoses.",4.0
Simple and innovative design that allows for strength training at home,4.0
"Better than I expected, feel less strain compared to free weights.",4.0
use it all the time,4.0
"I ordered these bands for my dad for father's day. When they arrived, the yellow band was in 2 pieces and the blue band wasn't there. Initially, I was pretty disappointed but after a call with the friendly service, they quickly sent replacement bands. My dad has definitely enjoyed them as they seem good quality. I would definitely recommend these as the products are good and the service is great.",4.0
So many different exercise arrangements that can be found on the web and YouTube. Keeps me motivated to increase the degree of resistance by adding multiple bands together with the easy on/off clips. Really is like taking along a mini gym on the road.,4.0
Great product,4.0
Easy to use and quick set up.  So far working great.,4.0
Excellent value. Good start for me before pursuing weight traing program.,4.0
Nice and sturdy.  Hold up well.,4.0
"I've been using these resistance band for the past three days, and I am loving it. It feels like I am back in the gym, but in the comfort of my own home. Here is my opinions so far.

Pros:
-Very easy to use.
-Able to add or subtract desirable amount of weights.
-You can do so many different number of exercises with these bands. The manual offered some suggestion, and you can always google for more ideas and helpful guide.

Cons:
-Only indicator of weight on these bands are by color. I would appreciate it more if there were numbers on them, because it will take awhile for me to remember which is which by having to refer back to the manual.
- Switching the bands back and forth for different exercises can be a bit annoying. If only it had come with 4 handles instead of two.

As promised, I am writing this review in exchange for a free resistance band. They are offering me one free band of my choice. There is an atomic green that is 70 lbs, but I went with the orange band, which is around 35 lbs. The person I was speaking to was helpful in stating that the 70lbs one is ridiculous and most of us will not need it.",4.0
"Having had these resistance bands for a little over a month, I can definitely appreciate the convenience of resistance to weight they provide. In my bag they travel, always able to have a mini gym about as I travel for work. I find myself exercising more because I have much less an excuse not to. This has led to strength and energy returns that I hope to maintain and compound upon. For these reasons, if one is in the market for convenient, effective, and compact exercise equipment, buy this. It works",4.0
"Great product, I enjoy using it. Has it hinged on door. Only once did it loose and hit me in the back but that was my fault not the product.",4.0
Yep. Super stretchy rubber bands that will give you a good work out.  Isn't that what it's supposed to do?,4.0
Great package of bands.  Really useful for getting a workout in at the office or while traveling.,4.0
I think it's a good product. But I'm finding switching cables to be awkward.,4.0
"Came exactly as advertised.  Clean, nice, high-quality.  The bands were flawless in exactly what I expected them to be.  The stitching and attachments were all good quality.  The carrying bag was a nice compact way to store them.  My only complaint was that I wish there was a bit more information on how to position them to double them up or attach them using the velcro or such, but with a little experimentation or any internet search, and was able to figure out some options.  Would definitely recommend for purchase!",4.0
I use this everyday,4.0
"its great, works exactly as you would expect.  handles are comfortable to hold.  all parts look to be high quality and are enjoyable to use.",4.0
Product is easy to use but having to change the handles every time you want a different tension in inconvenient.,4.0
good product for a reasonable rpice,4.0
It's okay,4.0
"They get the job done. The resistance on the thicker bands aren't has heavy as I was looking for, but they work for under the foot workouts.
Not the best for over the door work outs.",4.0
I really like it. Now everyone have a great day!,4.0
It's nice to be able to simply and compactly carry a gym around when traveling.  Would have given them 5 stars but the small carabiner clips that attached to the handles have some sharp edges that make it unpleasant to clip and unclip during a workout where you might be varying the amount of bands for each exercise.,4.0
"there is no manual on how to use the bands, disapointing",4.0
very good,4.0
I'm personally not a fan of resistance bands but got these for vacation. Very solid product.,4.0
"Excellent product that can be taken almost anywhere so that you can keep working out on the go.

Besides using these resistance bands in the house, I brought the bag to a local park and it worked great.  The park had smooth poles where I could wrap the bands around to do different kinds of exercises.  The velcro wrap was useful for different placements on the poles so that I could do rows, presses, with the bands around chest level.  I could also move the velcro wrap to the bottom to do curls.

The bands are also easy to clip on to the handles to adjust resistance levels.  I was doing sets with a partner, and we were able to add or remove bands fairly quickly to match each of our levels.

The manual included is also helpful.  I liked the variety of exercises and pictures that were included to show us how to do a full-body workout with the bands.

One of the few improvements I would love to see is on the bag.  It is small, compact enough to travel with.  But, it would be nice to possibly have straps to carry the bag over our shoulder.  I jogged from my home to the park with the bag, and it would have been helpful to be jogging with the bag behind my back, carried like a backpack, versus having to hold it awkwardly while running.",4.0
everything looks as can expect,4.0
"use this with my home gym (bench, squat rack and dip/pullup station) to add resistance or reduce resistance (you can use it to help or hinder your resistance levels)... works great.",4.0
If you don't want all the equipment at home you can't make it to the gym please work great. Great quality seem like they will last for a while.,4.0
Works fine. Don't like the newer clips!,4.0
These are great only wish there were now handles included as when I need a different resistance I have to stop my workout to change handles to different bands.,4.0
The bands arrived on-time and the products appears to be well done.  My only issue is that I may need a strap for heavier weights.  I have read that Black Mountain is willing to send an additional strap with no cost to me.  I will see.,4.0
Love my new band's.  The handles are good and wide for a easy grip . Love  the different options. The door thingy  any ways great for the money.  Will get plenty of use out of this.,4.0
"Absolutely love them! The only thing I might suggest is adding two ankle straps, not just one.",4.0
Very good exercise equipment for home; only drawback is single ankle strap which is insufficient for exercises like hamstring curls.,4.0
great product.,4.0
"I bought these for P90x work out, they worked great and did what I expected. Much cheaper than buying weights and i loved how you could add or remove bands to get the desired weight/resistance. It does take a little bit of time to set up for the next workout so I did have to pause the workout session while i set up between exercises. All in all I would buy these again, they are a solid product.",4.0
a big surprise!! better than expected!!,4.0
Great for a home work out. Or when you can't make it to the gym,4.0
So much versatility in these resistance bands! Black mountain makes a great product! I would recommend this product for his durability too.,4.0
It is just ok for me.,4.0
I have been using the bands to rehab my shoulder and they have worked well. The quality is good and it's easy to switch between bands for different exercises.,4.0
My wife uses these bands with her clients.  Her and I use them as well. They're great for transporting different places and very versatile. We're very pleased with the durability.,4.0
"Great customer service and product. lifetime warranty and mine had a promotion for a free orange band! One negative: sometimes the instructions don't match with the picture of the person demonstrating how to use the bands. Also, for chest flies I recommend attaching to the side of your door rather than to the top for better stability. Check out black mountains website for more exercises",4.0
"Great product, allows me to do strength resistance training while traveling. I put the bands through a lot of punishment and they fit easily in my canvas backpack.",4.0
Been using these for almost 2 weeks and having alot of fun.  I tried one other brand before these and one band broke after the first use so I returned them.  After using these I am glad I did; the construction is sturdier and it seems they are an overall better product.  I also found the exercise handout helpful and was able to put together a full workout with it.,4.0
Excellent product!!,4.0
I have been using these for over a month and they work great!  The carrying bag is very handy.. I have taken it on the road and used  in hotel room for a quick work out.  Very convenient.  Definitely recommend!,4.0
"Decent quality bands. Judging from my own strength combining all bands together equals around 75 lbs. Not bad at all for the price, the bag it comes with is cheap however. I don't expect it to last long.",4.0
Works well,4.0
"These bands are fantastic.  I love the detached handles, and that you can even double up the bands for maximum results.  They're well made, come with a door adapter, a carry bag, and even an ankle strap.  So far, I've just used the bands and the handles, though the ankle strap seems like a really useful addition.  They seem really well made, and after about a month of heavy use, they're holding together like champs.

They suffer only from their versatility.  It takes a moment to attach a new band to the handles, which sometimes can slow your workout down - though that is a super-minor complaint when compared to the versatility that you get with that particular feature.

All in all, I feel that they're worth every penny.  If you're looking for a great set of high quality bands, they're awesome.  Also, they come with a lifetime warranty (almost forgot to mention that!) which provides unbeatable piece of mind.",4.0
Great price. Great quality. Can't go wrong for the money. Only complaint is rubber odor/smell that still hasn't gone away many months later.,4.0
"I read all of the reviews and based on those outstanding reviews purchased this brand over the others.  I like the latches and there is no pinching.  I wish that it had resistance levels listed on each, like some of the other brands have.  It would make it easier than to know the colors or to look at thickness to figure it out when in a hurry.  I have two main complaints first I wish they were a tad bit longer.  I have another brand Gofit bands and they are a little longer and for a tall person that makes it a bit easier to get the form without compromising posture or bending knees and when putting overhead on pullup bar is nice to have a tad bit longer.  I guess it gives you a little more resistance because you have to extend a little more so it is probably a catch 22.  Probably others would prefer the way they are.  My second complaint is that the handles it comes with are squishy.  Yes, it is more comfortable but I would rather something more sanitary and that doesn't look so used after the first use.  My imprint is in them already.  I workout with several girls and we pass this around and I will be upgrading my handles.  Other than that the resistance is nice, the stack-ability is great and easy to hook/unhook.  I would still place this in the top brands and would highly recommend.  I am glad I purchases and will be adding to this package better handles and buying a few of the higher resistance too.",4.0
Great set so far!  The only reason they get a four is the connection between the band and the connectors are kinda tight.,4.0
"If you're looking for some quality resistance bands for workouts or training, it's hard to go wrong here. Bands and attachments are all well made and durable and have shown no issues through the first month of use. My only gripe is that the door anchor is too small. The doors in my house do not come all the way to the floor and the anchor slips through far too easily. If your doors are more than a quarter inch off the ground, you'll likely have to make some mods. Other than that, i'm happy with the purchase.",4.0
"This is a nice set of resistance bands that appear to be made to last.  These are much different and of better quality than the bands you'll find in certain stores.  The metal hooks work extremely well and you don't have to worry about them breaking in the middle of using them, and the handles also appear to be made for the long run. I've used these now for several workouts doing things like face pulls, wood chops, pallof presses and more, and they haven't seemed to lose their shape at all.",4.0
"These resistant bands are high quality and very functional. I usually go to the gym to exercise but decided to add a nightly stretching and resistance routine. This product has served very well. Easy to store and very versatile . I use them in conjunction with exercise bands for more variety. My only complaint is that I wish there were more than two handles included. I am constantly changing resistance levels for different exercises and that is a bit cumbersome. I'll look into whether I can buy handles separately. Otherwise, great product.",4.0
"I've had the previous design in the past which I prefer now. The main caveat is that when you are doing exercises where you want to tighten the band and loop it under your foot, there is already so much room between your handle and the clips and then all the way down to the band. This makes it a little hard for p90x exercises and such. Other then that they are great!",4.0
"Take some time to learn the basics, other than that seems to work OK.",4.0
"This product is very good and High Quality, long lasting and It is definetly worth it, not to mention
the fact that it isn't expensive.

No cons, all Pros to it.

Cheerss",4.0
GOOD PRODUCT,4.0
I enjoy using this set. It's helping me lose weight and tone up.,4.0
"these 5 straps are great with steel carabineers, good connections of rubber to handles, a leg strap & a door connector strap that fits in the hinge side of the door crack.....good value for price....I just started with trainer & am excited to be able to work out at home.  thanks Black Mountain",4.0
Have used these for a week now. So far have really liked them. These seem built very well. The included door strap works well and the handles appear that they will last for a good amount of use. The only complaint I have is that the carabiners on the ends of the bands seem just a little too prone to lateral movement when open which keeps them from closing all the way at times. Other than that a solid product so far.,4.0
"This is good stuff.,  The bad stuff is your laziness, other wise this is amazingly low cost to ->  low fat  yep.  Simple.",4.0
"This is a great set of resistance bands. The variety of bands is good - 2lbs to 30lbs of resistance. Combine multiple bands for more resistance. I really like how easy it is to switch the handles from band to band. They use a carabiner clip system. The included handles are good and stand up to daily use. Kit also comes with a handy instruction booklet that shows how to use the bands with numerous exercise moves. The whole kits comes in nice zipper bag - keeps it all together and in good shape. If you're in the market for quality resistance bands, go with this set.",4.0
"I love the way the bands are put together, they seem to be of a very good quality.  The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star is because I felt they needed to be a little longer.  I'm only 5'3 and they seem to short to me.",4.0
U can do it anywhere.,4.0
decent,4.0
Good,4.0
good product and performs as expected but I realized after the fact that I should of bought bands with more resistance,4.0
"I priced these at a lot of local stores and other Amazon vendors.  This was by far the best deal.  The cords are good and sturdy, connections and accessories work well and all zip into a bag you can toss somewhere.",4.0
does the job; excellent for the money,4.0
"I really like these. I have another set that is not quite as strong and well-made. These were definitely worth the price. I especially like the little work outs it included in the instructions to add to the list of exercises I already had. The storage bag is not much use, but I ended up hanging them on a large hook in my walk-in closet anyway. I would definitely recommend these if you are looking for sturdy bands that work for a variety of levels and users.",4.0
"I really like these resistance bands! They are highly durable and aren't ""cheap"" looking/feeling. The only downside is the hook feature. It's a little annoying to keep hooking and unhooking the bands when I want to change the resistance. It's my own fault because the picture and description describe this feature and I just didn't think much of it.",4.0
"I hardly used this item,but so far so good.",4.0
Purchased these to go with P90 as they are about half the price of Beach Body's resistance bands.  I have had mine for about a month and have had no problems at all.  Very well made and the materials used seem to be first rate.  They are holding up very well.  I would recommend these if you are looking for good quality bands at a great price.,4.0
"""Just go to your idiot Pilates class, Julie. You won't save money buying things you never use.""",4.0
"These resistance bands are nice, but wish they were shorter for what I wanted to use them for. I finally figured out what the black plain piece was for, to stick in a door, in order to use bands that way. I am mainly using the stronger black band with handles and red one to stretch, just using my hands. I guess I need two more handles. I really wanted the chair gym months ago, but HSN would take too long to ship it. The other three bands are okay to stretch together. The ankle strap is okay if you find the right place to use it. The directions do tell you not to wrap straps around any part of body, but I did it anyway. Sometimes you get tired of using the door! The metal hooks along with cloth piece attached to them are nice also, but cloth fits more comfortably having it hang from the larger part of hook.",4.0
"As a Personal Trainer (and a customer) I'm happy with these Resistance Bands.

As a Personal Trainer:

When you're using Resistance Bands you're demonstrating a type of training called ""Dynamic Resistance Training.""  This refers to the fact that throughout the entire movement resistance is being applied to the muscle that is being worked.  A Biceps Curl is a perfect example.  When using a resistance band for a biceps curl at the top of the movement (meaning when your arm is up towards your shoulder) there is still resistance being placed on the muscle because of the elasticity of the band.  If you were doing the same biceps curl with a standard free weight barbell, at the top of the movement there is little to no resistance being placed on the muscle.  This is the beauty of Dynamic Resistance Training. The muscle is being placed under constant tension.

At some point you may find that there is not enough resistance when using any one individual band, but no worries!  Just combine a couple of bands to increase the resistance!

As a Customer:
I like having a set of bands around for when I can't get to the gym or I am traveling.  Everything easily fits in the bag that is included and they are compact.  It's very easy to switch positioning or add bands thanks to the quick release clips. I enjoy using bands with handles versus the therapy bands that are used by Physical Therapists or Yoga instructors.  Those tend to pinch the skin, and it's definitely harder to get a good workout in!  These bands almost feel the same as working out in the gym with the cable machine.",4.0
Durable and holding up after a year of use.  The handles are a bit meh but you can upgrade once the plastic cracks....even before because the bands and metal loops are solid.,4.0
"Great for starters, high quality",4.0
"It takes more time to add or remove bands than it might to just grab another individual band but being able to clip all the bands to a single handle really allows for a wide range of resistances, which is very useful. The washer design allows for good movement but can scratch bare arms if doing certain moves, which Ive found uncomfortable on occasion.",4.0
Excellent product. One suggestion is to make the cable clips easier to remove a cable. The cables can be clipped on very quickly but removing them seems a little awkward.,4.0
"Really good product and easy to use. Simple to change out bands. Only reason I am not ranking higher is I wish the bands went higher in resistance. But to each his own. Either way, a great product for the price so far.",4.0
"Bought these in Nov2014. I used them pretty frequently, 5 days a week every other month. But recently I noticed since I left them, in their bag, under my carport for about 3 weeks they have become discolored. That's a red flag to me because my previous bands (different brand) got discolored and snapped on me. I almost ended up punching myself in the face.

Though these haven't broke, I'm opting for buying a new set. I would recommend only storing them inside.",4.0
great product,4.0
The product is great so far but it comes with quite low resistance bands. It would be nice to have one in there that was a bit higher.,4.0
A little bit shorter than expected,4.0
"Pro:
Good product. I can recommend this set.

Con:
Some bands have too light resistance.
The web gets in the way occasionall when the clip is depressed",4.0
On time delivery and a great deal.,4.0
Product was as described and arrived quickly.,4.0
"The quality is great. Carabiner ends are very sturdy and allow quick reclamping during workouts.  I use mine for Focus T25 workouts.  They work great.  My only issue is with the weight ratings...They aren't accurate.  I gave my normal red band (25-30lbs) to a friend and tried using black (15-20lbs) plus green (10-12) and quickly determined they were much more difficult than their supposedly equivalent red band.  With that said, you can experiment to find a combination that works for you.  Otherwise, I would purchase again and recommend to a friend.",4.0
Good buy.,4.0
"This product overall is great. It seems extremely durable. I appreciate the doorhanger. Everything seems like quality construction. The only downfall is it can be a pain to switch the handles on to a new band every time you need to change resistance, especially if you are doing drop sets or supersets. It would be great if they gave you two sets of handles instead of one. Otherwise, I highly recommend it!",4.0
"very good product!
would be nice if it included a second ankle/ hand strap.

one downside: the quality of the door anchor material is not that good. after 5-6 uses it is already a bit deteriorated.
hope that the product will last cause the training is effective!",4.0
"Nice bands.  Solid construction, connectors are solid spring loaded metal. Good overall value for the money -- though not quite so much as they used to be about a year ago when you could get them for $28 with free Prime Shipping.",4.0
They are excellent in quality and have an intelligent design as far as being  able to easily  adjust the amount of resistance you use quickly and easily. . Options for additional bands to increase resistance would make this a five star product.,4.0
"Great, having all the bands on at once gets to be a little cluttered, but still works great",4.0
useful,4.0
nice,4.0
"Very helpful for home workouts, only thing that I noticed was some of the clips were extremely tough to clip onto the handles. Nothing major, it was a small workout on its own! Thanks for the great price on these products!",4.0
Just as described and I love the handles so I can switch or add pounds.,4.0
"This was a good product just wasn't enough weight for me. I use small bands at work that are great, I wanted something a little better for home. I love the way they snap on and you can add or remove resistance. Perfect product for someone just beginning. I would recommend this to a friend.",4.0

"This was my first tiem using resistance bands, so i wasn't really sure what to expect. They are a pretty sweet addition to my weight and i use them every work out. I don't have but a few weights, so this is a lot cheaper for me to work out at home.",4.0
"I have just started working out with a trainer and she uses this band set in various different ways.  I really liked the ease and versatility of the bands so I have ordered a set for home.  I used them when I got them and have found home use the same.  Lots of things you can do with them, they come in a bag so you can store them easily.  Great for beginners at least, as that is where I am its all I can say!!  Worth it.",4.0
"I had not heard of Black Mountain products prior to finding them as a result of my search for ""resistance tubes"".  I was looking to quickly replace my existing tube from a different manufacturer which had recently snapped.  I didn't know one brand from the other, but what appealed to me about the Black Mountain bands was the carabiner attachment and the ability to customize a resistance level by mixing and matching different bands attached to the handles at any one time.  All of the previous tubest that I had purchased were single resistance which provided much less flexibility.

I ordered the bands on a Saturday and they arrived on a Sunday.  Nice!!.  I immediately began experimenting with various resistance until I found the one that best met my needs for the exercises I do.  Everything went well for the first few weeks, but then one of two the bands that I had been using together snapped.  This caused me to take a look at the other band  and I noticed that it was detiorating and appears likely to snap soon.

Ths was very disappointing.  I called Black Mountain to report my experience.  To my pleasant surprise, I learned about their lifetime guarantee and they agreed to ship me repacements for both bands.  I was very pleased with this result.  I have learned that resistances tubes can wear quickly.  Now I no longer have to fork out more money to replace the bands when they snap.",4.0
Good,4.0
"really fun, but the lower resistances are pure waste",4.0
I have found the product very helpful for excising the upper body and core. I had one faulty carabiner and Black Mountain Products replaced it with no problem.,4.0
Great price on good product.,4.0
"This set of resistance bands is just what I was looking for in a home work out set.  The ability to combine bands for increased resistance was the feature that put these in my cart.  Only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the width of the hand grip.  For several exercises, I have to be VERY precise in where I place my hand so that the nylon straps don't rub my hands raw. I would recommend this set to anyone. Right now the Mfr is offering a free increased weight band. Great value!",4.0
good assortment of resistances that you can mix for almost any weight.  Easy to use.,4.0
"These are well made and the kit is a good deal. It comes with a set of stackable bands, the handles, door anchor and ankle strap. Aside from stretching and light work most will have to add bands to this kit. I added a purple (40-50lbs) and the atomic green (70-75lbs). I use my kit to workout when I am on the road. They yellow and blue bands are useless to me, but buying outside of the kit is more expensive. I have about $60 all into this kit and it allows me to work my chest, arms, shoulders, back, do ""weighted"" squats and all the major muscle groups. I add in some planks for core and jumping jacks to get my heart rate up and it is a great workout that can be thrown in a bag, taken and done about anywhere.",4.0
cost was fantastic. the bag is nice to store these in. i like that you can clip many of the bands to the handles. i use these while binge watching shows on netflix. arrived very quickly.,4.0
Great band set!,4.0
Bands are working out fine. I would recomend this product.,4.0
Good quality.,4.0
"I'm using them while doing P90X (it's been a week), and then only reason it's not giving 5 stars it because they only have a single handle, and I find I constantly have to switch tensions during the workout. It would have been perfect if there were 2 sets of handles",4.0
Using these bands correctly is a challenge. The focus required for maintaining proper form is more than what I need when using free weights and machines. This is a good thing. I've been watching some videos online to improve my understanding of the product; there are many. I'm excitied to be expanding my fitness habits with them. Good luck.,4.0
