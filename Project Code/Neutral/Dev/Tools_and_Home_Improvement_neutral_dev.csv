"I have two of these mobile bases and an HTC mobile base. I prefer the HTC because the foot lever on the Delta protrudes into the shop walking area and causes a tripping hazard. I've tripped over them many times and tehy get in the way when I use the tools. The foot actuated operation is nice(although it tips the tool at angle uncomfortably far from vertical) but in my small shop, I need all the real estate I can get. I plan to replace the Deltas with HTCs when I can afford it. The HTC base uses two locking knobs to keep the wheels from moving while the tool is in use. It's less convenient than a foot lever, but it works well.",2.0
"First motor was under warranty and it was replaced, but I had to carry it to the repair shop which was 30 miles from my shop. Next motor lasted 13 months and it burned out, plus the capacitor burned up and 2 bearings were worn to the point of needing replacing. I think it was good that Black & Decker bought Delta Tools maybe they will improve the quality of the tools.",2.0
"I wish Jet made one of these. I've about decided to give up on Delta.
It is a strange philosophy to try to sell inferior tools with inferior instructions to us craftsman ""perfectionists"".
I received my Delta 6"" Belt/9"" Disc Sander this past friday so I can't comment on the longterm use ot the tool - but I will say that the package was pretty much falling apart when I received it. A tool that weighs 90lbs should be in a sturdy box.
Then there were the assembly problems. The support stand for the frame is lettered wrong in the instructions. One page describes the parts as lettered A thru E (there are two of each letter). The parts in the photo do not match the parts on the list. On the next page, the stand is shown assembled with parts lettered - again the letters point to thr wrong pieces. To make matters worse, the parts themselves are lettered A thru E. But these have no relevence either. As a result, at 15 minute assembly took me two hours of assembling and reassembling.
The belt tensioning screw does not work but I'll not get into those details - it would take too long to describe it.
Finally, belt wonders terribly from side to side and it is very difficult to keep centered.
I wonder what surprises await when I actually try to use this thing.",2.0
"The saw is fine for what I paid.  My real gripe is that part of the reason that I chose this model is that Amazon stated in the specs that the saw was assembled in the U.S.  Instead, it has the MADE IN CHINA logo emblazoned everywhere.  I try to buy American when I can.  Amazon isn't helping here...",2.0
"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said ""Drywall and Deck"" Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill.",2.0
"A contractor here bought one of these recently and i tried it and liked it.  Smooth with great trigger response.  only complaint I had was the trigger was so long that if one gets into trouble you can't let go the trigger without letting go the drill (a bad move sometimes).

My beloved makita 6303 suffered a mishap (my bad) and so I bought the milwaukee but it makes unnerving sounds and some vibration.  A sort of clacking sound, sounds like gears.  I even compared side by side with the contractors new one just to make sure I wasn't imagining it.  Nope, sounded terrible.

I think it has to do with the spotty qc on chinese made tools.  I returned it.  It cost more, but I ordered a makita dp4000 since I liked my previous makita 1/2 drill so well.  Haven't received it yet.",2.0
I am very surprised of makita motor is very noisy this one didn't impress me,2.0
"I was disappointed with the performance of the sander. It was difficult to control -- it usually hopped, skipped and jumped across the piece I was trying to sand unless I only used the edge of the disk. The sanding action  was not as aggressive as I had hoped. I have pretty much reverted back to  using my belt sander for rough sanding and my Dewalt ROS for the finish  work. I also found the unit uncomfortable to hold. The vacuum hose seemed  to be in the way. I actually wind up holding the vacuum hose and the  screw-on handle while operating.",2.0
"This sander is great in the beginning.  It works like a well built machine, and then, it happens.  For some reason, this thing gets out of balance and ceases to do a good job.  It wobbles all over the place.  My  shop owns 6 of these that were all bought at the same time, now after one  year of daily use, 4 of them are unusable because of the  counter-balance.
PROS
** Can apply alot of pressure
** Very  strong
CONS
** Gets out of balance
** Brushes hard to change
** 2  hand sander",2.0
I am very disappointed with this sander.  I thought it would work great for sanding large table tops.  Instead I have found that a large belt sander (4x24) followed by a finishing sander does a much better and quicker  job.  I have the Porter Cable 4x24 sander and the Porter Cable 330  finishing sander.,2.0
"Loved this saw, but after purchasing February 2015 the motor has went on it already. Makita qualified repair service told me today it would cost $286 to fix it. More than the saw cost.  Purchased because of the Makita name. Should have lasted more then 17 months. Disappointed",2.0
"A friend of mine bought this kit after I gushed about my Hitachi 14.4v system.  I loved the chuck, the weight distribution and the fast charger.  His 9.6 seemed too heavy, and while the charge held out for a good while,  it simply wasn't up to running a masonry bit or driving deep wood screws.  He felt like he had bought a weak screwdriver and an expensive flashlight.  I just felt bad for recommending Hitachi drills in general.  Usually their  engineering is such that they don't offer a weak tool.  Don't buy this  except for fairly light duty.  The 14.4 is as good a drill as is out there  however, and I have used the 24v Bosch and can still say that.",2.0
I received my sander today. When I unpacked the item there where broke items. When I called to get replacement parts I was told that it would be 2-3 weeks before I would get them.  If I buy something new and items are  broke or missing I don't think it should take that long to get replacement  parts.  I could order another sander and return this one quicker.  Bad  customer service.,2.0
Purchased the LS1040 to replace a LS1020 that was lost during a move. I was hoping this model would be as accurate as the LS1020 once it was set up properly. First noticed the saw was very light due to the aluminum base but not a show stopper. I was unable to get the turntable to lock properly outside of the detents. No matter how tight the locking handle was turned the turntable could still be moved. This could probably be corrected by adding a rubber pad to the back of the pressure plate or sanding the paint from  where the plate meets the saw. The locking arm for the bevel would hit the exhaust port so i had to disassemble and adjust to allow a firm lock without hitting the exhaust port. I mount my portable tools on quick release arms for a workstation and this tool only has 3 mounting holes. At this point I decided this saw would not work as a remplacement. I have been pleased with the quality and accuracy of Makita tools in the past but will have to rethink that in the future. Returning for a refund.,2.0
"Not happy with this purchase at all.  Seems to be a lot of variance in the units.  I looked at a unit built some years ago, and had a chance to work with it, and it was a dream.  Smooth, quiet operation, solid construction, precise, clean fit among parts.
When I received mine, the fan cover had slipped, shearing off the screws that hold it in place.  Amazon was excellent in getting a new one to me.
The new one works as well as can be expected, but is extremely disappointing.  The assembly and stop set to keep things in square is cheap and has excessive play.  The milling on the mini table was miserable -- obvious quality control problems.  I had to machine the table down myself.  (I chose to do this rather than getting another unit shipped out.)
I finally have a machine that works fairly well, but I had to put in a lot of effort and time to get it to that point.  I would suggest carefully examining all other options before purchasing this Delta Disc Sander.
Happy shop time....",2.0
"It works like it's supposed to, but unlike in the picture, it did not come with any of the attached polishing heads.  :(",2.0
"I'm not sure where to start.  Well, let me first say that I am somewhat of a tool afficianado.  If its a tool I probably tried it once or twice.  I love tools.  Big ones, small ones you name it.  Armed with a lifetime of experience I feel that I am an excellent judge of tools.  This tool may look pretty, sure it can fit in the palm of your hand, but what really counts is POWER.  This little tool just lacks in the rpm department.  A man like myself needs his tool to get the job done fast.  I don't have time to jerk around with my tool.  If you're a woman, this may be the drill for you.  But men like me deserve a bigger , faster tool.",2.0
"Received my Delta mortiser today (for Christmas), will be returning it first thing Monday morning.  The fit and finish is very poor.  In assembly, the manufacturer stripped the socket of a set screw securing the depth stop.  I cannot get it out to replace it with a new one.
The shaft  on the hold down is machined crooked and when you use it to hold down a  board, one end touches the board, and the other end is approx 3/8""  above the board.  Overall, parts don't fit together very well at all.
I  made one cut with it using a 5/16"" chisel, and it performed fair,  considering the bits that came with the unit.
I really hate this but it  seems Delta is going the same direction with tool quality as Craftsman.  Most of my stationary tools in my shop is Delta and I have been quite  satisfied with them in the past.
Like I say, I'm returning it Monday  morning, and ordering the more expensive unit made by Powermatic.  I'll be  commenting on that unit when I receive it.",2.0
"Anyone who has setup and used a drill press mortiser would be attracted to these mortisers. That and the FWW review are why I purchased the mortiser to make doors...much to my surprise the mortiser would not accept a piece  wider than 4.75"". After fabricating some spacers to fit between the  base and neck I was able to get the 5"" that I needed. Admittedly my  fault for overlooking this, but it would have been good  to incorporate  this capability into the design. One other problem was the quality of the  chisels,  very poor edge, with much difficulty was able to mortise Poplar  after predrilling. Now that I know other higher quality chisels are  available, that problem should be solved. Depending on your use (light  duty) it could be an adequate machine with the right chisels.",2.0
"Batteries and chargers are the weak point for these I have used the drivers I have 2 for years they made a good driver but I have been through so many batteries and chargers I have lost count, I have spent way too much on replacement batteries and chargers, it is so darn comfortable and easy to use that I keep buying them but I see there is a different company making one very similar for less than the charger cost so I dare this one to go out now",2.0
"This is not a drill I use very offen, and I would expect that it would have lasted a little longer. While running in a screw, I stripped out the gears and now have a tool that will cost as much to repair as it will to replace. Also the paddle switch is not very well designed, for a drill that is intended for cramped spaces I would expect something that was less prone to getting bumped or caught up, also the drill continues to spin long after you let off the paddle. This drill is fine for drilling small holes in cramped spaces that don't need to be damaged, that's about it.",2.0
"I've probably used this drill 5 time total. Mostly drilling holes in studs for electrical wire. I expect for $155 that the drll would last a lot longer. Didn't abuse it, or drill through nails. As soon as I started doing one inch holes the gears started to slip and that was that. If your doing small holes this drill is for you, otherwise use a half inch drill because this drill won't last very long.",2.0
"This tool is a real disappointment. I won't go into repeating the negative comments of the other owners of this tool for fear of scaring off potential P-C customers. I own several P-C tools (circular saw, belt sander, plate (biscuit) joiner and RO sander) and am very pleased with their performance. I spend a fair amont of time on woodworking sites and reading magazine reviews before plunking down ANY money (even a few $ on sand paper)on a tool or accessory. Unfortunetely, this research was not down prior to buying this (s)tool. I purchased this before a remodel project and did not get to use it before the 30 day satisfaction guarantee expired. If this was not the case, it would have been returned immediately. I gave this tool 1 star, however, it does not rate even 1 star. Save your cash. P.S. I bought a Sandvik scraper with holster and profile blades, reground the blades to fit the specific profile needed and they worked like a dream. Tim Allen is wrong, more power is not always better.
OK, I have doubled the review of this tool after having it for over a year.  There are a few tasks for which this tool is handy, i.e. sanding a roundover profile on a table edge.  But still the tool's feel is cheap and the thing eats sandpaper. DO NOT try to sand a painted surface with it.",2.0
My 352 belt sander needs new armature bearings after very light and infrequent use. The repair cost is almost the same as a new sander.  My Black and Decker sander lasted for 25 years and I expected more service from the 352 P-C sander.,2.0
"A good tool with certain attachments, but using the knife shaped tool -- and most of the sharper shapes -- with the adhesive backed paper is a cruel joke.  If you're lucky and the black rubber thingy actually stays in the plastic holder, the paper will wear out in 10 seconds flat and the black rubber will rub all over your work.  I honestly can't understand how such a ridiculously lousy design made it to mass production.  Try again, Porter Cable.",2.0
"This thing is too big to work with and awkward to hold.  The profile holders come off the machine during use and the adhesive paper doesn't hold to them well.  The H&L paper work well on the triangle foot, but you can get something easier to user for a lot less money.  All in all you need something smaller, lighter and with (wire or other) clambs to hold the paper.",2.0
"The bars are a little flimsy. When you are routing close to the edge, it works fine. However when you extend it, not very stable.",2.0
"Yes its an edge guide, but geese PC couldn't you have made this a little nicer than you did? This guide works, but the casting is so rough ( and flimsy ) that it makes it hard to run the router smoothly along your work's edge. It really is that bad. Compared to the BOSCH edge guide the PC is marginal at best. I modified mine with a phenolic ( polyethelene ) material cut to the same size as the guides, and used 3M double sided structural tape between the phenolic "" glides "" and the PC guides, and it works much better. Come on PC, I know you sell enough of the 690 series routers and accessories to justify some improvement.",2.0
Not for the new type of batterie.,2.0
Sander works well but the dust collection system is worthless,2.0
It was not made clear that this tool used a different battery than the above batteries so have no way yo test or use it . Shipping would cost more than discarding the tool !,2.0
i got the work light but it takes the old style battery. its useless to me so i guess i just wasted 10 bucks,2.0
"Looks like the 14.4 Volt Unit, I managed to order the wrong one! After having looking at the correct one several times before I decided to Order, Price, Shipping, Webpage all looked alike, Wasn't until I received it that I noticed my error, Not worth the hassle to send it back...",2.0
"Bought the PC 352VS on Nov 23 2013 from home improvement store. My job is to sand and level an OSB sub floor. The sander itself does what any belt sander should do, although the asking price of $165.00 does not justify the large flaws of this machine. Notice from the picture the exhaust port dust collection bag is directed straight up. This is a flawed design for 2 reasons. One: the CLAMP used to attach bag to exhaust port is the double loop squeeze type. Although easy to remove quickly the method in which they sew the bag material to the clamp leaves gaping holes which invariably shot high speed dust at my face no matter which way I pivoted the bag, I tiresome chore. Even duct taping the gaps was insufficient.  Two: The bag material itself is so porous that even with the duct tape the dust escaping through the material will soon fill your room with a thick dusty haze like a chinese industrial city on a hot summer day. My living room is 300+ sq ft with 12ft vaulted ceiling. A sizable amount of cubic area yet even with box fans in windows I couldn't keep the dust cloud at a tolerable level. Possibly redesigning exhaust port to a rear exit might crutch this spendy machine but probably not. Shop elsewhere.
Why did I buy it? My faithful 50 year old Stanley finally needed a brush change and is in the repair shop. Job had to move forward so I got this unit. By the way my Stanley doesn't even have a dust collector. Just leaves a uniform trail of sawdust that is easily scooped up by shopvac that you would have on hand anyway.
End result. Returning unit to vendor asap. Will wait for Stanley to be repaired.

"I was dismayed that this Milwaukee tool is made in China.  It works fine, but the plastic is a bit thinner and it feels a bit more fragile than the Dewalt light I have that was made in Mexico.",2.0
"I just bought this sander yesterday and returned it today.  It worked great for ten minutes, then trouble.  I first read the manual thouroughly!  It was fine on my test drive with the supplied 80 grit sanding belt.  Powerful and hefty, but pretty easy to use.  Ran hot, but they do that.  Dust flew out of the dusthole, and later was sucked up nicely with my shop vac with a conversion fitting I bought. I switched to a 50 grit norton to remove more stock and it was fine for about three minutes until the belt started to wander all over the place.  (The belt didn't have directional arrows on the inside so I put it in with number/lettering upright facing the front.)  No matter how often or how minutely I adjusted the tracking it quickly wandered one way or the other.  Took only 10-15 seconds to either jam into the sander or wander way off.  I then put the supplied sand belt back on and the same durned thing happened!!  Can't blame the belt.  While all this was going on I kept getting small but VERY NOTICEABLE shocks when my trigger finger touched the metal housing.  (Yes, I'm on a grounded circuit.)  AFter a few minutes of trying to work the tracking adjustment the front roller stuck in place to the way inside.  Repeated attempts to get it back in place with the adjustment knob resulted in the roller snapping back to it's new skewed, cockeyed home. Something inside wore away after fifteen minutes of use...  It's a big shame.  I really liked the way this sander felt.  Maybe I got a lemon.  I might try another one.",2.0
"I have used these sanders for several years in my custom cabinet shop.  They sand well enough but have numerous deficiencies.  They are loud, very loud; not 1 of the dust bags didn't fall apart after several months; they cannot be clamped to a bench for use as a stationary sander. Have been so happy with the Makita belt sander recently purchased to replace the aging 352VS's, that when the last 352VS needed repair (again) I just through it away.",2.0
"I always wanted Porter Cable belt sander. I had an old Ryobi and it lasted for years doing continual carpentry work...but I knew it was not a great machine.  I got this 352VS from Amazon 5 years ago, put about 8 hours on it (no longer doing carpentry full-time)...and a few weeks ago did some light-duty sanding on a piece of furniture.  The belt started slipping and then stopped.  Opened the tool and found the drive pulley is plastic, not metal.  It had sheared at the ""hub"".  Seems foolish for Porter Cable to have replaced at 40-cent metal pulley with a 15 cent plastic pulley but that's what they did.  My local tool repair guy told me they did this for a while.  Now they are back to metal, supposedely, but who knows what else they changed.  Now that DeWalt has bought Porter Cable, who knows what things will be like in the future.
My advice, avoid this one and look at Bosch.
to be fair, when the tool was running, it performed pretty well; had adequate power, tracked well and dust bag worked adequately.  Speaking of which, Amazon shipped this WITHOUT the dust bag.  It was advertised WITH bag, so I contacted them.  It took some complaining but they sent me one.  I've seen this before with discount vendors; they ""strip"" accessories out of the box.  I'm not saying THEY did that, but someone did.  The box was sealed, had no dust bag and they initially did not want to send me one.",2.0
"Always wanted a Porter Cable belt sander.  My old Ryobi lasted years but I know it was not a great machine.  I got this perhaps 5 years ago but as I am not working regularly as a carpenter anymore, and the machine was used for one small job and then hardly at all for 5 years.
Recently doing some light-duty sanding on a small dresser and the belt started slipping.  Then stopped.  Opened up the machine and found that the secondary drive pulley (the one that is attached to the drive ""wheel"") is made of light plastic and had broken (sheared-off) at the ""hub"" of the pulley.  This is a little 15-cent peice of plastic that is on the critical drive-train.  Seems very foolish of Porter Cable to do this.  My local tool repair guy told me they did this for a while but supposedly they are making it with a metal gear/pulley again.
I come to a company like Porter Cable not for bare-minimum engineering but for robust ""lifetime"" engineering.  Having a tool fail on the job is no good; I don't care what the warantee is like (in this case...past warantee).
My advice, check out a Bosch.  Porter Cable does not get high marks for this one.  This would not have lasted a day on a real jobsite with that plastic gear in there!
To be fair, when it runs- it feels fine.  Balance is fair.  It tracks well and the dust collector works reasonably well. (By the way, Amazon had this shipped WITHOUT the bag!  I had to sort-of make a big deal about it because it IS advertised as having the bag).  Gotta be careful!
Another small point, no case at all available-even as an additional accessory.",2.0
"I have used this sander for a while, even bought a new switch because while it was under warranty it wouldn't shut off. It was easier to just buy a switch and put in myself. It sands great, I use it mostly for removing planing marks and sanding out joints.

The reason for the low rating is the way Porter Cable decided to solve the problem of dust getting in the motor. I was wondering why the bag never filled, I thought the chanel where the dust goes from the back of the sander was blocked with debris. When I took the side off I was right it was blocked, with a piece of metal put in at the factory and siliconed to seal it. I cut the piece out and now use a vacume to help with the dust collection. This is better, but the impellor only blocks the way, next time that will be removed to allow the vacume to do it's job. I don't care if it voids the warranty, I'm more worried about the warranty on my lungs, a concern Porter Cable should also share.",2.0
"The sander itself has good power,the dust collection system on the other hand is a joke on this model. I use a sander alot holding it in a vertical position,and all your doing is eating dust.

"I have owned two of these in the space of 2 days and both of them

have died within that time frame.  In both cases, I was cleaning

metal with the belt.  After sanding continuously for just over an

hour the case was very hot.  The sanding belt is driven by a belt

inside the casing.  The drive belt turns a PLASTIC pulley that is

used to turn the belt.  In both sanders the plastic pulley

stripped and was completely useless.  My guess is that the

plastic got hot and softened.  I am very disappointed in this

sander and am going return it for a different brand tomorrow.

I giving it two stars only because when it did work it worked

very well.  If you were using it intermittently (like for 5

minutes max. at a time) then it would probably work well.",2.0
"Before buying a belt sander, I borrowed and friend's Bosch and rented one of these. I found the PC unit to be underpowered; when pressed on the work surface, it slows down considerably and gets hot quickly - the housing is too hot to touch! In contrast, the Bosch unit had significantly more power, making the job easier. I also disliked the PC's ergonomics - the bag sticks up between your hands and gets in the way when you're using the machine on a vertical surface. Buy a Bosch.",2.0
"With my saw I needed to mechanically hold the saw to the base or it would slide off when you try to move it. Otherwise, it works well.",2.0
"While this saw is powerful and well balanced, it has several short comings.  One of the most aggravating is the ease with which the depth adjustment slips.  The depth adjustment's quick lock handle engages a  locking bolt that runs in a slot.  This bolt has a square section which has  stripped out (with minimal use) and the bolt turns in this slot causing the  depth adjustment to slip.  It is not replaceable unless you completely  disassemble the saw.
The forward part of the base of the saw is not  chamfered on the right side of the blade.  This causes the saw to hang up  when cutting plywood or other rough-surfaced wood, especially when cutting  across the grain.
Overall the quality of the saw is only average, not  what I expected from Makita",2.0
"I am disgusted! This is a decent built base however, it will not fit a Delta Unisaw with the cast iron base extension. The saw I am I using is an older Unisaw. I called Delta Tech assistance and was told they do not make a base for the older Unisaws. I also asked if they receive the same question often and the answer was ""yes."" I did not see any technical info about this on Amazon.com when I ordered this item. I did not have the time to build my own mobile base and thought I would save some time by purchasing this item. I now have to spend a few hours cutting it apart and making it wider to fit my saw. I feel this item is misrepresented by not informing the would be buyer that it may not work for their saw. I am still disgusted!!!",2.0

"Unfortunately, the middle caster assembly developed so much play that it is not able to lift the base high enough to move the saw on my concrete floor.

"I've had this mobile base for five years.  The concept is great; a low profile base for occasional moving of a heavy tool, but sturdy and immobile during use.  Unfortunately, the extension on the wheel lift suffered a broken weld after a couple of years use.  Since I only moved the saw four times, that's unacceptable performance.  There's only a small weld that fixes the extension bar to the lift plate, so check it carefully if you get one of these bases or you may face an expensive repair later!",2.0

With the thin kerf Freud I tighten the arbor nut, turn the saw on, turn the saw off, and the blade spins on the arbor.  This is dangerous.  With the thick kerf the arbor nut stays tight but the stabilizer isn't needed with a thick kerf blade.  I'm returning this item.",2.0
"I thought I was upgrading from the Milwaukee 2.5 volt power screwdriver. This one has the noisy clutch, but I have never had any trouble with this style.

The auto shut off of the Panasonic is a electric switch that turns the tool off. Mine lasted about 4 months, returned for service, lasted another 2 weeks. The clutch was stoping power to the motor..  I like the extra power, but will stick to the Milwaukee for reliability.",2.0
"I bought one of these for my father, a retired electrician who occasionally still takes jobs.  At first, he loved this little drill.  The only shortcomings he noticed in the beginning were the lack of a keyless chuck and the fact that the paddle-switch could be dangerous if you weren't paying close attention to what you were doing.  In the end though, what became this drills downfall was the cheap construction inside the housing.  After only a few jobs, a plastic component around the motor cracked, allowing the teeth to slip under strain.  A DeWalt service shop charged... to fix this problem.  The second hole it drilled after that caused the gears to give out.  It was a great idea, but DeWalt needs to send this one back to the design board for more work...  I wish now that I had spent the extra money on the bigger DeWalt right angle drill.",2.0

"For starters, no combination of the collars would fit snugly on my drill press; I had to use some pipe clamp to fill in the gap.  This was really surprising and frustrating (there are so MANY included collars, I really thought one would fit!).

So I finally get setup, I grab my ""test"" piece of scrap.  Clamp it down (btw the table is WAY too short!  I could only use one of the clamp arms) and start to drill.  At the point where I felt I was forcing things I started to back off, and the entire piece of wood came up with the cutter.  ALL the clamps failed: the ""hold fasts"", the guide, AND the lock holding the chisel in place!  Four different failures, all on the first cut.  No thanks!  Returned immediately.",2.0
"OK, I have owned this saw since 1988 and it recently was stolen so I replaced it with a new one. I'm sorry but the new one  just a  copy of the original 60 degree bevel saw that it replaced. My old saw built thousands of sets of stairs - especially winders where you need that 60 degree capability. This new saw is the same, same model, same AMP's etc but as I am using it I am telling myself its just not right, OK it weighs the same  but it just does not have the torque and smoothness of my original saw. A glance at the ID plate tells me all I need to know "" Made in China""  I am not knocking China in fact their manufacturing has made leaps and bounds over the US but there is still something not correct about this saw, It also cuts at an angle with the scale set to zero, If I could return it I would.",2.0

Returned this and bought the Delta Mortising Machine which works a lot better and easier set up!,2.0
"Overall, I wish that I had applied the purchase price of this drill press attachment to the purchase of a stand-alone mortising machine.

When mine arrived I was disappointed with the fit and finish.  The unit that holds the work piece is made from cast iron.  Unfortunately, only one face had been machined smooth.  The supplied bolts would not slide the length of the slots in the cast iron work piece holder.  I took the unit to my local machine shop to have work piece holder re-machined.  That added almost $50.00 to the purchase price.  The photo of the product shows a nicely painted  assembly - mine was unpainted cast iron.

In use I needed almost every C-clamp I owned to hold it firmly to my drill press - in addition to the supplied hold down hardware.  Aligning the cutter to be square with the edge of the work piece is almost impossible.",2.0
"Purchased for me as a gift. It arrived with two 5/16"" bits and no 3/8"" bit. Returned for replacement. Replacement arrived with all parts correct. During assembly found out the locking handle is stripped out. Looked online for replacement locking handle and part is discontinued. Have not been able to complete setup yet and test out until I can find replacement part somewhere. Not impressed so far. May just return it and purchase something different.",2.0
"I bought a Delta Unisaw about four years ago.  It is a great machine.  At the same time I purchased the sliding table.  The sliding table sat in the box until now because I hated to cut off the Beisemeyer fence and table extensions on the side the sliding table mounts to.  I finally decided that the sliding table would be a functional addition so I began the process of installing it.  I have at least 6 hours into the installation and I'm not sure that I will be able to get the table installed accurately enough to be acceptable.  The table is not flat in any direction.  The tube which the rollers grip runs away from the blade over .001 inches.  I've shimmed and rebraced but...And how much is ""...slightly above the saw table.""  I agree with another reviewer who advised watching imported Delta tools carefully.  I purchased the tenon jig with the saw and then sent it back (imported) because it was just a big chunk of greasy steel, with adjustment knobs that did not clear nearby pieces of the jig.  I wish I would have looked at the sliding table in time to send it back.  Come on Delta, quit making accessories that do not live up to the Unisaw standard!",2.0
"I agree totally with many other reviewers.  Great tool, but these
blades are very expensive considering that the teeth break off very
very easily.  To make a blade last, you must really use the ""white
glove"" treatment, otherwise one blade equals one cut.  Too bad, i love
this tool, but will use it only as a last resort because of blade expense.",2.0
"I bought this some time ago and finally got around yesterday to attaching it to my drill press. When I did so, I found that, with the chisel in the chisel holder, there was a gap of more than an inch and a half between the top of the drill bit and the chuck it was supposed to go into, making the attachment unusable. The information on the attachment specifies the diameter of the quill that it fits on but says nothing about the vertical dimension, the distance between the quill that the chisel holder attaches to and the chuck that the drill bit fits into.

I plan to see if I can find a drill bit extender that would solve that problem. If not, the device will be entirely useless.",2.0
The product it not manufactured for precision. You will definitely shorten the life of your drill press. The chisels themselves are razor sharp though. Im going back to the old school way to mortise and tenon,2.0
"I have used this tool for over a year now to do a wide variety of projects. I first noticed that the fence 'slipped' when I was doing some fine work. The fence slips when you rest it upon your work (when you measure the biscuit slot from the top of the fence plate). This happens no matter how hard I tighten the fence. The solution for this tool is to only use it resting flat and then to only use the fence as a guide. Since I do the kind of work that requires more precision, I will be moving up to the Porter Cable 557 in a few months. This tools is good for a novice that is not sure whether they will use biscuits or not. Pros should start with a better model.",2.0
"The multimaster is a great tool but the blades are a real disappointment.  Bought a set of these even higher priced blades with the expectation that they would last longer and went through two of them in a matter of hours.  The teeth are just weak and wear out or break off easily.  I was doing nothing more than cutting 2x4's and some 3/4"" pine subfloor and 1/3 of the teeth just broke off on one and the other dulled so quickly that it just started burning through the wood.  So much for spending more.  These blades need to drop in price by a lot or be re-engineered for reliability and longevity.",2.0
Agreed with all the folks who mention that the blades are very expensive. I would think that Fein or some other blade company could make a fortune if they made a better blade at half the price. Also agree that I never would have bought the Fein Multimaster had I realized that the blades were so expensive. I find myself looking to other cutting tools instead of using the Multimaster. At some point I will look at replacement tools where the blades are cheaper. Probably soon.,2.0
"The picture that is presented for this Delta Saw Blade Guard product is NOT what you will receive. The electronics you see on the armature are NOT included in the order. There is nothing ""Duluxe"" about this product and is NOT the great deal Delta advertises. Though the guard works fine I was not satisfied with the amount I paid for this. Buyer Beware.",2.0
"The build quality of this unit is very good, however the design leaves a bit to be desired.  There are a number of negatives and annoyances which leave me wishing I had bought one of the other brands.

There's no dust collection port.  That seems silly, and I kick myself for not having noticed that before buying it.  I thought something this expensive should have that basic feature.

You can't open the saw cabinet once this is installed.  Being that this is made by Delta, you'd think they would have noticed that problem and prevented it.

No provision for the switch cabling.  They give you a place to mount the switch in a convenient location, but no good way to route the wires.  I drilled the tube myself and ran them through.

The add-on ""kit"" to use this with a Biesemeyer fence is just a flat piece of metal, and it's too soft/thin so it flexes and fails to support everything properly.  The price is ludicrous for what you get.  You're much better off buying a piece of angle iron and drilling it yourself.

Overall, for the expensive price of this, I expected much more.  The Biesemeyer guard is much better designed and has dust collection.  It may not have the remote switch, but I'd rather have DC and be able to open my saw cabinet.  I'd take any of the others instead of this one.",2.0
"The overall package seemed very good. Nice to have a case to store it, but the only problem I had was it doesn't fit my Ridgid drill press quill. It might say it fits up to a certain size, but there are only three size adapters. Be careful to check your machines diameter and radius exactly. Had to send it back and was charged $14 for it.",2.0
"This item worked as advertised -- converting my benchtop drillpress into a mortiser in about 10 minutes.  Though it's tough to get square and set, once you do it doesn't move much.  The parts are all solidly made and the fit and finish is just fine.  Comes with a nice assortment of bits too.  I will say that the chisels ""cooked"" (turned blue) pretty quick, but that may have been my own mistake.

The only problem is that the whole thing is a bad idea.  There are lots of reviews out there that talk about the convenience of this type of unit, but there are a few GREAT discussions about what a dupe it is.  Notably, [...]covered this device with an accurate review.

This item is no substitute for a benchtop mortiser, but a good plunge router or a drill/chisel is!  A benchtop mortiser is supposed to save you time and give you better quality.  I'd argue that the time spent setting this thing up (and taking it back down), could be better spent either building a jig for router cut mortises or cutting them ""manually"" using a drill and chisel.  The quality of the cuts it makes is so-so, meaning you have to tune them by hand anyway.  So, on both the convenience and quality front it falls short.

When you consider the cost, it's a no brainer.  For what you'd spent on this tool, you're half way to a SUPER plunge router -- or a ""real"" benchtop mortiser -- and all the way to a good used or refurbished one.  The router's more versatile, so the money you spend gets you a lot more.  I'd definitely recommend a harbor freight mortiser over this unit.

So... it does what it's supposed to do -- pretty well in fact.  To me though, the whole idea is a bad one, and your money is better spent on another tool that will give you better quality mortises and a lot more capability.",2.0
"Almost since the moment this thing came out of the box, I wished I had spent the extra money to get the Porter Cable 557. As other reviewers have pointed out in their colorful fashion, the 2 main failure points of this tool in my opinion are: 1. The fence very poorly designed. While trying to buscuit boards for a table top, the fence (which I thought I had tightened to the point of near over tightening) gradually slipped across 7 buiscuits, each cutting at it's own special height. Very dissapointing! So I re-aligned it and tried again on scrap. This time really reefing the fence lock down. Slipped again. Thrird time I used some channel locks for leverage to tighten the fence. Worked fine with no slippage. #2 problem: The dust port (as mentioned in other reviews also) is awful. Cutting red oak, ash, and cherry with the bag *OFF* allowing material to free flow (since it was plugging up with the bag on) the unit would only get through 1-2 cuts without jamming up. The problem was a baffle in the middle of the dust port. While it is probably there for strength, it catches the shavings and proceeds to completely block the chute every time! I solved this one with a rotary tool and cut the baffle out and it works fine now.  The other more minor complaints like the noise and ergonomics are minor compared to these major problems. There is no easy solution I can see for the fence problem. Save your coins a little longer and buy the Porter Cable. Just don't buy the PC biscuits for either machine as they have over a 40% failure in the batch of 1000 I just bought!!",2.0
"The Freud JS-100A is my first biscuit joiner. I picked it because it looked well made and inexpensive. After two years, I now use biscuits for everything and am putting the Freud to heavy use. It is an increasingly annoying resident of my shop; as of today I am in the market for a better-designed joiner.

The Freud continues to work OK--I have become used to the motor noise, which sounds like a handful of ball bearings rattling around in a coffee can. The dust collection system is its worst failing--the chintzy plastic manifold doesn't make a good seal and dust blows out the joint into your face. And when you have to remove the manifold to get the tool into a corner, you find access to the screw is blocked by the biscuit size selection dial. Oh, and dust goes right through the bag too, again right in your face if you're bending over to see what you're doing.

The crude fence adjustment mechanism is a real pain. When you are trying to center the cut in a board, it's just a trial and error game. Some kind of screw adjustment would be most helpful (as in the Porter-Cable 557 I bought to replace the Freud).

In production use, the tool seems heavy and poorly balanced. The on/off switch is awkwardly located, at least for me--I have to turn it on and then position it for a cut (instead of lining it up and just switching it on briefly for a quick cut. Then I have to set the tool down and turn it off. You have to wonder what they were thinking when they built this thing.",2.0
"The biggest problem with this tool is the total inability to adjust the auxiliary fence parallel to the blade.  The fence adjustment mechanism seems poorly designed and engineered.  The amount of discrepancy is small, but when joining surfaces that can accomodate only one biscuit, the joined pieces will be totally misaligned.
It's too bad because in other respects, it seems like a fairly decent tool. (If not for the lousy fence I'd have given it at least 4 stars.) But I've decided to return it and spend a little more money for a tool with better precision.",2.0
"The Fein Multimaster is an indispensable tool. Not perfect but It is much better than any of the other brands. However, the blades are greatly overpriced. They vibrate a lot, burn the wood, can break, and dull easily. That would be OK if they were inexpensive so that you could replace them as often as needed. Can't wait until another manufacturer comes up with an inexpensive good blade. No one will buy Fein blades anymore.",2.0
"These blades are very expensive.  They should not be used in a situation where the sides will hit against something because the teeth on the sides will break off. For unobstructed trimming they work great. So the performance was disappointing as I used both the wide and narrow blade for only a couple hours and the blades lost a significant number of teeth. I returned them and got the standard blades and have had no problems. Cutting speed is a bit slower, but the over all performance is much better.  I used them on Dour Fir for mortises. If one were to use them for precision cutting where the sides did not contact other material they may work fine.  It appears to me that the teeth are too long for the hardness which the steel needs to be to maintain the cutting edge and are brittle and the force generated by the oscillations is great and therefore breaks them off rather quickly.  Where as the standard blade have the teeth size such that they can withstand the forces generated.  A little longer cut time is worth the time saved by the amazing operations that would normally take a lot longer. And the standard blades in a 3 pack are much more affordable however still over priced.  But they have no competition and until that changes or there are 3rd party suppliers of their blades...",2.0

"I've been using this attachment for a couple of years now. I recommend it only if you cannot afford a bench top mortiser.

First, attaching the fence to my 16 1/2"" Delta drill press is not easy at all. In fact, it's a real pain in the keester. You would think this would be easy because it is a Delta drill press but it isn't.

Second, the workpiece holddowns are cheap and difficult to work with. No matter what you do, the workpiece moves when you don't want it to move, or it stays put when you want it to move. It's not a good design.

Third, the chisels do not drill perfectly square holes. The auger bits are just a hair bigger than the chisels. So, you end up with a circle with square corners. This effect is more pronounced the bigger the chisel/bit.

I finally ditched the table accessories and built my own table jig (which works surprisingly well and looks cool too). This solved the first two issues. If it is really important to have perfectly square mortises, I cut them by hand. This solves the final issue. (Note: the mortises are OK for most joinery because you have a shoulder on the tenon to hide the slightly out of square mortise.)

UPDATE I was hanging out at Woodcraft last Saturday and this guy walks in...to return an auger bit.  The pointy tip on the bit was not on the same axis as the drill bit.  He rotated the bit and I looked at the pointy thing, and it was tracking a circle 3/32"" in diameter.  That explains why the drll won't drill a square hole.",2.0
"This blade cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter, but it is extremely fragile.  I actually shattered mine when changing blades, not in actual use.  The spring loaded mounting system snapped shut on the blade and it broke into several fragments.

"Just received this sander today & it's heading back.  When I took it out of the box, my initial reaction was that it had mistakenly had a 4"" platen installed instead of the proper 3"". It turns out that is the way it's ""supposed"" to be.
To me it seems like this is a cheap fix, since the motor extends out past the belt's normal tracking location.  The extra wide platen allows the user to adjust the belt over so that you can sand flush to corners. In the process, the belt is partially off of the drive rolls (25% is off the rolls). It seems like this would shorten belt life, when used in this mode. When the belt is tracked in its normal path, the extra platen is sticking out where it will bump into anything that comes near. (Note that the sander picture show the item from the drive side where this ""feature"" is not visible.)
The dust bag port is rectangular, so have fun hooking up a vacuum to this one.  The dust bag seems lighter weight than on other sanders I have. Obviously I haven't used it, so can't comment on power and other usability factors. I'll be getting another brand of sander.",2.0

"I purchased a Fen tool when they first came out and while the tool is a wonderful concept, and does cutting jobs that are difficult with other saws, the cost, life and durability of replacement blades is ridiculous.

I quickly ran out of the blades that came with the kit because they wore out extremely fast just cutting soft wood trim. I ordered two replacements blade from Amazon and although they were very expensive, they wore out just as fast as the blades that came with the Fein tool kit.

I then went to Harbor Freight and bought a fine tooth Japanese trim saw to finish the job I was doing on flooring base boards and and door jams so that I could install a new oak floor.

Until Fein brings down their prices on their blades, and improves the quality of the blades, that Fein tool of mine will remain a very expensive paperweight.",2.0
"I bought this a few days ago and am finally returning it after 2 days of frustration.  It's set up for a right tilt.  I don't even know of a saw manufacturer that still makes right tilt table saws.  Additionally, I was adjusting the dial and a spring fell out of the assembly.  So, my mechanical engineer husband disassembled it and put it back together.  The thing must have been returned as all of the screw heads were damaged.  I found out later WHY they were all damaged.

The instructions say to not touch ANY of the black screws.  They're all black.  It later said to remove the three screws on both ends of the blade.  Using a well fit phillips head and ALL of my body weight (granted, I'm 130 pounds but still) I tried to remove the three screws as directed.  All of them slipped, all of them were damaged during this process, as careful as I was.  I ended up getting 5/6 out and I realized that I'm not confident I'll be able to put these back on.  It had to be some kind of butter alloy, the metal was THAT soft.  They clearly were not made to be handled, but I challenge you to find someone with a right tilt table saw.  They need to be handled.

As I type this, I'm packing this thing up to be returned.  I really liked the idea of not having to use shims.  But ultimately, this thing is not modify-able and it needs to be.  Get it together, freud.  This is a $275 saw blade.  The least you could do is throw in some decent screws.",2.0

"I ordered this with the JWBS-14OS saw (see also) and the kit came with a 22mm upper guide bar extension which did not fit the 19mm holes in the upper frame and upper guide.  It took 5 weeks, 4 calls to WMH, and the receipt of three more 22mm guide bars before they could get me the right part.
On the plus side, no problems with frame/wheel alignment as reported by other reviewers.
On the minus side, the guide block does narrow the throat of the saw about an inch, and (at least the 3/4 hp 14OS) is underpowered for resawing so I am not convinced that the extra 6 inches cutting capacity is all that useful.  also,getting that big bolt tightened inside the frame is tough, you can't use an adjustable wrench.",2.0
"I recently bought this riser block.  I bought the band saw and riser block at the same time, but had to wait for the riser block to get off of backorder.  So I was pretty excited to finally get the riser block and assemble the band saw.

The kit is very easy to assemble, even with my 105lb wife holding the band saw upper arm while I bolted it together - yeah, she's a sport.

However, once I got it assembled, it was obviously mis-aligned.  The upper and lower guide bearings were off by over an inch - much to far to be usable.  So, I called JET technical service to help me - thinking they would just send me a new one.  The JET technician told me to ""knock the pins out with a hammer.""  Wha?  The pins are mounted in cast iron with no through holes.  He assures me it will work, so I try.  As you can imagine, all I ended up with was mushroomed pins.  So I call the technical service line again.  The second guy tells me that most of these riser blocks (90% according to him) have this problem, and the instructions were supposed to include how to remove these pins.  He tells me to pull he pins out with pliers.

Well, thank goodness Amazon customer service is better than JET's.  I returned the block to Amazon and a new one is on route.  I hope this one is better.

2 stars for a useful product and a nod to Amazon's great customer service.  However, this will be my last JET tool purchase.  From now on I'll buy my expensive tools from a company that doesn't expect me to take a hammer to their product before it can be used.",2.0
"outer cutters  gave an excellent dado, sharp edges and flat bottom. the chippers were of different diameters, all smaller than the cutters, giving a dado which looked like the steps of a temple.

They confirmed the poor quality cuts on their own saw, both with and across the hard wood grain. They sent me replacement set from their USA stock room. This set was better but not as good as they advertize. I examined the shims and they were variously stamped with metric or imperial widths. A final email from Freud admitted they sell internationally, and most of the world uses metric widths. This does not explain the variance in the cutter and chipper blade diameters.

They seem pretty durable though, I'm sure they're of high quality, but just didn't cut like I expected well on plywood.",2.0
"I purchased this set to replace a ""wobble"" dado set because I needed something which could cut flat bottom dados. The cuts are exceptionally crisp with almost no tear out. My experience with this set is in cutting ~3/4"" wide dados 3/8"" deep in pre-finished birch plywood. I cut about 24 linear feet of dados and rabbits before I noticed that the cuts were no longer coming out flat across the entire bottom. Upon further inspection, I noticed that nearly half of the teeth on the right blade were chipped or missing all together. All of the remaining blades and chippers exhibited no signs of chipping or wear. This is very disappointing and I cannot afford to spend $85 on a saw blade set that is so fragile. I suspect that the blade was either A) manufactured improperly or B) handled improperly (possibly dropped) at the factory which weakened the TiCO teeth and/or bonding to the blade. As a result I will be returning the set to Amazon and going back to my old ""wobble"" dado set for most of my dado needs and a router for making flat bottom dados when I require them.

I have noticed that other customer reviews of Freud/Diablo blades with large tooth spacing (like their ripping blades) have also mentioned tooth loss or chipping due to the brittle nature of the TiCO teeth. I have been extremely happy with my 80/96 tooth 10""/12"" Freud Diablo blades which have very narrow tooth spacing. Perhaps I will try one of the more expensive Freud dado sets (which have more teeth on the outer blades) at some point in the future but as a hobby woodworker, I cannot justify the expense at this time.",2.0
"I just returned my Freud FJ85.  Sad to do since it was truly a bargain and had a good motor and smooth gearbox.  But all of that isn't of much use if you can't get blades to lock properly.  I had trouble with the supplied Freud blade, but eventually was able to lock it in.  I also bought a variety of Bosch blades.  I could lock in some after great effort, but some simply never would fit in.  In the end, my fingers were completely cut up.  I also didn't care for the lack of dust blower. The Freud comes with a vacuum attachment, but that seemed too awkward for most uses I had planned for the saw. The sight line also left a lot to be desired. I ended up paying more for the Porter Cable jigsaw, but I'm so much happier with it and glad I made the decision quick enough to get a refund.",2.0
"I've used a lot of different jig saws over the years. From Black & Decker to Bosch. Have to say that the Freud FJ85 was one of the worst I've ever used.

Bosch and Morse blades both hard to get inserted all the way in the barrel. Cutting guide was so far off it was pathetic.
Last of all, during cuts the saw tracked somewhat sideways like a car with a bent frame! Really skimpy manual, too.

Only buy this plane if you have both time and lots of Wetordry sandpaper (60 grit through 220 grit) that you want to use up.

"I brought the new 1618EVS to the job and after routing D pine for all togeather maybe 3 hrs. (NOT continuous running time) I smoked the motor.  After a long conversation with the authorized tool service center I sent it in for a complete motor rebuild.  They assured me it would come back assembled to tighter specs. than what it was manufactured at.  I was skeptical that it would be returned to me in any decent workable condition yet two years later I'm still milling trim with it.  However I'm still waiting for that day, in the middle of some job, where it will start spewing smoke out of the motor housing again.

I do like the soft start and constant RPM features.

The D-handle is very comfortable, and I find it helps to keep me accurate.

I have to agree with the other reviewers that it's too difficult to remove the motor from the base.  I do the router dance - I clamp the router between my knees and twist the motor away from the base with all I got to seperate the two pieces.  Ugghh!! Wayyy too cavemanish.

There is a plunge base available for this motor yet I'm hesitant to buy it because the power cord coming out of the motor is only 5-6 inches long (it plugs into the top of the D-handle).  That means the power cord will connect to the extension cord right at the router base.  That can't be practical.

You can force the joint parallel in softwood, but not if you are joining hardwood.  The problem is compounded when you join two pieces of wood, each with a 1/32"" error.  You wind up with a 1/16"" offset you have to sand down. Very disappointing.",2.0

The referenced saw blade is very difficult to find.
I ordered it because my saw arbor is 13 mm and will not accept the more commonly found blades with a 10 mm arbor hole.  I have a 5/8"" to 13 mm adapter ring for my saw.  Much to my surprise when I received the blade (in record time, I might add) it had the more common 10 mm arbor hole which is useless if your saw has a 13 mm arbor as mine does.  Because of the low price and the urgency of my need I do not intend to go through the rigamarole of returning the blade.  I have managed to find the proper item elsewhere.  I have ordered many items from Amazon and will doubtless continue to do so but my confidence in an items description has been shaken.

"How far Stanley has fallen.  Once you could be proud to own a Stanley, but not anymore.  The package says Stanley, but it might as well have said ""Harbor Freight Tools"". My Stanley 220 block plane that I won in the Soap Box Derby in 1954 is head and shoulders above this one in quality.  I bought this one as a Christmas gift for my son-in-law, and based on some other reviews, I expected to have to do a little touch up. Out of the box, I'm sure that it would have made shavings, but I would have been ashamed to give it to him in that condition. The poor grinding finish on the base and sides was just unacceptable for my standards.  A straightedge from heel to toe showed about 1/32"" gap in the middle, and about 1/64"" from side to side. After 2 hours of sanding with various grits of emery paper on the table saw top, I had it down to some level of acceptance, but not perfect. Then the adjustment lever for the throat width was almost impossible to move.  I popped out the plate and filed down the rough edges to get it to move smoothly. At least now I won't be embarrassed give it to him. The blade, made in England, seems quite fine although that too did not have the smooth mirror finish expected in a well sharpened blade. Maybe the whole plane should have been made in England!  I guess if all you want to do is plane some 2x4s and throw it in a bucket when you get done, then it's OK as is. But if you want it as part of your permanent shop, then be prepared to ""do-it-yourself"".  The 2 star rating was only that good because of the blade and the price. I guess you get what you pay for, but no more Stanley's for me.",2.0
"BEWARE! I purchased a FT2000E a couple of months ago, and recently bought the FT2010 Edge Guide attachment. Although the finish appeared fair, the fence would not seat in the slot, it was riding on top of the slot. The fence is stamped steel, and does not contain the black attachment on the fence shown in the picture. I ground down the edges of the fence until it fit and slid easily in the guide slot. While it works well enough now, the defect does indicate poor quality control by Freud.

"The plane came in a box marked ""Made in Mexico"".

Milling marks too were very deep and in all the overall quality was extremely poor. I have seen far better quality China made block planes.",2.0

"I had a Stanley plane that I bought maybe 10 years ago and it truly was a fantastic little plane. It didn't need much tweaking to get it to perform nicely. Unfortunately I sold it when I had to move a year ago. This new Stanley block plane I just purchased is different... in a bad way. The plane must be totally outsourced in my estimation as the machining of the body looks like it was machined with a swirling cinder block. I should have returned it but being the die-hard that I am I figured I would ""fix"" it. Four sheets of 80 grit wet/dry and tired arms to get the sole and sides of the plane to even look good let alone flat is discouraging. But I will press on. One thing on a positive note, the iron seems to be of quality steel (the iron is manufactured in England). After working on it for a while I was able to get it razor sharp and I'm sure it will work as intended. Another plus is this plane is overall a bit larger and heavier than my earlier version Stanley plane, that's a good thing. If you intend to purchase this plane be prepared to put in some serious effort to make it perform like it should.",2.0

"A couple red flags with this product.  One, some folks have received a fence that does not fit their 14 inch Jet band saw.  That was not a problem for me, the fence I received fit the saw very well.  The second problem however may be more widespread and may not manifest until you've had the fence for a while (as noted in other reviews).  The problem is with the locking mechanism.  I noticed after installing the fence that it would not lock at all.  When you take a good look at the mechanism you see an oblong fitting that rotates, like a cam, to put pressure on the locking tab.  Problem is that in my fence the ""cam"" was not nearly large enough to exert much pressure at all.  Apparently, based on other reviews, there is a plastic tab that is glued to the cam or perhaps to the tab that provides the necessary pressure to compress the tab against the railing.  Unfortunately for me I did not install my fence until about 35 days after I received it and the return window had expired.  Amazon, as usual, was awesome and they have agree to provide a full refund and return shipping.  So I dodged a bullet and my advice is to avoid this fence altogether.  The Jet band saw, on the other hand, has been great so far but that is based on limited use.",2.0
"The fence fit too tightly on the track and extremely hard to slide, making micro ""nudges"" next to impossible. I returned the item. I will go for a magnetic fence instead.",2.0
"This product is really a problem for both the seller and the manufacturer.

I received this fence today only to find out that it does not fit my 14"" Jet bandsaw, which was a surprise because on the side of the box it claims boldly that ""This fence fits ALL Jet 14"" bandsaws.""

The problem is that the fence itself is about 1-1/4"" too long for the spacing between the rails. I measured my table and it is just shy of 14"" (13-3/4""). The fence, therefore, is built for a table that is 15"".

I fixed the problem using 1"" wooden shims on the back rail and a couple of longer 1/4"" 20 screws that were long enough to compensate for the extra depth created by the shims.

The locking system was also not working at all, but then I discovered a plastic shim in the box that had fallen off the locking tongue. I glued it on with CA glue and it's now working as it should.

In the end, after significant modifications, the fence is square, true, calibrated, functional and locks to the rail, so I'm not going to return it because it would likely be too much bother for too little gain.

But buyer beware - especially if you own a Jet bandsaw.",2.0
"To save $25 I bought a ""Like New"" fence for my Jet 14 inch Band Saw.  After I put it together, I found that the fence was over one inch too long, so that the rear hook would not engage the rear rail. Oh well I said, I will just put in a one inch shim and it will work.  Then I pushed down the lock handle to lock the fence in place and found it would not lock.  When I looked at the lock plate, I found that the pad it locked onto was missing!  That was just too much.  I'm sending it back and just sucking it up and getting a new one. This is very frustrating and the second time I've bought something ""like new"" from Amazon and it was broken.

"I'm giving this a 2 since the part is repairable, but there were problems with the order so I can't say that I like it. This isn't a problem with Jet, but with Amazon. The box arrived looking like it had been dropped off a truck so one end was collapsed some. It turns out that nothing was broken from the damaged box, but I have no idea where the box was damaged.
I assembled the unit using the poorly written instructions. I have come to expect poorly written instructions from Jet, but I was able to decipher them and get all the screws in the correct places.
The problem came when I got it all assembled and on the bandsaw table. The unit wouldn't clamp solid and would move. This is not what it was supposed to do so I started investigating. Well, it turns out that I may not have been the first person to have this unit. The internal lever that clamps to the rail was missing the rubber pad so it wouldn't clamp to the rail at all. Closer inspection showed a bend in the lever as well as the missing pad. I had no way to know if this bend was normal or not, but the pad was definitely not there.
What would cause this? My guess is that the unit that contains the lever was not the original part in the my box. Everything else was taped and sealed as if it was new. When I inspected the box, the bottom had been retaped which I didn't originally notice. Had someone had replaced the original mechanism in this box and retaped it, then shipped it back to Amazon? Who would have known?
What do I do? I can repair the part myself which is probably less hassle than shipping things back. It isn't an expensive part. I had already broken down all the packaging for recycling since I didn't realize the problem until everything was installed. My lesson learned is to purchase future equipment from local vendors or directly from the manufacturer rather than go through Amazon. After purchasing a number of tools from Amazon due to the price, I doubt I do so in the future.",2.0
Setting up the rails was easy then it came to assembling the fence. That was also easy. Getting it straight and true was another issue. Not my idea of a good fence. Having to tighten down then check then redo the assembly screws to get it straight is not what i consider quality. Very good saw though. Maybe Jet should stick to that.,2.0

"I've used nothing but Freud blades and bits for nearly 15 years without a complaint. I use these 12"" blades primarily for cross cutting hardwoods - Maple, Oak, Cherry, Mahogany, etc. After noticing the rating guide that claims this blade produces excellent cross cuts, I took a chance and strayed from my usual LU85R012 96 tooth blade and bought this to 'save' money. What a disappointment and complete waste of money. This blade is nothing close to the LU85. The chipping on maple and oak is unbelievably awful. After 5 or 6 cuts, I removed the blade and reinstalled the dull LU85. It performed 10 times better dull than this new blade did straight from the package. Needless to say, I drove to Industrial Plywood and paid $130 for a new LU85. I am extremely disappointed - mostly in myself - for thinking I was going to save money. You get what you pay for, and I should have known better - which is why I gave it two stars. If you are looking for fine finish cross cuts, this is not the blade for you. I strongly recommend paying the extra money for a LU85 or LU79. If you are cutting wall studs or cutting up pieces of scrap wood for fireplace kindling, then this is the blade for you.

"I ordered this blade based on the negative hook, tooth count, thin kerf, and that Freud has a good reputation and I've used their other products all without issue. This particular LU91 seemed to get through the factory without final QC.  First of all there was a residue in the shape of squares on the back of the blade positioned over each of the laser cut anti-vibration slots.  There was also a hard epoxy glue substance built up along the curved laser cut anti-vibration slots.  It was actually higher than the carbide teeth. It took close to 30 minutes to scrape this off with razor blades and fine sandpaper.

The only other issue I have is that this blade is not as sharp as others, and leaves visible circular marks that you can feel.  Perhaps this one never went through the final polishing or sharpening, who knows.  I've used and paid far more than this for a blade, but I'd expect better than this from Freud for a blade in this range.  Something is simply not quite right with this particular blade. My Bosch saw is set up as square as can be, and I tried two other blades that didn't exhibit this issue. I simply cannot use this for any woodworking.

I have contacted the company just to report this in the even that they want to look into it, I believe each blade has an etched batch/serial number.",2.0
"If the magnetic base on this light were twice as strong, it would be worth owning and deserve a high rating.  As it turns out, the magnetic base is far too weak for many of the applications that this light is intended for.  Here are some things I tried with this light:

1.  Standing upright on a cast iron table (such as a tablesaw) - This thing nearly jumped out of my hand to stick to my tablesaw.

2.  Attaching to the side of my drill press - Basically the magnet would not hold the light in this position.  Only if I flexed the neck so the lamp itself hung straight down would it even hold itself to the side of the drillpress - and then it was so wobbly that I was afraid to turn on the press for fear that the light would slide right off...

3.  Hanging straight down from a metal plate on the ceiling - This light will support itself in this manner so long as nothing bumps it, in which case the magnet gives up and the whole thing falls down.

First of all I think that the board buddy is a good idea. Safety is always an important issue with me. The board buddy is well made. In saying that I gave only 2 stars because the board buddy is a pain for people with metal fences. I have an expensive  biesemeyer fence on my saw . I'm  not about to drill holes and tap them in my fence to put in a track so I can use the board buddy.(fence has no pre-drilled holes ) I think that this should have been  something that Woodstock should have stated in their description or made an adapter . I had to go online and research this to fix my problem. I was very disappointed that I couldn't use the board buddy when I needed it.  I would not have bought the board buddy if I knew what I know now. I would have done  something else. Good wood fences are not  cheap unless you make one .

"I have been adding a few new things to my woodworking arsenal over the last year or so to make things better/safer/easier and decided it was time to replace the stock insert with a zero clearance insert.
I thought long and hard about cutting one out myself or buying this.
Ultimately I decided to go with this one, perhaps my expectations were to high, but for me it is just barely OK.
I know flat is relative and this one is probably in ""spec"" but the one I have has a slight upwards bow in the center.
When height adjusted to match the in/out feed the middle of this insert is above the table top of the saw.
It is not much but the edge of the insert definitely catches the work piece when I slide it across.
When I couldn't get it adjusted satisfactorily I put a straight edge on the insert lengthwise and held it up to the sky sure enough I see daylight at each end.
It is not the end of the world but I guess I was expecting something that I don't have to modify to make it right.
When I get over the annoyance I can sand it flat easily enough but instead of looking like it is supposed to it will look ugly.
I also expected it to actually fit the insert opening a lot better instead of using screws to stabilize it in the opening.
Or maybe I should be grateful there were screws there to take out the slop?
If it was flat maybe I wouldn't be annoyed at all with it being undersized and using screws to mKe it fit tight.
I won't spend money on another one.

5-21-2016 update.
I finally got around to flattening this insert.
What a pain in the rear.
I used a bench top belt sander and it took a while to get it right.
All of the top colored layer had to be removed for wood to glide smoothly across it.
I am still trying to decide if I am going to paint it or just wax it and live with the raw phenolic brown.
If anyone else decides to sand theirs flat make sure you used a respirator (not a dust mask), phenolic is not something you need to be breathing.",2.0

"I am very disappointed with Makita. They seemed to be one of the few last companies that MAY have cared what quality tool they made. I just got mine, and was hoping I didn't have the problems others did mentioned in the reviews. This one does though. It has the mold line on the rear drive wheel that causes the sander to cut a line in your work. I have not even plugged it in because of this. I called Makita USA, and they put me in contact with a repair center in Las Vegas NV. The person I talked to was VERY nice and polite and knowledgeable,  but his hands were tied. He said he would try and let Makita know, but that still does me no good. I am in the middle of a job and need this. Either I can send it back and put my job on hold HOPING I get one with no problem, or take my chances at cutting off the mold line... NOT an option I want to be faced with either way. Makita need to start doing better QC, especially since this appears to be a common problem with this sander. I just wish a company today would make a GOOD well inspected and tested tool...

"The cast aluminum base had a hump in the casting 90 degrees to the plunge travel.  Don't expect to get good results with a tool that references the base to a flat surface when the tool rocks back and forth on its base.  Yes the issue can be resolved with enough elbow grease.  Just apply spray contact adhesive to the back side of coarse grit sandpaper,and stick it to the flat surface of a cast iron jointer table.  Then rub it flat, and reattach the somewhat less than sturdy aluminum base plate.  I just don't like having to do makeshift finishing work on a poorly manufactured tool.  And no, I didn't send it back for an exchange (not purchased from Amazon).  It only took the better part of one day to flatten the base.

"I purchased this to replace a Porter Cable 555. First, the fence was out of square. Next, the cuts were approximately 0.020 out on one edge.

"I purchased a new Dewalt 682K.  The instructions were not great, especially for me (a relatively new woodworker).  However, the problem was the depth gauge for the plunge--none (0, 10, 20, M) worked.  With the exception of 0 (which was much deeper than it should have been), the other three were all the same depth. So, I took it back to the vendor (Western Tool).  They pulled out a floor model to compare.  Its depth guage didn't work either!  That was the end of my Dewalt biscuit joiner.",2.0
"The Dewalt looked good in the store but I've been a little disappointed.  The machine needs a soft start on the motor to keep it from jumping when you pull the trigger.  Once I learned to maintain an iron grip, I realized that the mark that is supposed to indicate the height of the cut from the fence (or sole plate) is much too far off to be useful at all.  Most of the time you don't need to use the mark - if you just maintain reference surfaces carefully, all will align ok - but sometimes one has to use the marks and on this machine the marks aren't accurate at all.  Having to make complicated setups and test cuts sort of overcomes the purpose of the machine - which is to increase speed.  Finally, on my machine, I notice that when using the sole plate as the reference, actually the aluminum casting extends below the sole plate, so that the sole plate doesn't sit flat on the reference table.  Yes, it can be fixed with a (substantial) bit of filing.... but having to go to this extreme on a new tool, which may not be the most expensive but even so certainly isn't cheap, doesn't seem reasonable to me.

I know that some claim that the biscuits aren't for alignment but that's nonsense.... since the initially-compressed biscuits expand to fill the slot, then by definition they WILL align the parts.  Or, misalign them if the slots are a little off.  Plate joining seems like a faster alternative to mortise and tenons when the full goodness isn't needed, but this Dewalt isn't a precision instrument.",2.0

"I have used portable jigsaws and sabersaws for most of my forty years as a general contractor.  Last year my Bosch barrel handled jig saw of some 15 years service was stolen, along with $1500 worth of other tools, from my truck toolbox.  I tried other jigsaws and also the Bosch D handle jigsaw but was very dissapointed with their performances.  I was reluctant to spend the extra money on another Bosch barrel handled jigsaw at first, but I am very happy to have popped the extra few dollars for the control the Bosch jigsaw gives me.  In addition, the tool-less blade change that was missing on my old Bosch jigsaw makes the purchase of the new one even more satisfying.

Kudos to Bosch on a great tool for anyone who is using a jigsaw for any task requiring the extra control the barrel handle gives the user.",2.0
"Where is the savings?  Pay a premium for an item made in China at a huge discount.  That sounds like a good deal (no jobs left and no savings - sign me up for that program).  I will return this ""discounted"" item asap; or better yet, use it as a hammer.

  My quest begins for tools made in this country - such as Milwaukee orbital sawzall: good price, excellent tool, would have paid much more.  I do not care if a tool(made here) costs three times as much as one made in China and I have to spend three weeks locating it!  Tell that to your economics professor.",2.0
"I used the bosch with the handle grip before this one and it always scared me. This one has just been so so. Feels like quality but I have had numerous problems. Basically you can only rely on this saw for one thing, making ragged cuts in soft wood. Dont get me wrong, sometimes thats exactly what you need. Some times it will cut straight too but you don't really know till you start because you cant tell if the blade is dull by looking at it unless its very dull.
I was cutting 1.5 inch oak and the blade would follow the grain not the direction I pointed it. Then after cutting this one peice of oak my blade was dull but I hadnt realized it(or even thought that would happen after one peice of wood) untill I started cutting some plywood. The blade goes wherever the dull side of the blade is. Then trying to cut fiberglass with the fiberglass blade the blade broke instantly on contact with the glass. Then I tried to cut a hole for a electrical socket in my wall and the blade hit something in the back of the wall and the whole mechanism shot out the top. Springs and plastic everywhere.  Now maybe I am too hard on the saw but really the saw is just only good for a few things. This is a fringe tool for people with expendable income.
Im not faulting bosch because the thing seems very solid, it just happens that it doesnt do many things. If I had my money back I would by a sawzall, a good vice and a table jigsaw and just borrow someone elses sabersaw if I had to.",2.0
"Upon receiving this tool I immediately checked the plunge depth and found it was not even close when set to 0,10 and 20. I found that the adjusting screw which is supposed to be for fine depth adjustment was not set to the correct depth. Upon further examination I found that the screw was stripped and would not allow me to reset it. I had to remove the screw and tap it and reinstall it and set it for the 3 different size bisciuts. Not at all what I expect from a tool at this cost. Where is the quality control????",2.0
"This unit is flimsy and not easy to set up.  It's not easy to set up because the design of this machine is done very cheaply.  If your using a course stone you will run out of water very quickly, which is not convenient.  Very messy to use too.  I did get the unit set up to sharpen some jointer blades and the results were ok.  I honestly don't know much about sharpening and that is why I was hoping this machine would be straight forward to set up,use and get very good results.  It's not.  A good quality sharpener for blades and tools must cost a lot more!  If possible, see one in action before you buy it.",2.0
"I bought this product recently to build some cabinets. Although I had read quite a bit about it, I was not completely pleased with the product as it came out of the box. When you use a plate joiner, it is very important for the cutter kerf to be parallel to the fence. Since boards that are joined on edge are cut opposite to each other, any misalignment causes a doubling of misalignment. The unit I received was way off, not only in the fence alignment, but also in the depth adjustment. Luckily I was able to adjust it by loosening two screws in the front and resetting it. The whole process took about 1 1/2 hours. In addition, the dust port not very well designed. It is small and has a protrusion (probably mandated by OSHA) that keeps the dust from being properly ejected. The plastic adapter to hook it up to a bag fits inside the port, thus blocking the opening further. Also, the ways the unit slides on are plastic, and have quite a bit of play in them.
A couple of positive notes:  The tool has a very nice set of spring loaded nubs in the front that keep it from wandering when you are cutting.  The cutter does a great job of cutting the biscuit slots, and the fence locates well on the work.  Unlike other joiners, the tool lays perfectly flat when cutting a face frame from the top (apparently a Black & Decker patent).
Frankly, DeWalt could do a bit better for practically no additional cost by paying a bit more attention to assembly detail and design.  Then it could receive a 5 star rating.",2.0
I have a DeWalt double bevel compound miter saw that I have had for close to 10 years and I love it. Well after all these years the very tough dust collection back which is almost like a light duty canvas has a couple of large holes in it which allows dust to come out when using. I found this and was excited at the cost and assumed because it didn't state otherwise that it was the same as original. Upon receiving the bag I noticed it is a light duty cotten back that I really can't see this lasting 2 years much less 10. I would have gladly paid more for the OEM bag with thicker material but I didn't know that this was made to be less in quality.,2.0

"I wish I had read the previous reviews before I bought this tool. I would have run the other way. First it is almost impossible to get the machine out of the styrofoam. It took two of us pulling for a couple of minutes. The fences are extremely hard to aline. The edges are extremely sharp on the top and scratch your wood. You have to push the wood thru the bit so hard because the top catches the wood and won't let it slide.  I have noticed the spindle actually moves backward when running wood through. I am a professional carpenter who was lookin for a light machine to use on the jobsite, so I guess I will have to just keep looking. This machine also needs a variable speed or at least a couple of more speed settings. does not produce a clean cut on smaller bits.",2.0
"If you want a router table and simply can't afford better then go for this thing.  It has one speed, difficult to adjust fences and stock gets stuck on the ribbed table.

The maybe, just maybe you'll be able to route something accurate.",2.0
"I was truly amazed to see this kind of low quality equippment at that  price from Delta. I've returned this item after completing the assembly  (did not even turn it on).  1. The table's ragged edges gave me a cut on my  fingers. 2. The two adjustable fences are hard to adjust and cutch on the  table surface when you try to move them - especially annoying when trying  to do fine adjustments.  3. The locking mechanism will lock the motor  assembly after having slightly readjusted your adjustments.
4. The miter  gage groove (miter gage not included) is not smooth and the gage catches  the small 'imperfections'. 5. The motor height adjustment screw is what put  me over the edge: when you turn the knob nothing happens for half-a-turn  (up or down) then the motor assembly 'jumps' about 1/8"". By the looks  of it the crank scew was bent.
Did not even bother contacting Delta -  there are too many quarks in this product. By the way, removing the unit  from styrofoam packaging is a project by itself. It's time to move on to  another vendor.",2.0
"Bought this for price and name.  Know what you're getting.  The two piece fence is difficult to true up.  The sharp edges on the table ribs catch any imperfection in the workpiece and make it hard to move smoothly.

"Opened the box, took the sander out, looked at the sander for 1 minute, put the sander back in the  box - and filled out a return request.

The 9403 clearly had been used before. Belt was dirty and the sander was full of dust. Also the packaging had clear signs of having been reassembled.

So this is not so much a comment on the tool as it is a comment on Amazon, and this is not the first time this has happened with Amazon. What gives? What kind of policy does Amazon have when it comes to dealing with returned merchandise? Somehow it can find its way back into the retail channel as new goods. Clearly that should not  be happening. Maybe Amazon should take a look at some of the ISO standards for quality control and go for certification in the relevant area - the prep for certification would be helpful.

Also, while I am at it, am I the only one who finds Amazon packaging to be a bit too light? Typically Amazon uses a 1 ply box, sometimes Kraft taped, but often thin gauge plastic taped. And generally some AIRplus made by STOROpack gets thrown in the box. But unless the AIRplus occupy the top, bottom and all four sides they do no good. The Makita 9403 is a heavy tool. The Makita box it comes in is not a shipping box. For shipment it should be packaged in a manner that protects the tool on all six sides. If Amazon does not like ""peanuts"" - and who does - there are other cost effective ways to package that are hassle free.

So 2 stars for getting a used tool and for packaging. Will reorder and hope the next one is new (unused).",2.0

I don't understand how this can happen but if I had to guess I'd put this on Makita rather than Amazon who doesn't sell used versions of this product.

Note on Amazon return.  I filled out an inquiry then had Amazon call me for help which they did immediately.

Surprising for me was the oustanding balance and plenty of power for the hardest of the tropical woods (Use carbide tiped blade...please) Also have a cord keeper for place the cable away in some chores.

"I purchased this Makita 9403 belt sander in order to sand down a redwood deck that had been painted with latex that was now peeling in many areas.

I soon noticed that the dust collection bag was not collecting very much dust. When I removed the cover on the sander for the dust passage I found the passage quarters very narrow and plugged with sanding debris. Connecting a powerful shop vacuum to the sander dust tube (bag removed) while sanding also proved to be futile as the vacuum was not powerful enough to unplug the debris in the passageway.

Soon after I started sanding I noticed deposits building up on both rollers. The deposits were under the sanding belt and mainly on the front metal roller. The deposits formed in tenacious clumps as high as 3/16"". I had to chisel them off the roller and use lacquer thinner to remove some of them. As the lumps gathered on the rollers the belt would move laterally against the frame and disintegrate. To avoid belt disintegration one had to
frequently stop the sander, remove the belt and chisel off the deposits. This got old very fast as it seemed I was devoting more time to sander maintenance than I was to sanding. I finally put the Makita aside and dug out of the garage a Craftsman ""commercial grade"" 4x24 belt sander I purchased at least 20 years ago. It may or may not have been made for Sears by Porter Cable. The Sears sander was a dream compared to the Makita. I did not experience deposit buildup on the rollers and did not have to replace belts frequently. I intend to put the Makita sander up for sale as I will not waste anymore time using it.

I first attempted to purchase the tool from an Amazon subcontractor who claimed to have one unit in stock. I called the subcontractor and asked them to make a warehouse check if a unit was actually in stock. I was told the warehouse man had the tool in his hands. It turned out to be a brazen lie and wasted a lot of my time. I found it amazing that Amazon left me to deal with the subcontractor. The subcontractor was their agent not mine.",2.0
"This was what came with my DeWalt miter saw, and I lost in a move to our house. It is too small and but unless you have a dust collection system this will do in a pinch.",2.0
"I'm cutting a timberframe and needed a saw to make accurate 3"" deep cuts.  I own the big Makita, but that 16"" blade tends to wander a bit with the grain.  Plus, the base on that saw is very flexible.  It's difficult to get dependable 90 degree cuts with it.  I was hoping the Dewalt would give better results.  Unfortunately, the Dewalt was a big disappointment.

The biggest problem was the obstructed sightlines.  The housing extends so far around the blade that it's practically impossible to see the front edge of the cut.  By the time you contort far enough to see the cut, you're practically standing on your head!  It's very difficult to control the saw with your balance so far off.  To make matters worse, I can see no reason for the over-sized bonnet.  It seems like the designer simply had no idea how to use a saw!

NOTE: I know a lot of folks use the notch in the base as a guide.  I've found that to work well if you want a straight cut that's somewhere near your line.  If I want to cut TO the line, I have to see the cut.

In an effort to get an accurate cut, I resorted to using an edge guide.  (I hate to do that.  With the dozens of cuts I make in an average day, the extra setup time is unwelcomed.)  But here again, DeWalt let me down.  The base is out of alignment with the blade by over 1/8"".  This seems like a common complaint with modern circ saws.  I know these companies are driven to keep prices down, but how much would it take to align the base????  My Porter-Cable is aligned to within a couple of mils (.002"")!!!

This saw does have great power and provides a good depth of cut.  The overall quality of construction (aside from the base misalignment!) is average to above average.  The functionality - if you want to make an accurate cut - is extremely poor.  Seems to me that, for $200, Dewalt could have done MUCH better.",2.0
"This saw is being presented as the replacement for the earlier Black & Decker 8-1/4"" Sawcat. If only that was true. I purchased not one but two of these saws and found both of them to have the same defects. There was severe blade wobble with both saws, that resulted in a 3/16"" and wider saw cut while using a thin kerf blade! Three brand new blades were tried to assure that the problem was not with the blade. It wasn't. The height adjustment is very rought due to crude castings and rough metal to metal slide. The supposed electric brake doesn't really perform like a brake at all but merely a slow down of sorts. This saw in no way compares with the Black & Decker Sawcat of the past, and anyone expecting that will most assuredly be greatly disappointed just as I was. I also feel that for the cost of this saw, a rip guide should be included, but it isn't. Neither is a carrying case. The smoothness of the armature & bearings seems very crude and it's doubtful that this saw would perform as flawlessly as the B&D Sawcat did over the many years I owned it. What a shame, and my search for a replacement saw will continue.",2.0
"Made Communist China

This tool is probably okay for the do-it-yourselfer. However, if you are earning a living with your tools stick with American or German or Japanese manufactured tools.

I found that the side grip requires the use of the extension bar. In simple low torque drilling applications the side handle cannot be used without the extension. this makes drilling in close quarters more difficult.

"I purchased these featherboards because I just wanted something ""simple"" for my router table.  What a mistake!
As you tighten the screws, the plastic bends and gets cut up.  After just a few uses, it's all worn out.  When you try to slide this featherboard inside the miter slot, it bends and twists.  They have a sloppy fit inside a standard miter slot, which actually makes them dangerous, because they can slide around during a cut.
The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because they are cheap.",2.0
"This is the first router I've actually owned (as opposed to used).  I bought it based on price and horsepower; I am undertaking some small projects involving 3/4"" hardwood plywood.
Frankly, the quality control leaves everything to be desired.
My FIRST router would not sit flat on its base- the top of the router (~ 12"" high) would tip 1/4 inch back and forth.  The plastic sub-base appeared to be creased, so I removed it and tested it on the metal base only - same 1/4"" tipping.  They just hadn't finished the base flat.  Also, the speed adjustment dial was bent and would drop off and into the case when you tried to turn it.  I took the plastic case apart to re-insert it in its slot, then it fell out again when I tried to adjust the speed.
I returned this router for another; Amazon shipped the replacement almost immediately and certainly before they received the old one.
The replacement had the same ""tipping"" problem, but now less than 1/8"" back and forth.  I haven't removed the plastic subbase yet to check whether this is due to the same problem.  The speed adjustment dial is OK on this one, but the ""Deluxe Edge Guide"" has all the paint peeling from it (I mean ALL the paint, in big chunks) and appears to be rusted (I didn't chip off the paint to check, but the metal is definitely discolored).
I haven't decided yet whether to return this router, also, or try to fix the tipping problem with some judicious filing.  The edge guide will have to be repainted or discarded.
Perhaps if you were to mount this router on a table these problems wouldn't seem that important, but for a handheld tool it just doesn't work for the cutting axis to have that much play.  If I decide to keep it I'll remount the router on a new base plate of something soft (plywood?) enough for the high spots on the base to indent the base, and let the router sit flat.
The reviewers that say ""the finest tool I've ever owned"" must have really lucked out, or haven't owned many tools.  For me, two out of two major functional errors, plus two minor/cosmetic errors in manufacturing/inspection is too high a failure rate.  Aside from this, the height adjustment is good, and the router seems sturdy aside from the problems mentioned above.  The manual is useless; it doesn't even mention speed control at all.

My main complaint with this guide is the absolutely flimsy sheetmetal that does the guiding.  I have obviously attached a longer piece of plywood to this - but it is just flimsy.

"I have an older house (built in 1927) and I swear the only time it was painted correctly was when it was built.  It is a 4,000 sq ft, 2 story + attic with a 27x17 second level addition on the back.  After reading the reviews I decided to rent one of these ($20 per day) and bought 8 discs (24 grit).  I also bought a gallon of paint stripper to soak the discs in.  My siding is lightly warped/cupped and sometimes I would have to hold the tool at a slight angle (it does get heavy).  Contrary to an earlier suggestion of using lower speeds, at least in my specific case, I found that use at the highest speed gave me the greatest amount of time between having to change discs (the clogged one went immediately into a pail of waiting paint stripper).  Paint chips and dust flew everywhere!!!  WEAR A CANISTER RESPIRATOR and GOGGLES!!!  The tool works great...BUT..if like me you are probably working on lead based paint this dust will(!) get every where.  Due to the fact that the dust will fly and I have a neighbor relatively close to my house I am looking into another tool called the Paint Shaver which has a vacuum attachment and according to some reviews contains a lot of the debris...  If you don't have such concerns, using ~8-10 discs, soaking clogged ones in paint stripper, using a wire brush to clean them off and then an rinse in water is a process which should work quite well.  So...working with the tool at the 'right' angle and a clean disc does a great job...and like an earlier review says you won't be using this while standing on a ladder (I will probably end up renting scaffolding...not too sure about using ladder jacks for a platform) but beware of the dust and debris",3.0
"I purchased this product with a new router hoping that it would provide a simpler, more portable and less expensive solution than a table mount for working around edges. I've been disappointed in two ways. First, the mounting is not nearly as positive as I would hope. Even with the screws firmly affixed, there is still a small amount of play between the guide and the router. This does not inspire confidence, and creates accuracy problems when using the guide fully extended. There's really no excuse for this, it's just poor QA. While you might expect some play from generic stuff, a brand-new Porter-Cable brand attachment ought to fit a brand-new Porter-Cable router snugly. Aside from the attachment interface, the quality of this attachment is very good, and the design thoughtful. Functionally, it has some limitations, which is my second qualm. I've found that the relatively small contact surface makes it difficult to keep this running flat again smaller stock, especially anything rougher. The contact surface thoughtfully includes holes for screwing in a board or a plastic block in order to make this surface larger, but this still won't help you with thiner pieces of work. If you are trying to rout both edges it is a real challenge to keep this small guide surface from riding up and ruining your work. Now, this really shouldn't shock anyone, I am describing a scenario where a table-mounted router is obviously the right tool for the job. But if you are hoping that this can give you router table functionality in an inexpensive package that you can easily carry with you, be aware that this is not the case.

Overall this tool is great for certain applications, especially any work you need to do in place, where a router table is not an option. It's a good design overall, and rate as a 4-star tool by me if not for the play in the attachment interface.  I'd suggest potential buyers think about what they intend to use this attachment for. Personally I wish I'd saved my money for a bench-top table mount, but I can imagine others who would find this tool invaluable, especially if you do most of your routing on a jobsite instead of in a workshop.",3.0
"I have the PC 892 router. The Edge Guide I received doesn't mention the 892. There is a new ""42690"" (Why PC uses the same model number is beyond me).  The new version packaging does list the 892,893 routers and has a circle cutting attachment.  (see Porter Cable website)  The packaging is completely different in that it lists the other routers and the circle guide.  Beware of what you get, I WANT THE NEWEST IF I'M SPENDING THE MONEY FOR IT;  NOT THE ""CLEAN-UP BOY"", GETTING RID OF OLD STOCK.  Just time wasted, I sent it back and have to order from someone else.",3.0
The small face frame biscuits are a great item but in their intended purpose they are hard to work with. The inch and a half stock is better joined together with the old fashioned dowel method. You have to change blades on the joiner to use the smaller blade for this small biscuit and the time it takes isn't worth the trouble to do when you get a better result with the dowel.,3.0

"I'm going to take the contrarian view on this edge guide. I'm pretty much a gadget freak, and this guides combination of sturdy construction, lockability, and fine adjustment won me over enough to buy one for my 690. On use, I found it is a mixed blessing.

I have a pretty solid router table setup, so by primary use for this kind of widget is on wood pieces that simply can't be worked that way, i.e., edging tabletops. What I found is that the guide takes my 690, which serves as my simple lightweight hand tool, and makes it a bit awkward and weighty. Admittedly it is more accurate once set up, but so is my older, far less flashy edge guide once I get it set up. Think of it as one step forward, two steps back.

And the real truth is that relying on a heavy aluminum straight edge guide or using bits with standoff bearings really does everything I need. A lot of your reaction to this guide will be determined by how you work. For me, nearsighted and chubby, it forces me to far back from the edge to feel comfortable. Someone who is comfortable working a router from the side might think this is the cat's pajamas.

Which brings up my final point. Don't assume that, just because a tool is cool or feature heavy that it will work for you. Take the time to think about how you work and if it will fit in. Too often something I thought was going to be utterly wonderful wound up living on the top shelf.",3.0
"This is a fine router of its type. The variable speed and soft start features make it work beautifully. The plunge lock is conveniently located and easy to use. Unless you are routing dados on a well supported surface, it's weight and power pretty much requires table mounting. It is too hard to control doing edges. The table mounting is where the shortcomings are noticed. The weight will cause a normal MDF router table to sag fairly quickly if it's left in place, so make sure you mount it on a removeable plate; and remove it when not in use. I mounted a Router Raizer on mine to allow height adjustment from above, but in either case it won't plunge enough to allow me to change bits from the top of the table without modification to the (hardened) wrenches. I think a better choice would be the fixed-based version (PC 7518) used with a JoinTech Master Lift Pro or JessEm Mast-R-Lift(not the Rout-R-Lift).",3.0

"This is second 330 Speed Bloc sander I've owned. In the interval between the first purchase and the second, PC has changed the flexible power cord to a stiff kinky cord that doesn't ever lay flat, catches on the edge of the work bench as the sander is moved over the work and is a trip hazard when sander cord is resting on the floor. It has become such a frustration that I will find and replace the cord. I hate what PC has done to this otherwise great tool.",3.0

"I shopped for along time before settling on this unit, partly due to the fact that it was made in the good ol' USA- but it no longer is! I know there are good workers everywhere, but P-C used to be among the best, building things in Jackson , TN. I have a model 690 which has served me well for 16 years, going through literally miles of wood, but needed something a bit more beefy for dovetails and larger profile bits. I assumed that they were still built in the USA, despite seeing the lower end models had been produced from Mexico. I ordered this online, due to a good price, but had i known it was NOT made here, i might have re-thought my purchase.

Fit and finish appear to be okay, but not up to the ""old"" units. It remains to be seen if the durability has been compromised by the transfer to Mexico. The castings do appear to be a little rougher, and overall, it is not quite as nice in appearance as the US units, but, that may be ephemeral- the proof will be in the usage!

"I have been having problems with my year old 7518.  The speed fluctuates and/or stalls, both loaded and unloaded. After seeing the price for the speed control module # 875087 (~$100) I decided to try to replace the bearings first (~$30). The bearings have been ordered through Amazon. The upper bearing (# 330003-75) comes off pretty simply.  But to remove the  lower bearing (#146555-01), how does the chuck (part 83) come off the shaft to allow removal of the lower bearing and getting the shaft assembly out of the lower metal housing?

Read another review that talked about speed fluctuations from sawdust buildup in the speed module. I'll try cleaning it out before I put it back together. Regular internal clearing may be needed as part of routine maintenance as the top/motor cover comes off easily. Also note that the brushes can be readily checked/replaced at that time.

verygooddog's ""5"" star review reply comment says:
""I haven't had to replace bearings on a 7518, but there is a very good description of how to do it at reproductionwoodworks.blogspot. If you search for 'how to replace bearings in a porter cable 7518' it will pop right up.""
 Thanks

Update: To take the chuck off I used a counter-clockwise ""Lefty to Loose"", looking at the shaft from the chuck/collet end. I used an impact wench with a 1 1/8"" socket while a friend held the stator end with a leather glove on. It came right off.

"Fact is I need this thing. It fits my PC circular saw great. It's very light weight and long enough to not get in the way when ripping sheet goods. I have it connected to my shop vac and it does a good job collecting the stuff that would otherwise be flying through the air. But step back for a minute. It's just a plastic hose. The same stuff you can by a HD for 50 cents a foot. Ah, but the stuff at HD is not the right diameter. Gotcha. Man I wish some of this dust collection stuff would be more standard. PC is a 1"" end, my miter saw is 2"", my vacuum accessories are 1 1/4, my band saw is 2 1/2. You get the picture. I've got a drawer full of adapters. This fits the bill but they know you can't go out and buy it elsewhere. Shame.",3.0
"I like how flexible the hose is but it only works for veryfine light loads like  dust from a palm sander. If you connect it to your router etc. for freehand work it will  1. loses most of it vacumm due to the small hose.  2. it'll plug up due to the small hose.
Buy the adapters for your tools but convert them to a slightly bigger flexible hose e.g. 1 1/2"" size flex.  Also this hose is not designed to be cut shorter ( 5 feet) to improve it efficency.  The fittings on the end are part of the hose.",3.0

Oh, and the set screw used to square the sole to the blade when the saw is set to max. depth of cut ... I tried to adjust it and the thing fell out in my hand.  By the looks of it, PC didn't bother to thread the hole.  They just forced this screw in a few turns, which means you can't back the screw out because it becomes immediately loose.  Shoddy.

"This is an exelent Router until you get into the 3 1/2"" raised panel bits. I bought this router because of its power and Porter Cable Reputation. It stalls out out on hoging cuts forcing me to turn the router off then back on to continue the cut. It happend to me 20 times while cutting 19 raised panels. It is supposed to preform well even under the most demanding routing cuts according to the MFG. Porter Cable has replaced it but the replacement does the same thing. To make it work I take around 8 passes or go so slow I burn the wood black which is workable with a baby step cut as the last pass. Cutting the rails & styles of the doors in 1 pass it works well but so did my 80.00 dollar Craftsman 1 3/4 HP that was made in China.

"I've had a previous version of this belt sander which I purchased in the 1960s under the Rockwell name. It ran well for some fifty plus years until it fell from my workbench and cracked the housing.  This newer model is essentially the same re weight and balance.  It's somewhat easier to change belts and the variable speed  feature is a nice addition.  However, the older model had a removable impeller cover - essential should the dust exhaust port become clogged.  With the impeller cover removed, there was easy access to the exhaust port for cleaning.  The newer model necessitates the use of an air compressor to remove the clogged material.",3.0

The PSA  (pressure sensitive adhesive) 'sticky' discs(Model 334) are much, much,  much cheaper to buy and the cost of the PSA on the 334 will pay for itself  in 1 year of serious sanding.

Control is excellent and material removal is certainly adequate. However, the dust  cannister constantly falls off resulting in the user resorting to duct-tape  or some other measure.

"I have owned the side and outfeed supports for over 5 years. While they are a great addition to expanding the work surface, they fall short of the performance of an actual outfeed table.
The problem with adding an outfeed table to a Dewalt DW744 is that the rear bar that accommodates the gear fence mechanism must be free to move when adjusting the fence which eliminates it as a fastening point for an outfeed table.
One solution is to attach a wood block to the Dewalt rear outfeed support. You can then fasten your shop built outfeed table to the block without any interference with the gear fence mechanism.

I wonder how Porter cable could let such a flaw go out the door  when it would be so easy to fix.

"I've owned and used the Porter Cable 9543 for over two years now.  It's built with typical Porter Cable attention to detail; fit and finish are nice; ergonomics are excellent.  The adjustment screw for tilting the baseplate is an especially nice touch--you pull it out and rotate it 90 degrees. It gives you that extra leverage but in a package that, when finished adjusting, springs back into a tube that parallels the motor housing.  Nice touch.  The motor is suitably strong, speed control is good.  Overall, nice features, good quality.
I have two gripes about the saw, however.  The blower doesn't do a thing, from what I can see.  Put the switch on or off, and as previous reviewers have noted, it's a sawdust storm.  Since most of my work is outdoors, this isn't that big a deal, but if I was to use the saw indoors for finish work, I'd look seriously at the Bosch jigsaw which most finish carpenters seem to flock to.  Another gripe is the blade change mechanism.  Make no mistake, once you figure it out, it makes sense, but if you get this saw, take it home and for gosh sakes try changing the blades a few times.  Big tip to save you frustration:  The blade change mechanism is a simple spring loaded butterfly you press with two fingers to allow a blade to be removed or inserted.  Squeeze it together and it allows you to insert or remove the blade.  However:  it will only work when the shaft is at the BOTTOM of its travel.  If the shaft is in the upstroke position, the blade guard will block access to the butterfly.  So, step one is to remember:  When you need to change blades, eyeball the shaft and make sure it's at the BOTTOM of its stroke, before you unplug for the blade change.  Step Two:  Porter Cable has wisely installed a vertical slot the blade rides in to center the stroke.  When you remove the blade, make sure you pull the blade backwards (towards the slot).  Do these two steps and the blade is actually very easy to remove.  Don't do them and you'll cuss this jigsaw.
It's a good saw, but one reviewer stated they use it in lieu of their circular saw sometimes for general cutting work.  I work primarily in pressure treated wood and call tell you, without hesitation, that doesn't work.  It's only a 6 amp saw and PT flat out requires some force to get the saw through the wood, even with new blades.  A circular saw just eats it up when it comes to general sawing.  Save the jigsaw for the curve cuts, only when you need it.
A good overall saw, best suited for outdoor work and one that does require some time investment in understanding it's unique blade change system.",3.0
"I read all the reviews I could find and despite several reviews that spoke poorly of the dust problem, I bought it anyway. Mistake..... I returned it in two days. The tool-less blade change and bevel are great features and work well, but the dust blowing in my face with or without chip blower on was too much for a tool in that price range. Other brands (like Makita) have a clear chip deflector on the front. Another feature that is odd- the lower blade support does not pivot with the base when you do a bevel. you have to rotate it by hand. It will also wear the sides of the blade if not lined up. I looked real hard at the Bosch but don't want that either... I'll try the Makita 4304t and see how that goes.",3.0
"I love Dewalt tools but I feel there is one minor design flaw with this saw. I have to be very careful that when I grab the handle with my right hand to make a cut that I place my right thumb under the handle and not to the side.

"This router could be the poster child for everything wrong with the current state of tool manufacturing in the U.S. This is a brilliantly designed router given that it was designed 30 years ago. Unfortunately no effort whatsoever has been made to upgrade the design in subsequent years. Most notable is the lack of a self releasing collect. Router bits repeatedly get stuck in the collect requiring a sharp tap to release them. By addressing this and other minor problems this machine could be a competitive product for another 30 years but there is literally no meaningful creative design effort going on in virtually any american tool manufacturer at the moment. Most companies are simply shells for asian manufacturers who crank out decades old designs at basement prices. This particular router is not even sold at a basement price.

"I have been doing carpentry for over 22years, self-employed for over 16 years and currently have a business partner (4-1/2 years). Our projects range in price from $3000.00 cabinet units to $500,000.00 additions and renovations. We are very hands-on contractors due to the fact that most of the younger generation  today want a lot of money and benefits with little skill! Anyway, my business partner uses a DewaltDW708-scms and I have a 12 year old MakitaLS1011. Did I mention he is on his 2nd DewaltDW708-scms in the last 4 years! His saw has plenty of power and cuts fairly accurately as long as you treat it with kid gloves. The first saw broke when it got knocked over onto the floor and the yoke on the back cracked. Off it went to the repair shop, 3 weeks later we were told Dewalt couldn't fix it but they would replace it at a cost of $369.00. Here we are 9 months later and here we go again, the yoke is cracked, only this time full price $599.00 (forget-it). My business partner swore by this saw when he got it and thought it was so much better than my Makita. Sure falling off a table isn't good for any saw but my Makita has fallen over before and still cuts great and accurate. So what we did was list the pro's and con's of the Dewalt and this is what we came up with:

  Pros - plenty of power

  - mitre guage detents work well

  Cons - Very heavy (wear a back belt)

  - Dust bag doesn't work (took nine months of daily

  cutting to fill it)

  - Bevel stops on original saw were good but replacement

  saw they were terrible

  - Bevel guage on back of saw hard to reach and see for

  setting proper angle

  - blade guard tough to see through ( with the Makita

  you can lift the guard with your thumb to check

  where you are cutting, drop the guard back down

  and make your cut)

  - And of course the dreaded yoke!

I do not like this. Ive had the belt lossen and slip on me and even break. If you are looking for a good quality, reliable miter saw, go with the DeWALT 12"" Single Bevel Compound Miter saw. Its powerful, tought, and it has a worm drive meaning no belts. But over all the slide sawis not too bad of a saw but just not for finishing work.",3.0
"I've used this light for years because it came with the kit.
Ok, one day I really needed it and I set it down and the thing fell over and the bulb broke.  I went and put another one in.  Of course, since I'm a klutz, I broke the second one and had to finish working in the attic with a bic lighter.
One day I turned it on and the light was so bright it was so cool, then it burnt out quicky.  What happened?  I had put a 14 volt bulb in the thing.  Hey, it worked cool for a few minutes.
Anyway, seriously, the flexible part needs design work, the light does not stand on its own well and often falls over.  The tool itself is indespensable, but if it had a longer neck that was more rigid and a base that was more stable it would work better.",3.0
"I should say something about DeWalt that not a lot of people know. DeWalt and Black&Decker are one company. So what is behind that black and yellow casing could be Black&Decker!! ( Please don't misunderstand me, I am not saying it is; it could be-what is inside of a Lexus is a Toyota-Don't be fooled by advertising and what other people think ) Many pro. tool users will probably agree with me that DeWalt is not an industrial brand; it is premium household!
Anyway, about this light, I am very happy with the amount of light it produces and the length of the time with one charge. (I have the 14.4v)  But, there is a problem. The reason why I bought this light is the problem, the flexibility. There is really no flexibility. This light will NOT be flexible as you would think it will. It will loose the balance and will fall. I used it for about a month, got tired of it and got the regular version of this light. That will do anything this ""flexible"" light does and saves me about 400-500% time on tiring to change the light angle.",3.0
"...DeWalt, however, has a ways to go. After reading reviews that mostly rated the saw very high, I expected too much evidently. The saw is reasonably smooth running as it sits there, but during the cut, it does vibrate considerably.
Also, the holddown is terrible and possibly dangerous. It vibrated lose while I was cutting, causing the workpiece to jam the blade. It's hard to adjust and the allen screw (yes a separate tool is required) is aimed at an angle exactly toward the air nozzel requiring that I must must move and re-adjust the air nozzel each time I adjust the holddown.
 The accessory light is really poorly designed. The flexible arm is not stiff enough to hold the weight of the light. It will fall from horizontal onto the saw's table if you try to use it on the left side were its mounted. The way I solved this was to bend the flexible arm over the top of the saw and shine the light on the right side of the table. This solved the weak arm problem, but then I discovered that the light's flexible arm is not really flexible enough to stay put. It has an aggrevating memory. Vibration causes the light's arm to slowing move back toward straight. This results in the shadow from the holddown moving onto the blade and workpiece. I have to reposition the light several times during each cut. By the way, the light cannot really be used on the left side of the saw because the air nozzle and the holddown both cause shadows right were you do not want them.
The saw itself is probably better anything else at or below the price. The metal stand is also very strudy. I just expected better attention to design for [$$$].",3.0

"This is now my go-to utility flashlight. As you can see I have three DW's. More versatile and less aggravating than the others. Hey it can actually point down at your work table, which the other ones rather lamely can't manage. The middle one with the simple twist head that comes with all the kits - you just can't ever seem to get it to point in the right direction (unless you are working on the ceiling.) I also have the DW fluorescent light, which is very good for camping or lighting up a room in a power outage and gets hours out of a battery. But it's glaring and doesn't make a great focus task light. I guess what I don't like about this gooseneck model is that it's quite heavy and gangly and awkward. Like you can hang it around your neck but it's darn heavy and uncomfortable. I suppose it's partly the fault of using a big heavy 18V power tool battery. You can get it to do the job, but it's kind of an odd duck isn't it?
  Probably a good LED headlamp these days would be a better choice much of the time. I should really go shop for one of those as mine broke a while back. After I finish this review.
  Also, that reminds me, HELLO it's 2015 and the LED bulb has been perfected. An LED on this light with a beefy 18V battery - could probably burn for 15 hrs or more, what a super emergency light that would be. DW needs to wake up and smell the coffee and just stop selling flashlights with old tech bulbs already. And no I don't mean that forty dollar kit to convert your light to LED, oy.",3.0
"Works as advertised, the only downside is that I hate to let my kids use it as the cost of the batteries make for a VERY expensive flashlight.",3.0
"While the table was packed correctly, the welds on the bottom of the support assembly snapped off almost immediately upon assembly. These weldments are small threaded plates that hold the leveling feet. I called Delta, they said I need to return the broken part to a repair center for a warranty claim. That repair center is an hour away and of course is not open on the weekends. It seems to me, that they should just send me a new support assembly and I can send the broken one back. So be it. I am done with Delta. I should not have to invest half a day to claim a warranty for a broken item.",3.0
"Product works as advertised but  the run-down test on a new Lithium battery was a bit disappointing.  With frequent power outages, I want a light that will last a long time.  I turned around and purchased the LED bulb kit and resolved this as an issue.

The provided bulb's brightness was mildly disappointing.  The LED is brighter but does not throw as wide a beam.
But if you add the cost of the floodlight ($35) + LED kit ($25) , it's a bit pricey.",3.0
Good light for when you have to turn off the electricity to work on a circuit.  Not bright enough. Wish it was made with white led's instead of a flashlight bulb.,3.0
The saw arrived at my house and the packaging looked okay but after opening the box I found that bevel lock knob was broken in three pieces and that the metal base was scratched.  The saw itself works okay though so aside of the damage and broken knob I couldn't be happier.,3.0
"Nice product, but there are a few problems.

 First of all, if you own a newer Unisaw, the instructions tell you to cut 3/4 inch from the table before beginning the assembly. DO NOT DO THIS! If you do, you will have a 1/2 inch gap between the back of the saw table and the front of your outfeed table. It is completely unnecessary to live with such a gap. At most, you will need to remove 1/4 inch, and less if you want a flush fit and are willing to cut a rabbit on the underside of the board. I was stupid enough to trust Delta's idiotic instructions without measuring first, and now I have to replace this part. (It's probably easier to get some 1/2 inch laminate locally and make your own rather than order one from Delta's parts service--I've been waiting for some drill press parts for 8 months now!)

 Second, all of the cut ends of the particle board are exposed and not treated. I would definitely coat them with something, like polyurethane or shallac, to prevent swelling from moisture accumulation, especially if you live in a humid area.

 Third, on newer Unisaws, the dust collection port gets in the way of the table leg when it is folded down. Nothing serious, but it's a little annoying at times.

 Otherwise, it's a good design.",3.0
"I must agree with the above reviewer in that this item costs too much. Still, I don't know where I could get the same sort of thing elsewhere. It is a ""must have"" item if you also want to use the DW7051 Length  Stop, as it attaches to this unit. The price is probably about right if  DW7051 and DW7050 were sold together as one kit. I won't go so far as to  tell you not to buy this, because it's useful. Just be aware that if your  do, your paying a premium to DeWalt!
One thing to note. The nuts are  metric. I have metric sockets, but not wrenches. To tighten the nuts into  place, you need to put a wrench on the rods themselves, which again, are  cut metric. I made due with a ""normal"" (my point of view) wrench,  but it didn't grip the part firmly.",3.0

"I ordered this table to go with a Unisaw left tilt, Besemeyer fence, and Excalibur sliding table.  All parts arrived in good shape, and the manual is the usual Delta fare, which is to say a very good manual.
It went together OK, except for a few glitches, mostly due to my particular setup:
1) I had to remove 7 inches from the fixed and folding tables to accomodate my sliding table. It was easy enough to cut, but I sort of hated the waste.
2) The initial attachment to the table saw requires patience and a flexible body, both of which have escaped me. You have to reach inside the saw body to hold a metal plate that you then screw into place from the outside.  I recommend that you have a helper on hand for this step.
3) As mentioned in other reviews, the folding portion of the table interferes with a dust collection hose. Since I don't plan to fold down the table, this wasn't a problem for me.
Unless you need the folding feature, you may be better off with building a table to the exact dimensions you need.  But if space is a problem, this table will do the job well.",3.0

"Has good light output. These days you'd think they would go with an LED or offer an LED kit to go easy on the battery.

"After reading the sterling reviews on the Milwaukee 7/14"" Circular saw with Tilt-Loc I was just about ready to order one. I thought I'd better take a closer look befor I bit down, however.
I went to a local store to  pick up the saw and take a look at its features. What I found shocked me  when I compared it with the reviews I'd read.
First, the Tilt-Loc handle  takes a tremendous effort to adjust. Not what I need in the middle of a  busy day.
Second, the bevel gauge is readily visible, but the release is  right on the left-hand handle and interferes with gripping the  handle.
Third, the shroud continues so far down over the blade on the  right that it almost makes you step to the side to see the cut.
Last, the  saw feels like it weighs more than the saws from the competitors. It is  bulky and uncomfortable to handle.
This is a shame, because I own several  Milwaukee tools and know them to be excellent quality. Their claim to be  heavy-duty is a given. All I can say is to be sure what you are buying  before you throw away your old saw.",3.0
"This is a very handy flashlight; please don't think of it as a FLOODLIGHT, as it is listed on AMAZON.

"I have the Bosch handheld routers and Porter cable workhouse router under the bench, so I bought this for flush trim routing and door hinge work. For flush trim, this is a great router. However for routing door hinges and latches, it does have room for improvement. As others have mentioned the dept adjustment is sloppy. But not only is it sloppy when you lock it down, it slips so whatever depth you wanted changes. It takes a bit of fine tuning to get that depth locked in.

If I could do it over again, I think I might have gotten the Bosch colt. If you are looking for flush trim, this is a great router. If you do a lot of depth changes then maybe the Bosch would be better.",3.0

"I got this stand for a DW788 scroll saw.

First, let me say I know the instructions call for bolting this to the floor.  I think that's a bit unreasonable for most people.  On the other hand, I now know why DeWalt recommends that.  Because it's not very stable.

A better design would be to have 4 legs instead of the ""tri-pod"" arrangement DeWalt came up with.  The materials are good, it went together easily, it looks nice, it has a nice finish to it.  But it's just not quite up to snuff in terms of stability.

It works...it just doesn't work very well.  And it's one of those things that, at least for me, constantly reminds me that it's just a mediocre product and I'm not really happy with it.

Having said that, I did use some adjustable feet that were included in a very high-end, pretty blue router table package deal I recently purchased.  They went on nicely and the rubber bottoms keep the stand from moving around on the shop floor.  Being adjustable (the screw up/down type) they make it easy to level everything out on uneven surfaces.  I'd recommend stopping by your local home improvement store for something similar.

All in all, if I were still looking, I'd find something else besides this stand.  I can't recommend it.",3.0
Did the job Works good for my needs.,3.0

the weight and balance is nice as well.
but the collet always seemed to come loose messing with the depth of my bit and ruining a window frame or two.
in doing so i had to remove all of the trim.
replace all of the damaged peices from the router.
then re assemble it and fill the nail holes from the first time.
Id recommend the bosch palm router its quite nice and has a work light on one of the models.",3.0
"I don't care for this tool much. They claim its light. Maybe compared to a full size router, but its a little heavy and awkward. Also, having a clear base would be a lot better. Removing the base is an adventure. Turn the knob off, then the spring goes flying across the shop. When turning this tool on, better hold on. No soft start here.

Pros: Its powerful, quality is ok, and the base does hold its position. If you insert and set a bit and use this tool for that single purpose, then I think you'd be better off.

All in all, not horrible, but not great either.",3.0
"Bevel scale  was damaged some how in transit. Rest of the saw had no visible damage and seems to be functioning with out any audible noise. Can't do a full check out as I can't mount the table. Box showed no exterior damage.

Will update review after I have a fully operational tool.",3.0
"I gave the scroll saw an O.K. rating, but I have to qualify this. I received the saw new from Amazon, and had no trouble with the assembly. However, the blade wobbled, or vibrated, or moved from front to back as the saw was running, about 1/8"". This made it hard to cut and turn. I have returned the saw to the Baltimore office thru my local hardware store who handles DEWALT products for repair. I only had the saw a few days. I have read great reviews about the saw which is the reason I bought it, and still hope it will work out O.K. I am sorry the saws are made in Taiwan now. Their quality control is bad, although I hope the design will be good.
I received my scroll saw back from the Baltimore office, and they reported that the saw was normal. It still does not track true in my estimation, but here is what I did. I was cutting wood 3/4"" thick (regular pine) for wooden animals, so I ordered ""Thick Wood Hook Tooth"",  Style FR407 from Olson Saw Co., and they work much better. I still have to be careful and go slow, but maybe that is the nature of the beast. I truly hope so.",3.0
"But 35 bucks? Again, it's mostly plastic with a couple of rods and stop nuts.
If I had seen it in person first, maybe I'd just stick to my traditional fence methods.

The micro adjustment doesn't budge when the tightening bolt is locked down.",3.0
"I would not recommend this saw.  Mine is 3 months old and I just had to order parts to repair it already.  The upper blade chuck is cheap aluminum and the thumb screw is hard steel so the screw pulled the threads out of the blade chuck.  I registered the saw with DeWalt Feb 11 2015 ab=nd also made an account on Dewalts site three times.

I feel this detracts greatly from the usefulness of the unit. Also, the ""self-tapping"" screws that secure the extension to the saw base are very poor. One screw went in with a GREAT deal of effort, the other I could not get in far enough to clamp down on the rod it is supposed to retain. Anybody have a Torx driver with a breaker bar on it? It otherwise is a well constructed unit. Go for it if you have a 708 saw and a T-30 driver w/mechanical advantage.",3.0

"This stand is just OK... by reading the negatives it seems that the main complaint is that it doesn't fit other saws properly... don't know about that but it fits the Dewalt saw just fine. It is however not very stable. It comes with no feet, just bare flat metal with holes to bolt to the floor. If you want to bolt this baby down it's a good stand. My garage floor is cement and besides I didn't want to bolt it down, If anything I wanted it t be mobile, where I could put it in against the wall or in a corner and roll it out when I needed it. So, I put on rollers... BIG MISTAKE!. The tripod on rollers is completely unstable and it tried to topple several times just rolling it on a flat surface. I wish it was a four legged stand for stability and possibly a storage area on the stand. Anyway, as I stated it's just an OK stand that I have to man handle into position when I go to use it.",3.0
"Works great, easy to use, just drains the battery rather quickly.",3.0
"This saw has a good, solid feel to it but I had problems with it from the start.  I noticed significant difficulty in getting it to saw true to a straight line.  I initially attributed this to poor technique on my part.  Eventually, I built a jig to make it saw 4 x 8 boards straight but was surprised at the effort required to do so.  I was also surprised at how wide the kerf was when using the jig.  After examining the saw closely, I realized that the blade was canted outwards relative to the side of the shoe (about 2 mm from the back of the blade to the front).  There is no way of adjusting this parameter and therefore no real way of tuning the saw.

I realize that this is likely just my particular unit but it was clearly a deal breaker for me.  I have to say, Amazon was very helpful and they offered me a full cash return without even charging for return shipping.  This, despite being a week or so outside the 30 day window of their official return policy.  They understood that I'd been having problems with the saw from the start but didn't identify the problem until later.

I gave this saw 3 stars rather than 1 simply because my experience is probably the exception.  It's obvious from the reviews that many users are very satisfied with it and I don't wish to be a major outlier.

My next purchase will undoubtedly be for a saw with an adjustable cant.",3.0

"You MUST bolt this stand to the floor both per instructions and physical reality. Way too top-heavy to be stable otherwise.  It can be knocked over with a single finger if not bolted down, and for the same reason it's not safe to add casters/wheels unless you cobble together a wide-footprint platform for them.",3.0
"This saw has plenty of power.  The quick release height and bevel adjustments are great.  The bevel scale is accurate, so once you calibrate it you can set bevels with confidence (insofar as the design of the shoe allows anyway).  The tilt lock is helpful when sawing a vertical surface.

The shoe on mine wasn't parallel to the blade and there's no adjustment.  I had to take the saw apart, file some material from the housing where it meets the front mount, and shim to get it in line.  This is an important adjustment since when the blade is out of line the saw tends to either wander away from a cutting guide, or push toward it burning the wood.  Also, the rear attachment to the shoe isn't very robust.  I don't think it will break, but if you push hard on the saw it will flex enough to affect the bevel angle.  The good news is that with a sharp blade and the power of this saw you don't feel like you have to push hard.

Now that the shoe is adjusted I'm satisfied with this saw, but if I was shopping again I'd look very carefully at the competition.",3.0
"First off, I am DeWalt guy, but I think any DIY or professional can build a better one for about $15.  If you have purchased any of the DeWalt miter saws, then you can build a customized one 100 times better for half the cost, or even cheaper.",3.0
"I bought this to put on my new DW716XPS.  I just ordered another one because I thought they came as a pair.  So, if you want extensions on both sides, order 2.

I had an older DW705 which took the similar DW7050 extensions (which came in a pair).  The nice thing about that setup which is non-existent on this model is that the extensions would slide in and store underneath the saw base.  Also, from what I've seen from other user's reviews with other models that this fits is that they DON'T slide in and store under the saw base.

The bottom line here is that DeWalt screwed up by not making the saw and the extensions where they would slide under and store in the base.  But, if you want extensions, this is your only choice unless you have an older single bevel saw. They are functional and work well with the DW716 (which DeWalt lists for compatibility but not Amazon) and are sturdy and well made.  Three stars for sturdiness.  I'm deducting two stars because they don't stow under the base.",3.0
"I am a die hard Dewalt fan. I own about 15 different Dewalt tools, but I was rattled by this one. Light, stand, and saw all had issues. The stand was very sturdy, however ALL of the nuts and bolts were rusted. The lights wire nuts inside the housing were OFF and rattling around inside the METAL HOUSING that you are touching in order to turn it on and off. I realized this before plugging it in and fixed the problem. The light is also to heavy and the neck will NOT hold it in place so it keeps sagging down till it finally touches the table.  Finally the saw... The first one as far as I know is still lost in shipping. The second came in damaged. Although the box looked to be in good shape and the plastic covering it was solid, inside the box was another story. There were scratches all over the powder coated base and the knob for the table was SHATTERED. A black magic marker fixed one and a call to Dewalt fixed the other.

"Recently, while in the middle of a hardwood flooring project, I purchased this model sander at a local supplier.  After considerable use, here's my assessment.
Positive observations:
- It's build like a tank and will probably run forever.
- It's well-balanced and offers smooth sanding capabilities
Negative observations:
- The metal baseplate or ""shoe"" that came with the unit started warping after 1-2 hours of hard use, due to excessive heat.  Fortunately, I had taken the advice of another reviewer and purchased the graphite impregnated shoe and was able to replace the original shoe without losing time on the job.
- At 12.0 amps, it's still significanly underpowered.  It almost stalls with a 50 grit belt and heavy pressure.
- It's dust collection capabilities are mediocre, at best.  Even when connected to a large shop vac, it clogs continuously during heavy sanding.  Repeated clearing with an air hose is necessary.
- The machining on the housing is poor, especially in the area around the dust collection opening near the back of the belt.  The mating surfaces don't align, which adds to the dust collection problems since the dust collects in the misaligned joint.  I was able to improve this some with a small file but access is limited unless you remove the rear roller.
- The label on this machine says ""Whisper Seriers"".  I don't know what Porter Cable's definition of ""whisper"" is, but it's obviously much different than mine.  Ear plugs are absolutely essential for the operator and anyone else within ""whisper"" distance.

"I've done a fair bit of sanding with this product and overall, the sanding is good: good removal of wood with minimal swirl marks (just don't short cut through the grits).  The flaws are two: the wire support for the dust bag wore through the bag so now while sanding it spews a steam of dust through the hole.  Second is the power switch.  Every once in a while the thing won't turn on.  I've found that if you take the sander apart you can pull the power switch out and then take that apart.  Blow the dust out and put it all back together and it works again.  Call me crazy, but a sander with a switch that fails because of wood dust seems to be a bit of a design flaw..",3.0
"DeWalt made this stand to hold their DW788 scroll saw. The saw works great but I have not had it all that long. The stand is ok, but could have been made better. I hate ""open"" style stands for stationary tools, this stand is going to need a sheet of plywood and a couple of drawer assemblies to hold extra blades, and other small tools. The problem with this stand at almost 70 bucks it is bare bones, your getting stamped steel painted black with no directions included. I just think with a little thought DeWalt could of made this stand with an enclosure not wasting all that space under the saw. Its just ok.",3.0
"Bought this saw from from a brick and mortar store. So here is my first impression.  Got it to replace a dewalt dw396. Took it home and unpacked it. Started looking it over and was >SHOCKED<. Not by electricity but where it was made...CHINA! The one on the store display said made in mexico. I can live with that, but china? I guess since milwaukee is owned by a company in hong kong now, production will head that way to increase profits.
The fit and finish seem ok as does the large case, but it's what you can't see is what bothers me.
I will add to the review as I get some time on the saw To see how it holds up.
UPDATE
I returned this saw.
After using it I decided it just wasn't for me.
It cut wood like it was air. Sometimes you couldn't even tell you were cutting anything, excellent! But that's were it ended for me. The saw feels and sounds like a home owners tool. That is to say maybe alittle fragile? The base plate is nothing to write home about although it is nice and big...but It's just ok otherwise. Mine was alittle warped also. I believe a short drop and you will be looking for another saw.
The motor area had a strange rattle sound when at full rpm's but still cut very good. Also there is not a pocket for the brush's on the outside of the housing, So changing these will require some work.
The mounting brackets for the shoe to the body were very cheap looking. Like something from a $50.00 saw. Although they did work well.
All in all It's a good saw. The design and power are way ahead of most others, BUT to me it didn't feel like a comercial saw but would be excellent for the homeowner.",3.0
"Ive had my dewalt 788 for 5 months and have about 200 hundred hours on it. I just sent it in to be repaired for a
loud knocking coming from the back. The table on the saw has a hole in it for the blade to pass through, the only thing is the blade comes with in an 1/8 of an inch from rubbing the metal. nomatter what I do you cant eliminate the clearance problem.
  also it was hard to aline the blade, I never did get it perfect. the saw does run quiet normally and I was pleased with the way it cuts. I think that dewalt made a mistake having china make there saws. I was just looking at the delta 40 694, it is also a double parrellell arm and comes with a stand and light for about 200 dollars less. I wish I would Have Bought the delta.",3.0
"I am a die hard Dewalt fan. I own about 15 different Dewalt tools, but I was rattled by this one. Light, stand, and saw all had issues. The stand was very sturdy, however ALL of the nuts and bolts were rusted. The lights wire nuts inside the housing were OFF and rattling around inside the METAL HOUSING that you are touching in order to turn it on and off. I realized this before plugging it in and fixed the problem. The light is also to heavy and the neck will NOT hold it in place so it keeps sagging down till it finally touches the table.  Finally the saw... The first one as far as I know is still lost in shipping. The second came in damaged. Although the box looked to be in good shape and the plastic covering it was solid, inside the box was another story. There were scratches all over the powder coated base and the knob for the table was SHATTERED. A black magic marker fixed one and a call to Dewalt fixed the other. I guess this is why I've always bought my Dewalt products from a store and not online. For the prices we pay for these Dewalt products there should NOT be rust, wiring issues, and damage.",3.0
"The saw is very nice, EXCEPT... I discovered that the blade tilts forward noticeably, so every cut is not straight up and down, front to back. DeWalt says, in their Q&A, that it is normal for it to tilt forward slightly when it is turned on, but that shouldn't be the case. How can you make 90 degree cuts if the blade isn't 90 degrees in all directions?  Thus the 3 stars.",3.0
"This seems like a very solid stand for the Dewalt Scroll Saw; however, it would have been nice to have instructions
included in the box to show how to put it together.  The end of the box was open when I received it, so I don't know
whether or not some written instruction fell out.  Yes, I got it together by looking at the picture on the box, but
it probably took me twice as long because of lack of instructions.  Other than that fact, I like the way it holds
the saw; seems quite sturdy.  I might have given it four or five stars but for the lack of written instruction.",3.0

"the Dewalt DW788 scroll saw is not too bad, but my problem is a knocking problem I took to Dewalt center to have it worked on all most a year ago and was charged $225.00. Now the knocking has come back this time ever at low speed it knocks. I really don't want spend another $225.00. The wood I is maple, or 1/4 inch wood.",3.0
"I have to dissent from the glowing reviews. The aluminum base plate has not stayed flat for me, and I'm a fairly careful user, cabinet and trim work, and the ""potato chipping"" of the base tends to cause some blade twisting depending on where your weight is on the handle, leading to tearout and less than perfect 90 degree cuts. The handle on the blade depth adjustment tends to tighten as you raise the saw, requiring some fiddling to adjust the depth. I gave it 3 stars because as the others said it's powerful enough and certainly an adequate product, but not stellar.",3.0
"I went through two before switching to Makita. It is susceptible to power surges, and the variable speed mechanism will burn out easily.  You also have to replace $20 gasket about every 6-12 months for proper operation. It  now comes with one extra gasket.",3.0
"I have used these for a few years. They are sturdy and do not deflect all that much even with abusive projects like fencing.

The big negatives are:

1. Hard to adjust due to choice of screws on the base that hold them in place. For some reason, these screws are not knobs or thumb screws. Instead, they are big screws that require a tool  to turn. Why? This is the sort of thing that begs for a knob or at least a thumbscrew.
2. This works in conjunction with a length stop attachment. Because thee is clumsiness in setting up this units' support extension, there are issues that are caused on the length stop, too. It all works OK, but it is slower, stickier and more frustrating than it could have been.

In any case, if you need/want something like this for the DW, this is your choice and at least it won't break.",3.0
"As always the quality is great, but you only receive one arm in the package.  Just want to make you aware.",3.0
"The quality of the components is good. The steel is sturdy and will stand up to lots of use.  However, the purpose of the extention is to extend the work surface of the DW708 turntable.  When pushed all the way in so it is snug against the saw base, it is about 1/4"" too low.  When pulling it out, the rods are a sloppy fit and they sag, so the difference between level and the top of the support is even greater; around 1/2"".  Unless I'm dealing with warped boards (rare) I'm going to have to shore-up the extention with a wedge or two to make up the difference.
I mainly purchased it to use the DW7051 Length Stop, which seems to work okay.  Luckily I have the DW723 Miter Saw Stand, which comes with it's own extentions, so I don't need to rely on the DW7080.  If I had it to do over again, I would purchase some large steel rods or long bolts to substitute for the DW7080 since I don't need the extention function (which doesn't work so hot anyway).
DeWalt needs to make a quality extention specifically for the DW708 (which is a KILLER saw!), instead of having a generic one that is supposed to fit.  The DW708 is a very well engineered tool, and the DW7080 does not do it justice as a companion accessory.",3.0
"I should say something about DeWalt that not a lot of people know. DeWalt and Black&Decker are one company. So what is behind that black and yellow casing could be Black&Decker!! ( Please don't misunderstand me, I am not saying it is; it could be-what is inside of a Lexus is a Toyota-Don't be fooled by advertising and what other people think ) Many pro. tool users will probably agree with me that DeWalt is not an industrial brand; it is premium household!
Anyway, about this light, I am very happy with the amount of light it produces and the length of the time with one charge. But, there is a problem. The reason why I bought this light is the problem, the flexibility. There is really no flexibility. This light will NOT be flexible as you would think it will. It will loose the balance and will fall. I used it for about a month, got tired of it and got the regular version of this light. That will do anything this ""flexible"" light does and saves me about 400-500% time on tiring to change the light angle.",3.0

"I got the scroll saw and stand for my birthday.  At the bottom of the stand are 1/2"" holes that I thought were created for stem casters.  I installed 3 casters without any problem and move it to my garage.  The caster were due to not having one of those large, fancy workshop.  The stand started acting unsteady after moving it around a few times.  I realized that the 2 legs were OK, but the single leg had a problem: the adjustable piece was not tack welded as the other 2 leg were and was bending.  Not having a welding unit, I had to place 2 pieces of wood at the bottom (bolting them in with longer bolts) to act like a brace.  It seems that Dewalt would have tack welded this as was done on the other 2 legs.  Although, it did notice it was made in China...which some of their produces have problems.",3.0
"The Dewalt scrollsaw stand that I ordered direct from Grizzly arrived with no hardware to assemble it. The box was still taped up so it didn't appear to have been lost in shipping. I contacted Grizzly by email the same day it arrived. They got back to me in a couple of days and said to contact Dewalt service at the toll free number. They even gave me the part numbers I needed. So far so good.
I called Dewalt. They said they didn't have all the bolts, nuts and washers in stock (hard to believe) and gave me the number to contact a local Canadian Dewalt service centre. I called them and they said that since I bought it from the USA that they would have to charge me (an exorbitant price) for the missing hardware.
I contacted Grizzly again and told them this and suggested that they send me the hardware.  They never replied to my emails again.
I went out to a hardware store and bought carriage bolts, nuts and washers to assemble the stand.
The stand is very nice but I cannot recommend buying from Grizzly, at least for Canadian customers.
 Unhappy in Canada",3.0
"While this DeWalt guide does work and you can get basic jobs done, the design has some flaws, and mine has a quality issue.

When I first tested it on some scrap, it seemed great.  But only after using it on some real cuts did I see the flaws.

First, while I appreciate the vacuum adapter, it got in the way, preventing me from making my full dados.  Fortunately, the plastic adapter can be removed, and in the case of my dado, it wouldn't help anyway.

The second issue is with the single point of attachment to the black metal ""base"".  If you look at the photo, you'll see the thumbscrew in the center of the gray metal piece.  That is the only thing that is maintaining the position of the fence relative to the router.  While it has a fine adjustment knob, the threads on my knob didn't mesh with the threads in the gray metal bracket, so I could barely turn it, and I could see the threads getting flattened out.

Using the fine adjustment knob became very frustrating, so I ended up using trial and error to get close.

I would agree with the other reviewers that this is not a precision accessory.  If you do not need exact placement, it will probably work fine.  But if you need to have even 1/16"" of precision and have to change the position several times during your project, I suspect you will be as frustrated and disappointed as me.

If I need a router edge guide again, I will try the Bosch model recommended by another reviewer.  I don't think I'll bother to use this one again, unless it is for a project that doesn't require any precision.",3.0
"Not as much travel as i'd like in the adjuster. It's fairly loosey goosey when it's not tightened down, which makes precision adjustments difficult, but do-able with a little finagling. For the price, it seems like they could have made it much nicer for very little extra money or effort. The dust collector comes off easily. Overall, it's needed for a lot of work i do and does it well enough.",3.0
"I bought this saw based on all the reviews and reputation. When I tried to square the baseplate to the blade I checked the plate for flatness and found it to be warped. It had at least a 1/8"" dip in the middle of the plate, right where you place a square to check for 90 to the blade! I checked a display model at a local dealer and it had a dip also, though not as bad.
  I looked for other saws with strong, flat bases and chose the Porter Cable. The adjusting handles are small and hard to use but at least I can expect square cuts!",3.0
"I picked this up on an Amazon lightning deal for $340.00 including tax and shipping. Had it not been for that I don't think I would have paid the $500.00 or so that they are asking retail. This saw operates smoothly enough and the blades are easy to change and tension, all the controls being right there on the top arm. I haven't had any issues with the speed control so far as some have had. The table top, as many have complained, is somewhat roughly milled, making it more difficult to rotate pieces while your scroll cutting. Fortunately, I have an 18"" wide belt sander which I ran the top through with 120 and 220 grit to make it smooth. That along with some paste wax and she's perfect. The table top is not parallel to the surface of my work bench. It's about 5/8"" or so inch higher on one side, after adjusting the top square to the blade, which others have complained causes the blade to hit the inside of the throat opening. Mine wasn't far enough off to cause that , although it's far enough off level to make the tilt gauge pointer ineffective, which I don't really see as a problem since I'll probably never be tilting the table and if I do I would never rely on the accuracy of it anyway with out checking the angles with a tilt gauge and making test cuts. For the kind of money that they want retail for one of these, one shouldn't have to deal with any of the quality issues that are present. So far, for me this has been a good value since I don't use a scroll saw much and I didn't want to spend the the hundreds and hundreds more for an Excaliber, Hegner, Rbi hawk, etc. , but didn't want a $75.00 to $175.00 Taiwanese one either. This is a good middle of the road saw if you can get it cheap like I did.",3.0
"Overall, this is an ""ok"" stand - it does the job of holding your scroll saw down and in place.

Why just an ""ok"" on the comment?  It certainly leaves a lot to be desired, and a few minor modifications could make this a great stand, as follows:

* This is fairly lightweight metal, and you feel as if a good ""bump"" from something could make it move.  I don't really want the scroll saw to move unless I am trying to work with another tool in my smaller shop.  A heavier duty grade or thickness of metal may or may not be a psychological thing.
* Speaking of moving the scroll saw, for those of us with a limited amount of space, and moving tools around as you go from project to project or the various stages projects go from inception to completion, it would be nice if you could put casters on the bottom of the thing without having to drill your own holes into the metal.  That's not a contradiction to my first bullet point above as I would put on locking casters to keep it stationary.
* The stand is put together with  inch bolts, and assembly in the upper rear part of the stand is about as tight as it gets - be prepared to pull out your wrenches as a normal-size socket set interferes with other portions of the assembly.  While not hard to do, it is a pain in the neck only being able to turn to tighten a little bit at a time over and over and over.",3.0
"It isn't LED and it runs a battery down quicker than you would think.  It's really old school tech and I don't recommend one.  But as far as it goes for old tech, it puts out a good incandescent light, which FYI has better color rendering than LED",3.0
Just ordered and received this saw a couple of days ago. I've been using it quite a bit and it seems like a pretty good saw but the second day of use I cut the saw's power cord while setting the saw down. This saw has no brake and takes a while to stop. If I had it to do over again I'd look for one with a brake.,3.0

"The DW788 to me is a 3 to 4 star machine. However, my review here focuses on re-packing the saw into it's original carton. I'm moving my shop across country and spent 4 fruitless frustrating hours trying to re-pack this machine as it came originally.  General rule: photograph every unpacking so that if you ever have to re-pack you will have a visual guide.  Of all of the woodworking tools I re-packed in their original boxes the DW788 was by far, by very far, the most difficult.  It proved ultimately impossible so I did the best I could.  The special complication here is protecting the arm from side pressure.  Other than the table, re-packing this thing makes Rubic's Cube look simple.  A call to the company proved equally fruitless.  The DW customer service agent could hardly wait to get me off the phone.",3.0
"Saw similar products at the hardware store and thought this would be a great addition since I'm always using mini-lights, etc. and have the older DeWalt 14.4 power tools.  Light output is very good and although I didn't test battery life with the light, I can't imagine that being an issue as I'm always amazed at how long the battery lasts with regular power tools.  The big downfall, however, is the ability to ""pose"" the light on whatever subject you're working on.  Rotating the head on the bevel just doesn't deliver enough flexibility and it makes no sense to try and aim the light more precisely by wedging books, etc. underneath the battery.  I almost never use the Dewalt light anymore.  A rechargeable work light like the ""LOFTEK Outdoor PowerBank Ultra-compact Portable Led Work Lamp Flood light, for car travelling camping fishing,"" is a far better choice in my opinion, after having purchased one of these too.  These are also available on Amazon.  I use it all the time and am very happy with it, but would make 1 or 2 design changes for convenience if I could (I listed that review under that product).",3.0
"This edge guide is what you would expect for the price. Its construction is solid, but lacks refinement. The adjustments are fine and allow for precision cuts, so it fulfills its basic task well. Its negative points are that the dust-collection port does not work all that well (the DNP616 adapter is much more effective because it surrounds the bit and effectively creates a seal around it. The rods that attach the guide to the router base are ver short and don't allow the use to make cuts very far in from the edge of a board, though their ends are threaded, so extensions may be available. Finally, when one loosens the center knob before using the dial to make fine adjustments, the edge guide sags a little, which introduces a slight amount of inaccuracy.

Overall, this is a helpful too and it was not very expensive, so I recommend it.",3.0
My rating is related with the use and accuracy I will experiment.  I am a wood working begginner and will enjoy this job,3.0
"This particular belt/disc sander is worth what you pay for it.  It's a nice addition to a small home workshop.  It sands small items decent and is helpful if you build projects by the dozen like I do.  Unless you have the  tool attached to a piece of 3/4"" plywood and have it secured to a  workbench, it has a tendency to wander and vibrate a bit.  The removable  tilt table is a very nice option.  Overall, it is a quality Delta tool and  just like anything else, you get what you pay for.  For the price and  quality, I would recommend it, but try one first; you may want to spend a  little more and upgrade.",3.0
This sander is light duty. But not too bad of a tool. One of the best uses for it is to use it instead of a grinder. The slower speed really make it well suited to grinding and shaping edges. And for polishing work. Use the  blue zirconia belts and you will be able to grind like crazy. I found the  disc is only good for steel that is soft as it is too fast for wood or  hardened steel.  I have ground almost 100 plane irons and other tools on  mine and it is stilll going. I use it atlest a hour a day. For the price it  is a good little tool.,3.0

"I bought this saw specifically because the end user can adjust it in ways other circular saws are not necessarily adjustable. Unfortunately, I used the saw for a project and noticed something was wrong. The blade was not square to the base and if one were to make it square, other problems were created. Ironically, it was a problem I could not fix and Dewalt wanted me to send it to a service center. They gave me the option of returning it for my money back or to have it repaired. Seeing as I never used it, I wanted the money. Overall, I was disappointed but I have other owned other Dewalt tools without issue and since Dewalt does have a grace period to use tools and possibly return, it was a just a learning experience. What did I learn? Always test tool purchases right away.",3.0

"Design of the light does not allow it to shine light downward, only upward.  Great if you are working on stuff above the light, not very valuable if you are working on stuff below the light.  Hence only three stars.  Light is bright and does not drain the battery terribly.  When DeWalt designs a light for casting light down, I'll buy that one.  This one is very limited in what it can do.  The only way to light downward is to lay it on its side and that does not work well either.",3.0
"I waited over a year to write this review to make sure I gave the saw a good try. It worked great for about 11 months, so I thought I was one of the lucky ones, and then it started making a horrible banging noise. I took it to the shop, waited 3 weeks to get it back (3 weeks during my BUSIEST SEASON), and less than a month after I got it back, it died on me completely. I took it back to the shop, waited another 3 weeks to get it mailed back to me (since the shop is 40 miles away), and it was physically broken when I got it back. I sent it back to them, and they got the factory to send me a new saw. Horray! It worked like a dream for about a week, and then it started making an awful knocking noise and vibration. I had just about had it by now, so I just kept running it for the next month since it still actually cut, and finally today it quit on me.

$500 is A LOT of money to me. I've had a Ryobi scroll saw that I got for $30 at a yard sale, almost 4 years ago now, that I have never had a single problem with. It's really too small and the blade changes were too annoying, and that's why I shelled out all the money for a dewalt. Now I wish I had just saved up longer and bought a higher quality saw, but even then, who knows what the quality of that would be. I'm so disappointed with this saw, it makes me sick.

If it worked consistantly, it would be a great saw, but it doesn't.",3.0
"The flex compromises the accuracy.  This solution is probably OK for the weekend warrior, but if you make your living as a finish carpenter, you might want to look elsewhere for a more accurate solution.

My first use caused me to ruin some very expensive wood, even after testing it first on scrap wood several times. It seemed to work just fine on the scrap, but when I tried it on hardwood, no such luck. I gave it 3 stars, because my technique may have been somewhat at fault.

The instructions well....let's just say they were less than helpful. I did manage to assemble the saw in spite of the lousy instructions. Connecting the blade on the bottom end is not exactly as quick change as you might think,in fact it is a major down side to this saw. Even the higher end delta's use the same quick set type bottom end connector. In my opinion not a good design. If you want things on the quicker and simpler side see dewalt but the sticker shock will probably point you back to delta. Even though this saw has problems and is rather crude in design. I will keep it. I'm sure after the break in period things will smooth out as I get more familiar with this models features. for the money this is as good as it gets.

Nice, soft material on the inside so it doesn't scratch whatever its attached to.
Very bright and seems to last long. (I haven't used it more than probably 20 times or so.)
Has two brightness options.
Cons:
Can be kind of a loose fit on anything but a book.
I know it has two brightness options, but the options are literally really, really bright or really bright.
Brightness makes reading in the dark a bit ""blinding"" and may disturb anyone else in the room.
All in all, a great product and worth the $.",4.0
"No idea how it works as a reading light other than it has to be better than the watch battery ones--they go thru batteries like crazy.  With this, I was looking for something to spotlight a 20 oz. plant nano for a a couple of hours a night.  The batteries it comes with are cheap and fade quickly, but I use brand name rechargeables and get about 15 hours of light out of them on ""high"" before replacing them.  I use it on its base and even without that added base mighty bright wants to sell you, this is very sturdy.  Never tips over.  It's great to spotlight a small terrarium or keepsake under a bell jar, stuff like that, esp. in an area where there is no electrical outlet.  Have had it for a month now and no issues.  The only reason it is 4 stars instead of 5 is that is took 5 attempts at contacting customer service to find out how many Kelvins it is--10,000K if you're wondering.  This was ridiculous as this was something that could easily have been stated on their website or description and wasn't.  And 5 times for a simple question?  One customer service rep even told me they don't rate them in Kelvins...Next time I read a cheap paperback novel with the gray paper and gray type, I'll use this and see how it goes, since I will never use the watch battery kind again for reading...",4.0
"Because my wife likes to get to sleep a little before me, I needed a light that wouldn't disturb her as much.  This light fits that bill in two regards.  First of all it is not as big as other book lights I have owned.  It will easily work on hard covers, and if you are reading a soft cover book you can clip it the cover and some pages of the book itself to help out.  When you get to toward the end of the book just magically remove the book light and place it on the front cover with twenty pages or so!  For me this is not a real inconvenience.  It also work on my Kindle cover with the front part of the clip between my kindle and the cover itself.  The second thing that makes this product perfect for me is the two brightness settings.  They are both pretty bright, but being able to turn it down a level makes the wife happy.  My only complaint is that the clip can be slick on some book covers.  This isn't as big of a deal, but it can slide at times.  Overall this is a nice book light for the money.",4.0
I bought this for my Kindle 4..works awesome!! batteries super easy to install..fits nicely on the Kindle with a silicone skin ..overall a great deal!.,4.0
"The product shipped in a timely manner and was delivered as promised.  The Mighty Bright light is indeed bright.

Even on the low seting the light is bright enough to potentially disturb a sleeping bed partner.

The bright light lives up to its name!",4.0
"This is great value and provides bright lite to read my Kindle. I always use the two lights as I think one is too dim. Priced right, it is very good.",4.0
"Convenient, lightweight and the clip on stays in place. The batteries last a long time. I recommend them to everyone.",4.0
"I couldn't decide online which type of clip-on light to use for my Kindle Touch. Too many reviews and it seems like most people want a really bright light, which I don't - I want a dimmer one so I can see my Kindle and my husband can still sleep. So I had to go to a store to try some out; Barnes and Noble brick and mortar store has a few in its booklight selection. This one is really light and small (it uses those annoying flat batteries rather than AAAs, but I am making that sacrifice for size and weight). It has one LED v. 2 or more for the other ones. It is still too bright in the dead of night. I ""solved"" this by cutting two pieces of white electrical tape to size and putting them over the entire lighted part, so that the light is quite well dimmed. There is still a little glare, and it is annoying. But the lights all cause glare -- it is definitly possible to angle them up to reduce glare, but then the size of the cone of light they cast gets bigger, and that defeats the purpose of trying to light up only the Kindle screen itself and not my husband's side of the bed. You can clip this on the side of the Kindle instead of the front, and choose the side that points the light away from your partner. That also helps. The light also ""leaks"" a little out of the back of the light switch area (mine is a dark blue color light, so it looks like there is a blue light on the back of the light's head). I covered that up with black electrical tape.

I have pretty light-sensitive eyes myself, so I just needed a little light to allow nighttime reading. This light, modified, is a decent solution. I wish they had one with a truly dimmable LED available! Good luck hunting. Oh - and if you do go to a store to try out lights, take a dark jacket you can throw over your head so you can really test them.",4.0
"This unit is light, flexible, and inexpensive.  It is operated by 3 AAA cells that are included.  The light is bright enough to read by.  For the price it would be hard to beat.  I've seen some for 2-3 bucks less that couldn't light a candle to this.",4.0
I really liked this until I gave it away as a present. It was very bright and made reading in the dark very easy. It practically lit up the room itself.,4.0
"After reading others' reviews, I decided to try this light for my Kindle.  It clips to the cover and generates a great amount of light without being too bright.  The only downside I have found is in the wrong position, it can create a glare on the screen.  This is easily remedied by repositioning, but not compromising light.  Great value for the money!",4.0
Finish is good. The flex arm is sturdy and holds it's position. The two LED are bright enough for my daily use outdoors. Fits my job application perfectly. Clamp is sturdy but has shifted on me while walking around doing my night patrol outdoors. Price is fair for the product. Recommend!,4.0
I have had three of these book lights and have had the same experience with all of them. The light works great. The neck is strong enough and stays where I put it. Batteries last for forever. (I read in bed every night and sometimes fall asleap with the light on. Still it is sometrimes six months on one set of batteries! ONLY problen is where the light attaches to the neck. Every one of these has come a little loose and then the connection is broken and I have to mess around with it to make the light work. Doesn't matter though it's still the best one out there.,4.0
"I've never had a book light before, so I have nothing to compare this to.  That said, it is bright enough to read, without being too bright.  The clip seems to hold well enough, and the flexible arm works great!  I'm happy with my purchase so far.",4.0
"I have a two year old who is fascinated with all things electronic.

And this light, while not made for a two year old, obviously does not stand up to one either.

Needing 3 batteries it takes up a bit of the corner of my screen on my nook.  I got used to that, so really not a big deal, but worth mentioning.
The flexible cable gets pretty weak after use and often takes some serious negotiating to get it to a place where it stays, but isn't putting flare on it.
However, the batteries make this light last a loooooong time.  I usually fall asleep with the light on, only to wake up and turn it off in the morning.  I have only replaced the batteries a couple times over the last year despite that horrible battery abusing habit.

If there weren't other cheaper ones out there, I'd probably just re-buy this same one. But I got this because it was the only one available in the Radio Shack I had gone to, and was on clearance for ten bucks.  It did it's trick.  I feel I got my ten bucks out of it...but I would like something with a little sturdier battery attachment backing so my son can't disable it as easily..nor destory it as easy.  That said, it's worked just fine with no back cover for several months now.  The light does decrease in brightness when the batteries are getting low.  And the buttons got a bit finicky for me, however, I could possibly blame that on the toddler as well.",4.0
I actually clip this light onto my windowsill beside my bed. It works great. It is definitely bright enough for reading. The light itself stays where you put it and doesnt droop or anything. Definitely what I needed.,4.0
"Nice looking well designed book light.  Purchased for my 10 yr old son.  My daughter has the Fulcrum flex light in silver which is great and a little cheaper than this one.  The fulcrum was only available in silver and wanted a blue one for my boy.  Unfortunately he finds it too bright to read by and that is when only one light is on, forget two.  It bothers his eyes and I must agree it doesn't need to be that bright.  We'll use it as a flashlight/emergency lighting.",4.0
"I researched a bit and my final decision was between this, the Fulcrum and the Lightwedge. My first impression was good (well packed, batteries included, nicely built), my second impression was terrible (light wouldn't turn on) and my third was great (light suddenly begun working!).

The output is not like a nightstand lamp and can make your eyes tired after a while, but it is more than enough for my 30-40 minutes bedtime reading. The dual mode is useless, doesn`t change much... set it on one or two, I feel it doesn`t matter much. I wish it was a bit more powerful and that the first mode were more like a night light just to walk around at night and find your book.

Very economical, so far I haven`t changed the set of batteries (at least 3 weeks).
Unfortunately I couldn't get used to attaching a light to my paperbacks, so just attached it to my bed frame and work it from there. I am happy with my choice because my girlfriend is sleeping better, otherwise I would use my nightstand light instead.",4.0
"Good little light for reading at night when my desk lamp is too bright. I haven't used it as a clip light, so not sure how well it holds. I especially like that there are 2 intensity options.",4.0
"I think I'm probably someone who would never be terribly happy using a book light.  When it comes to vision and lighting, I'm sort of like the princess and the pea. But I bought this for use during power outages (of which we have many) and I'm sure it will be a vast improvement over the gyrations I've had to go through to create enough light to read comfortably in the past.  I bought this one because of the features that have been reviewed positively here.  The double lights and the longer goose neck that allow for covering both pages and for not having to move the light to turn the pages are big pluses.  The goose neck so far remains where I put it as well.  The clip seems to do fairly well on paperbacks.  I've found I can also clip it to the headboard of my bed, which is helpful.  I can't imagine trying to read in any sustained fashion with less light than this, however, and this level of light isn't very comfortable for me.  Using it as a booster in a low-light situation would be much better than in a no-light situation.  Nonetheless, I think that in a power outage, it will allow me to cut down on the number of candles that I'd still use for some ambient light while reading.

I had to return the first one I bought, which seemed okay in a low-light situation, but in a no-light situation I was aware of a slight, irregular flicker that was unbelievably annoying. I returned it to Amazon, which replaced it with lightning speed, and the new light was flicker-free. Great service from Amazon!",4.0
Purchasing the Mighty Bright was a good choice. The lamp gives off sufficient light even if you opt to use only one of its 2 LEDs. The switch is great. The clip was a bit bigger on the Kindle device though. It would be best if you have a cover that comes with the Kindle so you just clip it on to the cover instead. Can be used on my laptop as well...I thank the YouTube client who uploaded his video review. It really helped me decide on this purchase. I will try to upload a video review as well so you can check it before you buy the product.,4.0
"Weighs a fair bit less than the triple-A battery variant from the same company, which was part of my purchasing decision (holding a book up with a heavy lamp on it gets old.) Generally attached to either a chunk of book or the cover of the Kindle; I have a flip cover with a stiff front (which becomes the back), so I just attach it there, thus cannot speak for whether/how much of the Kindle's plastic it covers.

Only problem is that the battery connection seems a bit wobbly; get in the wrong position and the flickering makes it seem like reading by a very bright candle. Not enough of a problem for me to do anything about it - even when it goes dim it's more than bright enough to read by - but certainly enough to dock a star.

Neck is long enough that I've been able to adjust it as needed, but short and stiff enough to actually hold (a problem I've had with other booklights.)",4.0
"Pros
* 2 super bright LEDs - 1 LED is enough to comfortably read in complete darkness
* Base is not too heavy and clamps on securely
* Batteries last for a long time
* Highly flexible neck that stays in place
* Can choose to use one light at a time, or both
* Do not have to worry about replacing burnt out bulbs - Yay LEDs

Con: The on/off button, after a few months of use, requires me to push down rather forcefully for it to work.  I hope it does not break.  I payed ~12.  In comparison to the Fulcrum Multiflex, which I have also used, this is better quality and the additional LED makes it a better value - As long as you do not pay too much for it.",4.0
"The amount of light is great, it stays hooked to the book well, including paperbacks. My only problem is getting the light going from the left page to the right and then clear down the page. I am always readjusting the flexible part to accomodate this.",4.0
"I've had my booklight for a year now and it still works like a charm. It illuminates my page without the circular spotlight that you get with other poorly designed lights and the two settings give you the appropriate illumination for the environment you're in. My only issue is the bulkiness of the clip and the fact that this little guy is really hungry for batteries, but that may be because I use my Kindle every day.",4.0
"I bought this as a gift.  After I saw how much it lights up the kindle without shadowing out at the bottom like the one I own, I'm going to order myself one now.",4.0
"Bought one of these a few months ago for reading my Kindle at night. It's light, very fexible, powerful brightness and overall one of the better booklights I've purchased over the years. Liked this so much, had to buy another one because hubby was stealing mine all the time.
A good product for Kindle and print books.",4.0
"This light can be used for regular paper books or your e-reader like the kindle.  I use it for my kindle, which has a pleather cover on it.  The light gives you 2 options, bright and very bright (since there are 2 tiny LEDs).  Unfortunately, though this is no fault of Xtraflex, it causes a glare on the kindle screen.  I suppose this is the fault of the kindle maker. I avoid the glare by pointing the light slightly off to the side of the screen, but when you're reading in the dark in bed, your husband/wife might not appreciate that.  All in all, it's a good light for the money.",4.0
I like this book light and it clips to the cover of my nook very easily. It provides a nice area of light. The only con for me is the clip is just a little bulkier than I would prefer.,4.0
"It's bright, has 2 light settings, and is articulated well.  The only thing I would change is to shorten the arm by a bit.  Overall - recommended.",4.0
"I love my new book light.  I have been using it for several weeks now.  It is small enough to take on trips, yet very bright.  I enjoy having the option of using one or two of the bulbs at a time so that I can minimize my impact on others if needed.  I was skeptical at first because I thought the batteries required would make it too heavy, but I was quite pleased.  I imagine if you had arthritis or another injury, it might make holding a book with the light a little difficult though. All said, I am glad chose this light!  I",4.0
"Got two of these a month ago and its working very well as additional light for my workbench. I can clip it to thin edges i added to my worktop and the craning of the neck is very useful. At first, one of the units only had one light working but then it just started working out of nowhere. Hopefully that remains the case. They are bright. and two levels of brightness is quite nice.",4.0
"I had another reading light that was utterly useless so did some research and ended up with this highly recommended light. It certainly lives up to the reviews - it is nice and bright, but not so bright as to annoy others. My only complaint, echoing someone else's here, is that the neck could be a tiny bit longer. This would allow the halo of light to be just a titch bigger, which would be perfection. I am a happy customer though, and may buy another to alleviate the short-neck issue.",4.0
"The light works perfectly with my Nook and attaches well to my new Box wave Nero cover I also purchased on Amazon. It's light and well made. There is no glare and I love that I only need a AAA battery to power it. The cost was good as well. My only complaint was that the shipping was half again as much as the cost of the light, which I didn't notice until after I'd ordered it.",4.0
"Very pleased with the Mighty Bright XtraFlex2 light. Lights up Kindle screen and book pages very well. Flexible stem is great and functional.

The only negative is that the base (where batteries are stored) is a little cumbersome at times. Would have been nice if the design would have incorporated differnt batteries so the base could be smaller.",4.0

"This is the second product I tried for reading with the Kindle in the darkness. I'm really happy with this choice.

"Purpose: The primary intention of my purchase was to have a small light for bedtime reading so that a light doesn't disturb my wife's or my sleeping.  Secondary intention was to utilize the light for mobile reading.
Result: The dual light setting provides adequate lighting with someone else in bed with the lower light setting, but can provide more than ample lighting with the higher light setting.  The light is surprisingly bright.  Although if illuminating with the batteries, the unit can be somewhat cumbersome.  The clip is adequate, if there isn't too much jostling.  Otherwise, the light is what I expected.  I would recommend this light.",4.0
This was almost exactly what I wanted.  It has a bright light that doesn't rely on batteries.  The arm is flexible and easy to adjust.  I just wish the clip wasn't so bulky.,4.0
"I love this little book light and recently lost it so I am buying another one because nothing else comes close, especially in the choice of yummy colors, like pink and purple, blue and green, something to match every outfit and bookcover (hah).  People always stop and ask where I got a PINK booklight.  The only fault I see in this booklight is that the on/off switch is a ""pressure"" type switch and it turns itself ON all the time whether I have my Kindle in my purse or a bookbag, invaribly I look down to find the light is on.  This has led to wearing out a lot of batteries because the light can end up being left on for hours, even overnight.  I wish they would redesign it so that you have to switch it on and off manually, so it can't turn itself on from the slightest pressure.  Other than that it is great. (I bought the cheap little $3.95 light and as warned by many reviews, it arrived broken; I screwed it all back together and it works, but it is so flimsy I am going back to my mighty brighty!)",4.0
"Excellent - throws a nice light for reading traditional paper books.  Selectable luminance very convenient.  Only problem is that it's made of plastic.  And you're thinking, of course it's made of plastic and so is everything else.  Yes, because it's a cheap material, costs less to form, and ships light.  Eventually the consumer will pay for another one when it cracks or fades.  Five stars is this light with better quality material and craftsmanship.",4.0
"I bought two of these book lights, one for a granddaughter and one for my husband. I love the soft glow that lets my husband read in bed when I'm ready to fall asleep. He love the way it sits on the cover of his Kindle and twists to the perfect angle for reading. Our granddaughter loves hers, too.",4.0
"Great light, but it's actually a little too bright.  I got it so that it wouldn't bother my sleeping husband, but it still disturbs him b/c of how bright it is.",4.0

"This is a perfect light when you need just a little extra without bothering anyone else next to you.  On the plane, train, and automobile.  Even the person sleeping next to you will not be bothered by it.  It works for me and that is all that matters. I purchased a holder in the same color and it brings attention to what I am doing.  Now if more people will purchase them, maybe the prices will go down.
It arrived in a box that looked like someone had stepped on it.  But it did not have anything wrong with it.
The only thing I did not like about ordering this, is that all the colors are not listed together.  If I did not find a skin that I liked better then I had originally picked out when I went to checkout, I never would have found this.  I am not one to spend hours looking, I search and find and then purchase.
Anyway, get this if you need one.  As I said before, just enough light.  And, it has TWO settings. Which I think is a plus.",4.0
"Bought this light as a fathers day gift, so far it is working great, it clips on nicely and the light is very clear for reading in bed with the lights out.",4.0
"Nice lamp, good quality, I just wish it would have a slightly wider light angle.",4.0
The light works well as a booklight although I find it more difficult to use on paperbacks than hardbacks.  The light is sufficiently bright for small pages using just one of the two LEDs but is great if you have a larger format book because the second LED broadens the lighted area.,4.0
"Over the years, I have purchased and used four of these great little lights. I use them to read mostly, but they have come in handy when a flashlight was not readily available. I've always been happy with this product, but this last one I bought, the Might Bright XtraFlex2 light (purple), actually broke on me. I was removing it from a book and when I pushed down on the clip to remove it, half of the clip just broke completely off, so it is no longer usuable as a book light. Would I purchase another one? I am doing just that right now to replace the defective one. I still believe these are great products and will continue to use them.",4.0
"I use this light with a kindle DX.  It is excellent for its size and brightness, but the clip is too narrow to fasten directly to a kindle; it can clip only to a cover.

I considered (and tried a friend's) Mighty Bright XtraFlex 2 light, but liked the idea of a smaller, single battery light.  This light fits that bill perfectly.  Unfortunately, the kindle is too thick for the clip to hold to the light.  The larger XtraFlex2 light could clip to the kindle, but is also best with a cover because its clip is wider than the bezel of the kindle DX.",4.0

"I had two of these xtra flex book lights and I really loved them until the clip broke and I couldn't attach them to my books any longer.  So, if you are clumsy like me and mess around with your booklight alot...beware of this little default.  Would I buy it again?  Yes!",4.0
"I was so fed up with all my previous book lights ruining my poor books. I don't think I owned a book that hadn't been ripped, creased, or mangled in some way from sliding my ""cheaper"" book lights on and off the pages. I went in search for a better light on Amazon and found the Mighty Bright XtraFlex2. I love this light for so many reasons. It has a large strong clip that stays secure on your book without any damage. The neck is very flexible and will bend to whatever position you want, and actually stay there. The batteries seem to last, I have been using this light almost every night for a month and haven't noticed any dimming. I love that it comes in so many colors. Now onto the reasons I only gave it 4 stars. If Amazon allowed half stars I would have given 4.5 but they don't so I didn't. The two light feature is a great idea but I find that there really isn't much difference in brightness if you use just one or both lights. I find the light almost too bright (I know ""what do you expect from something called the Mighty Bright"") still, I wish that the one light feature was a bit dimmer. Thankfully my husband is a heavy sleeper and doesn't mind. The clip is a bit bulky for regular books (if you are buying to use with the kindle you may not mind this) and I find it a bit annoying holding the pages open with this wedged between them. The price is also a bit high, in my opinion 25 dollars for a book light is a little much. Overall this is a great light, the best I've owned. I would recommend the Mighty Bright XtraFlex2 and would purchase again.",4.0
"Small, flexible, and the perfect amount of light for reading. It lights up my book, but not the whole room, so it does not bother anyone else.",4.0
"I so wanted to love this light. I love the idea of two light settings. I love that it basically covers all of the kindle reading page - but NO REPLACEMENT BATTERIES? The thing is so easy to turn on, if you carry it with you, it can accidentally turn on, thereby burning out your light and having to purchase a whole new unit, rather than just replacement batteries.

How sad. Otherwise, I loved it.",4.0

It works pretty well, although I would prefer it to be a little bit wider so that the pages could be illuminated more evenly. I usually just move it around as needed and it's not a big deal since it is so flexible. It has two settings so you can adjust the brightness. The clip is sturdy and seems like it will last. After having it for a while, I have discovered many other uses for it (dropped an earring? looking for a cable behind your computer? can't find something under the sink? etc...). You can clip it to pretty much anything where you need a little light temporarily.",4.0
I'm not sure why folks have said it' not enough light. I got this because my husband goes to bed earlier than me and our big lamp keeps him up. This concentrates a lot of light on the page but not elsewhere. It was plenty to read by and very cute! I'm ordering a second one for my husband.,4.0
"This is the first reading light I've ever purchased, and it works great. It's very sturdy, with a solid clamp, although it's fairly heavy and doesn't work well with magazines or flimsy paperbacks. The light is absurdly bright, especially at the 2-bulb setting. In a dark room I've still had to make a little cardboard shade to limit how bright the Mighty Bright is. Honestly it's almost too bright.",4.0
"I bought this for my Kindle DX (love that!).  This works well when you need the additional lighting.  It provides a nice amount of light when the batteries are fresh.  I also use it for actual books and to help illuminate my laptop keyboard when necessary.  My only complaint is that the power button is on top of the light itself, and tends to turn itself on during transport.  I sliding switch may be a better design.  Other than that, well worth getting.",4.0
"Works well, made well.  Should stand up to the job that it was made for.  The light it puts out is excellent to read by.  Illuminates only the reading area and not the rest of the room.  Makes reading easy at night without disturbing my partner.",4.0
"The light is great as it is bright and made of plastic so it doesn't scratch the Kindle. I am however a little surprised that there isn't a light more ""Kindle Specific"". That is one that is a little smaller and would fit in the case with the Kindle. Good bargain though and two light settings which is a very nice feature.",4.0
"Amazon has been bugging me to do this review so here it is:  They sent me a purple one rather than silver, but I could care less about the color.  It works just fine.  Be careful where you place the clamp so you don't damage the screen.  It will work fine on DTB's too.  Very fair price, IMHO.  I'm using it on a Kindle 2. Only 4 stars because of the switch placement.

UPDATE Oct. 18, 2009..We had a power failure last night so I just turned on the Mighty Bright and read away.  Plenty of light with just one light on. I'm ordering another one for my wife to use with her K2.",4.0

No different than the one I bought [...].""  But when I used it that night ... I have to admit, it really is significantly brighter than other book lights that I've bought.  I like it a lot.  The only thing that could be improved is the on/off button placement.  When I adjust the  light, I find myself unintentionally turning it off.  Then, it takes several clicks to get it back to the intensity that I wanted.  Still, it's a keeper.",4.0
"This works very well, the only think is when you have it packed in a purse or bag it turns on very easily and lights up everything in your bag!",4.0
"I own this product, but if you are looking for a Kindle light there is a better one available, the Mighty Bright TravelFlex LED Book Light. I like it a lot better for my Kindle 2.

Here is what I like about the TravelFlex:
-Thinner clip fits the Kindle better (it fits perfectly on the spine of the Amazon Kindle 2 cover)
-1 AAA battery instead of 3 makes it easier to use on the Kindle and easier to bring spare power if you think you might run out soon
-I only ever use 1 LED at a time with my Kindle
-Lighter weight keeps it from sliding around and making the Kindle feel out of balance (especially when reading in bed).

This is a great light, but for the reasons above I would recommend getting the Mighty Bright TravelFlex LED Book Light for a Kindle.",4.0
"I received one of these (black but no adapter) a few months ago and my verdict is that I am likely to use it when reading books at night. I also don't feel that I'm missing the adapter.

Brief overview:

- 2 bright LED's with lenses
- light has more blue and very little red, or yellow (think of a steady neon light)
- uses 3 (THREE) AAA batteries which makes the base a little heavy
- 40-hour battery life (claim is made on the package, not exactly timed by me) but it does feel like it lasts forever on a charge
- power adapter does not justify paying twice as much for this book light given the long battery life and the inconvenience of running an electric wire on your bed
- relatively long, flexible arm
- can turn on 1 or 2 LED's
- solid build
- a bit heavy but had no problem using it with a paperback

I will definitely use this lamp when reading books at night. I doubt I will ever use it as a flashlight or a work light unless I had no other choice. If I were to buy another book light today it would be a Mighty Bright but I would go for the 'no adapter' version which sells for about half the price.",4.0
This definitely gives enough light to read by but tends to easily move when shifting the Kindle and sometimes needs readjustment of the lamp position.,4.0
"I've had this for about 6 months now and read an average of 3 hours a night.  The neck is unfortunately loose & no longer holds itself where I position it but it's still the best book light I've owned so I'm buying another.  I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that the neck didn't stay sturdy over time.

Lightweight & great bright light for night reading.",4.0
"I just returned from vacation where I really put this light through its paces.  Overall, I like this reading light but there is one major flaw which keeps me from loving it.

Pros:

- light weight
- two levels of brightness (very helpful)
- light is easy to position to just the right spot
- clips on and stays where you put it (even with a Kindle)
- LED means a long battery life and don't have to carry extras

Con:

- where the on/off switch is located (on the light head itself) and because it is turned on by pushing it in, it is VERY EASY to turn it on accidentally.  As I was packing it into my luggage, I accidentaly turned it on and again when removing it from my luggage.  I had visions of it being bumped during the flight and finding out the light had been on for many hours without my knowledge.  I suppose I could take the batteries out every time I pack it, but don't really like that additional step.  Even when just moving it from one spot to another in my own house, I had to learn how to hold it to not cause it to come on (one time it did and was directly in my eyes -- I saw spots for a while!).",4.0
Well this is a good product for the Kindle 2 as the contrast isn't enough in the kindle in dim light. The only thing there is a slight glare when not adjusted just so also it's a little bulky but that's because of the batteries.,4.0
"This cute little battery-run (3 AAA, not included) light does what it says - bright light even on ""dim"". It's like florescent lighting....casts a bluish tint. It's certainly bright enough, but the eerie tint will give some a headache or at least depression. It fits my Kindle 1 cover just fine. Very tiny price. Fine for short term usage, but for me, not for longer reading sessions. Yes, it will do nicely in a power outage!",4.0
"I really like this light. I bought it for use with my new Kindle because where I live tends to have a few power outages every year, and when the power goes out during dark hours reading is pretty much all there is to do! As much fun as I thought getting the bright purple or blue would be, I decided on the silver because I thought it would be less distracting in actual use. I thought it would blend into the surroundings more and I was right about that.

I absolutely love that it has two lights so you can choose which best fits your needs at the moment, saving on battery drain when you can. In dim lighting conditions one bulb is plenty. In full dark then using two works best.

The neck is long enough that it allows for extra flexibility in positioning to avoid glare on the Kindle screen and I'm not having any problems with it being too floppy to stay where I put it. I'd imagine that might change over time with use, but I'd also imagine that is true of all lights using that type of flexible neck.

The clip is wide enough so that it doesn't cause too much pressure on a very small spot and it seems just right in the amount of tension is has, not too much and not too little. It works best by clipping on to my Kindle cover, but I can actually use it on just the Kindle plastic casing too.

One of the best parts is that it uses normal AAA batteries for easy replacement. I hate products that use odd battery sizes so that you have to search for a store that sells that particular size.

I did take off one star for the design of the power button. While it's a nice design with just pushing it, because it's slightly raised above the level of the bulb housing I can see why others report they have problems with it being accidentally turned on when being carried in a purse or briefcase. For me that's not an issue because I will either just be using it at home or on vacations. At home it just sits on a shelf and for trips I can remove the batteries before putting it in my luggage.",4.0
"very light and strong fixation to the book
double or single led position is very usefull!",4.0
"Bought it for my daughter for Christmas after doing some research.  The light is fabulous.  She has used it every night in bed.  There are two LEDs and she only turns one on, and this is plenty bright.  She was using it in the car when I was driving and I couldn't believe how much light came from it!  She's still on the first set of batteries.  Only complaint she has: when attaching it to a hard-cover, the clip tends to slip down on the cover.  Really like this product though and will buy one for our son soon.",4.0
Nice light and plenty bright but could be a bit more sturdy.  Easy to take anywhere in the house or on a trip.  Good buy.,4.0

"Now I can read my Kindle at night and not bother my husband.  Also, Pink is my favorite color",4.0
"If you plan to use this light (or any light, very likely) with the Kindle, you will find a problem with ""spotlighting."" The Kindle's screen is just reflective enough to cause a bright splash across the page when a book light is pointed directly at it. It's impossible to read through the brightness. This book light has a goose neck, so it can be used successfully if you angle it a bit, so that only the edge of the circle of light illuminates the page. The drawback is that the light is no longer as local, and may disturb those around you if you are using the light to read at night.",4.0
I bought this little light for my wife. She's read in bed for the past 25 years and has always used some type of portable light. This is about the 10th one she's had. She likes it! She says its nice and bright and easy to clip to the book. We haven't had it too long so we'll see about the longevity but up to now; I'm out of the doghouse! Woof!,4.0
"The headline says it all.  Took off one star because battery life is pretty poor.  That said, I've tried many booklights; this is the one I use.",4.0
"This was a gift for my granddaughter (age 12). She loves it! However, had I known it doesnt use regular batteries (like AA or AAA), I wouldnt have purchased it. It uses those coin-shaped batteries that are always difficult to find (otherwise, Id have given it 5 stars).",4.0
"Super cute!  Has just the right amount of brightness to be able to read, and folds up to store.  It attached to my book easily, which was a plus.",4.0
"Great for use for reading. I got this for my daughter(7yo). Unfortunately, the bulb area separated from the neck of the clip, but we were able to put it back together. She just has to be careful with using it. I have one, just a different design, and have had no issues using it or with it breaking or coming apart. The type of batteries it uses isn't easy to find though. I don;t know if it's the area I live in, but the place either doesn't sell it or it's not in stock. one thing to look at when deciding on purchasing.",4.0
Perfect for night time reading,4.0
"Bends well. Works great, but light is very bright. I love how it bends and stays in place. This company has great customer service. We ordered two of these, and one broke, but they immediately offered to send a replacement.",4.0
Very bright. Nice quality. So far so good!,4.0
Daughter really likes it,4.0
"Exactly what we ordered. This light is lightweight and offers good light to read by. Only one setting for luminance may bother some but for my wife and me it is fine for reading in bed with the bedside lights off. Battery is a cell battery as opposed to AA or AAA, but easy to find.",4.0
"This is what i use to bribe my daughter.  Do well listen and you can get some extra reading time in bed.

She loves it",4.0
It's pretty cool. Exactly as pictured. Doesn't hang on to paperback books well.,4.0
I wish it had a longer arm.  I am using it to light my pattern for cross stitch.  The pattern is 8.5 by 11.  The light does reach far enough.  I am trying to make it work.  The light itself is great.,4.0
"Gives a bright light on the entire page of a paperback and medium size hard cover book.  However, it has to be adjusted when going from the left page to the right.  (I have never found one that can illuminate both.)  It is light enough to be used on a paperback if you clip it to the last several pages.  I love the color, probably because I love purple in general.",4.0
"I bought this as a gift for my 8 year old grandson, who like to read before bed.  He loves it and uses it regularly.  Well made, sturdy clip.  I would recommend for kids.",4.0
Small and works great.  No complaints so far.,4.0
I enjoy this book light and it gives a large amount of light,4.0
I like this reading light a lot but had noticed after a little use the light wouldn't always turn on when prompted. It sometimes takes a few pumps of then button and sometimes goes out whilst reading.,4.0
Way too bright,4.0
Amazing little light the acts as a book mark too. Serves its purpose but if you want to read in complete darkness I suggest you get a stronger light as this is most useful in dim-lit situations.,4.0
"These were purchased for our two girls to use at bedtime. They are great for reading-very bright light! Only gave four starts because they are a little bit heavy to use with paperback books, but we adjust. I would purchase them again and they are super cute :)",4.0
"We bought one of these a couple years ago for our daughter to read with at night and it has been good and reliable, so this year we decided to get another one for our younger daughter.  Only problem, the new one arrived non functional (even after replacing the batteries which we shouldn't have to do with a new product that comes with batteries).  Now I realize that this is not a reflection on the product itself, just an inconvenience for me as a consumer.  I would recommend this light as I am having it replaced because we have had great luck with our previous one.",4.0
Serves it purpose.,4.0
Great little light that is bright enough to illuminate the page or Kindle well and easy for the kids to use.,4.0
Very bright!,4.0
My daughter loves to read and so she loves this but after about a week or so the light started to flicker off and on while being used. Maybe a shortage in the wiring or something. Other than that my daughter loves it and that she can read when we go on road trips.,4.0
Shines bright enough for a book light.,4.0
"My daughter became a book-addict thanks to this little book light. Before going to sleep she can close her door, turn of the lights and delve into her world of stories.",4.0
"I got this for my husband to replace a book light that had gotten lost. The light is great for reading overall, holds on to the book well, it's just VERY bright, so it's not great if you want to use it to read while someone else is sleeping.",4.0
"Bright little light without waking up my partner. Would've given 5 stars, but both of our lights had a little annoying thing wrong with 'em. Whenever I bump the back of the light at all (where the battery goes in), the light flickers, or on the odd occasion, turns off completely. Great little light otherwise!",4.0
"Works like a charm. The light is bright enough to illuminate the entire screen of my kindle, but not to bright to disturb my husband from sleeping.",4.0
It was a little smaller than I thought.,4.0
Very compact and well made. My daughter loves it.,4.0
Love it!  I can read without waking my husband up :-),4.0
"A bit heavy for the book pages, as you can imagine, but very useful.  I tried to use it with my kindle, but so far I do not see the need to add more light to it. Most importantly, the light reflects, so not recommended for kindle paper white.",4.0
"Works great, very bright & cute lite.",4.0
"Bright, great for reading but might be too bright for others trying to sleep next to you",4.0
"My 9 year old daughter is the one that uses it, but I have seen how it works. It is very bright, but not so bright that it disturbs others when she uses it, and it clips perfectly to her books as well as her tablet. Even her thicker books such as Harry Potter it works for, and she loves the girlish designs on it. Very happy with it, especially given the price.

EDIT: 1 month later and this is broken. I'm not sure what happened, but the top part with the light in it got separated from the middle, and the inside wires snapped. My daughter was very careful with it and is now very disappointed. I have taken a star away, since this product is clearly not very durable and I expected it to last longer than a month",4.0
Lost a star because the provided battery lasted less the 2 hours.  Replacement battery(s) are still working.  Light is plenty bright to read by.  Takes two batteries.,4.0
"Effective. The only negative: I ordered the orange football themed light for my grandson, but turquoise with swirls arrived instead. I noticed near the barcode that the sticker said ""football"" on it. So I don't believe this was amazons mistake but the manufacturers.  I chose not to bother with an exchange.",4.0
Very bright for such a little light and lightweight too.  I'm happy with it.,4.0
Got this for my daughter. It's very bright. So far so good.,4.0
It appears to be very durable and kid proof. This is handy for my little ones kindle and nighttime reading! very useful.,4.0

Designed for children, it can just as easily be used by adults because the monkey is removable. It comes with a detachable clip, making it useful not just for books, but laptop users as well. MacBooks come with their own backlit keyboards, but most PCs do not and I often have a hard time identifying keys on my HP laptop when I'm surfing at night. The flexible gooseneck makes it very versatile as a mini-flashlight as well. It's bright and competes with some LED flashlights I own. If you have a wall plug, you can also use it as a portable nightlight for home or on trips. Just point the neck towards a wall or floor to mitigate the brightness to your needs. The clip also makes it useful for clipping onto hat brims or shirt pockets for various non-reading situations.

As good as this light is, I do have only 2 minor complaints about the product's design: one is that the monkey figurine feels tacked on, quite literally. While it certainly is cute, the rigid mounting bracket isn't very good. It can fall off easily when handling the light, making it easy to lose. The other issue is that the USB connector feels loose because it lacks the metal sheathe other USB devices commonly have. This jacket allow them to sit snugly inside the port. Without it, depending on the angle of the gooseneck, the center of gravity may affect the connection with the contacts. The only other thing is that the manual could perhaps be more detailed on total charging time and battery life expectancy. Otherwise, a fine and useful light for home or travel. If taking on the road, the monkey should perhaps stay home to avoid loss.

Manufacturer provided test unit for evaluation.",4.0
as expected,4.0
"Such a great idea, and super cute, easy to use and my four year old loves it!  Only downside is the lamp arm and the clip don't really ""lock"" together and so after a few times of charging, the rubber around the USB mount got bent out of shape and doesn't fit properly into the clip and so they are easily detached from each other.  Light itself was very bright and lasted a good amount of time between charges and charges very quickly.  Just wish the clip and arm clicked together a bit more securely.",4.0
I like it. It just look like the picture but its a little to heavy for small books,4.0
"This light does exactly what it is supposed to do. It gives off the perfect amount of light. It is lightweight and I love the fact that I can just plug it in to a USB port. That's it. No cords or extra cables to get in the way. The only thing I don't like is the monkey or whatever the animal is attached to it. I don't know, it seems to be geared more towards children,in my opinion.  I would prefer the same style but perhaps in some classier, adult like color schemes.  All in all, I really like it. I received this product in exchange for my honest review.",4.0
"This is such a cute book light. Pretty bright. Super cute monkey attached that can be removed. But why? He's so cute. Nice sturdy clip. Holds good on anything, not just books. I love that the charger is under the clip. Just pull off the clip and plug into any USB. Which also means I can use this for my laptop that doesn't have backlit keys! I love that. Charges fast. Hasn't gotten hot on me yet. Super cute, great for any book lover, Kids included.
I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review",4.0
Product provides enough light to see the keyboard or use a reader.  The clip is secure and attaches well.  The recharging USB is cleverly hidden in the clip.  Not as adjustable as I had hoped but not bad.,4.0

"This is beautiful rope lighting and is perfect for use on our motorhome awning.  I would have given it a 5 star rating, except the light color isn't as ""warm"" as described.  It is on the bluish white spectrum.  However, it does give off a beautiful glow, as the lights are perfectly spaced to give adequate evening lighting, but not too bright.  I recommend it.",4.0
"I ordered the Warm 3000K bulbs, I didn't read close enough, these are COB style, and non dimmable so they will get warm, not as hot as Halogen.
I ordered a set of two for our stove hood, they are slightly mismatched in color temperature",4.0

It's a bulb and lasts pretty good. Halogens are hot,4.0
"I got this for my back patio. It has a soft glow and is perfect for lighting up my patio when chilling .
Owned for 1 month",4.0
"These are very nice replacements to the old kind you could get at the home improvement stores.  These run cool and use a  lot less energy.  One of the problems with the old type of rope lighting is the heat from the lights wore out the clips that hold them in place, making them brittle.  They would need to be replaced every few years.  I do not expect this type of issue with the LED's.

If I were to ""knit pick"" the LED's, it would be that they are not quite as warm as the old style.  These are a bit cooler than the warm glow I wanted, not to the point of being unacceptable but cooler in color none the less..  The LED is also somewhat brighter.  Overall a pretty good, energy efficient alternative to the old style.",4.0

"I recently received this silver safekeeper, and I am happy with it overall.  It is not very large, but I do like the different sizes of the compartments.  What is most important to me, besides value-for-the-money, is to be able to put my sterling silver jewelry in zippered compartments.  This way, my jewelry is least likely to tarnish and it is organized, so that I can just choose and go.  A nice feature of this case is the two ring rolls.  These particular ring rolls (I have other silver safekeepers) are large, but not too large for my size six rings, so that when you slide your rings on them, the rings stay upright and you can easily see which one you are looking for.  The ring rolls are so snug that the rings do not slide into one another, which I also like very much.  Therefore, I have given four stars for this item because I would like this silver safekeeper to be either larger for the money, or less pricey because it is not that large.  That being said, it is doing it's job, and my jewelry is tarnish-free and organized.",4.0
"Lot's of zip closed pockets for rings, ear rings etc. Only short coming is storage for necklaces. Yet it accommodated everything else. I especially like the ring tubes for ring storage. all sizes seem to fit,",4.0

"Like most moms, mine is proud to have a child in the Army. I ordered it to her house while I was deployed and she has been wearing it since; I've been back for a year now. She usually wears gold, but this is nicer than it looks in the picture. It's the same height and width of a standard dog tag but about twice as thick and the material is much more durable than aluminum, stainless steel maybe, won't bend or dent. My mom's hasn't tarnished or rusted in the year and half she has been wearing it. The relief is deep with a semi-gloss brush finish. It gets 4 stars because the chain is the same cheap bead-chain we get. After a little while the chrome fisish will wear off the beads exposing the copper beneath, making it look crappy and leaving a grey ring around your neck. You'll want to get a better chain.",4.0

"good replacements for existing fixtures  produce a great deal of heat, though, so we will eventually replace the fixtures so we can use led bulbs.",4.0
Seems to be a good bulb at a good price ...,4.0
I changed out 2 dead bulbs with these and they are working fine. I'm happy that I got 10 of these for less than the these 2 would have cost me at the local big box store. Now I have 8 more available for the future. I'm happy.,4.0
works fine.  Not as bright as the one i bought from radio shack but for the price worth it.,4.0
"Great bulbs, arrived quick - but I inadvertently ordered the 120V instead of the 12V in haste.  So I'm stuck with 10 worthless bulbs.  My own fault! :)",4.0
Loved the price on this.,4.0
These are about one fifth of the price that you'd have to pay at Home Depot.  I installed about 6 of them in under-cabinet lighting and they have performed as expected for the last month.  I'd get them again.,4.0
"I have quite a few of under-cabinet puck lights, and with all the door-slamming, I go through a lot of bulbs. I've been using these for a while now. The price is right, and the quality is good. I give them 4 stars because they're a bit large, and may not fit in all puck light fixtures.",4.0
"These appear to be a bit better made than some we have purchased in the past.  They all worked initially, which isn't the case for the last batch we tried from iLLumi Projections.  (6 of 10 failed!)  Only time will tell if these measure up.",4.0
"Not as bright as the ones I purchased from Home Depot/Lowe's, however has last longer. My guess is if they were brighter then they may experience premature failure. If the brightness was the same then they would have received 5 stars. However overall I'm happy with the purchase.",4.0
The product works as advertised.,4.0
