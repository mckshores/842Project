"My young kids are interested in the human body so i figure i buy them this toy,  Parts are really small and are to handle cause of how sticky they are cause of the materials they are made with.  Kids played with it couple times and like everything else..... collects dust!
I think i got to get the kids the next step of human anatomy and buy a classroom kine dummy",2.0
"My boy played only first of the day..
maybe because my boy is only 7years old",2.0
"I am a little disappointed with this product.  I wanted to have this to teach my daughter and once we put it together and started to take it back apart, it wouldnt go back together again correctly.  Things fell apart, the two pieces would not stay together.  It was fun for the first time and my daughter did learn from that.",2.0
"Gave to my niece as present. Upon opening it and taking out the pliers, they broke apart! It is made of cheap plastic and the post holding it is very small...too bad as I had high hopes for this.  I think the idea was nice but execution could use improvement. She hadn't opened the organs yet but it appears they have a coating on it which will eventually gather dust over time.  The skeleton shell is thin plastic and I fear with one good drop, it will crack. The small posts on the bottom of the skeleton that fit into the plate seem small and I also fear those may shear off...time will tell. Will update once she uses it more regularly.",2.0
"My son was dying for this, but after playing with it for several hours, he never picked it up again.  A very expensive Happy Meal toy (in terms of length of interest) if you ask me.",2.0
great for the money but the parts do not all go together or stay in place you might want to look for a better model,2.0
"this looked cool, but my 9 year old stopped playing with it in about 10 minutes. perhaps she is too young",2.0
"It was ok. Its a cool idea, but we couldn't get the clear part to stay closed and we got two skulls and no skull cap. Also the insides being squishy makes it hard to know if you're placing things properly. It was too hard for my 5 year old",2.0
"I'm very disappointed in this product.  I bought for my 8 yr old son who saw it advertised in a magazine.  I researched and thought it would be an acceptable purchase.  The one I received did not appear as it is in photo.  We had to assemble the model and in doing so, realized that the pieces would not stay secure in the holes that are designed to hold them in.  Very frustrating for him and myself.  I like the booklet.  Considered buying a more expensive version but couldn't figure out the difference by the description.  Will return, but my son thinks this came from Santa.",2.0
Parts are too small and it was hard for my 8 year to take out and put together the right way.,2.0
All of the puzzles are the same.  Match five people with five items.  I like this math one slightly more than the other one.  I expected some variety.  If my grandson loves them I'll report back.,2.0
Not frame worthy. Too much unnessary bordering and not enough figure details. Good for kids but not adults wanting something to display.,2.0
"boring, overpriced game",2.0
"The Greatest Dot-to-Dot series.  As other reviewers have mentioned the numbers are sometimes hard to make out and it's a little confusing as to which dots correspond to which numbers.  Numbers are close together which makes it more difficult to decipher.  The Monkey Around books (Greatest Dot-to-Dot) are just as challenging, often times more, in it's puzzles and yet they are easy to read and correspond to their respective dots.  I simply wish David Kalvitis could keep up with my three year old's love for these puzzles since the quality of the Mindware books simply don't measure up.",2.0
This is definately an adult dot-to-dot.  My granddaughter likes to do these.  She is young and thought it would be something we would do together.  Guess my eyesight is REALLY bad!  Very small numbers.  Will keep for an adult to use.,2.0
confusing to play,2.0
"The blue and purple and the red and orange are so close in color it is hard to play.  Also, should have been painted with a mat finish due to lighting glare on the blocks.",2.0
Dont understand how to play it so have not.  I have read the directions and went on YTube to try to figure it out. It sits in my closet wasting away,2.0
This particular game is a knockoff. I had purchased this game at a toy store and came to Amazon to buy another. This is an awesome game. The game that came to me via Amazon was in a smaller box and there was no bag that you will need in order to store the pieces once you open the box. You won't be able to put it away in the same box once you open the packaging. The image on the box was blurry. I returned it and went to local store to get the real game with the bag.  The game is wicked fun!,2.0
Item did not come with the drawstring bag as listed in the description.  The bag is fairly important for holding the tiles and letting players pick new tiles without seeing them.,2.0
"The game is fun, I played on someone else's game, whicj is why i have bought it. Delivery was swift, all good in that regard. I give 2 stars because the box says a bag is included and my box did not include the necessary bag for the tiles",2.0
What happen to quality control? Some wooden tiles are chipped on the corner and edge making them stand out from the other tiles. Not good since the game requires the face down side of all titles to be anonymous and exactly the same.,2.0
I think we could love this game if the directions didn't suck. They aren't clear and leave a lot that you just have to guess at. Maybe once we figure out our house rules we will be bigger fans. Was super excited for this game but was left frustrated and let down by the lack of direction.,2.0
Not as much fun! According to the kids.,2.0
Two tiles were stuck together and when I separated them the paint came off the bottom one. That did not make me too happy.,2.0
Box was sealed when received.  When we opened box at Christmas there were no instructions and the draw string bag is missing.  Not impressed!,2.0
my eight year old girl never plays with this game... :(,2.0
"This is described as a game for ages 6 and up. Really, it's a game that only 5-7 year-olds would enjoy. It's far too simple for anyone older than that.",2.0
Do not understand the instructions on how to play,2.0
Not recommended for kids under 12.,2.0
"If you decide to order this game, don't worry about getting the Chinese knockoff version; if you're lucky the lead paint and toxic fumes will kill you and you won't have to sit through this incredibly boring game.
This game is like scrabble, if you took out all the words, challenge, and fun. The rules are suitably complicated, but that doesn't make the game challenging.
The best board games always have you 'doing' something. In Scrabble you make words, in Monopoly you buy property, and in Catan you build your own little empire. Things like that are what make the games enthralling and exciting for you and your opponents.  In this game, you line up colored shapes. Woo.
Save yourself some time and money: print the pieces yourself on paper and try the game so you won't be enticed to but the real thing for $35.
I have no idea how this got such a high rating, unless most people enjoy boring games that require almost no thought.",2.0
"The game is great, but it came without the storage bag that was supposed to be with it.  I was disappointed when the recipient opened this incomplete gift.  No rules came with the game either!",2.0
"Not one of the avid game players in my family could ""get into"" this game.  Maybe it involved too much reading of instructions.  We blockheads stuck with Blokus.",2.0
"This game is all hyped up, but really isn't that much fun. It's too much work to track who's winning. That is fine if they provided some sample pads to track scores. Instead, the box merely comes with the pieces, and an extremely poorly written instruction. I have recently started playing many boardgames for the first time, and this is the only game that has given me problems. It was not difficult to get started, but there are many cases where we played into situations that are simply not covered by the manual. Game design must include clear instructions that account for all playing scenarios. Instruction manual is not an area a game - especially recently introduced ones - to skimp on.

I also agree with other reviewers that the colors are much too faint. Under less than bright lighting conditions, it often required much squinting to figure out the color being played.",2.0
Instruction manual and bag to put tiles in was missing.  The game was fun after we looked up instructions on how to play.,2.0
"My grandson liked the game but there were no instructions and no bag for storage as listed on the box. I returned it with no problems, as usual, from Amazon.",2.0
"Did not arrive with bag or instruction, was able to download instruction, but was disappointed.
Usually very happy with everything from Amazon.",2.0
The edition of this game that was delivered was not the same as the one pictured. The game arrived without any instructions and without a bag to hold the tiles. I am very disappointed.,2.0
There was no instruction book or bag that was listed on box. This was an incomplete set. Disappointed this was like that.,2.0
"The box for this says that the game includes both a bag and instructions. Neither were present and I don't know how they would have fit it into the box since the tiles *just* fit if laid perfectly flat in three layers.
I'm lazy so I haven't decided if i'm returning this or just sourcing a bag and getting instructions off the Internet, but think twice before buying this SKU of this game",2.0
"I ordered two of these games, one for our family and one for the grandkids. The one received by the grandkids is in different packaging (smaller, cheaper, with a tab side opening) and came with neither instructions for play nor the bag to mix the tiles. I am very unhappy with it. I expect they will return the game.",2.0
"NOT SUCH A FUN GAME, UNLESS WE JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY, BUT SO FAR, WITH ABOUT 3 VERSIONS THAT WE HAVE TRIED, IT ISN'T ALL THAT GREAT.",2.0
"Tiles are of a lower quality than the games my friends have; they are glossy, much smaller and some are uneven with the rest.. I am disappointed",2.0
I HATE this game!  I am throwing it away!  I've tried to like it but it's just not fun and I love board games and such.... Look on this game is a waste of money!,2.0
"Game is pretty fun but 8% of the male population is colorblind and this is one of the worst offenders I've ever encountered (as a colorblindy).  I play a lot of games and most manufacturers have learned to deal with this by adding some sort of visual cue.  For example, Ticket to Ride uses colors a great deal but a colorblind person quickly identifies that there are subtle symbols to help them identify differences between colors also.  This manufacturer could easily add a symbol to help those that are colorblind but they haven't.  It's not as fun when you have to ask other players, ""are these the same color?"".  We ended up using a sharpie to mark the differences in color but I don't think we should have had to.",2.0
"This game looks very fun based on the instructions and other reviews. I would have liked to give it 5 stars. However, despite the price the manufacturer has elected to paint the pieces in the worst possible paint. I have never experienced anything like it. As a tutor, I have many games. Occasionally I buy one that must sit outside for a few weeks due to its toxic odor. I have brought this game in several times in the last year hoping it would finally be ready. It still smells! I am beginning to wonder if the toxic odor will ever disappear. Skip this game and try Blokus or Othello.",2.0
I bought this for my granddaughter. She usually loves this kind of game but this one somehow misses the mark.,2.0
I purchased this game to play with my 6 year old nephew.  He loves board games.  This one did not hold his interest.,2.0
"My primary criticism of the game is the poor choice of ""comedy"" movies selected for questions. I understand that the gamemakers can't afford to pay for the rights to every great comedy movie ever made, but honestly, we played the other night and had 6 questions from the movie ""Julie and Julia!""  Was that even a comedy?!!  If you are a newcomer to the game, my advice would be to keep the answer ""Meryl Streep"" right in your back pocket for the duration.  Also, there was a question from the movie ""Sex in the City,"" but I disqualified the correct guesser immediately and sent them home early for having seen it.
And if you're an owner of ""80's Scene It"" and benefited from the vast number of questions from John Hughes films, your in luck, because he crept into about 20% of the questions in this game too.  I heard Hughes just bought a new jet courtesy of Scene It.",2.0
"I've had more fun playing Pogo's Trvial Pursuit game than playing this.... First of all, it doesn't really work on the computer the way you'd expect. Second, it requires at least two people. Third, the questions aren't all that challenging. Thank you....I'll stick with Pursuit and You Don't know Jack!",2.0
"We had a big family game night last week and I broke out the new Scene It Comedy edition.  It featured written instructions as well as instructions given on the DVD which was included.  The game board can also be expanded for longer games.  About 10 of us played the game and most of us were confused by the questions.  I have never heard of a lot of the movies that were included.  All in all, unless you are a complete comedy movie buff, I do not recommend.  I have played other Scene It Games in the past and enjoyed them - I think I just wasn't into the Comedy Movies that were included.",2.0
"If you're an obsessive fan of all the new B effort motion pictures and direct-to-video sequels being pumped out by the Disney studio, then you're likely to be very pleased with this game, which seems to give a lot more attention to Bolt and the newest Winnie the Pooh cash-in than the classic masterpieces that made Disney a household name in the first place.  Few and far between are My Play and All Play questions relating to the classics, instead utilizing the game as a sort of advertisement for all the garbage that isn't already in your video collection.

Add to this a thoroughly lackluster presentation (at least the disk loads faster because there aren't any impressive sounds, images, and effects to cue), and I give Disney a C-/D+ for their efforts here.  It works, and some families are going to enjoy it, but those of us who think of Snow White and Beauty and the Beast when we hear the name ""Disney"" aren't going to have much use for this game.",2.0
"I had high hopes for this game as my daughter and I are big Disney fans, but the game was not at all what we expected.  We have played several times now and every clip has been from a Pixar movie, usually Incredibles or Bugs Life, movies my daughter hasn't seen.  I realize there needs to be things that appeal to both boys and girls, but I thought there would be more equal representation.  I've seen no clips involving any princesses or fairies at all.  I do not have the older Disney Scene it games so I don't have anything to compare this to,but I'm guessing based on the movies and clips we had hoped to see in the game, we made a poor choice by selecting this version, which we did because it was the only version available in the store.  If your kids are into Cars, Incredibles and the other Pixar films, they will probably love this game, but if you have a child expecting to see princesses and fairies, or even Mickey Mouse, this version is a poor choice.  The box does show both Jasmine and Tinkerbell on the cover, and it also says that it features movie clips from disney and pixar films, but I did not find this to be the case.  This game is very heavy on the Pixar, very heavy on the movies that appeal more to boys.  I wouldn't recommend this for a young girl.",2.0
"Right before I played Scene It Magical Moments for the first time, I played a round of a 2nd edition Disney Scene It that I already owned.  That was great fun.  Sadly, the new Magical Moments edition is just not very good.

The presentation is pretty abysmal in comparison to other games.  The Second Edition board had pictures of characters on each space.  It was rather attactive.  Magical Moments on the other hand simply has blank spaces and a few random (and they are quite random) characters thrown on the board.  Also gone are the double move spaces, which is sort of inexplicable.  The Buzz cards are now retangular instead of circular and don't fit as nicely on the board.  Obviously, they went out of their way to make some changes, I just can't figure out why.  Also, one of the playable characters is the hero from the upcoming Disney movie ""Tangled.""  Seriously?  No Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck or any of those classic characters but we get Rapunzel?

This game of Scene It plays pretty much like any other game of Scene It.  You roll, you move, you answer a question on the DVD or cards and if you get it right, you move again.  Unfortunately, the first roller had moved three quarters of the way around the board before getting a question wrong.  And that was only because that person lost an ""all play"" which is really the only way to end a turn in this new game.  They also added a new DVD category called ""my puzzle"" which allows you to use the DVD remote to pick an answer.  These are also too easy.

The clips remain amusing, but the questions are just too easy for your average Disney fan.  Since I assume only Disney fans would pick up a game like this, it seems rather hopeless that people will have a lot of fun.  So my recommendation would be to go purchase Scene It Disney Second Edition, which really is a run and often challenging game.",2.0
"This DVD was definitely not what we expected.  It does not show baby animals too much, and it's pretty much a game and not a documentary.  My 2.5 year old does not really enjoy it, so I can only hope he starts to enjoy it once he's a little older.  If it looks too good to be true, it usually is.",2.0
There were very few instructions.  It was difficult to understand how to play.  The kids got bored with trying to figure it out.,2.0
The game itself any one could play if you understood where to put the pieces etc.  Instuctions were very vague.  We played it our way 7 year old was happy with it but has only asked to play it once so Im guessing it will sit around and collect dust now.  Not a game that he will want to come back to over and over.  The questions were extremely easy anyone who has watched Rudolph can answer them.  Even with the dvd slowing you down the game didn't take much time at all to play.,2.0
It has a lot of needless stuff in it. Could be more fun and could be done better.  A bit confusing for young kids and not fun enough for older kids.  I'm about to leave it outside,2.0
"The idea of it is cool, but it's not what you think. It almost has nothing to do with the movie. There's no trivia, and the games are stupid easy. Hell, you don't even need to have ever have seen the movie to win, as opposed to other Scene It games where seeing the movie helps immensely.

Even though there's different random games, only 3 ever pop up ""randomly"", or so it seemed like. I dunno, maybe it was bad luck, though I suspect not. I played this twice and there's several games that never popped.

It's not really meant for more than a one time play through. It's meant for babies and monkeys. Not worth the money.",2.0
"Three of my children and a friend--a 22 year old, a 17 year old, a 15 year old, and a 14 year old--tested this game.  They all said that the game was set up so that either the questions were way too easy(a made-up example --what color is Rudolph's nose) or too hard and obscure.  They played it with younger children in mind, and said that even young children would probably be frustrated by the too easy, too hard issue.  They also said that it was very annoying to have the Bumble get all the toys and make it so that no one playing won.  It should be set up in a different way so that one of the players would win every time, not have people playing against the Bumble.  One of my children said that she didn't think she would have enjoyed the game when she was little, based on the problems they saw with it.  I realize that we didn't test the game with the ""recommended ages"" of children, but I think that my kids aren't so far removed from childhood and can judge what they would have liked and disliked as younger children.  The board game is colorful and the concept of the game is good, but maybe it should have been more extensively tested with the expected users--young children.  Perhaps valuable feedback for improvement would have been gained.",2.0
Very difficult for little ones.  Not much fun for older ones either. Kinda cool just to have if you love Rudolph though.,2.0
"Very, very boring game. I thought board games were boring, this DVD game is boring as heck. It seems to be the same thing over and over and over. Not something I'd recommend",2.0
"My kids (3 & 7) loved this game.... the first 2 times.  After that the limited number of different dvd minigames repeats and repeats and repeats and ...... you get the picture.  Buy it for $5 if you can, otherwise look for a smarter game.",2.0
"We ordered this after reading the 5 star reviews.  We probably should have taken a closer look at the description.  We really thought this would be more of a trivia type game, since it is made by the Scene-it company, but there is no trivia at all.  You could replace the video clips and game pieces with some other theme and it wouldn't alter the game at all.  OK for 4-7 year olds, but my wife and I were getting tired of it about halfway through the first sitting.  From now on our kids can play this on their own.

Quick description:

The objective is to collect 4 acorns that are your color (the space you start from).  At the beginning of each turn, you get to turn over a tile, revealing an acorn or a blank tile. You move around the board collecting your acorns as they become available.  The number of spaces you are allowed to move is determined by the DVD portion of the game.  There are 8 mini-games that you play (like acorns under a shell that you have to follow with your eyes).  Some of the games require skill, and some are pure luck (like a Plinko-type game).  The results of the each game will let you move 1, 2, or 3 spaces.  Each mini-game is proceeded by one of eight video clips from the movie.  You end up seeing the same clips several times during each game.",2.0
There were not many cards or designs as I was hoping for.  Great skill for kids to have as math readiness.,2.0
"I bought this game thinking it was Back to the Future fluxx and was horribly wrong. It's made by the same company and comes in the same packaging as fluxx but isn't fluxx.

I'm am idiot...",2.0
"Not as good, personally as some of the other fluxx card games, but it's still interesting.",2.0
"Fun theme. Poor ""game.""",2.0
We bought this game on the recommendation of a friend but we found it to be slow moving and pretty boring - sad I wasted money on it.,2.0
Only played once and didn't finish the game. Went back to Fluxx 5.0. Did enjoy Zombie Fluxx; it is more lighthearted.,2.0
Good price and shipped well- but bad game.,2.0
"I was dissapointed that the cards looks just like the original Fluxx.  The same border, text, and bland pictures.  Cartoon Network Fluxx is a much better example of how to do a follow up to the original.",2.0
"It was fun for about 2 days, no one has played it since. Shouldn't have wasted my money.",2.0
"Really can't get into this game, and neither can anyone else. Still, it gets good reviews, and I'm hoping that one day the right group of people will get together. It seems like it should be fun. I'm going to keep hope alive for this one, but so far.. nothing.",2.0
"I was dissapointed that the cards looks just like the original Fluxx.  The same border, text, and bland pictures.  Cartoon Network Fluxx is a much better example of how to do a follow up to the original.",2.0
"We had never played a Fluxx game before but had played various other Cthulhu card games.  Cthulhu Fluxx is built around the concept that the rules change continuously, but we tried this game several times and the rules changed so frequently that it was virtually impossible for any player to win.  One outcome of the game is that everyone loses (Cthulhu wins), which I suppose is alright unless it happens every time.  After I played it the first time, I thought to myself, ""This game is so random, we would do just as well to simply throw all the cards on the floor and see if any one picks up the right set of cards to match the current goal.""  Upon seeing how quickly the goal changed in the game, my 10-year-old daughter had the very insightful comment, ""Oh, this could go on forever,"" which she said with a tone of dismay.  It didn't go on forever because Cthulhu won (every time).  We are done with with this game after playing it a few times.  For a Cthulhu-themed card game, Cthulhu Gloom is much more fun, more imaginative and the graphics on the cards are much more esthetically pleasing.",2.0
"We have other Fluxx games, so we are familiar with them.  This one has much more complicated rule changes, so we always had to carefully read the cards when we'd play them, which disrupted the game.  I'd rather play regular, Eco or Stoner Fluxx.",2.0
"I was trying to find a kind of fantasy game to play with my 6 year old son and this was a fail. It was confusing and boring. The goals are just having certain cards. Too many cards for my son to keep track of and the play was really boring.  I will try the Dungeon board game next, that's probably more like what I was looking for.",2.0
Do not use product. The cards only contain the Spanish words. Shouldn't the translation be on the back of the card? This product was of no use.,2.0
"Only in Spanish, so doesn't really help to learn Spanish unless you already speak it.  Spanish and English would be much more helpful",2.0
Not great. This product does not have the english word on one side. It is the spanish word and just the image on the other side.,2.0
"Someone in the review mentioned that there is English translation but that's lie. I am a beginner and I need English translation.
I feel like it's waste of money. No recommendation!",2.0
This is definitely only for kids and you don't learn much really,2.0
i was disappointed in that all of the words are basic Spanish. I suppose I was hoping for everyday words that I could post around the house on everyday objects. silla for chair. sofa for couch. mesa for table. etc. I wanted the words to help me learn everyday Spanish words.,2.0
"useless for my needs, I gave them to charity.",2.0
"There are a few things about these cards that bother me. First, there's no pronounciation explanations, second, there is no English word anywhere, and third they use a different word for the colors than all the other Spanish programs/books that I've used. If I hadn't written all over these, I would return them.",2.0
I just expected English on one side.,2.0
Too simple and too few cards.  Nice idea though.,2.0
"The ad should be more specific such as how many cards in a box and what level of learning it is designed for. The picture of the item is deceptive. It contains only 100 cards while I thought it should have at least 500. It is also for children, not for adult students.",2.0
No what I expected.,2.0
This was a gift for someone else.,2.0
"I was sorely disappointed with the gift wrapping.  I paid for gift wrapping and it was wrapped in two layers of transparent tissue paper (one sheet, folded over).  No surprise for the recipient.  Boo!  10 cents of tissue paper.  Boo!  Boo!",2.0
I purchased this and 3 others for my 4 year old granddaughter. The problem is that the numbered portions of the picture are way too small for any child to stay in the lines. You need to make the boxes to color a lot larger or the kids won't enjoy it. Randy,2.0
"Cute box, but boring and unbalanced game with broken press-your-luck mechanics. Gets worse with more people as you spend most of your time watching and not much time playing.",2.0
"There is a pretty annoying misprint on the headquarters board. This is a ""known"" issue they won't fix/replace, they won't tell you about and will happily charge you 40 bucks for. I had previously enjoyed a couple TMG games. but my first and probably last dealing with their customer service has left a bad taste. Should wait for a second printing. Sure wish I did.",2.0
"I backed this for their Kickstarter, and was rather disappointed -- both with their Kickstarter behavior and the game itself. I'll just focus on the game.

The artwork is pretty good. The rules are very unclear, to the point that I thought there was a misprint in page collation. The game itself is rather dull -- each player rolls dice, tries to get as many good things as possible, then chooses to do so again. There is little or no challenging decision-making, and almost zero inter-player interaction. You just watch someone else roll dice.",2.0
"I tried this game with 3 others and while the mechanisms are sound and the game plays quickly, it didn't strike a chord with me. The most glaring thing to me was the limited replayability of the game. It has a very small card set and it almost plays like a abstract card game rather than a city building game. The ""flip"" mechanism was also difficult to enjoy since you have to hold the cards in your hand in a very precise way so that you don't see anything below the top card. I enjoy city building, but I was just not impressed with this one.",2.0
"My rating may seem too critical, but it's honest.  The mechanic of flipping a card to upgrade sounds great in principle, but really makes for a very poor experience when implemented.  Because the cards are two sided, shuffling becomes a very tedious and awkward experience.  You don't want to look at the cards while shuffling, because that would be cheating.  So you shuffle under the table.  But then if you drop the cards your current game is completely messed up.  It's a novel concept, but a horrible when implemented.

I like the simple artwork, but the theme is terrible.  I like it that the theme is neutral, but it's terrible in how buildings are suppose to translate to powers of the card.  A better theme is desperately needed to bring this game together.

Overall, I can not recommend this game at all.  This is one of those games that has potential, but definitely needs to head back to the game testing labs.  Two sided cards could be an interesting concept, but trying to shuffle cards while not looking at them and not dropping any of them is just not going to work.  Simple artwork and generic theme are very much appreciated, but trying a card's image to it's function needs to have some mental connection.  Otherwise the theme is nothing but distraction.  A proper theme helps the player remember what each card does.",2.0
"I played this with 4 players.  I found it to be dry and boring and I couldn't get into it.
The decisions weren't very interesting and when the price of the goods unpredictably change, which can happen at any time, everything you've worked for becomes a waste.  Boring, frustrating and annoying.",2.0
"I appreciate the attempt to create a good game with a small footprint, but this just falls way short.  The abilities on the buildings are very lackluster and you never feel like you are doing more than moving markers up and down a track.  The top hat mechanic also takes it down a notch or two.  The top hats allow you to use an opponents building without paying the fee.  But it is just too easy to get a top hat and it is not unusual for everyone to have one.  That just removes part of the reason for buying the building.  All in all a very dull game that as none of the good type of tension necessary in a good game.",2.0
"rules were not clear, this game just doesn't seem to play well",2.0
"Supposed to be a quick, easy game with an interesting market mechanic.  It wasn't.  It just dragged.  On and on, until we stopped playing, put it away and played Snodonia instead.",2.0

"I tried out this game with the other residents of my senior citizen complex, and it just isn't for us old geezers.  The instructions are quite complicated.  I do think those in their 40's and younger will get a kick out of this.  It's just not for us old geezers.",2.0
"The Firefly board game is fun.  It is clearly inspired by the show at every turn.  It is, however, extremely long.  I've played it with 2 gaming groups, and we still haven't been able to finish even a single mission.  One of the reasons?  The game has too many damn cards.

I expected the Breaking Atmo booster to have another Firefly in it, or something that could shake up the pace of the game to make it a little faster.  It turns out this expansion is just more cards, and the last thing this game needs is more cards.",2.0
"As many others, I first viewed this game on TableTop. Purchased it to play with a mixed group of gamers & non. Two of the group are huge car fanatics, so I thought this would be a good option to get everyone involved and having a good time.

Let me start by saying this game drags on and some of the rules just over complicate a simple game. Our game with 7 people took nearly two hours due to the fact that you are constantly passing the one lone dice set around the table. This game fills the void for huge groups, but other than that it is a pass for me.",2.0
"There are few games to play with more than 6 people, so after watching Wil Wheaton's Table Top on this I bought it thinking it was perfect for a game loving extended family. Unfortunately, it looks more exciting than it actually is because it just isn't that competitive. Basic rules or not, there just isn't as much smashing and crashing game play as you want. Oh, and do not think you will EVER play with 2 people (seriously, it is pretty much playing by yourself)... awful.",2.0
"I purchased this game along with many others. This was my introduction to tabletop games and I was appropriately overwhelmed by the instructions. We played it a couple times and shelved it for some other games.

After getting for familiar with the other games we figured we would tackle this one as we were used to the complexity of tabletop games. We played it again but the fun just isn't there. I've never successfully had a group want to do more than one lap as it was unanimous that they were done with one. In fact we had players intentionally destroy their cars so they would leave the game.

The game itself is well made. The board is nice with really nice artwork. The little cars and gearboxes are cool. The instructions are colorful and informative though fairly overwhelming and unintuitive. You will find yourself going back to cheat sheets numerous times throughout the game. On a side note the plastic insides of the box were crushed in shipping so there are minor cracks where you put the cards and pieces back.

It's clear that a lot of effort and passion went into the game but I really don't see our group picking this over really any other board game that we have.

It is because we find it more of a chore than a game we give this 2/5 stars.",2.0
"I was looking for something to use with Heli-X.  This does work for that, both in Windows 7 and Linux, with no drivers needed.  While it does work, it has huge dead spots near stick center, about the first 1/4 to 3/8 of travel has no effect (looking at the calibration screen in Heli-X).  This means that you are moving the sticks about 1/2"" each way to get the helicopter to respond, which is nothing at all like a real helicopter.  At best this is frustrating, at worst it builds very bad habits.

This might be passable for someone learning to fly planes, mainly for orientation training, but you will be in for a rude surprise when you fly a real plane and find out that 1/4"" movement makes your plane bank hard.

I tried to use it on my clear view program but it could not be adjusted. I could not get it to set up on the software that came with it.,2.0
Not as good as prior reviews stated it was.  Not compatible for some flight games.  The controls are sloppy and have a short range of motion compared to others that are similar.  Spend more and maybe you can get better quality.  It is ok for the price but not good enough for high end users.,2.0
"First, mine arrived DOA but it was obvious that this is a toy and not really appropriate for proper training in radio control operation.  It's too small, doesn't have trim control and the sticks have none of the feel that an actual controller does.  I didn't get to test  its accuracy since it was defective but even if it was spot on, there are much better options out there - check out the Dynam 6ch controller - it is life size, has trim control, good feel on the sticks and works well with Clearview SE (free).  Don't even bother to download FSM, it is outdated, no longer supported and not all that good when it works.  The upgrade of Clearview is only $35 to get all the models and airfields or buy them one at a time to add to the freeware version.

Props to Amazon as they immediately issued a return label and promptly credited me back my funds.  Notice this is sold by a 3rd party vendor but fulfilled by Amazon - that makes all the difference in the world since the seller has to comply with Amazon's policies.",2.0
"It came quickly and as describe but there are flaws. Software are clunky and none of the helicopter model work for me so I had to download a different software (HeliSimRC). It's just a totally different feeling training with a computer vs a real RC. I suggest you save some extra money and buy a cheap 4CH RC heli instead of this. You'll learn quicker from training with an actual RC than with this. For me, this is a waste of money.",2.0

En mi opinion este software es MALO, sirve para aprender ESTRICTAMENTE LO BASICO de volar pero lo peor de todo es que VIENE CON ERRORES!, yo lo compre y lo instale en mi laptop y al tratar de arrancarlo daba error por falta de un archivo, luego pude resolver el problema y hacer correr el programa pero igual daba errores de imagen, tuve que desinstalarle las texturas y las demas cosas de los graficos para que medio se viera... Tengo una laptop DELL XPS M1530 con windows vista de 32bits, 4gb de memoria ram, tarjeta de video nvidia geforce 8600gt m, 500gb de disco duro, o sea que las fallas que presento este software NO FUERON por falta de requisitos de mi computadora...

I have issues with the softwear. I do not know if it was the windows 7 so I tried it on my vista machine.  the softwear does not have the proper DLL files to complete the install. so I am stuck with some thing that I can not use and out 50 bucks!!!!,2.0

"The software that ships with this product is not compatible with Windows Vista or 7 out of the box, but digging around the Internet gets it to work. It's probably worth the extra 40 bucks to buy a more modern simulator designed for Vista/7.

What I liked: It simulates model plane flying once it works
What I don't like: It takes a lot of tweaking to get it to work on a modern operating system, the documentation is fair to poor, the flying experience is pretty monotonous once you get used to the controls and get the plane ""off the ground""

I've seen some better simulators with obstacles and more extensive flight environments, but I don't know how much they cost. You are basically paying for the controls in this package, and not for the software. I don't know how well this will help my RC flying, but it is certainly a good way to learn to fly without smashing your plane to bits.

On a side note, if you are just starting RC flying, get something like this simulator, but spring for better software, and get a high-quality beginner's plane like the Easy Star. You WILL DESTROY a classic style airplane with the motor in front if you are just learning. The powered-glider type of planes are made to fly easily and be very forgiving of beginner errors.

The price of this product was just a few bucks more than the cost of the cable to connect my controller to the computer. Look around, and you might find the cable for your controller for less, and you can just download the simulation software. -3 stars for poor software, compatibility, and limited entertainment.",2.0
"NO vista compatible. Is it the software bundle ? Us it the device itself? I am still trying to figure out.

"As soon as I opened the package and handled this plane for the first time, it slipped out of my hand and broke both tail fins and one of the engine inlet spikes (all made of light plastic and glued in place).  I glued this back together and put it on its stand, but I am reasonably sure that it will not stand the test of time.  I was very unimpressed with its construction, and had higher expectations for a die-cast model.",2.0

"This model was disappointing in every regard.  First, to my eyes it is closer to 1:87 scale than 1:72.  It is not diecast, but plastic and quite fragile.  I am a wargamer and hoped to use it with my 20mm figures.  I will still use it, but had I been able to secure Hobby Master's Bell Huey, that would have been my first choice.  This is a consolation and a distant second.  It's what I get for waiting too long.",2.0
It is not exactly as advertised.  It is listed as a DIECAST model.  Not a bit of diecast on it.  I collect 1/72 diecast aircraft and I bought 2 of these (one as a gift to a former Vietnam vet friend who flew these things and was shot down).  Slightly disappointed because the quality and diecast listing are stretching what you're actually getting.  This thing is 100% plastic.,2.0
This is very fragile. You need to immediately try to glue the rotors. The pins that hold them on are flimsy and will break with the slightest movement.,2.0
This model has NO diecast parts like it says it does. Very cheap flimsy plastic that does not hold up well.,2.0
I think the materials you use to produce this helicopter are too weak.  I expected something better.  But the size is really representative of a 1/72... that is cool.,2.0
A nice model but some of the decals are misplaced.  I will be returning the model.,2.0
"Very Good model.  Problem is how it's on the stand.  Too much weight forward, very difficult to get it to stay off the plane's nose.  I'll have to add weight to the stand or fasten it to a larger stand base.  VERY SAD!!",2.0

This is a fun little unit. A few issues. It is very fragile. it broke the second day I had it. Plus the usb charger doesnt work at all. Over all I would not recommend this. I purchased a different brand and have had then a month with no breakage. My 8 year old loves them.,2.0

It uses IR sensing so it can only be used outdoors when it is cloudy and can olnly be used indoors with a high ceiling,",2.0
"The gyro or the rotor mechanics, did not hold up. Nice craft and flies well when it works but after a few days it would not properly stabilize to hover still. It would go out of control.",2.0
"I may have been in haste with my first review. After going thru everything to see if I received a genuine Syma the only differences are the color of the circuit board and the graphics on the side. Every thing else checks out, even the box it came in. @ $17.00 you can't go wrong with this buy.
I have e-mailed Syma with two questions.
1. Any other color of circuit board besides red.
2. Side graphics
I will post a follow up with these two questions answered",2.0
"I don't know how I lived without this! I was loving learning to fly this thing and told all sorts of people they had to get one! After a few weeks though the controller started to accelerate when I reduced throttle. Left and right controls are fine and batteries don't help, it's as if the left joystick is faulty.

It should have lasted longer even for only $20, but I am considering buying a bigger outdoor model, maybe I'll be luckier and the thing was just so much fun!!",2.0
"Not sure if it is fun or not. The screws holding the propellers on are tiny and the blades become loose and it will not fly. The user manual it at best ambiguous and written in very tiny and blurry font. Had to go to online forums to just get it to engage the blades for use.

The battery was weak on the first flight and it wouldn't charge enough to take a second flight.  No return or warranty information.,2.0
I had to return this item the same day I received it because it was not functioning properly. There was a problem with the infrared receiver on the helo. I tried 2 different controllers and the issue kept happening. There was also nothimg in the area that could have caused unwanted interference. These S107's work great I have another one that I have never had a problem with. This paticular one was just a lemon. I wanted a replacement but for some reason Amazon says that I must get a refund from this vender.,2.0

love the locking aspect but it is smaller than the original which isn't good,3.0
"Nothing against scrabble, as this was my first time ever purchasing a scrabble board.  I went with this one since I've heard stories of epic games being ruined by all the pieces sliding off the board.  The lock system is a nice feature.  Keep in mind that the lock keeps the pieces in place if the board gets bumped or moved.  If a sore sport decides to capsize the board, the pieces will still ""unlock"".  My only gripe is that everything, EVERYTHING is plastic.  I personally am not a fan of plastic, and for those wanting the nostalgia of the cardboard board, this will not be the board for you.",3.0
"This tiles in this set are a bit small to manage but fortunately are easy to read.  The box we received has an error near the bottom of the game board (right side).

"This game board was much smaller than I was expecting it to be. On the good side, you could probably take this and play it in the backseat of the car. The tiles do stay in place and don't slide around. There's a bag to keep the loose tiles in which certainly helps to keep you from losing them.",3.0
This is some sort of bootleg scrabble. The pieces are a small cheap plastic and the logo does not look the way it does in the picture.,3.0
"A tad too light weight. The holders for letters move around and drop the tiles. Otherwise, the locking in place is a good idea.",3.0
We love scrabble but never Dr finished a game before because someone would always get too rambunctious and knock the tiles around. I was really excited for this version and while it is a bit more secure the kids still end up knocking the tiles out of place.,3.0

Had to return - ordered wrong item,3.0
Smaller than I expected but love scrabble so its fine!  Just wish it was bigger.,3.0
The product is as described. It is travel-size it is pretty small however the lock-in pieces don't actually lock in very well. If you put one in it kind of goes crooked and then trying to fix it you know call the other one's crooked.

The board is about one square foot (I think the classic board is more like 2.25 square feet). Also, after 60 years, you think Scrabble would include a pen and pad for keeping scores, e.g. like you get with Yahtzee and a host of other cheap board games. That's a 50 cent cost to the unit. Alternatively, you could design and advertise a Scrabble app that contains a dictionary and a score keeper. No app + no pen and pad = supply your own scorekeeping system. Would I forgive Apple for not including a charger with a Macbook? Then why should I forgive Scrabble for not including a scorepad?",3.0

I suspect that the points on the tiles will fade out or disappear soon even if you play with clean fingers.  When you form a word a tile may not always fit in or lock in the slot.

I actually like that the tiles are plastic and easy to clean, since I have lots of little ones running around. The pegs in each corner of each square do help make the tiles a little more stable, and the board has held up just fine. I was considering giving this as a gift, but I think the ""not fantastic"" quality would have made it a bit tacky for a gift. This set has been perfectly fine for teaching my kids, though.",3.0
"Tile Lock Scrabble is a portable take on the classic board game.  The board is shrunken to 11x11 inches (compared to the traditional 14x14) and is a solid piece of plastic instead of a folding piece of cardboard.  There are small rubber feet to help keep the board from sliding around.  Because the board is rigid, you can support It on your knee or on an uneven surface.

To help with the portability, this board features tiles that are held in place by small posts all throughout the board.  This is what they refer to as the ""tile lock"".  Once a tile is in place, any lateral movement of the board won't cause it to move out of place.  A major problem with this design, and the reason that I give this product three stars, is that if you bump the board up and down, the tiles still go flying.  They are only held down by gravity.

The board comes with four plastic tile pews.

Overall, I found the small 11x11 size with the small plastic tiles difficult to get used to.  The tiles are smaller than a traditional scrabble board and a bit slippery.  Because of their shrunken size, my adult-sized fingers fumble with them a lot.  Unless I was using this in a motorhome or somewhere without a table, I'd probably opt for the full-sized game and not worry about the tile lock capability.",3.0
"Seems cheaply made compared to other Scrabble sets I've owned. I will have to say it is great for putting in the camper and taking it along on our trips. Bring a small dictionary for disputes as some areas don't have cell phone coverage to look things up when you go camping.
It is small, the tiles do not slide around as much as they would on a regular board, though I would not say they actually locked. If the board it tipped they will fall off. Tiles are smaller and it makes them a bit harder to manipulate.",3.0
"I've played Scrabble since I was a kid using the traditional board and tiles.  I chose this product as a method of introducing the game to my daughters, both of whom are old enough to understand the concept and rules but also young enough to guarantee that the board will be hit at least once each game by accident.

The first thing I noticed is that the board is significantly smaller than a traditional Scrabble board, and the tiles are likewise smaller to fit the board.  This is probably fine for kids who generally have better vision than adults and can more easily handle small tiles, but it makes it tougher for adults.  The feel of the tiles is also just not the same as the wooden tiles to which I've grown is , although that's hardly a fault.

The tile lock idea is great, but the use of ""lock"" is misleading.  These tiles can be knocked around the board without too much difficulty, especially if the board is bumped at all from below.  I think larger tiles to prevent this problem would create other issues by being too snug, so maybe larger locks would have been better.  Whatever the solution, this system is far from perfect.

I really like the idea of this product and I'm sure we'll make use of it.  Even with its faults, it's a better option for kids than the regular game.  If they can work out some of these kinks, this could be a five-star product.",3.0
"Scrabble is a great classic game that never seems to get old. I have younger kids and it does make it easier for them to set tiles and not knock out other tiles with this set. It is a bit disappointing that this set is made up of so much plastic which makes it feel a bit cheap. This one is about the same price as a ""standard"" scrabble set that gives you wooden tiles and holders but a basic playing board. I would skip both and get the current ""Deluxe"" edition for about 10 bucks more that has wooden tiles and holders and a plastic board with tile holders and spins. I got one way back when it was still Milton-Bradley and we still use it.",3.0
"My family has played Scrabble as long as I can remember.  It was one of the first games we had -- my parents enjoyed playing it with each other even when we were too young to be good players.  Because the game itself is so well known, I will not review the game, only what I think of this particular set.  As anyone who plays Scrabble knows, it is all too easy to jostle the board and move the pieces.  My Mom has the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scrabble-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B0036RRSU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scrabble Deluxe Edition</a>&nbsp;with ridges around the squares to keep the pieces from moving and I was hoping this version would be similar to it.

The good news is that this set is about one-third the price of the set my Mom has but the bad news is that it is smaller and not as nice.  Unlike many Scrabble boards, this one does not fold.  It is approximately 9 1/2 inches square and the background ""regular"" squares are light blue/gray, not the white or cream I am used to.  There is only a thin border around the playing area.  The list of letter tile distribution that was on the side of the board I grew up with is on the rules sheet in this set.

The system for keeping the tiles in place is a grid of little red plastic bumps on the corners of the squares. The tiles are plastic too, not the wood I am used to, and they have tiny recessed corners that fit around the red bumps.  Once in position, the tiles sit very securely on the squares -- I tilted the board to almost vertical before the tiles fell out of place.

There is a major issue with the bag the tiles are in.  The fabric is so thin that you can see the letters on the tiles through it.  This would make cheating to get better tiles very easy.  You will want to either make another bag or put it inside something opaque to keep players from being able to see the letters while choosing tiles.

The box a game comes in is not important for playing a game, but is important for storing the game.  The cardboard is quite thin and the box is not very sturdy.  I worry this box would not last nearly as long as the game itself.

The bottom line is that if you want a Scrabble board where the tiles won't move around while you are playing but also want a more affordable price, this set could be good for you.  If you really enjoy playing Scrabble, I recommend you spend the extra money for the Scrabble Deluxe Edition",3.0
"My extended family loves Scrabble and it is played at most every get together.  They are the types that take it pretty seriously and even have the Scrabble Players Dictionary to settle word play disagreements.  Myself though, I play games for fun and while competition is good, I don't take it nearly as serious as they do.

This Tile Lock Scrabble is my 3rd Scrabble Game.  I also own the Scrabble Deluxe Edition and the Game Folio Scrabble.  The one thing that each of these versions have in common is that the tiles are meant to not slide around by way of some alteration to the board. With the Deluxe version the tile spaces are recessed, with the Folio the tiles snap in and with this version the tiles are supposed to lock and while they do click in, lock is not what I'd call it. So if you are looking for one that can take a bit of movement and jostling, keep looking beyond this version.

Overall the set is very similar in price to the Game Folio which is meant for traveling and the tiles snap in much better on that version, but for me I still find my preferred set is the Deluxe.",3.0

"We wanted something that would survive a little bumping better than the traditional Scrabble board. We played a dozen games with it this week and it worked fine.

But, overall it is not a great design. To ""lock"" the tiles, there are pegs at the corner of each board square and the tiles sit between those, not exactly locking in, but fitting enough that they won't easily jostle loose.

List of defects:

1) Getting a tile into place is too fiddly, one has to be pretty precise in setting the tile down, most often people had trouble getting them into the right spot. Often one person set their tiles down and then a second person spent a little time aligning them and getting them into the exact right 'locked' position.

2) The tiles have holes in the middle of the bottom, which means that if one just puts a tile down near the right spot, it's common to catch a board peg in the middle of the tile. If the tiles were solid instead of 'hollow', they would be easier to put in place.

3) The tiles are light and small and slippery. They are kind of hard to hold onto with bigger hands.

In the end, a flat cheap magnetic board with magnetized tiles would be very strongly preferred over this.

It is usable, but I would avoid this version. 3 amazon stars.",3.0

"I wanted to love this but I already have misgivings. For one, there's a bit of advice on page 3 saying that the charms might fall off.  Ummm wow.  Really?  Sure they say to use a strong adhesive but then an adult has to be involved.  So that's a bit of a discouragement.  The charms and stickers and such are cute.  Clearly inspired by kawaii.  This is actually what appealed to me because I hoped it would thrill my granddaughter.

The ""meat"" of the journal begins on pages 12 and 13 with a quiz. Then there's some fill-in-the-blank type things.  It isn't until page 17 you actually have the space and freedom to actually write a journal entry. And there won't be another until pages 29 and 47.  Yep.  You get 3 whole pages for journaling.  The rest is activities and such.  I wouldn't mind all this fluff stuff if the book itself included more opportunities for personal writing.

And maybe that's for the best.  The paper is glossy.  This will limit the types of pens one can use in the book.  Or, and I would highly recommend this, you will want to blot the pages so keep paper towels handy.  Simply have the child write and, before turning the page, lay a sheet of paper towel on the page and turn.

With that in mind, you might want to wait to decorate the cover until the rest is filled in.  I can't imaging the bumpy cover will not make it easy to write in the book. *shrug*

So yeah, it's cute.  And it's easy to fill up with fun things but I had hoped for more.  Hopefully my granddaughter will love it and have fun tilling it and decorating it.

*It's fun.
*The instructions are clear enough. (It may take a while to understand but you'll eventually get it)

Cons:

>The 1995 edition is better.
*All of the group cards lack descriptions.(as seen in the  NWO 1995 edition)
*Some of the effects of certain cards seem to be simplified.
*Some of the content seems to have been toned down. (Many of the really violent images are replaced with generic,dull looking images)",3.0
"Its a good game but one will have to make sure they are enough people to play and they are fairly even in competive ability. Meaning a mixed group of adults and young kids would not be fun. Also for non fantasy fans it will take a bit of explaining and the game is very esoteric and is very honed on a small audience. It's probably not going to be a big hit w a lot of people, unless perhaps at a convention. If though one can find a group it will more then likely take several sessions of bumbling around w the rules to get the full grasp of the game. A lot of it is based on subtrafuge that goes undetected, though after a round or two it becomes obvious who does what. It would be hard to pull off shifting alliances and the like for most players until a high level of understanding of the game is achieved as the game has multiple goals at once going on.",3.0

"I've mentioned in my other Munchkin reviews how awesome Munchkin is.  It is.  Great game. Can't say enough about how much fun the overall game is.  Awesome. I can't, unfortunately, repeat that word for Munchkin 6: Demented Dungeons.  You won't hear me repeat the word again in this review.

This Munchkin expansion introduces two new card types to the game: Dungeons and Portals.  Dungeons are cards that are played in a separate stack from the normal two stacks in a typical Munchkin game (the Door stack and the Treasure stack).  A Dungeon card represents the dungeon the characters are playing in.  There is a Dungeon in play at all times, and each dungeon adds a new rule or new law by which the characters must abide while that dungeon is still in play.

Portal cards get dealt into the Door stack, and they're used to change out the dungeon that is currently in play and replace it with a new one.  Some Portal cards have their own rules, so that two or three dungeon cards can conceivably be in play at the same time.

All this sounds great, and it is in theory.  The problem is that there aren't many Portal cards, and when you have a lot of expansion decks in play, that makes for a lot of Door cards.  When you have to shuffle the Portal cards into the Door deck, they get diluted significantly in a bigger deck.  A big part of the fun with the Dungeon element is to regularly change out the Dungeon (and some of the rules for specific dungeons are less fun than others to live with, so you WANT those changed out quickly).  A big deck of cards means you may only encounter a new Portal every once in a while (or occasionally not at all).  This leaves you with two options.

1)  Deal the Portal cards into the whole big Door deck and hope for the best, knowing that you may not see a Portal card again for most of the game and may get stuck with a Dungeon you don't much care for.
2)  After you shuffle the whole big deck of Door cards, shuffle the Portal cards into just the top [insert your favorite fraction here] part of the Door cards.  Top half, top third, maybe?  This way the Portal cards are mixed in relatively close to the top and are sure to be drawn often throughout the game.  The problem with this is that, if you want to continue to do this, you have to go through the deck after every game and pull out all the Portal cards so that they can be shuffled into the top portion of the deck for the next game.  Otherwise, they'll be all mixed in after the first time you do this.

Option 1 is not much fun when you have 500+ Door cards diluting the handful of Portal cards.  Option 2 is a royal pain to deal with before and after every game (but it's great during the game.)

If you're working with a smaller deck (my condolences), this may not be such a big deal.  After playing with these cards a few times, though, we just leave them in the box now.  Not really worth it.  In the immortal words of Dennis Miller, though, that's just my opinion; I could be wrong.

Munchkin 6 is still good, just not quite as aweso--",3.0

"The cards themselves are great. In addition to the normal 52, there are 2 informational cards and 1 featuring L.I. Cohen branding - these 3 extras can be used as jokers if needed, as the backs match the deck.

However, I was very disappointed that the barcode sticker was applied directly to the box and can't be removed without leaving sticky residue.",3.0

the bid cards are made of cardboard. other games we've seen the bid units are made of durable plastic,3.0
We have been playing Wizard weekly since New Year's Eve 2007. We usually replace the game set every year and have seen many changes in the design of the cards and bid counters over the years. The cards in this set are our favorite but the cardboard bid counters are cheap and do not hold the spinner piece tight  enough. The previous plastic design did break fairly easily but still preferred over this design.,3.0
very disappointed in cardboard counters....turning mechanism was too loose. We were expecting the quality of the original plastic counters!!!!,3.0
"The devices to select you bid for ticks to be taken were cardboard, not as expected.",3.0
"I was disappointed that the 'clickers' were made from cardboard unlike the plastic ones in original set we purchased. They work fine unlike the plastic ones that quit clicking and only spun. So, guess that's the reason they changed.",3.0
The game itself is still fun. I was disappointed in the individual game betters being changed from plastic to hard cardboard. I bought the deluxe since it is easier to play using the individual game betters than keeping track on paper  the different bids people made.,3.0
I ordered the deluxe game to get the bid indicators. The problem I had was the #'s were to small for any one to see .,3.0
"I bought this because of notalgia.  I was a huge fan of Robotech back when it was first aired in the U.S., loved the RPG, and figured this would be a decent buy.  The models are in a lot of tiny pieces that aren't exactly high-quality molding.  It can take a bit of work to get the bits to fit together, in many cases more than a GW Finecast model (For those that know the struggle of putting one of those together).  Lots of sprue, lots of filing/sanding work.
The box does come with everything needed for a 2-player game though, but it definitely takes some time to get to table as you have to assemble both armies.  If you're looking for a game to play out of the box, you might want to give this one a pass.  If you're an avid modeler who likes a challenge though, this game will give you that.",3.0
"The rules for this game are actually pretty darn good. If you've played 40K or other miniatures battle games, you will be right at home.

Unfortunately, putting together the 34 minis requires a ton of glue and a lot of patience. If you don't have modeling experience, you will be in for a shock. This will scare most gamers away and may even stop this good game from gaining critical mass. Palladium really screwed up with these minis. However, if you can get them put together, the minis are gorgeous, and the games is very fun to play.

The rulebook is a little rough around the edges, but the artwork is awesome. Robotech fans will love this!

At this juncture, most of the mecha and infantry in the rulebook have not been released, and may never see the light of day. It seems like Palladium is on the fence, and may or may not release more minis for this game. It could be DOA, but I hope not.",3.0
"Fast shipping and delivery
Like the stamps but have to be careful not to let the ink get on the background. Sometimes leaves smudges. Overall I'm happy with this purchase.",3.0
The shipping was sub-par. The tin was mailed in a light mailer and the tin was damaged. :(  But the contents were fine. I do love the little glittery cards with stamps and labels. So retro and sweet!,3.0
"The basic concept of this game is great for preschoolers who love Pete the Cat.  The execution, though, could be improved.  The spinner is attached to the board so the board does not lay flat.  The markers are attached to very small bases and thus fall over easily on the wobbly board.  Part of the game involves exchanging button jars among players.  This is awkward for preschoolers when they have lots of buttons;  it would be easier if each jar were a little box or container of some kind.  Even with these problems, my 3 yr. old loved the game.  With changes, a good game could become a great game.",3.0
"I've been a fan of mystery puzzles for years.  Although assembling the jigsaw puzzle is entertaining, the story itself, particularly its resolution, is very disappointing.

If you are looking for any sort of a satisfying mystery, you will be let down.  If you are looking for a fun jigsaw to pass a few hours, you will be quite satisfied.  It's just a shame that the strength between the mystery and the jigsaw puzzle couldn't have been more balanced.",3.0
"My family was very motivated to solve the mystery. However , there were 9 pieces missing from the puzzle, cannot recommend this puzzle.",3.0
"It was fun to put together, no photos to copy, but solving the mystery was somewhat dull. The story was quite predictable!",3.0
"The puzzle is very fun to put together-- enough distinctive colors, with challenging ""same color"" spots. Just wish the mystery wasn't SO easy to figure out just from reading the booklet. I suggest doing the puzzle first, examining it, and then reading the story for this one.",3.0
Bought for Pre-K boy whose class mascot is Pete the Cat. The game pieces are thick cardboard and it is extremely hard to get them into the slots on the plastic holders. It took three adults almost 15 frustrating minutes and a couple of the pieces got bent and mangled at the bottom. The board has already started to come apart at the folded seam after less than 3 months of use. The concept of the game is good but the quality of the game itself is 'meh'.,3.0
this wasn't as cool as i thought it would be.  we used it once or twice and it now sits untouched.,3.0
"The stuffed kitty arrive on time and in pristine condition.  It looks like the kitty in the books and is an excellent teaching companion to the story.

"Cute character not very fuzzy. I thought it would be soft but it was well made and stiff. If you just want it to display with the book, I would recommend it. It arrived when I expected it.",3.0
"I ordered this as a stocking stuffer for our daughter. The stuffed animal version definitely looks like the book counterpart. The animal itself is not made of very high quality materials. It is small and stuffed tightly so not really huggable at all, the materals are not soft - kind of reminds me of a more detailed version of something you'd win at a carnival. BUT - if you have a big bad kitty fan in your household he might be worth the expense. I am not sure I'd buy this again if I had a do-over. He sits pretty much ignored in a toy bin since Christmas - because it isn't huggable or playable - I mean what else can you do with it?",3.0
Cheaply made with cheap fabric/materials for the price.  Too bad considering it is a great character to go with the books.,3.0
"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter who is in love with Pete the cat right now. It's good enough to make her happy but from a parents perspective it is overpriced for what you get! Only one button ""pops"" off attached to a string. The other three are firmly attached. Considering this puppet is supposed to go with the story where all the buttons come off I am a little annoyed by this. I think I will probably modify it so all of the buttons can come off but are still attached by a string and are held in place by Velcro like the other button.
In my opinion, if your child absolutely LOVES Pete the cat like my daughter then maybe it is worth it especially if you are able to modify it, but otherwise I wouldn't spend more than maybe $10 on this puppet.",3.0
"This is a cute puppet, and since the books/songs are so interactive, we get a lot of use out of the puppet. I wish that all the buttons came off, though - you can't act out the song if Pete only loses one button!",3.0

"Cute puppet! However, this little guy is not made to stand up to rough toddlers. The material is flimsy and his legs are sewn on by only a few threads.

Price is not bad, but you get what you pay for in terms of quality.",3.0

"These were fine to include with the Llama Llama books, but for just play time they're rather cheaply made. I wouldn't have bought them just for the doll itself. I wouldn't recommend it for children under three because of the small teddy bear that can become detached and the pajamas aren't very sturdy for little ones trying to undress them.",3.0

"These are not bad, but the velcro on the palms of monkeys' hands that is supposed to hold them together does not. If you are not going to use them in that manner then these finger puppets are fine otherwise. They are nicely made, good quality, but the velcro is my main issue with them.",3.0
"Gifted to grandson but parents are just as enamored and love the ambience it creates. I think I bought 4 or 5 of them because I reordered for other grandchildren. Whatever you do, don't open it up without putting batteries in before it gets wet. We ruined the first one not realizing this. My daughter just told me that the one I gave her died because it got water inside (when cared for properly) she even glued it trying to keep it dry inside. She thinks it might have gotten in through the switch. If this product could stay dry inside at least until batteries died, I would give it a 5 star rating.",3.0
"These are really cute, but are not finger puppets by my definition. They are velcroed together, and aren't made to fit on fingers. When I tried to use them to do ""Five Little Monkeys"" it was awkward to have to pull off each monkey and put it behind me and very hard to hold up together. Cute but not finger puppets.",3.0
"The monkeys' size is too small to play, much less than what i expected. The finger can't be inserted from behind inside and it might tear in if anyone try to enter by force. Otherwise the product is good but I gave this rating because of the size.",3.0
These puppets are super cute and I would say well made. The kids love when I pull them out to play with them. I have an in home daycare and let them take turns taking one of the puppets off my fingers as we sing the song.

Picked up the 2nd edition of Gloom: Unhappy Homes at the same time as the core game. I've found that the expansion doesn't add as much to the game as I hoped it would but it's nice to have never the less. Unhappy Homes (2nd Edition) had some of the same issues the core game did. Smudged text and cloudy plastic that made it hard to see the card underneath.,3.0
"The WOW board game is a well put together game overall, and relatively fun to play... at first.

I'm not going to rehash the points made by the other reviewers, as they are valid, but the overall experience is what leads me with a middle of the road review.

The game is great from the standpoint that you incorporate RPG elements in ""building"" your character... the quests and items all lend a distinct flavor to the game, but the mechanics of the game are what drag down the rating.

From a fun factor standpoint (which is why we play GAMES, no?) the game drags you along for a 4+ hour ride.  At first, it is relatively enjoyable.. but eventually the game wears thin and gets repetitive.  VERY repetitive, despite the various quests.

Eventually it becomes not much more than a turn-swapping, roll massive amounts of dice ordeal.  Combine this with one ""slow"" player or a ""tactically slow/meticulous"" player and you could find yourself waiting in excess of 20 minutes for a turn to come up.

The beginning of the game moves quickly, but as the mechanics stay the same and the game does not mature with the character progression, the game is doomed by folks waiting on line for a turn.  It almost seems as if the game can be played independently from the other players save when a PvP element is introduced into play.  Based on this standpoint, luck is often the determining factor in who is the victor (who drew the better cards, strategy aside).

So it's good, it's long, and then it gets strained... and eventually the strain saps the fun out a promising idea.",3.0
"Something of a weak expansion - it mostly results in one player having to run laps around the expansion board having Arkham encounters, and never getting to go into any other worlds. By far my least favorite of the three expansions that add an extra board to the game.",3.0
"The idea of rifts, while interesting, are havoc causing and not in a good way. The two times I have used this expansion this mechanic hosed players with monsters to the point where they abandoned Kingsport all together.",3.0
"Tons of new cards, characters and baddies make it a must buy for AH fanatics.  However, the portals mechanic leaves much to be desired.  Essentially one player ends up babysitting the expansion board most of the game which after several play through we have found to be an extremely boring job.  We often just include the new characters and monsters now and don't use the expansion board.  If you are looking to add on to AH, make sure you pick up Dunwich Horror first before grabbing KH.",3.0
"It's hardly a game, more like, follow the board and hope luck actually moves you along. You don't really ever make game changing decisions. I've played it about 6 times and have never been able to win with my friend helping (it takes a while and it's discouraging to barely even be able to progress halfway through the game before losing). I can't honestly recommend it.",3.0
"I got this for my wife because she loves co-op games. You play as 2-5 hobbits (Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, and Fatty) trekking across Middle Earth to destroy the Ring. Different players have the opportunity to be the ring-bearer for a round, which mostly consists of trying not to die, since all the players will lose if the current ring-bearer dies.

The game has lots of components, each with their own rules. Casual gamers will find themselves quickly confused with all the symbols and terms (as I discovered with my family). Those who have played a few Fantasy Flight (or similar) games won't have much trouble picking it up.

In the game, each player has some key decisions to make which generally consist of either playing cards, drawing cards, or moving your hobbit further away from Sauron's evil influence. The ring-bearer can also put the ring on once per ""conflict"" (there are four conflicts) but this is risky and the game pretty much dictates the exact moment the ring should be put on. Deviating from this seems to only lower your chance of winning. There is also a way to summon Gandalf for help in different ways throughout the game.

Aside from these few decisions, the game pretty much plays itself, and it's very luck-heavy without much you can do to counteract the luck element. You'll be drawing tiles and rolling a die, and if each hobbit ends up drawing several bad tiles in a row, and/or rolls poorly, then you're just going to lose the game without any say in it. Even the very last part of the game (destroying the ring) comes down to dice rolls. Imagine playing for 90 minutes and it comes down to ""If you roll a 0-1 you win, if you roll anything else you lose"".

The game does, however, have a decent theme and some neat nice art on the components, even if they are all just cardboard.

Pros:
Co-op
Not super difficult to learn
Nice theme

Cons:
Very luck-heavy
Not very many significant decisions to make",3.0
The moon jar does a great job of beginning to teach good money behavior at a very early age.  The color coordinated sections are fun to play with.,4.0
"This is a great item for teaching children about money. My daughter still puts way too much in the ""spend"" section as opposed to the other two, but she's learning! I just wish the sections were a little bigger. It doesn't hold as much as I'd like it to hold...",4.0
"Ticket to ride can be played from 3 players on up and has quite a bit of strategy needed to win. However if you are young, you can still play by tying to create just the trips you get.  The game will start slow, but the choice of one of three actions you can do can make turns happen quickly once everyone understands the basic rules.

As you get better at the game you find that there several different methods you can use to win, such as picking up extra trips, having the longest continuous train(or route). Hiding where you want to go, or trying to create the longing train from several directions at once.

With all the pieces in the game (each player starts with 45 train pieces) there is the possibility that you may loose some of the them. Its all ok as long as everyone starts with the same number of train elements.  You can modify the game to make it go faster by having less pieces be used and can even do a team type game where you split a color between two team mates.

The counter board for the score that goes around the table is clever and works very well.  It makes keeping track of the score counting easier..

Its a very good game to have.",4.0

"Love the game. A little spendy, and for the price paid it should include the 1910 expansion set. I bought those seporately It is a very fun family game.",4.0
"As a whole this is a great game.  It is very simple for new players to learn yet allows for advanced play and strategy for veteran players.  Every game is different due to the randomization of the tickets.  My 10 year old loves playing it with me.  I've taken the game to family gatherings and it is an easy to get everyone to play because it is so easy for new players to pick up yet has plenty to offer for experienced players.

I was concerned ordering online and having the game delivered due to complaints of damaged boxes and the like.  I'm very protective of my stuff and want to keep it in mint condition.  My game arrived if flawless condition.  It shipped in an over-sized box with ample packaging materials.

While I think the game is great there are a few minor things that prevent me from giving it 5 stars.
The board doesn't lay completely flat.  It appears as if the board seams are too tight preventing it from laying flat.  I'm hoping over time it will flatten out more.
I may be spoiled from playing my friends 10th Anniversary Edition of Ticket To Ride but the color and ticket cards are just too small.  They are hard to hold onto and even harder to shuffle.  The 10 Anniversary Edition has full-sized playing cards which are much easier to handle.  The card storage in the box also doesn't make sense to me.  The way the plastic box insert is molded all of the colored cards can't be stacked together.  You must separate part of them and put them into the same stack with the ticket cards.  This seems like a minor thing but it would have been so simple for them to fix it by making one of the stack spots a bit deeper in the plastic insert.",4.0

"This game is great for an adult night in with friends, and my 9 year old has a blast playing a grown-up game with her parents too.

"Fun game, got it for the kids for Christmas.  Scoring is sometimes hard to keep accurate (1 train is 1 point, 6 train is 15), but you can rescore at the end too.  Game took 5 people, 3 hours to complete our first time, but we also didn't know what we were doing and had to reread instructions. Overall a great game.",4.0
"The game itself is great. I found the manufacturing quality to be quite sub-par. As other reviews have mentioned, the board doesn't quite lay flat. Also, the cards are insanely small making them very hard to shuffle. My Grandfather had trouble playing because he couldn't read the destination cards because of the size. I'd guess it was done as a cost-cutting measure, which is sad given the retail price of this game.",4.0
"The game gets 5 stars.  The seller we bought it from sent us one where the game board was not stuck on completely correct.  It has bunching up in a couple of places around the border.

"This game is so much fun, definitely a favorite in our home! Only complaint is that some of the cards are printed incorrectly. On the route cards are written two destinations you're supposed to get to, but the picture of the route is supposed to show two dots on the map where those two places are and most of them are wrong! So that's kind of sketchy but it's not that big of a problem! Still would totally recommend this game, its awesome!",4.0

I've always loved this game and I finally gave in and bought myself a copy. The game arrived fairly quickly and now I play it non-stop. The reason I'm giving it four stars is because my game board won't completely lay down flat  and when I received it two of the corners of the box were already ripped which was annoying. But overall everything else was fine and its still a great game.,4.0
We received the game on time but missing pieces. It's a fun game and easy to learn. I wish that the cards were bigger because they are hard to read.,4.0

"Fun game to play, but definitely a little complicated to learn the first time you play it.",4.0

"the game is awesome, but I found one black broken train such a racist",4.0
"It's a bit of a slow-paced game where not a lot happens for a while. Your turn is either spent drawing cards or building trains. You need to play as many color cards as the trains connecting two cities indicate. Good for starting or ending a game night, because you can hold a conversation while playing. Easy to learn, might be a good game for those with kids? Personally I like games that move a bit faster or are a little more complex.",4.0
"Great game; very entertaining.  Only problem was that the game came with the wrong number of colored train cars.  You're supposed to have 45 per color, however, we received odd numbers for all colors.  For example, we received only 44 reds but 50 blues.",4.0

The directions are a bit complicated in my opinion and we really didn't know how to start playing until we watched a you tube video.  But once you figure that piece out, it's easy.",4.0

"I like the European version better, but this is an easier version that is still fun.",4.0
"This game is a blast.  Its repeatability is high, among games like Monopoly.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons:

1 - There is only 5 players maximum. The board could accomodate 1 more player. I know that does not seem like a big difference, but in the play and flow of the game, having 1 more player could make this game even tighter and more competetive, forcing players to have more strategy in picking their routes.
2 - The instructons for this game are very long and repetetive, and even somewhat confusing. It all makes sense after you get through a few rounds of turns, but at first the instructions leave players looking for a simpler bullet list of ""how to"".

Other than this, the game is near perfection.",4.0

The nostalgic train theme is probably more attractive to older adults, but curious younger folks might find it engaging too.",4.0

"What a very interesting game! I enjoyed it with my husband and older boys. My eight-year-old didn't catch on so quick, so I had to play for two people. The only problem we have is not having more destination tickets. After a couple of games, it gets pretty boring trying to find the same roads over and over. I hope there is more destination tickets we can buy to make the game not as familiar. Overall, a great and interesting bored game for a family game night.",4.0
"Great game for 2-4 players.  Change of rules can give different spin on game.  Recommend as a entertaining game for adults.  Only downside is the size of the cards, which are very small and difficult to shuffle and handle.  They offer a larger deck with the expansion but you need to invest another $27-$35 for those.  Almost seems as intentional that the original deck was so much smaller, as you would spend the extra $$$ to correct this issue.  Otherwise, I would give this 5 stars as it is very addicting.",4.0
We had fun playing this after we figured it out. We found a video on youtube that helped clarify things. It actually is a lot simpler than it appears at first. It does require strategy and/or luck. My 8yo son didn't enjoy it at first but now he's liking it more and more.,4.0

It would be nice if they could do a special deal where you could by the full sized card with the game with even just a little discount... like $50.,4.0
"We got this game as a Christmas gift, and have enjoyed playing it numerous times already. It has similarities to Monopoly and Risk---collect cards, claim your ground, earn points---but the overall strategy is learned easily and the game can be completed in less time. We'll probably try the European version of this game after mastering this one.

You win the game by scoring the most points, and points can be earned in several ways: completing a preassigned start-to-finish destination route (Chicago-->L.A., for example), claiming smaller routes between different cities, creating the longest continuous route on the board. Some achievements are worth more than others, so prioritizing your moves is a must!

One note about gameplay: the board has the train routes marked in colors, and a few were ""too similar"" for a slightly colorblind guy in the house to discern easily. It's nice that the game makers also tagged the routes and playing cards with a unique symbol for each color, problem solved!",4.0
"This should be on most every ""typical family"" game shelf. Replaces the slot usually reserved for the ubiquitous monopoly board with a board game whose competitive gameplay keeps every player involved for the duration of the game. Unlike monopoly, game length shouldn't unnecessarily drag on (if you're taking more than an hour or two you might be doing it wrong). Gameplay works for 2-5 players but this board shines at 3-5 players (for a great 2-player variant try the Nordic Countries box).

Add the 1910 card expansion pack right away for higher quality cards and a pile of destination tickets that will ensure that every game feels different.",4.0
"This game is a blast!! My husband and I find ourselves playing a few games a night when we aren't bringing it over to a friends place for game night. My only complaint about the game is that the cards are very small. I purchased the expansion pack and the cards are the same, but double the size. It's an affordable upgrade.",4.0
Really fun game to play with 2 or more people! Can be intense but still easy to learn!,4.0
"This is a good game, with a few caveats: first, forget about the theme of a seven-day contest, or a million-dollar prize. There is none of that in the game, so it's a bit misleading.  There is a map with various cities with routes between them.  Some routes have double tracks so that more than one player can claim that section of the route when they put their train pieces on it.  You have to collect enough cards which match the color of the section of route on the board in order to claim that section.  It does take a bit of strategy, and some luck. I was a bit disappointed because I thought there would be more to the game - for example, that you might learn something interesting about the cities on the route.  The last time we played, I tried to make it more interesting by making players offer or look up a fact about one of the cities whenever they completed a route. I thought that made it more fun, but my son complained because it made an already-long game take more time.  And it is a pretty long game.  My daughter, who is six, plays this game with us, but she doesn't like to strategize to complete the route cards, so she just places pieces wherever she can complete a section.  You can play the game this way if you want to, just causing havoc by blocking other people.  She sometimes gets bored and quits before the game is over.  We all enjoy games like Catan or Forbidden Desert better, as there is more happening in the game.  This is not a game to make you laugh or foster family communication or creativity.",4.0
"After the first couple of times playing this game, I was surprised by its simplicity. I heard it was a very popular board game among the gaming community, so expected something a little more complex. This is a game I now share with my friends who are less enthusiastic about board games. It involves more strategy than a standard, mainstream game, but is simple enough to learn and play all in one sitting without being frustrated. If you play with a variety of friends, the game has more replay value. If you typically play with the same crowd, expect to get bored relatively quickly if you don't buy any of the expansion packs.

My only complaint on the quality of the game is in the game board; I cannot get ours to lie flat on the table! This usually results in a little bit of shifting of pieces during play. It's nothing we can't work around, but I am not sure if this problem is consistent across all or if ours is just slightly off.",4.0
"Highly recommend for age 6+. This set has smallish cards, otherwise it would be 5 stars. There are expansion packs with bigger cards.",4.0
"With an instruction booklet that could fit inside a fortune cookie yet high replay value, this is as elegant as it comes for a Euro game. While I'm not always willing to play this game if other options are available, this is one that keeps the barrier to entry fairly low and therefore succeeds with all audiences, even those that might only be casual tabletop fans, without exchanging too much in the way of depth and mechanical soundness.

The gameplay consists of drawing cards, and playing sets of cards for points - to complete other objective cards for connecting cities across the map. Getting routes completed requires an ability to be able to conceptualize a perhaps-winding line of track that makes many stops in unrelated cities because either the other player blocked you from a direct connection or because you're going for the longest continuous route (which is worth 10 points at the end of the game) or because you want to rack up points for laying big routes.

If I had any complaint to make about the game, it is that even though there is a bit of flexibility on picking up route cards, if you get skunked with a bunch of faraway and distant routes that are difficult to connect, it's going to severely hamper your ability to win the game. The designers mitigate the randomness by allowing you to toss one of the three starting routes away, but if you do, of course you may be at a disadvantage against another player that picked three great routes with proximity to each other.

But even setting aside that reservation, it is played in a decent length of time, it tells a story with the trains sprawling all across the board and it is engaging for a casual crowd without being too boring for a tabletop veteran. There is a reason why this game has millions in sales. It delivers a crisp package in as short a route as possible.",4.0
This is a great game. We have enjoyed playing this game and we have introduced it to our friends.,4.0
Family enjoys this game!,4.0
"This is a great game for almost all ages. I like it because there is some strategy involved within it, deciding what kind of routes you want to build, if you want to successfully take more tickets, and competing against other players. It only took about two times going around the table before I was able to play this game without any questions and feeling confident in my abilities. I've seen very young kids (about six) play along with adults in the adult version, so don't worry about it being too difficult and only for adults.

Basics of the game: Draw various routes between two cities that you need to complete for points. There are only select routes between certain cities, and various distances so it can make it difficult if people end up taking your route. Everyone has different colored trains you use to designate your routes. The amount of routes you have, the completed or uncompleted tickets all affect the points at the end of the game.

Although I do enjoy the other Ticket to Rides more, such as the European version, this one is still fun.",4.0

Fun family board game. It really only took one play through for all of our kids to really understand and like this game.

"We are a family of board gamers. TTR USA is simple to learn and play. My two boys 7 and 9 year olds pick up the game easily. However, it is IMHO pretty predictable after a few games - you sort of can remember what routes you used to build and hence can guess what your fellow game mate is attempting to plan. it isn't as complicated nor challenging as our fave game - Settlers of Catan. But it doesnt take as much time to finish a game as Catan does. Overall, on its own, it is a game easy enough to provide family fun or among friends and my kids after playing a few times, are able to set up the game and play with other kids without supervision or guidance. But for me, it doesn't have the ""oomph"" factor like Catan. That's because I am a Catan die heart.",4.0

"Our family has played this several times.  After a couple trial rounds, we managed to get the hang of it and had lots of laughs.",4.0
"Pros: Quick turns, it isn't over till it's over
Cons: Can be repetitive

Game play is pretty simple: you start with some secret tickets with cities on them that you have to connect together to get points; then you either draw cards, build with the cards in your hand, or get more tickets. That's the whole game.

I'll start by saying that I'm a fan of more complicated games like Agricola (my favorite at the time of writing) or Pandemic, so the lack of options is a bit uninteresting to me. That said, I still enjoy playing Ticket to Ride. I like to compare it to Catan, because a lot of people looking into board games have some experience with that one. You are collecting resources in order to build around other players and get the most points. In Ticket to Ride, the resources are colored trains, and you're building stretches of railroad that are worth certain amounts of points. In Catan, you roll dice to determine what resources you get. In Ticket to Ride, you draw from a deck (you can choose from 5 cards that you can see, or take random cards). I like this because you have control over what you receive, where as in Catan, if the dice are not in your favor, you're out of luck. For this reason though, there is no trading in Ticket to Ride. This also means that turn length is cut to a minimum. No one is asking for cards or taking resources and then building something. All you can do is draw or build. It is hard to find something bad to say about this game, but that would be my one complaint: it can get repetitive since your're doing the same thing every turn.

This does, however, make the game go at a faster pace than the games I usually like, which can be refreshing. Even though there isn't much variation on what to do each turn, you still have to form a strategy. You can keep an eye on who is building where, and what color train cards they are picking up. Then you can either try to cut them off or make a move so they don't cut you off. You can try to build the longest track to get more points up front, or get more tickets to get more hidden points.

Because of these secret tickets you get, no one knows for sure how many points each player has until the very end when the game is over. At this point, everyone reveals their tickets and the final scores are tallied. This is another thing I like about Ticket to Ride in comparison to Catan. In Catan it can come to a point where defeat is almost certain, but in Ticket to Ride I've been in dead last when the game ends, but end up winning because I had some high scoring tickets that I had connected. This helps players stay involved the whole game, which is important to any game, in my opinion.

While not a game I would've chosen initially, this is certainly a very fun and fast paced game that most people should enjoy.",4.0

"My first time playing Ticket To Ride was the Europe version. After playing the This version, I wished I had the Europe edition. I like the train stations and the tunnels. The game still has the charm and fun.",4.0
"So here's the deal this game is super fun just like everybody says so don't think my less than 5 star review indicates anything but that.  We play it as a family and both the parents and the kids get really into it. High play and replay-ability, quick to learn but a LIFETIME TO MASTER and all that stuff like you'd expect based on everyone raving about it.

Observations / suggestions / etc:
 - Requires a fairly big surface area given lots of cards and lots of pieces are part of this game
 - Gameplay is super fast, you can get around the horn very quickly (4 players can play in 30 seconds total if they all just draw cards), so don't think you're going to be getting up to get a drink after your turn or anything.  Or checking phones seriously just put them away.  Good to agree on a set ""break time"" or something
 - Total game time is also pretty fast but not silly fast.  An hour or 90 minutes or so.
 - If you play with people who are sneaky you should think about wearing sunglasses so they can't see where you are looking on the board because it might give away your strategy if they could tell where you are focusing
 - If you're playing against people who don't wear sunglasses try and watch their eyes so you can see where they are looking, it may give away their strategy and you can swoop in and take their routes and win the game that'll teach them
 - The spot labeled Duluth is clearly in Minneapolis/St Paul and *everyone* who you play with from Minnesota will point it out
 - I recommend some sort of ""card holder"" thing if you play with younger kids and/or people with smaller hands.  We have some wooden boards with slots cut in them to hold cards and they help a ton in this game (and others). I put a picture of that up.

My only real critique of this game - and the reason it's 4 not 5 stars - is the board doesn't sit especially flat.  You can see in the pictures I attached.  At times you have what seems like a million little trains on the board and just having the board not sit flat makes it seem a bit cheap. This is all about MANUFACTURING quality however, not about GAMEPLAY quality.",4.0

Got this as a gift. Game is a lot of fun. I gave it 4 stars because there will come a point after a lot of play where you can figure out the destination cards other players have based on where they are placing their routes and can quickly block them. So there is a upper replay value limit for the experienced crowd. This game is a lot of fun though as I said. Can't wait till my kids are a little older so I can play it with them and hopefully teach them some geography at the same time.,4.0
"This is a good family game, easy to learn, and straightforward to play.  Also helpful in teaching US geography (and a few Canadian cities).  Our family enjoys playing it.

This game plays well for our kids (8 and up) who are generally experienced with games.  The concepts are not too difficult, and the gameplay is competitive, but not cutthroat.

It wouldn't be a huge problem production-wise to make standard size playing cards, which would be easier to handle, pick up, and more importantly, to shuffle.

"... not because it's not a great gateway game, but because there's an even better version out there.

The beauty of vanilla Ticket to Ride is its simplicity and accessibility for players of all ages and experience levels. Players can take one of three actions on a turn - take train cards (to build routes in the future), take destination tickets (to acquire new points scoring objectives), or claim routes by using the appropriate set of train cards (to score points and progress against objectives). The winner is the player that accumulates the most points for building routes and linking specific cities from their destination objectives. This simplicity allows the game to move at a very fast clip because players have usually chosen their action by the time their turns come around. However, this simplicity does not obviate the need for strategic play. Players will need to effectively balance long-term and short-term objectives, while keeping an eye on their opponents to stay one step ahead. The best part of Ticket to Ride is that you'll find yourself feeling like a powerful, cunning railroad magnate as you complete routes and destination tickets. In the end, it won't matter whether you win or lose because you'll have had an absolute blast.

It's little wonder that 'Ticket to Ride' is one of the most well-known and beloved gateway games. You can't go wrong by picking this one up, but I would highly recommend opting for 'Ticket to Ride: Europe' instead. The 'Europe' variant is superior in almost every way -- a better designed map and additional gameplay mechanisms that add strategic depth, mitigate randomness, and increase overall replayability and enjoyment.

Pros:
+ Extremely elegant gameplay mechanics
+ Perfect for play with kids or inexperienced gamers
+ Players feel a sense of accomplishment even if they don't win
+ Moves at a fast clip; players quickly get into the groove of pre-planning their turn
+ Beautiful board game with high quality, colorful game components
+ Just enough decision making and trade-offs for a gateway game

Cons:
- 'Ticket to Ride: Europe' is superior in almost every way
- Train and railroad theme is not for everyone
- Location names can be difficult to read across the table
- Luck of the draw can make a very big impact in regards to destination tickets
- Very little player interaction
- Works ok with 2 players, but it's not as engaging",4.0

My children (ages 12-18) and we the parents enjoy this game. It was easy to understand and was pretty quick paced. We purchased this off of a recommendation of a friend of ours. Not bad. Looking for something that was different than your normal board games and we ordered this one and Catan.,4.0
"This was the first game I played as an adult that really launched me into the ventures of board games.  Truly a gateway game, my wife and I still play this from time to time.  The game doesn't take too long at all and the objective cards keep each game just different enough for you to want to play just one more time.

Each player with  choose a color of plastic train tokens, be dealt ticket cards, which will be your main objective for the game, and dealt train cards.  The train cards are your resource for laying down your trains and making long windy connections all across the board.  The player with the highest point total at the end of the game is declared the winner.

PROS:  The board looks great and the cities aren't too hard to find.  I've heard many families play this with their children to help them learn cities of the United States.  The plastic trains are sturdy and not flimsy in any way.  The game can take anywhere from 30-60 minutes.  The fact that this is considered a gateway game is great if you are looking to introduce some of your non board game friends into the glorious world of board gaming.

CONS:  The cards are small, Very small.  The expansion 1910 gives you bigger playing cards to use which I do in fact use, but that's another expense.  I really wish the big cards were already in the base game.  While strategy is present, if you play with the max amount of players, the board gets filled up fast and you can get cut of from your routes very quickly.  If that happens many people get into the ""I've already lose"" frame of mind and it can be boring for that person the rest of the way.  This has only happened one time though.

"Very fun game to play with younger children (9+) but I wouldn't say it's the best for adults. It lacks a directly competitive and cooperative aspect from other games and it is very chance driven. That being said, it flexes decision timing skills and adapting strategies to changing scenarios.",4.0
"Pretty fun game. There are different strategies but there are a couple that are more dominant, so if you play with the same people they also realize this.",4.0
Long time to process an ship.  Other than that the game is great.,4.0
Great game. Way overpriced at over $30,4.0
Not as complicated as some of the others.  I got the rules ok even with a migraine headache.  It was fun to play especially when you have a smug 5 year old that trash mouths.,4.0
"Great game, works for all ages.  Has strategy and is insanely easy to pick up.  It's a great game to own as a gateway to harder board games.",4.0
"Hey, this is really fun! I do take issue with the assertion that the game can be learned ""in 5 minutes,"" though. For our family if was more like 15 or 20. Not that it's difficult, but it does take some time to read through the rules and understand the setup and game instructions. Once we got rolling, though, it was a lot of fun, and I can see why it's so popular. We have young kids (7 and 10) who both picked it up (the 7 yo with some help) and who are looking forward to playing again. Our only complaint is that the train map labels Minneapolis, MN as Duluth? I guess they didn't think map accuracy was terribly critical. It doesn't impact the game in any way, it's just a weird thing to get wrong.",4.0
This is a very fun game! It is great for small groups (five or less) who enjoy strategy. My only complaint is that the box arrived damaged.,4.0
"I consider myself a tabletop gamer and this is one of my favorite games and here's why it takes less than two minutes to learn and it's fun.
those who reviewed it and said they couldn't figure it out wouldn't know how to tie their own shoes!  it's extremely simple you take one of three actions on your turn, you draw 2 train cards, build a train route between two cities or you pick up ""ticket cards"" which gives you another route between cities you must complete before the game ends or else you lose those points...it's that simple! whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins!",4.0
"For me anyhow,,it was complicated.",4.0
This game is a little confusing at first but very fun. It's not too long. Excellent for game nights.,4.0
After you play this you'll love it but wish you had bought the Europe edition because of the way it distributes long and short routes.,4.0
Awesome,4.0
"Love the game, the cards are too small and hard to shuffle, hard to read",4.0
"This game is a lot of fun and we have played it with board gamers and non-board gamers with positive outcomes each time. Only negative is that it does get repetitive after a few plays and you can quickly devise strategies that will easily help you win. There are expansion packs for it that might make it a bit more difficult or more fun, but we haven't tried this.

If you're looking for an easy to get into, relaxed game then try it out. You'll probably enjoy it.",4.0
Fun easy to learn game,4.0
Gift for unknown child at Christmas.,4.0
The game is great family fun.  We play it with our 7 and 9 year old.  The expansion kit is a must. The game cards that come in the box are way to small to use.  That is the only draw back of the game.,4.0
"Fun game for the entire family.  There is a bit more luck involved than I was hoping though.  Sure, there is some strategy involved with how you lay your routes and choose your destination tickets, but in the end you still need the cards.  In the end I'd say it's about 60% luck and 40% strategy, which isn't bad for a card/board game.",4.0
"It's an ok game, great intro for beginners.  Not a lot of conflict or backstabbing, most people have fun with it.

I don't play it as much now because I feel there's not as much replay value in the base game, but will pull it out if there's someone new to board games who is interested in learning.",4.0
"It's a good game.  Easy to play and fun on certain occasions.  My husband really enjoys it, but I prefer something a bit more challenging.  Would be great for kids!",4.0
"I bought this because my adult cognitively disabled son likes trains and because it has favorable reviews. I am pleased with the game: the physical components are solid and attractive (but the train cards are too small to shuffle easily). The rules were clear and we were up and playing with a minimum of effort. The game is simple enough that my son was able to play independently and even win a game, but there is enough variety and challenge to keep adults interested for the course of the game. It takes around an hour for us to play, meaning we can play once or twice in an evening. For an adult it is not an intellectually demanding game; it strikes the right balance between relaxing and entertaining.

If you have been playing standard games like Monopoly and Clue, Ticket to Ride will be an excellent addition to your repertoire. If you're new to boardgaming, it's a good place to start. If you're a hardcore, experienced gamer it probably won't keep you entertained by itself, but it's something you can play with kids and beginners, or just for a little light entertainment. For us, it's hard to find a game that can entertain all of us without being too difficult for an adult with a cognitive disability. Ticket to Ride hits that sweet spot.",4.0
"Great game, good price and quick shipping",4.0
"Great gateway game!!  What that means is this is a great game that you can bring out that will not be overly complex and scare off casual gamers.  My wife and I love to spend time and this game allows us to be able to play and talk about the day while the kiddos are asleep.

This game has been one of those games that our friends and family ask to play again.  To me if someone asks you to play a game again you should look to purchase those games because of the replay-ability maximizing your investment.

2 player games allow you the ability to stay away from each other for the most part but It does extremely stressful with 4 or more players as you will have multiple people not happy you blocked their route early and they have to live with not making their routes :) (Don't let 4-5 players stop you from playing though)

Great game and look for it to play with family.  And I would recommend it if you need a list of games to start your collection.  This game really can compliment other games such as Worker Placement (Carcasonne or Settlers), Deck Building (Dominion), Co-op (Anything Matt Leacock), etc.  This doesn't duplicate and load you down on any genre that you have really.

Pros
* Great replay-ability
* Great for 2 and works with more
* Great Gateway game to introduce people to board games
* Easy enough to talk and play
* People ask to play after the first game :)
Cons
* Warning if you don't like stressful with 4 or more players (if you like stressful GAME ON!)...(Don't let 4-5 players stop you from playing though)",4.0
"Novel and lots of fun!  The number of players is quite limited because of the finite number of tracks available, so be aware of that.  Score-keeping is a bit of a pain, too, especially if you're used to playing the app, which does all of that for you.  But still definitely worth getting if you have a boardgame crowd!",4.0
"My loves trains so we bought this for him as a Christmas present. At first, the instructions were a bit clumsy but once we figured it, it was a fun game. Sort of like Monopoly for trains but perhaps not as intense. Other children who have played it liked it as well.",4.0
Great game.  However it was a little difficult for my 8 year old grandson to play for a while.,4.0
I love this game. :),4.0
I played last night for the first time. Once with 2 players and another time with 3 players. I like it cause the rules are pretty simple and it's fun (maybe it's because I won twice)!  It'll be interesting to play with more than 3 players because I'm pretty sure your routes will get blocked more often. It is a little pricey but the quality is good for what you pay for.,4.0

"This is a tough little game...a real challenge for the 9-year old in my life....and for me, too!",4.0
I gave this game to my nephew for Xmas. The first one he bought for himself and it his car was broken into. This is one of the many board games that he enjoys. He and his brother and my son were playing this game on New Years Day. They enjoyed the game very much.,4.0
"I've played this one plenty of times in the past but decided to get a new copy for myself and my wife (I left my old copy with my ex wife) because I thought it would be great for playing with her family.  Truly this is a great family game with fast play and easy rules, people of all ages can enjoy the game.  That said the rules still have a few errors in them and as always the game is a little predictable without the expansion (you get to know the destinations very rapidly).  Despite these limitations, this is a good game for families and friends.",4.0
Very simplistic yet entertaining.,4.0
"Fun once you get the hang of it.  Family of 5 playing for the first time it was a bit hard with having to explain the details to young kids (7, 9, and 10 years).  Once we finished though they said they enjoyed it.  Expensive.",4.0
Love the game but Duluth is in the wrong place.,4.0
Great game for a wide age group.,4.0
"We love the Ticket to Ride U.S.A. version.  The Europe game is similar...a few differences,  but the biggest difference is trying to find the cities with European names.  It'll be good for learning places in Europe but definitely more challenging when you're teaching someone how to play the game.",4.0
"Fun, But I like Settlers of Catan better",4.0
We LOVE this game! It's really such a blast to play. We saw it on Table Top and had to have it. We also purchased it for my niece is is on the spectrum for autism. We did our research and it's a great game for any age.,4.0
"So much fun! I got this for my parents for Christmas and we played a couple games as a family. At first I thought it might be boring, but it gets entertaining and calls for a bit of a strategy. Definitely recommended for game nights.",4.0
GIft for a 9YO boy.  Will take them a bit to learn but will be a great game for a long time.  Note:  Lots of little parts.,4.0
"We have had Ticket to Ride for a couple of years, and its a popular request for game night at our house.  Our friends with kids love it just as much as the grown ups.  This most recent purchase was a gift, for a family kids ranging in age from 7 to15. Highly recommended!",4.0
This game is very enjoyable but only offers a handful of different game play strategies.  A main complaint among the other participants (All over the age of 30) is that it is not a very complex game.  It seems like it would be a wonderful item for a group that has child-aged children (rather than parents who are in their 60s and kids who are in their 30s) because the concepts are fairly easy to grasp.,4.0
One of the top games for beginner gamers.,4.0
