"Lords of Magic looked like a pretty good game when I read the back of the box in the store but I found it to be extremely frustrating when I played it.  It seems as though the computer is starting out with many more  resources because I could never catch up to my neighbors in terms of units  and resources.  Waiting times between turns is way too long, as is waiting  for a unit to heal.  Also the lack of a small map on the bottom of the  screen makes it really hard to orient yourself in the bigger picture.  Also, the map stays basically the same no matter how many times you play.  Sometimes a few things move but basically it's all the same.",2.0
It was predictably cheap in build quality but functional enough that I decided I'd buy another the next day. After about three hours of gameplay the left side of the d-pad stopped working. Junk.,2.0
"Start and Select buttons got embedded into the controller, so I ended up taking it apart in order to get them out and alter the holes so that the buttons wouldn't get stuck. The wires were poorly soldered on, so they ended up coming off of the board almost instantly.",2.0
couldn't use wasted my money they're made only for the Computer,2.0
"Swat 2 is a good follow up tp Police Quest Swat although it does have a very different feel.  Just let me start off by saying this is not an action game.  It is a Command and Conquer style game, without all the kiling.  I  didn't enjoy this game as much as I thought I would.  You command a LAPD  Swat squad.  You control what you need to buy for your squad, and you must  limit how much you buy, because funds are limited.  The graphic side of the  game is poor.  The characters are small and hard to tell apart from the  terrorists.  The game does allow you to take control of the terrorists, but  that part of the game doesn't seemed polished, and plays like they just  threw it together.  The game is very challenging, and you might become a  little frusterated when you have to keep doing the same mission over and  over again and don't exactly know what you did wrong.  The game is not  horrible though, if you liked the Command and Conquer series and enjoy cop  games you will probably enjoy this game.",2.0
Very bad quality poor,2.0
"It functions, so its got that going for itself. It feels very cheap though. Very cheap and hollow. And very light. Noting like a real SNES controller. But I suppose, if you don't care about any of that stuff, it did work. I wouldn't recommend it, though.",2.0
"I've played this game between 10-20 times and when it kept going it was really fun. ""Chaos"" was usually the one I played but ""Life"" was pretty cool too. The battles were pretty good but the AI wasn't all that great. The different characters and units were pretty cool though.

The graphics are so so. They're not terrible but they're not exactly beautiful either.

Unfortunately it crashes after a few minutes or hours so I haven't got to the end of the game ever. I've tried it on two different computers, one being way more poweful than the other one and it just won't play completely on either one. If it'd quit that, it'd be great.",2.0
This is very stiff... like it might not ever get broken in.. sorry I bought it.. it's not what I expected..,2.0
"on the whole this controller is okay, but the d-pad ca be pressed down on all sides at once. That makes it almost unusable.",2.0
This is about as third party and cheap as you can get for an snes controller.. it feels like its going to fall apart in my hands. I don't reccomend this product at all,2.0
It functions. The D-pad and buttons are not nearly as sensitive as an original Snes controller which makes playing certain games pretty difficult. I'd much rather pay more for a better controller than this. It feels pretty cheaply made as well but I guess that's what I get for only paying $5 for a controller.,2.0
"Alpha Centauri fails at providing this game player with any kind of new excitement from Sid Meier. One can appreciate breaking away from the Civ  1/2 games, however the paradigm factions the game is based upon are just  plain atypical and boring.  In effect,  military versus humanists,  microsoft versus professors, etc... kinda like the UN playing ""Lost in  Space.""  Previous Sid Meier games were more tangible, the sci-fi in  this was kinda corny.  I've spent many a sleepless night playing the  previous  Meier games, but this one just seemed ""okay,"" not  spectacular.",2.0
"The reviews of this game looked great and I've enjoyed Civ I, II, & III.  Unfortunately, there was not anything new or interesting in this game.  I found the ""alien"" technology difficult to understand and stragetise.  Civ III is much better.  I am very glad that I did not pay full price for this item.  If you have already played Civ III, do not bother with this game.",2.0
Again another old game that didn't run well under Win xp.  I did manage to get it running a few times with freezes and sluggish fps.  Most of these older games ran under Glide and not Direct X.  Problem the reason it didn't work.,2.0
"I was expecting a lot from this game and EASports disappointed me. This game has less teams than the other, it is not possible to choose the stadium, and the championships like UEFA CUP and another's made it very  bad.",2.0
"Why Americanize the game when it's a world sport?
1)  Commentary just flat out stinks!  Download the English commentary patch with Motson, Lawerenson, and Lineker. A piano dropping out of the sky?
2)  Facial  features looks terrible and was much more realistic in 99.
3)  Player  skill moves are neglected.  Still can't do the nutmeg on the keyboard.  The  straight arms and shielding is okay.
4)  Difficulty:  Much easier to  pass defenders in world class mode.  Way too hard to connect on crosses  unless it is a set piece.  Most of the time the ball drops real softly  toward goal when you try to get a good header from a running cross.
5)  Graphics:  Behind the net cam is nice and so is the slow motion replay,  but the facial features looked way too unlike the players in real life.  More like cartoon interpretations.
6)  The player attributes scale  doesn't really distinguish them by much.  The 1-7 scale is too narrow, and  why does non-keepers have goalkeeper ratings?
7)  Introducing set  pieces were okay, but you can't pick who you want as the three choices they  give you in team management.  That gets frustrating when you have a weaker  player who can't head the ball.
8)  Tackling:  The dive button they  introduced can make it frustrating when it seems the defender flat out  chopped your legs off and there is no card!
9)  The only real plus  about the game is the added choices for IGM. You can change formations for  the front, midfield, and back line.
10)  The music was alright too.  Robbie Williams was a good pick.
  I was really disappointed the  first time I played this game, and thought 99 was much better.  The  only consolation is when I began to play with friends and that made it  worth it.
  Just remember to download patches.  They have a lot of  improvement to do.",2.0
"Can I ask 1 Question.. Why did EA mess up this series? I havn't played the whole series, I have 98, 99 and 2000 but gosh man, they really messed this one up.  1. Graphics - The graphics look very good.  The player faces  could have been better, but they are adequate. I like the crowd jumping up  and clapping. From a distance, it does look realistic.
2. Sound - I wish  i received the European version. I have the commentry off, all i have to is  it really sucks! The crowd cheering is really cool, though it would have  been nice to have crowd biasness in home games.
3. Gameplay - Purely  disgusting. Where have most of the skill moves gone! Although the ball  physics are much more realistic, it is much to easy for the computer to  pick off your passess. And I hate the free kick arrow, its is horrible. It  uses a power bar which really fails. Also, when taking corners from the  opposite side of the field, you can't see the power bar so you have no idea  how hard you kick.
One of my BIGGEST problems is the refree strictness. I  put the refree strictness bar on full and the computer gets away with slide  tackles from behind all the time, even when i am running with no one  infront of me. This one really gets me mad!
In conclusion, I have given  up on this game. I jump back to Fifa 99, its much much much better than  this piece of junk.",2.0
"I was very disappointed with this game.  The graphics are a step up, but the new klunky interface detracts from playability, even once you get used  to it.  My biggest gripe is that the technology tree wasn't expanded, but  rather completely replaced.  While this contributes somewhat to a new,  fresh game, the elimination of key technologies and their functional  replacement by other, more esoteric ones detracts from the realism  possessed by its predecessors.  Those happy with the improvements in  graphics, units, technologies, and user interface Civilization II boasted  over the original will be seriously disappointed if you're looking for the  same in this title.  I've already stopped playing Call to Power, but I  still play Civ II occasionally, for what that says.",2.0
"Why didn't I just read the packaging and put it down. No, I had to go and buy it. I played Civ II once, Alpha Centauri two or three times, and now Call to Power... well, I didn't make it through the tutorial.
One word...  ZZZZZZZZZZZ!",2.0
"I was (and remain) an avid Civ 2 player, so I was pretty excited when CTP  came out with its promise of new units and graphics and concepts.  I have  to say I'm disappointed.  This game just has too much going on, and the  confusion of it sucked any of the fun out of it for me.  I give it two  stars for ambition (honestly, some of the government types and diplomacy  options move in the right direction) but nothing for the fun factor.  New  units like Evangelist and Slaver make you more mad than anything, and this  multiple unit war stuff didn't seem to make much sense.
I also don't like  the new interface.  In this game you have the opportunity to control your  whole civilization from one screen (as opposed to individual city screens  in Civ 2) but I never really know if I'm doing well or not.  I may have,  say, 150 production, but what does that mean?  I miss shields and stacks of  grain, at least I knew if I was producing what I needed or not.
Ah well,  a bold attempt that trips itself with complexity.  Stick with Civ 2 and  wait for Civ 3.  Not much fun to be had here.",2.0
"Well, I must say that I was really disappointed by this game! I got my hands on it as soon as it became avayable. Having played for interminable hours with the original Civilization game I had great expectations from  this title. In the end it really turned out to be one of the worst sequels  ever!
The MAYOR SHORTFALLS ARE: 1- Game speed. By the time you reach the  space age you will not have been able to explore much of the world, and  will not have been able to build an army from a particular historical age.  Since the speed is so fast, by the time you have an army of, let's say  musketeers, you have already discovered planes and the nuclear bomb. THIS  IS VERY FRUSTRATING!  2- Units: Fewer than its predecessors and less  realistic. 3- The space age: It is only confusing and doesn't really help  to make the game interesting. 4- Unconventional units: You have now lawyers  and eco-warriors that work something like the spies in the original game.  In the end they end up beying only annoying and totally confusing! It would  have been better to add a more sound political and economic sistem to the  game and add a few varibles afterwards (i.e.: political movements and  private enterprise). 5- Customization: It is now impossible to customize  the game, like create new units as it was possible in CIV 2. I hate that!  6- Maps: Lacks a map of earth!  It used to be the only map I played on in  CIV 2!
IMPROVEMENTS 1- Graphics: Way better than the predecessors. Too  bad that the other features in the game didn't get quite to the same level!  2- Soundtrack: Improved somehow. 3- Combat: A tactical display now allows  you to actually play battles. Nice idea to start with, but it is somehow  badly put to work and has some incredible bugs (like archers that shoot  down stealth bombers! ).
My suggestion?  Wayt for a sequel or buy CIV 2!",2.0
"This game calls its civilizations ""races"" and has slavery as a prominet part of the game, but there is the abolition eventually. It does not feel like a successor to Civilization II. The wonders of the world are  all new, as is the technology tree. The interface is new, and you cannot  use a keyboard to move units. I did not care much for its supposedly  improved graphics over Civilization II, I did not see that much  improvement, and by now the graphics are not cutting edge anyway.
There  are too many new units and cumbersome rules associated with them. The  cursed televangelist keeps popping up out of nowhere, converting cities and  eating into your empire's resources. The lawyer hides just as you are about  to move a military unit to kill him. Building cities in space and under  water may sound like a lot of fun and a novelty compared to the two  original Civilizations. But playing at lower levels, this won't be  interesting, becuase you will learn how to crush your opponents before  acquiring the technology for underwater and space construction; at higher  levels, the game becomes too difficult and too cluttered with units and  characters to persevere with marine and space existence. The only real  improvement over Civilization II is that governments are more stable during  war. In Civ II, if you wanted to wage a serious war, you had to install  monarchy or fundamentalism, or your government would collapse. Bottom line:  maybe it's because I am older, but I did not enjoy this game as much as  Civilization II. What comes out of ""Call to Power"" screams for  help to bring more original and well-crafted games to the market.",2.0
"This is the worst CIV game out there.  They changed the interface so drasticly that it is no longer any fun.  They renamed all the wonders and lots of the technologies and worst of all, it doesn't feel like a civ game.  This game may have good graphics, but thats it.  It is way to complicated.  My settelers can't even bulid roads.  The AI ain't great and they always  appear early.  Get Civ 2 and pray Activision doesn't touch the CIV license  agian",2.0
"I got this game when it first came out, played it, and it was great. A few games later you start to notice that the all mighty AI, is all very much predictable. To a historical sence.... when my phalanx are able to fight  along side my space marines.. it just kinda throws the game off. There is  no option in the game to update units that have been deemed obsolete. So  you can either send them off to battle to die or disband them. Either way,  they will be marked up as a loss on the score card. If you are thinking of  buying it, please have a system far beyond what they recommend. I have a  P366 w/ 32 MB of RAM and when my civilization reaches about 20 billion  people, it crawls. To give you an examble, I can end a turn and go take a  shower. Overall, it is good for about 10 games.",2.0
"Civilization ,Call to power had the potential to be a good game . The graphics are  an improvement from the original civilization , the wonder videos are cool and the units are well detailed but there is nothing  spectaculer.  And to be honest its got some major problums . The  3 foremost being the combat , the controls and the way they use turn based  stratagy. The combat is just all the units lineing up next to each other  and slashing ( or shooting as the case may be ) at each other . You have no  control over your men whatsoever . The problum with the controls are that  the units are so hard to control that many times you click them into the  wroung places . Also the computer moves you around to diferent units as you  pass by with the curser . You may have to play the game to get what I mean  .  The biggest mistake in the game is makeing it a turn based  stratagy . It takes way to long to move each unit from place to place. It  may have been better if the units had more movement points but as it is now  the game takes like 5 to 6 hours to complete . Who has that much time to  play a computer game ?  There are other problums . Like the  fact the computer cheats . Or the fact the computerized charectors go from  loving you 1 minute to the next attacking you . Or the fact that the  charectors are not like they say they should be . For instince can you  imagine how frustrating  it is to be attacked by your former allie Gande .  Remember non-violent-protests ? It seems like the people who programed this  did not pass the sixth grade .  Baisicly this is a game that could  have been good if the people who made it had put some thought into it  before desighning it . But as it is stick as far , far , away from this  game as possable .",2.0
"I would rent this game. It takes no skills what so ever to beat it. Maybe it just came naturally to me, or maybe I'm just to critical but this game is not worth buying. In my opinion this game would only appeal the the 8-11 age range and even then would they only play it once or twice.",2.0
"i am an avid gamer, and am very fond of the aliens series, so i thought that this game would be a dream come true. infortunately, it wasn't. first of all, there are only 15 different maps. the maps get reused so  frequently, it gets boring after a while. the learning curve is vewry  basic, despite what the box says, and the alien is by far the easyest (sp?)  to use. the marine is at an unfair disadvantage, as he only has a limite4d  number of weapons, and they get taken away after every level. instead of a  campain, the game has a mission sstem, like a video game. on top of that,  you have to beat on the most difficult setting to play all of the  ""unique"" levels. this is IMPOSIBLE to do with the marine. what  this game needs is a really good add on, to save it from the pits of video  game hell. if you want a good shooter, for the same price, buy half-life,  game of the year edition; it comes with a free copy of team fortress, a  game that alone blows avp out of the water.",2.0

"I was disappointed this product came on diskettes, rather than CDROM.  Only one game is mouse driven.  The PacMan game requires you to use the arrow keys, and they do not respond quickly enough.  The old 80's joy  sticks were better.  Over priced for what you get.",2.0
"I have played few games that were as funny as this one. Why? Take a bunch of game developers who hated the average controls of survival horror games, get a bunch of inept writers to scribble down a derivative plot with a nice hook and horrible dialogue, music composers who aspire to be better than John Williams, game designers who played WAY too many Super Mario games and anyone in marketing or professional game reviewing to pass the game off as a Survival Horror game and you've got a painfully hilarious game on your hands. This game doesn't do Sega any justice and don't believe the lie that this was their first Survival Horror game, they made their first two years before this on the Saturn and that game, Deep Fear, was art compared to this. I felt absolutely lied to when I played this game thinking I was in for the scare of my life when I found myself rolling on the ground after witnessing some of the silliest character models, inconsistent soundtrack, awkward dialogue, non-existent atmosphere, incomprehensible plot and obnoxious controls I've ever played on a DreamCast game. Your characters run so slow you'd think they had weights tied to their ankles, but their steps look so played out it's almost like they're waddling away from danger! You'll kill monsters who, despite being four legged monstrosities, will literally sprinkle you with gold coins! The overly dramatic music will play on and loop over and over again when nothing is happening! You want a farce? You've got nothing but farce in Blue Stinger.",2.0

The graphics are good but first there was the necessity to download a patch which at 25mb is the largest game patch I've ever seen, the list of fixes is enough to make you question why they released it in that form anyway.

"These days games carry SO MUCH depth, example game modes, characters, areas/platforms, etc.  Unfortunately, TONY HAWK Pro Skater suffers in that  area, which therefore makes it not worth the price of $40.  On the PRO  side, The graphics are simply tremendous, the levels look fabulous,  character design, stats, all the features, brilliantly done.  But it's not  enough.

"Growing up in the 70's the game of life boardgame was my favorite. My friends and I would play for hours, driving our little car around the 3 dimensional track and waiting for the chance to put our ""children"" pegs in the car (always biting the bottom off to make them shorter than the parents!). I was really looking forward to playing the PC version, but was kind of disappointed because the very things that make the boardgame fun are not present in the PC version. The biggest flaw is that you can't really see the entire board view, so you have no idea what squares are coming up. Half the fun of the boardgame is the satisfying sound of the wheel whirring, while you call out ""come on six!"", only to be disappointed when you land on 5. The graphics are amusing, and the game does have some entertainment value, but it just doesn't recapture the old board game.",2.0
"Loser! The cars in this game don't leave behind any dust, they bite the dust! It's no wonder that Activision didn't dare tie this game directly into Interstate '76. There is just no comparison to the classic game. I would love to compare this game but since Activision isn't doing that I won't either. Let's go down the list of Graphics, Control, Game Play, Sound/Music, and Fun Factor. That will give or take one star for each category.
Graphics: Where does one start on the graphics? As far as the level of detail and the amount of destruction available, it is indeed a very good game. Games of this nature tend to over simplified with little or no detail in the buildings and surrounding terrain. Activision programmers spent a lot of time on the details in the game, I wish they spent the same amount of time on the game's engine. The game engine plays like a first generation game. There is such an incredible amount of popping, crazing, stretching, and disappearing polygons, any good programmer should have never allowed this kind of thing to even leave his development PC. For those out of the loop I'll define the problems.
Popping- Terrain popping up out of no where. Programmers usually solve this with careful use of fog. Yes folks, that is the true use of fog. However fog in this game is under utilized. Almost like it was thrown in at the last minute.
Crazing/Stretching- This tends to be very similar. Various walls or architecture seems to twist or stretch into bizarre angles. If you have the game drive the car directly up against a vertical wall and you'll see it. The level with the lighthouse is a prime example.
Disappearing polygons- This is a serious no no in games. Drive to the edge of any arena until the car ""bounces"" if you can get the proper slope of land (about a 45 degree angle.) and the camera swings low enough, parts of the ground will disappear and be replaced by a livid blue (or red depending on the generation of PSX console or some other factor).
Control: Unfortunately, this game can't decide on Arcadian controls or Real World controls, so it attempts to do a half and half deal. The car's accelerates and steers like it's running through molasses, unless of course it floats, then it feels like it's skimming around on ice. In fact, control's so bad that I tend to get and use the hovercraft mode or the boat mode more often than not. The only major saving grace is that the controls are 100% configurable. I myself don't like the default uses for the buttons. Especially for my style of play which involves using my thumb to press two or three buttons at the same time. (Old School Mario Style if you will.)
Gameplay: Game play is frustrating at best. (Why is the ""Arcade"" mode listed before ""Quest"" mode?) The various modes of the game should be fun, but really, are more of a frustrating exercise in patience. Past experience tells me that arcade mode is a great way to ""practice"" the details of the game. In this case, it actually is set up that way. Hints and tips are handed to you before each battle. Cars can be limited in number and difficulty. And goals are clearly defined. However, actually doing all of this takes a bit of work. The number of ""configuration"" screens one must churn through is heart breaking. Whatever happened to a ""simple"" game session? And the enemies seem to be overly ruthless. Whereas quest mode seems to be the easiest of the modes, having blasted through 4 of the drivers in the first few hours of playing. I really didn't have much patience to even try the survival mode.
Sound/Music: I try not to review music or sound in games but in this case it will be the only whole star for this game. The music is indeed sweet to listen to. The tunes are strangely familiar, but I can't place my finger on it. It also appears that there is one song for each of the characters to play. The book lists 15 characters and I believe there are 15 songs. It's quite fun to try and match the songs to the characters. The music would have been a blast if they used real world 70's music but alas, the licensing would be too much. The only annoying sound effect is those stinkin' UFO's. Kind of makes me want to turn the CD into a UFO.
Fun Factor: Fun Factor can't get much lower. The only fun things here is the quest mode and two player mode. It's always nice to play ANY game with two players, especially one that lets us rag on it like it's Elevator Action (Waaay back in the NES days.) The quest mode is nice for those late night no-brainer sessions where your brain is too fried to think about anything else.
Sorry if this review is just as jumbled as the game itself. Watching the game world twist and spin in sickening ways scrambled my poor brain. The results?
Half a star for graphics but bad engine. No stars for the controls. No stars for game play. One star for music and sound. And half a star for the fun factor. That's all. Hope Activision's third attempt isn't a . . . dump.",2.0
"This expansion pack (EP) was a complete wast of my time, and money.  It adds a couple new magical weapons and armor, some new spells and a couple new areas to explore.  There is no plot to the the EP, just some NPC saying  ""Oh I lost my son in Durlags Tower. . . ."" and stuff like that.  The only thing that made this EP worth two stars is that they cleaned up a  lot of the rough edges from Baldurs Gate, and increased Experience points  to a point where your fighter and like one other class can go up a level.  By the way, it is just one more disk that you have to flip through if you  decide to replay Baldurs Gate.  In conclusion don't buy this EP, it isn't  worth it, unless any new EP's come out that require it.",2.0
"This sequel to Vigilante 8 has taken a backseat to the first and gone way downhill, crashing into burning flames and leaving nothing but a huge wreck. And instead of rating it high and then commenting on how much I want to play this game, or complain about it not being delivered, I'm actually reviewing the game from having actually played it!!!

The graphics may be slightly better then the 1st version, but the game-play has come down badly. Tho it is fun for a few seconds to have your vehicle slide down ski-slops, or get picked up by crane magnets and ski-lifts, or have your car blown off the road by jet engines, the vehicles response is horrible compared to the first. You have less control this time, the car won't do the 360's properly, and in lighter cars, you spend more time upside down trying to flip back over, because of opponents rockets, then anything else.

The levels seem much smaller too. Someone said there is 50 levels, what are you on about? There is not 50 levels.... it would have been nice to be able to unlock some of the levels of the last one, but instead you have to play the new ones, which have more potholes, things to crash and fall into then anything fun to do.

Even if no one wanted to add some of the original stages, they should have at least added some of the original vehicles. Nothing has come back, every car is new. Some are interesting, like the moon-buggy's, motorbikes, bug-bug, and a range of other vehicles, but there's no way to enjoy testing them because you cant control any of them. The speed of the cars is boringly slow! There is a code to make them faster, but that only results in worse control of the vehicles. The worst control is when trying to control your vehicles upgrade... You find things on the track that transform your vehicle into some other modified craft. Most of them change into a ""Back To The Future II"" style Sky-way-Flier. It looks cool at first, but you have no control over it. Also the spaceship from the original is no where to be seen.

There is some new weaponry, like a flame thrower, but opponents seem to now drive shielded vehicles and it now takes 100 times longer to destroy someone. Also, the rockets and pink projectile things are about all that's found in most levels, there is a few new things like specials being easy to find but what happened to the mini-gun? It seems to have almost completely disappeared and it's annoying looking for weapons inside buildings when you cant control a vehicle to get in there quick enough.

Even with codes, this game was still no fun. You need the invincibility code, but some of the codes like Monster Truck Wheels sounds like fun, but it's nothing to brag about, you just keep slipping around with no control as usual.

Overall, stick with Vigilante 8. Don't bother with this sequel. It's a downgrade from the 1st. On one player anyway, I haven't tried the multiplayer, but take my advice if you intend to play one player. It's not worth it. It's all graphics and no fun.",2.0
"First off, I've just gotta ask what's up with the first review on this site?  A glowing review that's logged more than 100+ positive votes?  That's a lot of traffic.  Not that I would accuse anyone of having a  hundred friends and employees drop by the site to plug a product, but . .  .
As for the game itself.  Wizardry Gold, the most complex game in the  pack, does have a few very nice features.  In particular, there are several  groups of NPC's running around trying to accomplish the same quests that  the PC's are, which provides a nice sense of urgency that most computer  games lack.  Also, the magic system is very good.  Since each character's  spell points are distributed around between six different schools, you're  forced to employ a bigger variety of spells than in most RPGs.
That said,  the game is VERY DATED.  In spite of the 1992 date on Wizardry gold, it  looks and plays like something from the mid 1980's.  The graphics are  extremely primitive, to the extent that they actually impede game play.  Because every wall and every tree looks exactly the same, it's hard to  navigate.  Also, you can't see monsters until you are actually in combat  with them, and many special features (alcoves with urns, panels of blinking  lights, etc.) have no graphical representation at all, so you have to  physically step on every square to see if there is something  there.
Interaction with NPC's is also extremely rudimentary.  Most NPC's  will only talk about three or four subjects, usually say only one sentence  on the subject, and usually repeat the same thing that every other NPC says  on that subject.  This makes it hard to figure out what is going on in the  world, and to get a handle on the backstory behind all the quests and  NPC's.  The NPC's in this game are primitive compared to those in Might and  Magic 6,7, and 8, which are in turn primitve compared to the NPC's in  Fallout 2. (A game with the best written characters that I've seen  yet.)
All in all, I think modern players will find these games  frustratingly primitive.  Those looking for a good RPG should try Fallout2,  Might and Magic 6,7, or 8 (they're basically all the same), or the Baldur's  Gate games, in that order.",2.0
"This is the UK version, full of censorshit. Yeah you can patch it, but I wouldn't have bought it if I knew it wasn't the US version and it doesn't specify clearly whether it is or not.",2.0
I cannot play this game because it is nothing like the other fallout games I have played. Very dissappointing.so I gave up on playing it.,2.0
"I bought this game for my 7 year old son, expecting it to be a good one.  The graphics are average (better graphics can be found with Spyro, year of the dragon), and the levels are very frustrating, I found myself throwing the controller away several times trying to help my son get through the levels, even though I consider myself a good gamer.  I finally recommended my son to play Spyro the dragon instead to avoid anymore frustrations.  I won't recommend anyone to get this game.",2.0
I don't get it why it is not as good as the PC version. I don't like the fact that you can't see the entire world map with all your countries and armies at once (just like the Risk2 PC game) but instead have to move from one continent to another.,2.0

"If you have other real people to play this game with, this is a fun way to play Monopoly because all of the time you normally waste digging for pieces or cards and counting money is done away with.
However, playing the computer is no fun what so ever because it has been programmed to be such an abysmal player. It offers you cash for properties based only on their mortgage value. Thus it will buy a property for two hundred dollars one turn, and sell it to you the very next turn for $100- and this is only one example of how much of a dunce it is as an oponent. So if you were hoping that you could finally spend your nights playing Monopoly without having to invite a bunch of people over, I am sorry to say you will be sorely disapointed.",2.0
"Maybe it is because I have a Mac version but I was really really enjoying this game when my band of characters stopped going up in experience levels.  I contacted the company but was told that that is just the way the game is.  Yes, I do like a challenge but I play computer games to relax too and without an advancement in level I don't see how to win this game.  I was very very disappointed.",2.0
Game is excellent. But disc came very scratched and barely plays.,2.0
"Although I can see why this game is such a classic, many of its elements simply don't stand the test of time.  For example, I've heard people gush over the music, which I personally find underwhelming by today's high standards.  Also the lack of direction can prove incredibly frustrating when you get lost.  However, I should admit that I don't particularly enjoy non-linear sidescrollers, as I'm also not a fan of the 2D Metroid games.",2.0
"If you have an older computer, or lack the appropriate computer skills, this is a beast.  Even with the patch, it crashes constantly. Everytime I am just starting to get the hang of the controls, it locks up and shuts down, (usually right before I am about to save my progress).  The game play itself is amusing, but there is a lot of walking involved, which if your computer is older or slower, can become pretty tedious.",2.0
"I enjoy RPG games. Really, I do. But for some reason, I couldn't get into this one as much as I thought I could. But I've looked at all the reviews  on this board, and most are raving about it. But what I'm also wondering is  if these very positive reviews are from mostly die-hard RPGers, and/or  Dungeon & Dragons fans.
I personally do not play D&D, so I'm not  a die-hard. But I did enjoy Diablo, Everquest, Might and Magic 7, and Age  of Wonders, so I'm not against ""dungeon-crawl""/fantasy type games  as you may think I am. I did like the ""pause"" option in Baldur's  Gate, so you can give commands to each of your party's members without  getting thrashed in the meantime, but I didn't care for the graphics. But  to some, that's minor and forgivable if you like the gameplay--I guess I  just didn't. I also prefer faster paced games with a more linear storyline.  But if you prefer a non-linear storyline, and sometimes feeling semi-lost  in a rather large world to explore, that's all the more reason for you to  get this game.
I also get a tired of too much repitition. Every battle I  set my formation up, pause, issue relatively the same commands, and  execute. (In Everquest, I only went up to Level 12 and quit, thinking,  what's the point?) So the combat is repetitive, but in Baldur's defense, it  does have a storyline and an ending, unlike Everquest. But it is time  consuming. But if you can afford the time, and you like RPG's, then you'll  love this title, otherwise, spend your gaming money elsewhere.",2.0
"Let's be serious.  The idea of a good computer game from TSR is enough to make any D&D fan take notice, and they came SO close.  But they failed in the most important part of it all.  D&D is all about interacting  with other players, and the multiplayer aspect of the game is simply  terrible.  It's impossible to do anything if you are not the main  character, (the idea that there would even be a main character in a D&D  game is insulting to all the players of the real game,) because whatever he  does screws up whatever you are trying to do, even if you're not even on  the same screen.  It's not fun to follow someone else around the screen.  Single player play is fair, but again, its all about playing with other  people.  Buyers beware.",2.0
"i don't know why others rate this so highly - the graphics are OK, i love the fact that you can play with friends (although in the end are different schedules ruined this) and i like importing my own pictures. But the  controls for this game are absolutely frustrating!
Some minor gripes:  the manual doesn't have enough info, combat used to be a MAJOR pain until i  stumbled over the pause commands (and had to play with them to figure out  which ones to set), having the main character enter a store makes life  frustrating for other LAN players, the plot doesn't seem multiplayer  friendly (you lose all those NPCs which are important to the story - the  party is so small), the maps don't make a ton of sense, group movement can  be really annoying and my number one complaint: you can't use arrow keys to  move your character!  i know, it sounds minor, but the view screen is only  large enough to show a few tiles, so you have to scroll the screen, click a  destination point, by which time your guy has already walked there so you  scroll some more, repeat - it gets so that you never actually see your  character because you're so busy setting way points for him to walk. At a  minimum, if you have to play this carpal-tunnel torture of moving your  characters leg by leg, you should at least be able to make the screen  center on the character - the little guy just walks off the screen and you  don't know where he went. At a minimum, let me see more of the map at one  time - i have a 19"" monitor and prefer looking at what's happening  rather than the large pretty pictures some artist drew.
The plot's OK,  the D&D system is pretty sophisticated, there's some real polish in  places and we've needed a good RPG for a while (i LOVED Fallout, which had  lousy, but still vastly superior, map and movement controls), so i got the  game the very first day it was released (xmas eve), and my roommates and i  played it for 2 weeks, but eventually i got so sick of the control scheme  that i just erased the frustrating thing",2.0
"Is it possible for a game to be TOO realistic?  The graphics are excellent, and there's a lot of bass to everything.  Now, shall I go into the negative parts?  I'm against the claim that video games cause violence  in the populace, but this game nearly changed my opinion.  In Kingpin, it's  ""f-this"" and ""f-that,"" and ""Don't look at my  (expletive).""  Even casual talk has the F-word butting into the  conversation, and I was very disgusted with the conversations that my  character engaged in.  I returned the game soon after I installed it  because I thought the ""gritty"" subject matters detracted from the  ""fun factor"" of the game.  How can one have fun cussing and  killing other people that cuss back?  Sure, Quake and other games are  violent,  but not as wanton, gratuitous, and obscene as THIS game.  I admit  that I like some violence, but not even *I* would defend Kingpin from  accusations of youth violence.  Aside from that, bullets leave exit marks  on the opponents, but so does the crowbar, the levels are very confusing,  making you run in circles, and objectives are very vague.  Heed the rather  large warning labels on the box PLEASE.  This game is DEFINETELY NOT for  kids...and even some grown-ups!",2.0
"I thought that the previous adventure, Zork Nemesis, was one of the best puzzle/adventure games I've ever played, compelling storyline, atmosphere, mystery and challenging puzzles - took 6 months of intensity to complete.

Nice graphics, great humour but only 18 hours total  gameplay to complete wasn't worth the $$.",2.0

Trades are confusing, and the computer opponents play the game like crazed lunatics. Wait until one gets a monopoly and starts building houses. The turn will take forever, as the elated opponent gleefully mortages everything in sight in a frantic attempt to add another building.
I've had two versions of Monopoly for the computer and have been disappointed with both. On the other hand, a $20.00 Super Nintendo cartridge of the game generated hours of fun. The graphics were simpler and the options were fewer, but maybe that's why I enjoyed it.",2.0

  Another thing is that the skirmish mode stinks, there are only 5 maps and you can't choose what race you want to be for each map. Plus, on some maps, the AI is completely stupid, and on some it is just the opposite. This game is just plain boring, it gets on your nerves a lot.

It takes forever just to get to play a mission.  The mission starts loading up and someone starts talking, I guess giving a little story to the mission you are about to play.  But, I can see that it's all loaded up within a few seconds, but the person just keeps talking.  I can't get it to skip past that so I can go ahead a play.  This is very frustrating.

"$43...As I write my review the game is selling for $43.  I sold my copy 4 months ago on here for 9.99 and it wasn't the lowest price.  What the heck is going on here.  Clearly the folks paying the silly price have not seen the gameplay or read a correct unbiased review.  I purchased my copy on clearance (I was the original owner) for 1.99 back in the day and even then I thought I overpaid.  The storyline is vague, the characters are too similar and from what I could stand...the same scene appears to take place with different baddies over and over again.  And this game is $43??

"... but ultimately decided I never would.
The original Railroad Tycoon game ranked as one of my all-time favourite computer games. I wasted countless hours laying track well into the night and cursing computer  players when they started buying my stock. When I discovered RTII for the  Mac, I purchased it immediately...
And found a game that proves that  bells and whistles aren't always good things.
RTII has a very pretty,  forced perspective map of the area in which tracks are being layed, but the  nature of the map makes it neigh-impossible to predict exactly where the  tracks are going to end up unless one practices extensively. In other  words, one has to *work* just to figure out how to play the game. And, as  far as computer games go, that's not my idea of fun.
Despite not being  able to play the game, I'm giving it Two Stars. It's pretty, the sound  effects are nice, and the idea of laying tracks in Africa and Asia appeals  greatly to me. In concept, the game *is* superior to the original RT and  takes advantage of the advances we've seen in technology in recent years...  but the designers (or developers, I'm not sure who to blame) just didn't  know when to quit.
I think I could have enjoyed this game immensely if it  had had been presented with an old-fashioned top-down/2D view of the play  surface rather than enduldge themselves in making the game prettier. Maybe  that could have been an option that could have been provided--I don't know  enough about computer programming to know if such a thing would have been  possible. As things stand, 'Railroad Tycoon II' is just taking up space in  my game CD rack.",2.0

"The interface to this game is terrible. I spent the first couple of hours of the game trying to figure out where I needed to go, because the game's interface didn't let me realize I could leave the city. More situations like that followed later in the game.
The battle system is absolutely tedious; it involves clicking the same thing over and over again, to the tune of a slow drumbeat which only helps to ensure that you are thoroughly bored. In fact, the severe lack of music is a problem which plagues the game. This would only be forgivable if it weren't for the fact that other RPGs constantly break new ground in game music, making Septerra Core look absolutely pathetic in comparison. It gives the impression that they spent the budget which was supposed to have hired a composer on advertising instead.
The incessant puzzles you have to solve are very contrived, and you never know whether talking to a certain person will be the key, or whether they will blather on about nothing. If I wanted puzzles, I'd play Riven so that they'd at least be well-done.
Finally, during what I have to assume was a 'boss battle' because the battle dragged on longer than usual and had a louder drumbeat, the game crashed. I would have had to start the battle over again, if it weren't for the fact that I uninstalled the game right then and there. It was too late to return the game to the store, but at least I could get my disk space back.
This game is inferior to Square's games in every area; it is nothing but hype.

"Let's get this straight right off the bat: Civilization II is one of the best games ever spawned.  I bought the Gold edition because I expected my enjoyment of the game to be expanded by the new stuff.  I also assumed they  would have fixed the minor-but very annoying-bugs from the original  game.
I was wrong.
The ""advantages"" of the Gold edition are the  following:  --Multiplayer options --New scenarios --Expanded options for  creating your own maps and scenarios.
I have not tried the multiplayer  options.  They may well be wonderful.  Please note, however, that a  ""multiplayer patch"" for Civ II is available on the net.  For FREE.
Some  of the new scenarios are decent.  Many are annoying.  However, they were  not worth the extra money.
The map editor is identical to its original.  The expanded scenario-building options are nice, but beware: it will take  HOURS to properly prepare a scenario.
The bugs, which are obvious and  glaring, were never fixed.  Here are the bugs I noticed: --Units which you  send to a location more than 1 square away (via the shift-click method)  will sometimes go the opposite direction.  Other times they will simply  move back and forth between two spots. --The game will occasionally crash.  Save often.

"This game is so bad I hesitate with my second star. I would categorize  this game as a great concept ruined by a bad game. While the movies are  great and the wide variety and impressive uniqueness of the different  players is truly an accomplishement the actual gameplay is crap.  For one  thing the sides aren't evenly matched. Play Veruna with even a small body  of water and its a gauranteed massacre of the other side. Play Zhon, on the  other hand, and expect to spend 5 hours on a single game before deciding to  give up. Amazingly, the expansion pack fails to correct this problem at  all! The game is pathetically slow and worse, the somewhat baffling  placement of mana makes it impossible to fortify yourself in a base.  Furthermore (and there's more) the unlimited supply of bafflingly placed  mana is in-exhaustible, so the computer builds anthropomorphic bases with  defensive fortifications every two feet. Try and set foot in one of them  and your army of 30 is dead in 3 seconds! 30 is also the biggest force you  can ever truly hope to assemble, by the way, because to control more than  that is impossible, flatly impossible! While you can group units, ordering  a group is ill-advised because while you may order them to move to a  certain location on the way if they're ambushed by the enemy they'll just  keep walking and not even fight back until they're all dead. Tell them to  attack the enemy and they kill the unit you clicked on and then just stand  to be slaughtered by the rest. Even setting them to agressive mode does  little to combat the problem.

Of course it helped me to visualise the world a little bit, but at the  same time the story and gameplay weren't what I had been expecting for so  long. First the choice of places you visit. I guess those places (Shadar  Logoth, White Tower, Mnts. Of Mist, Blight and an off the beat Whitecloak  fortress) are there due to the fact that converting the whole Tear or  Caemlyn for us would be a great work, but still this is not what I had been  expecting.
Then the fact that you only use ter'angreal during the game.  Leaving out channeling surely was a wise decision (consider the sight of a  roomful of sisters weaving their patterns), but leaving out the system of  angreal was a stupid mistake. I certainly don't think that the dart-thingy  in the game is worth naming a ter'angreal. Even when I try to convince  myself that in those places I visited there really weren't any sa'angreal  the idea of wasting about two tons of cuendillar just for killing off some  of those evil trollocs or whitecloaks seems disgusting to me. And I won't  start telling you about all the things Balefire can do and what it can't  do...
Then the storyline. It is too simple for me. It has got the neither  overwhelming grab of the books nor the virtues of a simple adventure. It  shows us one of the greatest stories in Randland's history as a mere trail  that the protagonist had to follow (again I will not start talking about  those ""puzzles"" you have to solve). I guess that an RPG-or-something would  have had a better story than this mere Unreal child has. Of course there  are people who waited for another hack-and-slash game but I wasn't one of  them.
The beginning is not a bad one (for you still don't know the rest  of the crap that's coming) and there are some funny levels (""Dungeons of  the Forsaken"") and the movie before the last level *evil grin*. But the  rest is certainly something I was not waiting for (the horrible scene just  after the credits was the peak). My opinion is that worth keeping is only  the second CD that you get `cause the story/movies and music (which is very  good BTW) are on that one.
P.S. Does any of you who have played it  already know, how the Portal Stone ended up in the WC's fortress's  courtyard in the end?",2.0
"""Wheel of Time"" by Atari is based off of Robert Jordan's ongoing (interminable) series by the same name. It is a FPS with both Single Player and Multiplayer modes.
As far as its actual graphics goes, they are pretty good for the time . Sound, also, was done reasonably well.
However, gameplay was horrible. While the missions themselves did make some vague amount of sense, the devil is in the details, and this is just one of the places the game failed. There were many instances where I was able to trick the computerized enemies (MOBs) into standing in places where I could hit it at my leisure and it would just stand there and take it. I also was able to use certain spells through walls when it made no sense for it to do so.
Another problem was the control system. Movement worked fine, and I never found myself stuck anywhere. But the selection of items (all ""spells"" in the game are derived from items which you collect and in some cases use up) for use, particularly in combat, is problematic to say the least.
The plot is in many cases highly dubious if one knows much about the series it is based from. In fact, it borders on absurd. Also, I found the ending to be highly anti-climatic, to say the least.
In all, this is a game that tried hard to be something great, but fell far short. Like the author of the series, it appears that SquareSoft bit off more than they could chew.",2.0
"I love the story and this is what started the series, but I hate the game itself in terms of gameplay. The controls are a bit unresponsive, the combat is a joke and the prima strategy guide is an outright marketing scam. I just had to tell the truth of what I think about this. The gameplay is so bad for me that it just ruins the entire thing for me. I'd rather just watch someone play it with no commentary.",2.0
"My initial excitement for this game was soon squashed by the frustration brought about by the realization that the later missions are essentially very complex puzzles that require a linear approach and split-second  timing. I like the concept of team members with a different array of skills  and equipment, with the spy and the sniper being personal favorites.  (Although the need to limit the sniper's ammunition is understandable from  a play-balancing perspective it seems very unrealistic to suggest that a  soldier could only carry five bullets.) The team roles however add to the  frustration, since the death of any member will cause you to fail a  mission. Your team members seem to die distressingly early and often, so  one may feel obligated to save accordingly. This merely compounds the  difficulty and frustration of the later missions. I soon realized that this  game just wasn't fun anymore.",2.0

You have to use 8 different keyboard buttons just to move the camera around - you couldn't just click with your mouse. How many times did I play where my party would be fighting and I would desperately be trying to zero in on them with all the confusing camera-angle buttons, and all the while I could hear the screams of my party as they died horrible deaths because, I, their commander, could not locate them and direct them properly against the enemy? Usually by the time I did find them, it was much to late. Half my party would be lying dead in pools of gore, while the others still alive would soon be dead.

There is a new storyline, or more precisely, a new variation of a Might and Magic storyline but graphics, sound, monsters, spells, skills and interface at all the same. I couldn't get the game run with DirectX under Windows 2000, software mode only, although the game is listed as NT-compatible. Keyboard shortcuts would stop working and occasional clipping problems got me stuck and forced a reload to get out. The sound is what really drove me crazy.

"This game was rated as a TOP strategy game.  I have enjoyed the full series of Command and Conquer which is a Strategy game with ever increasing capabilities.

I have been disappointed with Total Annihilation - the key to this game is try to make do with what you have quickly, there is little strategy in that!  There is NO ability to group your game pieces or call all to action with one click on the keyboard. Game pieces scatter and you have to find them as best as you can and then move them.  You can't set any of the pieces to do anything automatically - like forage for metal or energy.  Every piece has to be clicked on each time while still trying to combat the enemy.  The game itself IS ABOUT SLAUGHTER rather than STRATEGY and combat.  The ratings I read about said it had great graphics - oh yeah?  Not to me! This game uses a lot of FOG, if you aren't standing in the spot, you can't see much futher around.  To make it harder - opponent pieces can go invisible NOT your own troops!

Guess it lives up to its name Annihilation!  Kill, Kill BUT NO Strategy!",2.0

"I love the concept.  And I have played many hours.  Inevitably, I will purchase Ruins of Kunark.  However, considering the problems with Verant's  so-called customer service, I will easily give up the game to something  comparable like Shadowbane that I have heard much about. Everything I read  ""review"" wise in this Amazon section, regarding EQ's failed  customer SERVICE, is true.  There is but a single GM that has ever handled  a customer service issue of mine with care, and thoughtful resolute... if  only they were all like him - alas, they are not.  Obviously, these  problems will not be dissimilar within RUINS OF KUNARK which is also a  Verant product.
In the time that I have played, Verant has made  numerous adjustments to hamper gameplayer efforts to level (I expect it to  be time consuming, but requisite play time to level is ridiculous!).  Also, as stated in other ""reviews,"" there are too many important  in-game items, that are all but impossible to get; thus the real-life  auctions of certain items for hundreds of U.S. dollars.  Why would anyone  consider paying real money, except for many worthy, indeed required items  for reasonable in-game progress - that are otherwise impossible to  get.
Every other week or so, Verant tweaks the game.  Though many issues  are addressed in these updates for the betterment of the game, all too many  also include alterations that ultimately put the player at a greater  disadvantage than before the ""update,"" by imposing a greater  inability to gain EXPERIENCE, by which a player advances.
I give EQ  RUINS OF KUNARK 5 STARS purely for the thrill of the game concept itself,  along with the nothing less than INCREDIBLE graphics throughout. However,  Verant strikes out in customer service, ensuring consumer displeasure.  And  for that, those otherwise 5 stars, drop to a TWO STAR.",2.0

Not a huge one, as  people were beginning to suspect that it might not be very good.

The graphics and sound are functional, the gameplay is no  more advanced or entertaining than 'Quake 2', the character AI and voice  acting are both simplistic and irritating (your sidekicks are infuriatingly  stupid, and their death instantly loses you the game) and, crucially, both  'Half-Life' and 'Soldier of Fortune' are much, much better, and cheaper.",2.0

It plays like doom did and the AI is possibly the worst ever, in  an age when AI is as good as Theif and SS2. I think Pong had more  intelligent coding then Daikatana. Unlike games where you injure someone  and he runs to find his mate. Shoot a baddy in Daikatana and his mate will  stand lifelifeless next to him watching the world go by.
I was hugehly  dissopointed as I thought this would be a rival to Half Life and would  easily be the best first person shooter of the year (to which Soldier Of  Fortune holds the crown so far for me).

"Updated review- March 20, 2007

I was completely wrong about Metal Gear Solid.  I've really grown to change my mind about the negative thoughts I once had and NOW I think Metal Gear Solid deserves 5 stars (4.5 to be exact).  I especially grew to appreciate the main purpose of the game which is, as many have already mentioned, being encouraged to AVOID the guards that appear on your radar.  The idea of the game is to find ways to avoid enemies- not just go in and attempt to either shoot or break their necks.  No wonder I originally gave the game a low rating.  I went in expecting to kill everything that walked in my way!  The gameplay is a radically different approach from anything I've ever experienced before.

I originally said Metal Gear Solid was one of those games I respect more than I enjoy. I said this because so much thought and energy went into the storyline and voice acting, that I felt the game deserved to be respected, and Konami deserved credit for making it.

However, playing the game today for the first time in months, I don't know what happened. When I hit the triangle button to put myself in first-person mode, and looked across the hallway to see if a guard happened to be standing there (or walking towards me) I got caught up in the excitement and the quiet atmosphere of trying to find a way around him. It was addicting. I finally figured out how to break their necks and that was a lot of fun, too. The boss fights are actually the very best thing about Metal Gear Solid.  Every single one of them is fun, not to mention they all require you to figure out the best way to defeat them using your rather large selection of guns and figuring out which gun is the correct one. I love fighting that ninja without using weapons and hearing him speak between the action segments.  Hearing enemies talk while you're fighting them makes you want to kick their butts even MORE!

I also love when everything is nice and quiet, and then you accidentally walk right by a guard.  When this happens, a loud sound effect comes in that gives off a feeling of ""Oops, my bad!"" because now the guard is chasing you around.  You now have to run for your life.  I didn't realize last year that this is actually a lot of fun. This IS a really good game. I'm sorry for saying it was average last year. Sometimes I need to actually PLAY a game before speaking my mind.

Metal Gear Solid is the revolutionary Playstation game that showed the world a new, life-like way to play video games in the late 90's.  The influence this game had on the future of video gaming is simply astounding.  Metal Gear Solid showed how you can take stealth fighting and wrap a gigantic, memorable story around it.  While I'm not a big fan of lengthy twists and turns in video game storylines, I will give Konami a lot of respect for putting an *incredible* amount of time and effort into the game, and in the process, having the Metal Gear Solid series continue to do well on the Playstation 2, and soon, Playstation 3.

I especially like the quiet atmosphere while you try finding ways to walk around guards.  It comes off like you're watching a movie instead of playing a video game, or, to put it another way, you're ""playing"" a movie.  Not many people can create an atmosphere quite like this.  Good job Konami.

Sometimes the guards aren't as intelligent as you'd like them to be (you can actually walk into an elevator and they will walk right by, without noticing you) and apparently none of them can see you if you're standing only a couple feet away, but you know, these problems are actually pretty nice because it allows gamers to finish Metal Gear Solid without any major difficulty problems.  I can only imagine how hard the game would be if guards were extremely observant all the time.

I still have a problem with the overall darkness of the game, though.  More often than not, an important health or ammo pack is located in a hidden dark area, like near a corner, behind a crate or somewhere you can't see.  It's really not a big deal, though.  Just remind yourself to always check every dark area you come across.  If you're still having trouble finding items, just press the triangle button to put yourself in first-person mode, and hit the left or right buttons on the directional pad to scan around.  This works really well.  In fact, the whole first-person camera angle was a great idea from Konami.

Even though 20 minutes of cutscenes and conversations isn't really my thing, at least you are given the option to skip through them if you want (by pressing any one of the four main buttons, plus the Start button).  I hate when game companies FORCE you to watch them.  I don't think the storyline is bad in any shape or form.  It's actually decent.  You see, my whole life I've had a belief that a video game should be more about actually ""playing a game"" and less time should be devoted to storyline segments (I'll make an exception for RPGs).  The storyline in Metal Gear Solid is so big and lengthy that if you were to sit there and listen to the whole thing you would be sitting there for HOURS.  Honestly, Metal Gear Solid focuses more on storyline than actual gameplay.

With changing times and technology, people began to prefer the realistic aspects of video gaming.  Metal Gear Solid will go down as one of the originators.

I DO have one complaint- there doesn't seem to be an option for you to lock-on to your target, so YOU are forced to find and face the target.  For example, if a guard is located south/east of you, you have to actually use the directional pad to face south/east and THEN you can shoot him.  You have to face him directly or he'll continue shooting at you until you're dead.  This can be a pain because turning correctly is a bit of a challenge.  This could have been fixed with one simple ""lock-on nearest target"" feature.

Sure, you have guns that can zoom in on a target, but to use THESE guns you have to get into a special position (which changes the angle of the camera).  By the time you get into that position the guard will have already killed you because it takes a few seconds to get into that position, and believe me, you don't have a SECOND to waste once a guard spots you.  I want a gun that features a QUICK lock-on target (such as a gun with high amounts of firepower and frequently-available ammo packs).  That way it won't feel hopeless when a million guards are after me.

Besides a bit of overall darkness, a lengthy storyline and sometimes unfair situations regarding aiming and shooting, I have no other problems with the game.  These are really minor problems and it's easy for me to look past them.  A game that I SHOULD have given more attention to before attempting to give a final verdict.  Metal Gear Solid is a classic game.  It just took me a while to see that.",2.0
"This game plays wonderfully.  The movement, graphics and fighting are very well done.  The problem is just that the games plotline was terriblly designed.  I had so much money and so many potions by the end that there was no way that I could possibly lose.  The game is so short it is hard to call it a real RPG.  It only took me ten hours or so to beat.  Each time you meet a new enemy the game becomes challangeing for about three or four minutes before you figure out how to beat that creauture.  The magic is well done graphicly and the healing and invisibilty spells are somewhat usefull, but not nessesarry to winning.  The offensive spells are just useless.  They are hard to cast and don't cause enough damage to warent their use.  If the people who created this game had taken just a little bit longer to make the game longer and more challengeing this game would really be worth having.",2.0
"Come now, who here really thinks they put some time into designing this  game?  The game's story is as horrible as it is clich and is being voice  acted by people that sound too much like a student film class working on a  mid-term project.
Combat consistis of clicking your mouse button in timed  bursts or uning an asinine keybord interface to swing your weapon in three  different strengths.  Whee.
Magic spell creation is novel, but quickly  become tedious and dangerous in the middle of combat when you're trying  like a madman (or madwoman) to heal yourself, but can't get the runes  lined-up in time.
And even the graphics, which are nice, are loaded with  bugs.  In most cases, whenever an enemy would drop an item, the background  would spring 'holes' of black space around it and cause nemerous graphic  flaws until it would finally crash without explination.  Furthermore, some  enemies would become 'stuck' in some void on your screen preventing you  from being able to attack it!

My other concern is more a matter of personal taste - the whole scenario is surreal.  A rabbit goes into a tree and then enters rooms in a dollhouse.  I guess this wouldn't bother most young children but somehow the animation seems just slightly off to me - a little dark, or strange, or something.  Not bad or spooky, just odd.

"I'm a huge fan of the TR series, and I like the movies  as well. TR1 and TR2 were the best in terms of story, pacing and action. The CG sequences were cooler too.  I hate to say it, but I'm disappointed in this game. TOO SLOW! The levels go on forever, and there's nothing to keep your interest. Ocassionally you will have a ninja jump out at you, or some scorpians, but that's not enough to keep you interested.
The other problems is the levels require too much backtracking and are too complicated. I got stuck numerously and ending up getting a code off the internet to skip levels.  The beginning of the game shows promise with young Lara, and there is a very cool level where Lara has to manuver a jeep in the desert and over cliffs and whatnot.
I don't know what I can recommend instead of this one, but I would say rent it or get it for cheap like $5 or less used or new. She tomb raids for too long with little payoff.",2.0
"I, like most who have played this game, am a huge fan of the Tomb Raider series.  I especially enjoy the puzzle solving of the first game and the action/adventure element and increased pace of the second one.  This series starts off promisingly enough.  Outside of a mandatory (groan) training level, the game eases you into the tried-and-true Tomb Raider gameplay we all have grown to love.  The environments are large and exciting, the puzzles clever.  Exploration is fun and rewarding, and progress is logical.  For the first 6 or 7 hours.  The challenge level really picks up after the VERY neat train level, and in fact starts to become downright maddening.  Do we really have to backtrack for 3 hours just to find 7 scattered items required to make it through to the next level?  Things get flat-out obnoxious at the Chambers Of Tulun and the Trenches.  This area goes something like this: rope swing to hit a switch that unlocks an invincible guy in a room.  Go to the Citadel Gate level to obtain a nitrous oxide canister.  Return to the Chambers and go to the Trenches.  Obtain the nitrous oxide feeder.  Return to the Chambers of Tulun to obtain the roof key.  Go back to the Trenches to get to the Street Bazaar.  Get the car jack and mine detonator so you can get back to the Trenches.  And so on and so on and so on.  Is this mad jumble of item dispersion that is being passed for level design really necessary?  I really enjoy the high challenge level of the Tomb Raider series, but this is ridiculous.  If I didn't have a strategy guide with me, I wouldn't have made it to the Citadel (which is where I am right now).  This game is loads of fun for about 20 or 25 levels; afterwards, it becomes a chore to play.  The graphics and presentation have not been improved drastically since the first Tomb Raider, and the legendary level design has regressed considerably.  Many spots feel cheap, rather than challenging.  Control, while still functional, still isn't perfect, and it causes every jump to be deliberate and nerve-wracking.  If you miss and survive, then you have to make another series of jumps, which can take another 10 minutes just to get back to where you originally were.  I could go on and on, but this game is just too much.  Get this only if you're a die-hard TR fan; but be prepared to fork out some extra cash for a strategy guide.",2.0
"Let me start off by saying that Metal Gear Solid was a solid game (no pun intended). This is a limited text box, so I'll cut right to it. I've listed  some good and bad aspects of the game below. Let's start with the  good:
1. Smooth, flowing storyline
2. Great cinematics
3. Ability to  flatten against a wall when you push the D-pad towards it.
4. Relatively  smart AI (guards hear certain noises, see footprints in the snow and FOLLOW  them, etc)
5. Ability to distract guards by tapping on metal.
6.  Creative weapons (claymore mines, stun grenades, etc)
7. Ketchup  :)
HOWEVER, having said that, I would like to point out I played the  Syphon Filter series before playing MGS. While many people criticize Syphon  as a knockoff of MGS, I found several problems with Metal Gear (compared to  Syphon Filter):
1. The overhead view is maddening! Unlike Syphon (which  is 3rd person, right behind your character), MGS forces you to stand  vulnerably idle to look in first person mode (triangle button).
2.  Inability to aim. Unlike Syphon, you can't easily aim in MGS (if at all),  manually or automatically. What's worse is, you can't see what you're  shooting at if the character is *just* offscreen (but definitely within  sights). Again, back to problem #1.
3. Having to find two items to  operate the sniper rifle appropriately: the rifle AND tranquilizers? That's  a little overboard. If you can't find the drugs in the cave, your gun  shakes uncontrollably, basically rendering it useless. Three more  complaints about the sniper rifle: a)your scope can't zoom in or out; b)to  operate it, you're vulnerably lying down in the open so your enemy can pick  you off; and c) your scope moves *excruciatingly* slowly, which is a big  danger when you've just been hit and need to re-aim the gun.
4. Inability  to stand behind a wall/truck and strafe to shoot. That was the biggest  drawback to this game. This was *especially* problematic with the sniper  rifle (see #3). In Syphon Filter, meanwhile, you are able to stand behind a  wall as you orient yourself and duck out when you're ready.
*My advice*:  Borrow the game from a friend/rent it. Decide whether you like it before  buying it.",2.0
"I finally got around to playing Thief and, given all its wonderful press, I ended up disappointed. Yes, I know the graphics engine is outdated now but even when it came out it must not have been that great. I found the constant stealth factor to actually not be that fun and found it very aggravating at times. Sometimes it takes ALOT of playing time to negotiate and area correctly without alerting the guards. I also found the player controls a little more stiff or crude or less responsive or something than most games of this nature. I played through alot of the first level and then gave up. Maybe it was a blast when it came out but now there are alot of other games that will give me much more fun and excitement. I will give Thief II a try (I already own it) but I feel it will be more of the same.",2.0
"I remember when I played the demo for this game. It was brilliant - you could stealth around, you had to be startegic and the atmosphere 10 times as tense as any other game ever. You had to loot a mansion and you could pick up some jewels for yourself as well. You had to AVOID making a comotion. The use of sound and light (or lack of them) was excellent as well. It was one of the best levels of any game I had ever played.
I got my hands on the full version and rushed through the first level, eagar to see what theivery lay ahead. When I started playing the second level I found myself making my way through a haunted mine where I had to avoid zombies, kill spiders and eventually free someone from a prison. The whole thieving aspect had been taken away, and not only had degenerated into a standard cliched fantasy hack n slash affair, it was a BAD hack n slash affair. The next 2 or 3 levels were the same. Yes, you had to be stealthy, but not in the same context. I never played on - I had no motivation to.
This could have been one of the best games ever, but in attempting to appeal to the mainstream (lets face it, the thievery aspect wouldn't have sold well on consoles) they messed it up, and they didn't even do the ""it's-been-done-before"" bit well. At least if it was done well it could have offered some short-term enjoyment (albeit forgetable) so that I wouldn't have completely wasted my money, but as it is it was a missed oportunity. Doesn't even deserve the tag ""Thief"" most of the time.",2.0
Nice game with a slightly high learning curve. Just like real fishing it requires some degree of patience.,2.0
As for a star rating I can't really say for sure because THIS GAME WILL NOT WORK ON PS2 OR PS3 and since my PS1 crapped out in my I can't play the game but I hear that the game is very underrated. I hope to be able to play it somehow sometime soon but I figured I should let people know this game only works on PS1,2.0

What is fun is playing with two players, but even  that doesn't make it any easier.  I would say if you can get this game for  under ten bucks and only want about five or six hours of gameplay out of it  it is worth it.",2.0

"I am totally at a loss for this game.  On one hand it has so many original idea's in terms of both plot and gameplay (And has the closest thing to a sim dating game we'll probably ever see), but the way you actually play it leaves me at a loss for words.  It's not that the battle system makes no sense, or is bad even, it's the leveling up that confuses me.  You don't get stronger when you level up.  Your defense gets weaker when you level up.  You get more health but you seem to loose more health at the same token too.  I'm am at a loss that the creaters of this game could make so many good idea's and make them so poor because they can't figure out commen sense when it comes to leveling up.

I used PSXMC to listen to it. so never really liked the game because of the 2d style gameplay, definitely don't like it now since they change the soundtrack and stuff on it.

"Preface: I bought this raunchy little gem in the hopes of introducing my friend to the genre.

Pros: It was in good condition. It was what I ordered. It worked just fine.

Cons: The Playstation version is significantly less groovy than the PC version (i.e. the graphics were worse, and it had NO MULTIPLAYER, which was really the only reason I bought it) *sniffles*

Overall: I wouldn't buy it again, since it didn't have multiplayer. Buy the PC version instead.

Thoughts: I wish I'd known they were so different.",2.0
"In Rainbow Six, you assemble a highly skilled team of anti terrorist commandos, plan out your assault and then control one or more of the team as you commence your invasion.
The critical item to note here is that the majority of the game is spent choosing your team, equiping them properly and then planning out the raid.  This is not Syphon Filter where you jump into a room of bad guys and blaze away.  You can be killed in a single shot.  Once the action begins, you can play any one of the raid team that is engaging the enemy, otherwise the sophisticated computer AI will guide them according to your plans.
I agree with the reviews that suggest that you rent this game first.  It is very detailed and realistic.  If you don't want to spend hours analyzing and preparing the missions, then you wont't appreciate the game's considerable depth.
I find that the detail level does not lend itself well to the standard dreamcast controller.  There are too many things to do and the interface layout is awkward without a keyboard and mouse.  I also found that the action part of the game (moving the aiming cursor) was overly sensitive and very frustrating to use.
The other reason that this game does not rate highly for me was the poor, boxey graphics and the medicore sound.  They just do not take advantage of the Dreamcast capabilities.  On the otherhand, the game does have a lot of replay value and very sophisticated AI.",2.0

"I used to play MORTAL KOMBAT 4 in the arcades back in 90's and it was such a great Arcade game, I just loved it. I didn't buy it for consoles, I had both Playstation and Nintendo 64, I think I was playing Command and Conquer and Turok 2 around that time. So Thirteen Years later, I decided to buy it for Playstation, and This game is BAD! BAD! BAD!. First, the graphics are inexcusable, all the sprites are squared and untextured; and when playing, the fighters feel like stick figures. Second, Goro wasn't in the Arcade version and really cheapens the game, it is so lame that the developers spammed his moves, two grapple punches from Goro kills you (unblockable) and when he's not using that move he's doing his Teleport Stomp (unblockable). Third, all the ending videos, they tell no story and they're badly produced. I guess worth Ten Dollars Nowadays but good thing I didn't get ripped off for Forty-Five Dollars in the Oldendays. MORTAL KOMBAT KLASSIC for consoles, MORTAL KOMBAT 4 for consoles, and MORTAL KOMBAT: ARMAGEDDON  are the three worst of the Franchise. The Three Best Of The Franchise So Far Are MORTAL KOMBAT: DEADLY ALLIANCE, MORTAL KOMBAT VERSUS DETECTIVE COMICS UNIVERSE, and MORTAL KOMBAT 3/ULTIMATE MORTAL KOMBAT 3. I am really excited for the new reboot of the Franchise MORTAL KOMBAT(2011).",2.0

"For those of you who don't know, you play the game as one of three towering monsters, a werewolf, giant lizard or giant ape and the point is to destroy cities across the world. Sure the original arcade game is a classic, with lots of punching and smashing to offer, however this game ""world tour"" does not have much to offer in terms of fun. Its fun for about the first five or ten minutes, beating, smashing, punching and kicking, then the reality sets in that this is a tedious game. There are over 100 cities and each city is not just a screen, it's a side scrolling level! It wouldn't be so bad if the enemies were not horrendous! Its not just ten enemies on a screen at once, its about thirty to fifty at some points, shooting, bombing, flame throwing, flying and stomping you. The entire game despite being 100 cities can be defeated in a single day but does have a save feature with the memory packs. There is a nice plus though, lots of moves to learn and master, lots of detail, each city looks unique and features landmarks of that city and it is very educational for children to learn geographical locations. Don't pay more than ten bucks for this game though.",2.0
"As much as I want to be able to like this game, I just can't.  The original idea is still a good one (control one of three gorillas and level  one city after another), but I think it's finally been exhausted.  When I  frist started playing this game (with a friend), I was having fun.  But as  the levels progressed the experiance soon became mind-numbing.  I know that  the game is just supposed to be a fun excursion but it could at least  demonstrate some kind of variety within the levels.  Each time you play a  level the whole experiance becomes more boring.  I began to dread having 80  or so cities left to destroy.  Also, the multiplayer could have been  improved.  The only difference between it and single player is that you now  have two or three people destroying building, and they have the ability to  punch each other.  I really expect better of Midway, which is usually a  company that puts out good games, and I still can't believe that they made  a sequel to this without any significant changes.  Almost nothing has  changed even from the original Rampage of the 80's.  It's time that Midway  either puts the series to bed or makes it more interesting.  To wrap things  up, this is a game that starts out as a very entertaining cartrige but  quickly takes a turn for the worse.  Rent this game...don't buy it, since  you'll be tired of it before the game is due back.",2.0
"I don't know how people are rating this game so highly.  I am a huge MK fan, but this game defines why I try to forget that MK3 and UMK3 came into existence.  This is an absolutely horribly programmed one player game.  The computer controlled players anticipate and counter every single move you do even on very easy!  You have to pick Motaro just to make it to the end, and then who had the brilliant idea of giving Shao Kahn a throw-there goes the one way you could beat him with most players.  Avalance software must have spent one day configuring the AI for this stinker.  Then, to make matters worse, the Playstation D-pad controls like a tuna boat in a boat race.  Good luck not breaking your controller as you watch your character get decimated and wonder why the move you tapped in did not work, over and over again.  Then after I finally beat the game with Scorpion, the machine crashed twice so who knows if he has an ending or not.
The only reason I gave it two stars, is that with two people you do get an almost arcade perfect MK experience, but you still deal with the absolutely ridiculous characters of MK3 and UMK3 and all its palette swaps.  My advice is to turn off aggressor mode as well as all of those cheap auto combos and pretend you are playing MKII with some extra backgrounds.",2.0
"This game was quite... what's a nice word for it... bad. I don't completely remember, but I think this game was given to me for a birthday present or something, so I do feel bad for whoever it was who gave it to me... what a waste of good money. Sure, at times it could be addicting, but it's way too repetitive and too long.
I think I'll sell it the first chance I get. I don't care what kind of games you like, don't get this one at all.",2.0
"This is actually one of my favorite games, so I thought I'd get a copy to get some more games for my PS1.
My disc came 2 days after I ordered it, which was a pleasant surprise. Unfortunately, however, while the case was in really good condition, the game itself wasn't. It was pretty beat up to say the least. After a couple minutes, I got it to load, but the game was skipping like a music CD, or more accurate to the problem, like playing a game that's a tad too high quality for your PC to play.
Bottom line: If you want to get this game, make sure you get it from a place or seller you trust, If you want to get the game and not risk too much damage on the game itself, I can only reccomend getting the N64 version, more or less because an N64's cartridge will last much longer than a PS1's disc. If not that, than I'd reccomend just getting Rampage: Total Destruction, which includes both the original Rampage and this on one disc.",2.0

"Mortal Kombat Trilogy was a popular game back in the early days of the Playstation's existence. Even before the Playstation Mortal Kombat was known as a groundbreaking game for its graphic violence on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. It was the first of its kind, or one of the first. Looking back at the old 2D fighter games, despite the heavy amount of blood and all the creative fatalities, Mortal Kombat STINKS, plain and simple. The game tries to look dangerous and back in the day it really WAS a threat. Parents were terrified that their children might experience all the blood and gore.

We're talking nearly 14 years since the original Mortal Kombats release, and now we can look at the Mortal Kombat series for what it really is: a cheesy-looking and crappy series of uninteresting tournament fighting. That's what the entire series is (until the game turned 3D, then I don't know WHAT to think). Just the way the two fighters attack each other is SO boring. Even the best fighters like Sub-Zero and Noob Saibot are a total bore.

Midway thought they really had something going when they created Mortal Kombat Trilogy. It featured nearly EVERYBODY from the previous Mortal Kombat games. How can it be bad? Well, besides the reasons I mention above, the Playstation version is murdered with INCREDIBLE amounts of loading times. People can say the Playstation was a bad system when it came to loading all they want, but the fact remains Mortal Kombat Trilogy is quite possibly the most annoying game when it comes to waiting to play the freaking thing. Sometimes you have to wait almost a minute before the game *finally* loads the fight screen. And the fighting is so bad (because the entire Mortal Kombat series up until this point is severely dated and horrible) that the loading times are actually the part I look forward to the most.

I'll give the game one extra point for featuring all the fighters in one nifty little package. Besides that. BAD game.",2.0

"I picked up Soul Reaver thinking that I was going to have something as good - if not better than - Blood Omen, the game coming before it.  To say ""I was let down"" would probably make understatement of the year.  The dismal world of Soul Reaver is more like an empty exploration game than an RPG or action game.  The monsters are mundane, the hero is dull and one-sided and the ending (or lack thereof) is the worst pile of snot I've ever had the displeasure of getting from hard hours invested in a video game.  Soul Reaver has it's few and far moments, but does not live up to the Legacy of Kain title.",2.0
This game started out fun but after about an hour of play I became very bored and frustrated with the frickin' horrible camera angles the computer  gives you.

"Oh wow....I remember playing this colossal flaming pile of turd. A friend of mine rented this game from Blockbuster for a couple of days. And I wished we both could have taken back the time we wasted.

They had great ideas for this game: You take Sub Zero from the Mortal Kombat series, use this opportunity to tell people more about his back story and his battle against monks, set it in cool locales and incorporate MK inspired game play and controls in an action adventure, side scroller with light RPG influences. What could possibly go wrong??? How about....EVERYTHING in this game.

First off, Sub Zero walks and controls like a robot. Second, this game uses every button on the controller (you even have a separate button to hit when you want him to face the direction to walk!) Third, you unlock his special moves as you progress through the game and while many use the same directional pad + button combinations in Mortal Kombat, they are 100 times harder to pull off. The bosses are petty damn hard so expect to die a lot. The graphics and sound do their job in setting the mood for the game, while the music is standard MK and kung fu inspired theatrical sounding. The PS1 version features full motion cut-scenes between the stages you fight in while the N64 gets the standard static artwork.

I give it two stars for the cool music and graphics for its time. But that alone will not make a great game. You may be tempted to pick this up if you love Mortal Kombat and the price is right. DON""T DO IT!! This is an example of how Midway had great ideas for this game but executed these great ideas very poorly.",2.0
"I admit I did put hours into this game being the hugh Mortal Kombat fan that I am. Gosh I'm sure happy this embarrassing MK game didn't ruin Subzero's career. It is a side scroller in which you are faced with many evil monks (oh, and they're all twins for some reason)..Subzero has many power-ups that prove useless. The mega-sized bosses are boring to fight (oh, and they never die for some reason). Due to the fact that the game supplies no level maps (how generic) a strategy guide would be a must, that is if you cared to bother with the game in the first place. Two good things did come about from this MK disaster.. Quan Chi & Shinnok. For Mortal Kombat that is a must see ""MK4"" or the new ""MK Deadly Alliance"". Leave this one in the past where it never should have spawned. 2 1/2 stars is as high as I could go. I'm generous.",2.0
"Don't buy this game. I've been playing it recently, and although the graphics and gameplay aren't bad, everything else is, especially the cameras. When you're playing, the automatic camera angles are horrible, and I find myself often readjusting them manualy. It becomes almost impossible to fight more than two other men at the same time without dying, because you need to see them to shoot them, and therefore have to readjust the cameras; two shots later and I'm dead. Quite frustrating. Also, the game only has 4 guns, a pistol with unlimited ammo, and shotgun with little ammo, a automatic but not very powerful rifle with limited ammo, and a rocket launcher, with only four rockets. There is also C4 explosives. This does not make for very fun gameplay. If I were you, I would put your money towards another first person shooter, such as GoldenEye 007 or something newer.",2.0

Every time you restart the game after quitting, you are taken to the beginning screen, when you should be taken to the load/save option. I admit this is a small detail to dislike, but none the less, it is unacceptable for an adventure game.
Some puzzles were very difficult to solve. I had to replay the 1940's scene many times just to get my idiotic character to say one particular line just so I could move the radio dial to enter a room, which would enable me to finally finish the scenario in one minute.
The somewhat creepy sounds and music, and the fact that it deals with the paranormal are the only reasons why I rate this game with two stars...",2.0

"Midway, in an-all out effort to publish as many fighting games as humanly possible has given the world Mortal Kombat Gold, an ""update"" to  the mildly popular MK4 seen in arcades everywhere a couple of years  ago.
To warrant this title's port to the DC, Midway included some  ""new"" characters.  Cyrax, Mileena, Kitana, Baraka and Kung Lao  are all standing by to be beheaded at your leisure.  I'll admit, it was fun  to play as my old favorite Baraka, but I found his return to be a bit  lackluster.
None of the fatalities you'll see from the new guys are  original, all are merely 3D updates of MK2 and MK3.  I found Cyrax's  ""blowing up the world"" move terribly lame, as will you.  And  suprisingly, Baraka's victims don't bleed when he impales them.  Otherwise,  you'll find all of the characters present in the home games from last year,  including the console-only Goro.  Also, savvy players can unlock Noob  Saibot and Sektor, via secret codes (don't tell).
Let's get one thing  straight.  Graphic-wise, this game mirrors the arcade perfectly.  That's  one smooth box of chips Sega's got.  The character models are back to the  3,000-polygon count (up from the PS and N64's dozen or so polygons per  fighter) and the colors are bright and vibrant, with no pixelization.  However, there's a few oddball things that stand out.  For example, for all  of its 22nd-century power, the Dreamcast can't deliver shadows that don't  look like bouncing boxes strung together?  I don't think so, Midway.  Plus,  you'll see several of the same animations again and again and  again.
Gameplay also mirrors the previous home releases.  Jump, combo,  special move, jump, combo fatality.  The AI isn't particularly bright,  especially on the stages where rocks and other debris litter the ground.
Sound-wise, the game is adequate.  The new characters use recycled  sounds from old MK games, as do the new stages (also taken from old  games.)
All in all, if you haven't played MK4, and you have a Dreamcast,  you may enjoy this title.  The action is swift and pretty, and there's lots  of fun blood and mutilations (parents beware.) Otherwise, this title is old  news that could have benefitted from a little more development time.",2.0
"This is a very disappointing version of a great game. The manufacturers have disgregarded the system-specific needs of macs and opted instead for a crude port of the PC version.

Disappointing.",2.0
"I can see how some folks would enjoy a pure arcade version with no reality whatsoever involved.  Myself, I think I'd like something more realistic.
First downs are 30 yards, there are no penalties, there's no kickoff, and there is no realism involved as far as athletic ability of the players.  For example, if you complete a pass from Young to Rice (remember, this is 2000!), and Rice has the open field, two defenders are actually able to catch up to Rice and tackle him.  This is flat out ridiculous, even for an arcade game.  Ditto Terrell Owens and Tim Brown, and I was able to stop other wideouts with linebackers just by squeezing the turbo button.
The emphasis is obviously on bone-crushing tackles, but after an hour of play, the only really enjoyable aspect of this is the ability to cheap-shot the offensive players long after the ball is whistled dead.  The field-goal kicking system is particularly vexing, as it was apparently designed by a chimp with ADD, and requires eight espresso-mochacchinos in order to maintain the twitch focus required to accurately split the uprights.
Overall, I see this as a fun arcade game for younger kids not up to simulation-level gameplay, and guys/gals who just want to have fun beating each other's players up.  Me, if I want to beat up some guy, I'll play Soul Calibur.",2.0

The unit was delivered quickly and appeared to be in good condition. While I knew the battery compartment cover was missing I did not expect to have only a Black and White screen display.

"Why did you do this id? No wait. . . I understand why, but it's still no excuse to create a game like this. Multiplayer only? OK, OK, I need to settle down here. First of all I need to explain my situation. I have Internet access but not the kind to play this game, I have a lowly 56k modem with a (insert appropriate insult here) connection. This type of connection is definitely not the best connection, even for games that have low data transfer like Diablo or Ultima. However, in my apartment complex we created our own Ethernet LAN with the main hub in my own apartment, perfectly ideal for this type of game. Does this mean that I play this game? Yes, sort of. Does that mean that I like it? I wish I could.
I've rewritten this paragraph four times already. There is no way to express my dislike for this game. Simply put, players will get separated into two groups. Those with the skills to pummel anyone who comes into the arena, and those who get pummeled. Unfortunately, the ""Pummelers"" are few and far between. Most of the ""pummeled"" will be amateurs, they'll buy the game, play through a few deaths and erase the game from their hard drive. My LAN mysteriously ""empties"" out when I offer up a game of Q3. id blew it with this one. Poorly thought out, this game serves only the elite few with the grit, skill, determination, and fast connection to play this game. Lets hope that id gets a brainstorm and comes up with an actual story line for the next game instead of taking the easy way out like they did with this one.
Remember, I'm not saying the multiplayer is bad. The multiplayer is awesome! It's the lack of the single player that makes this game blow. In fact, it's the lack of everything else that makes me want to lose my lunch.",2.0
"I like action games and FPS's so naturally I tried out Q3A. Unfortunatly, this really stinks. The lackluster single-player is basically running around a small, uninspired map shooting and the intelligent blur that is  your opponent. Speaking of AI, after the first half of the single-player  game the enemies you face are literally impossible to beat unless you have  cheat codes. Xaero is especially frustrating because his aim is always  perfect. That's not intelligence, that's inhuman perfection. Another  problem is the weapons that haven't changed (except for power and rate of  fire changes) since the original Quake. I gave Q3A 2 stars because it did  have an ambitious idea but it didn't make it. I also own UT (you can see my  review of that too) and it is much better so buy it instead.",2.0
"First off let me say that i've been looking forward to this game since Q2.  I've never played Unreal but plan to soon, so i'm not knocking this game for that reason.
  The graphics are great...if you have the right 3d  card.  I have an ATI RAGE PRO that's done real well with most everything  until now.  Occasionally the game will freeze me in one spot on the level  and i can't move, although i can fire.  If i exit the game and then try to  re-enter the game the graphics will be totally scrambled unless i change my  display settings to 16 hi color 640x480, or reboot my pc entirely.  Just  because the box states that it works with certain manufactures cards  doesn't mean it will work well.
  As far as playing is concerned if you  don't have internet access don't bother.  The best part of this game is the  multiplayer aspect.  The solo deathmatches get very boring very fast.  There is no level playing field, you can't adjust any of the computer bots  to do better or worse....and most of them have a much better aim than  you'll find yourself having.
  In single player mode you'll basically  find yourself running around in circles trying to kill the bot before the  bot gets you.  After the initial wow of the graphics fades there isn't  much more to experience in single mode.
  Don't get me wrong, i like the  game but it was not what i expected.  If you expect something along the  lines of Q, Q2, you'll be very disappointed.",2.0
"Although a lot of people liked this game I hated it. For one thing this game was WAAAAYYYYYY too easy (I beat this game in three days playing only  1 hour a day! The first game had me playing for mounths! )! You're supposed  to find this fairy to give you all your powers back, and yet you start the  game with all your powers! Plus I don't care how good the graphics are,  Rayman does NOT look good in 3D and does not belong in 3D! So get the first  game, I don't recomend this game to ANYONE!",2.0
"I've always kinda liked the final fantasy series and I liked this one too, the gameplay is pretty good and the characters too. But every game has its flaws. The graphics are pretty bad and certain enemies can use instant kill attacks the first turn, meaning there's nothing you could've done to avoid it. Seriously? How dumb is that. You can't defend any of your characters before the attack happens, so you've got no choice but to die instantly. On top of this the GFs attacks take way too long to happen. To be specific, 30 seconds. The game should give you the option to skip through cutscenes and gf attacks if you've seen them like a billion times already. As if this wasn't bad enough, it took me literally forever to get the GF doomtrain and the first time I used his attack it did next to no damage at all. As if all my hard work was spent for nothing. I should've gotten something worth my while. All in all, I won't say it's a completely bad game. But certain elements in this should have definitely been edited to make them somewhat fair. If squaresoft ever decides to design a remake with all the annoying parts cut out, I'd definitely buy it.",2.0
"I spent countless company hours playing Doom and downloading new and interesting patches in the days before there was a world wide web (Remember Gopher and Lynx?). Since then I've greeted each new offering from iD with  great anticipation and excitement which has always been rewarded until Q3A.  What were they thinking?
This is Quake meets the American  Gladiators--Wasn't that Turbo I saw with the cushioned-ended baton?I don't  need a shotgun--I need a tennis ball cannon, some goofy-looking protective  eyewear, and a retarded-looking helmet. Gone are the adventurous missions  winding your way deeper into unknown enemy territory where after some  serious combat and blood you might be lucky enough to stumble, bleeding and  confused, into a secret that just might save your life. Instead, you now  run, run, run, run-around in circles. It's like running a marathon on a 440  yd track--no mystery, no exploration, just blind atheleticism.
OK . . .  Cool graphics. Nice out-of-the-box Internet interface. So what? It's all  been wasted on a game that was ill-conceived the moment they abandoned  their loyal fan base--blood-thirsty, sex-starved, eternally adolescent  males with a taste for mayhem and destruction.",2.0
"THE GOOD: If you want deathmatch, this is unbelievable. Unreal Tournament looks like stick-figures fighting compared to Q3. Q3 is all about graphics.. lotsa blood and body parts flying.
THE BAD: Sound for Q3  stinks. For all the bad-ass graphix, sound still hasn't evolved from  cartoonland beeps and bells.  Most of all, forget about single player, NO  ONE buys this game for single-player, there isn't one.
THE UGLY: Forget  about system requirements on the box. To play Q3 so that it actually works,  you need at least 400Mhz processor and a spanking new video card.  Even the  video cards the box says will work, like Voodoo, will give you major  problems.  You better spend $300+ on some TNT2 Ultra video card if you want  this thing to work.  And MOST IMPORTANTLY, you MUST MUST have cable modem.  56K doesn't cut it. you simply cannot play, because you'll be 1000 times  slower than eveyone else (even with the lowest graphic detail and no sound,  animations). You'll die die die and that's no fun, and there's no single  player game to fall back on.
SUMMARY: This is not a $40 game for most  people (like me). I had to spend $300 for a new video card even though my  original card was ""ok"" by the boxes standards. And I had to buy a  cable modem + monthly service fees. You better have deep pockets to play  Q3.  But as a game, and not a tech-project, Q3 rocks!  After 30mins of  play, I walk away from my computer shell-shocked, like i was in a savage  bloody war, try taking 30 vivarin and washing it down with a pitcher of  coffee for the same effect =).
Oh yeah, one last thing, forget about  tech-support.  They didn't help me, and apparently didn't help others who  wrote reviews.  If you're computer can't run Q3 for whatever reason.. its  YOUR problem and YOUR money.",2.0
"""The Ultimate Deathmatch Experience"". This is the motto of the game. Sounds fun. But killing and being killed by either the rocket launcher and rail gun and in one shot 20 times a minute is not my  definition of fun. It's just basically point and shoot and hit space to  respawn. Only good side to the game are the incredible graphics. Nice eye  candy but then you have to by yourself a 3D accelerator because it won't  play without one. The sound is very shoddy, characters' moaning and  grunting sounds are terrible. Don't bother trying to run this on a dial-up  internet connection because the game will lag majorly. Single player game  gets boring because the bots don't use any strategies whatsoever. If you're  used to the class system of Team Fortress Classic or the team style play of  Starseige: Tribes then Quake 3: Arena will be a major disappointment. The  structure of the levels are weak in comparison to the previous mentioned  titles and the weapons are taken directly from the Quake II. Save your  money and buy Unreal: Tournament or the upcoming Team Fortress 2.",2.0
"I was very disappointed by Quake III, compared to UT its action and graphics lack severely. Online was a joke for I couldn't get it to function, even though UT works almost perfectly. Don't waste your cash, get  a real or Unreal game. Though it is kinda like Duke Nukem, only better.",2.0
"I loved this game, but I and many people I knew, had problems with the final disk of this version of the game on the Playstation 2. I am lucky I could hunt someone down with an original copy of the last disk and finish the game, but it was a pain.",2.0
"I'm a Quake fan and yes I got the game as well. But it was shocking to find out that this game is worse than previous ones. The deathmatch maps are just plain stupid, Quake2 had way better ones. And rocket jumps are  pretty useless too as the maps don't have good places, the teleporters and  those round Yellow jumping things have taken over. So if you got the game  already just convert the old maps to be played in Quake3's engine. The  charecters look good but the colors are a bit wierd in my vodoo3 3000 card.  Unreal Tournament & Decent 3 is way better than this crap. Only good  thing about the game is it's music & visuals...and I paid for it.  Nothing else. I look forward to Quake 4, hope ID don't repeat the same  mistake.",2.0

"If you love DM, and I mean love DM to pieces, then Q3A is for you.  It's Quakeworld with a breath of fresh new graphics.  If you want something really exciting, then go somewhere else.  I found the game to be very very  boring.  I've been playing Quake since pre Quake World and this game was a  huge let down for me.  There is a reason that everybody and their brother  are playing TFC online....it's much more team oriented and interactive=fun.  Straight DM is fun for about 10 min, for me at least.  UT, Half-Life with  TFC are 100 times more stimulating and fun that this game is.
Q3A  represents a technological leap, but not a leap in gaming.",2.0
"i got this game and didn't really play it my brother mostly did and he said is was an awesome game until you get to near the end of the second disc and it freezes at a boss

In summery  Q3 Great title, but you will need an ass kicking spec.",2.0
"I'm a huge Final Fantasy guy, but for me, 8 is just very close to trash.  I tried to play it right when it came out but I couldn't stand it right from the get go so I quit early.  I tried to play it again a few years ago and the same exact thing happened.  Finally a little while ago, I forced myself through it. No exaggeration.

So I started the game for the third time thinking, hey maybe it just takes time to catch on.  But no, I never really became addicted to the gameplay as I usually do in FF games.  The only way to get stronger is to find monsters with different spells and steal their spells for your attributes, which is fine and all, but it got extremely annoying having to do that until you reach 100 and for each character! It doesn't sound necessary but trust that's the only way to get stronger because as your level goes up, so do monster levels, so yes there's no point in even leveling up. Really stupid in my opinion, but it's a different type of thing that I think some people actually did like.  Not me. Every other FF was great as they were because they did not deviate the gameplay to this extent.

For every thing else, the story was a definite plunge from 7.  FF7 blew everyone away and when this cam out, the characters were ok, but the story was pretty lame, but not too, too terrible and the music was forgettable.  The environments were about matched with that of 7, but less enjoyable. So overall, this is not a great game.

I feel like this game is extremely overrated, getting so much positive feed back, but for what? My expectations were much higher after being so impressed by 7.  Maybe the bar was just set too high.  Maybe Square needed a break.  Then again, there are obviously people who love this style of gameplay, which gives them a much more different gaming experience.  Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst game ever, but it's just not the same Final Fantasy experience everyone loves.

So bottom line, if you're new to final fantasy and haven't played this yet, I would say consider a different FF game.  But give it a chance if you're not that picky with RPGs.  Just don't expect much.",2.0
"While Final Fantasy VIII is a great game within itself, I find it unfortunate that I have to give this copy that Amazon is distributing a poor review.  FF8 has a great story with an innovative (though sometimes overly complex) combat and magic system that sets it apart from any other RPG of its kind.  As a game, it is definitely one of the most original and higher-tier Final Fantasy Titles out there and is definitely worth playing if you're up for a challenge or something different in the FF series.

  The  reason that I give this product a low score, however, is that the quality of the physical product itself appears not to be up to snuff.  Amazon is selling the Square-Enix published ""Greatest Hits"" edition of the game (the original prints of the game were published when the company was still known as Squaresoft).  The game is a 4 disk title and when completing the third disk you are asked to insert disk 4 into whatever console you're playing on.  However, there seems to have been a defect in 'specifically' the 4th disk, because no console that is compatible with the game (Playstation, PS2, PS3) seems to recognize that the disk as being in Playstation format.  This renders the entire last fourth of the game as unplayable.  I've researched other forums and several other people seem to have had the same problem with the Greatest Hits version sold through Amazon, so I'm not the only one.  If Amazon can manage to get in a new batch of copies with functional 4th disks, this product is worth buying without a doubt.  Unfortunately that isn't the case now.",2.0
"Out of the box Q3A is terrible. It's like a Q2 clone, with all the same old weapons. Q3A is like a Friday the 13th movie nothing new and the format is just plain lame.

Hopefully TF2 will save the First Person Shooter, cause Q3A  sure doesn't.",2.0
"I know it is not fair to compare FFVII and FFVIII, but that is only because everything about FFVII was great, and most things about VIII were not. For example, the game is 4 discs long, (which is not the problem) but I had max stats at the end of disc one because of that damn junctioning system. All you have to do is find the powerful magic draw points, and bam! 9999 HP! Also, the story was really rushed. It was battle after battle with Squall (who was too quiet [making him mysterious..ohhh] and too much of a jerk) to get places that never explain anything. The main reason you fight Ultimecia is to stop her horrible time compression (what would that do, anyway?). The only connection between the characters is that they were all at the same orphanage, which doesn't mean anything. ""Wow! We went to the same orphanage?! We must be intimately linked in our destinies, or some crap like that. Oh, and because we have no reason NOT to remember that we did live together, I think I will blame it on the GF's. There is hardly any character development or storyline, and it had a bland magic system. There are only a few good things about this game, like the ability to finally break the 9,999 damage barrier, the cool GF's, and Squall's final limit break. I actually enjoyed this game the first time through, but then I went back and played FFVII, then replayed VIII, and realized what it was missing. Sorry if I offended anyone.",2.0
"First thing to remember with this game is - KEEP WITH IT. Once you have mastered the controls it does get better. Based on the Phantom Menace movie, you get to control the characters Obi-Wan, Queen Amidala and others. With various weapons, blasters, rocket launcher and the favourite - the light saber. Background music is great, the graphics aren't so great but still playable with. The Cut scenes are your standard fare but are pretty impressive. It does get hard in places but by using the 'try, try again' method you should eventually get through it, puzzles are solvable and light-saber duels near impossible. The only major aspect of the game that I was dissapointed with was the ending - you'll see what I mean when you get there.",3.0
"I bought this game for a friend of mine, who lives in Japan and has an American Playstation.  After a few weeks, he sold it back to me for half cost.  That pretty much says it all.  If you've seen the movie, you know the game.  There are relatively minor challanges, and once you've played it once, you never want to again.  If you like Star Wars, there are a LOT better games out there that you can buy.  This one's mediocre.",3.0
"I loved the game the first time i played it through, but as with MOST (not all) games, it got boring the second time around...:(...It strays far from the movie. It has the basic characters, but is not like the movie. You will recognize a few items and place from the movie...like the palace, of the last part of the game, where you defeat Darth Maul, but it was just kind of a game to sell and make money...It's fun, but doesn't last

"Where i live this game has been heavily criticised for being unoriginal and not very replayable. These are both fair criticisms as it is very much like games such as Tomb Raider and so on. It admittedly does not have a particularly good replay value except for finding the many secrets. However, i am an unusual gamer in that i do not care about either of these things. It seems that no matter what game it is, there are very few that i would return to. Also i have a policy of rarely purchasing games that are to similar, with a few exeeptions such has any Zelda game, Platformers and PokMon Gold. The point is that as a choice for your one Action/Adventure title, The Phantom Menace makes a pretty good case.
Technically it is not outstanding, with decent graphics and some neat effects(you will need a fairly powerful PC to prevent slowdown.). The sound and music is very good however and all the familiar music from the film is included. It must be pointed out that TPM has excellent ambeint sounds, such as wildlife squaking and people talking. The secrets in the game are quite plentiful with maybe 4-5 hidden items on each of the 11 levels maybe less, maybe more. A major complaint directed towards TPM is its dodgy control system, the keys are redifinable however, so this should not be a problem.
GRAPHICS: 73% Jagged graphics and slowdown are made up for through the use of neat effects. Mmmm... Burn marks
SOUND: 92% Terrific music, sound effects and ambient noises.
Mmmm... Duel of Fates
GAMEPLAY: 78% Seen a million times gameplay, but i like it. Mmmm... Dozens of hidden items.
SOMETHING OR OTHER: 56% Really lacking in this department. Gets most of it for being Star Wars. Mmmm... Star Wars.
OVERALL: 71% A few problems. But i reccomend it over Tomb Raider. Mmmm... Mediocre",3.0

"First off let me say this: I'm 29, and in general I hate Pokemon. I think it's one of the most over-commercialized things I've seen in my whole life. But my kid loves them, and as a result I checked this game out to see if I thought he'd like it as a gift. As it turns out, it's WAY above his level (he's only 4), but in the process of checking the game out I really decided this game was pretty cool.  As has probably been said about 50 times already, the main aspect of the game is battling your pokemon against others, in an attempt to capture as many of them as possible. Although it doesn't sound like that big of a deal, what I found most interesting was this:  In the game you can have up to six pokemon with you at any given time to use in battles, and there are something like 150 of them throughout the game that you can collect and use. There are several ""types"" of pokemon, all of which have certain strengths and weaknesses against other types. So as a result when you go into battle not only do you have to think about how advanced your current ""party"" is getting (which is all there is to most RPG's I've seen on the gameboy), you also have to take into consideration which pokemon out of all those you've collected will do the best in that group of six that you can take with you on your quest. On the downside, unlike some of the RPG's on the gameboy that have been considered among the best such as Zelda and Final Fantasy, there doesn't seem to be a lot in the way of quests, side quests, or other things you need to do, other than just walk around an area fighting pokemon until they get strong enough to beat a gym trainer, which opens up the next area for you to wander around in fighting until you get strong enough to open up the next, and etc. This probably makes it a game that is good for younger players who might have trouble following all the different storyline aspects of some of the ""bigger"" RPGs, but still as a result it leaves me wanting a lot more story depth than there is. The game has a lot of interesting aspects, and it can be fun to find and train all the new varieties of pokemon as the game progresses, but I feel anyone who is a teenager or older would probably get more enjoyment out of one of the ""heftier"" RPG's.",3.0
"Out of all my friends, I must have been the last kid to get this game. I was not regretting it when I asked for it and got it for Christmas, because this game was so cool at first. On Christmas day of 1998, I must have played this game all day. In three days, I had all eight badges, and enough to take on the Elite Four. It took me a little while to beat them, I did. And that's when I got sick of the game. The thing is, after you beat the Elite Four, what you have is a group of superpowerful Pokemon that can only fight wild Pokemon, and you need to catch the rest of the Pokemon. The game becomes a big nothing. It's fun to raise low level Pokemon if you still have trainers you haven't fought, but besides that, it's a pretty big nothing. All you can really do is fight wild Pokemon, walk around, get lost(Which is hard because the game's map is too easy to figure out), and go shopping for items you probably won't need. I have never gotten all 151 Pokemon, because it gets so boring at around 120 that I can't stand it. The game is fun if you use cheats like starting off with Mew and multiplying items, but besides that, it's pretty boring. I'd say to buy it, but the fad is over now, and nobody cares. Playing Pokemon these days makes you an outcast. Only buy this if you're not afraid of ruining whatever reputation you have.

I like the powerups especially, like the home run bat from earthbound, a lightsaber, a bobomb, etc... However, there are some cons to this game as well. Mainly, for all other people claim differently, the characters aren't balanced. Link with an experienced player will whoop most other characters, and certain characters, such as the big and lumbering donkey kong are way easier to knock off the edge. Also, some characters like the unlockable jiggly puff are lame, single player is boring, and some of the arenas are tiny, making it near impossible to avoid getting knocked off if your character lacks some sort or float or teleport move.

The game repetitive , annoying , trivial and of course my favorite definition meaningless to me, i felt that alot more could have been done to make this game a great classic, but only the characters can stand out!!!! nothing else, not even the game play, my little bro loves this game so i guess it's worth a play if you have an infantile intellects laterzzzz folks / gamers",3.0

"First, get this straight. If you're one of those Nintendo owners who invites all their buddies over to have a go at Goldeneye, Mario Party, Beetle Adventure Racing and all those other multiplayer classics, Super Smash is the game for you. Unless one of your friends has it. You see, Super Smash doesn't really achieve much in the single player adventure. This is due to the fact that it simply isn't fun to beat up people by yourself. Who are you going to taunt and yell at? The television screen? I'll give you some inside information: it won't yell back. The levels and characters get tedious and boring really really fast. But as a multiplayer romp, Super Smash achieves all that a fighting game can. It is fun, but only in groups.",3.0

Deluxe.  To keep data that would be erased otherwise, you would need to order a memory card, which is just more money, though not much.

I really don't understand why this game gets such a high rating. I mean all it is is an exact duplicate of the 1985 NES version converted to the Game Boy with a few extra modes of gameplay and extras added into it. I suppose for those who were to young and have not experienced the 8 bit Nintendo days it is good for them to experience the game too. But lets face it if there is any game that most video gamers have played at some point in there lives Super Mario Bros for the Nes is it. All this Game Boy version is is a fine conversion of the first Super Mario Bros to the handheld console and not much more. Great for kids that are young now though who missed out on the Nintendo 8 bit days.,3.0

"Having the rare opportunity of trying it out, the Game Boy Color is a considerable leap from its predecessor.  Besides the main feature of processing 32,000 colors with specially designed games, the GBC is backwards compatible with classic monochrome Game Boy titles, though you can play with different palettes by tinkering with the face buttons when the title screen appears.  Also, though the system's slimmed-down design is pretty convenient for pocket games, it's a bit too narrow for big hands.  It offers no shortage in battery power, and the AC outlet at the bottom provides extended play with the right adapter.  The biggest oddity on the handheld (for me) is that you raise the volume by turning the switch down instead of up.  As for the GBC's less-than-stellar resolution, after discovering the Japanese-exclusive Game Boy Light, there's no excuse for having to find a proper light source.

This system is recommended for players over 7.",3.0

"Game Boy Color was the most popular system for portable fun in color. Then one day in June 2001, the Game Boy Advance came along. The Game Boy Color felt so humiliated. The Game Boy Advance (GBA) has much better graphics, a wider screen, and longer battery life and better accesories. Ha ha GAme Boy Color. In June 2001, Nintendo attended the Game Boy Color's funeral. It commited suicide when GBA came out. ZI highyl recommend GBA to everyone. It like having a portable Sony Playstation with Nintendo 64 games.",3.0
"The atomic purple color, to start with, is very, well, I like it anyway. The graphics are okay, and the sound is hard to hear sometimes. Um, there's nothing much to say about it. Sometimes if it's battery is low it might just freeze or shut itself off in the middle of a game so you might want to make sure the battery is good. Since Gameboy Advance costs about the same, I'd reccomend it since I've heard it is better.",3.0
"First of all, I'd just like to say that if I could, I'd make this game 3 and a half stars rather than three, but since half stars aren't possible here, I just made it three, now for the review...
Introduction:
Game Boy has always been a very popular system, ever since it came out approximately 8 years ago.  The Game boy was big, and bulky by today's standards, but compared to the Nintendo which needed a tv to play on, and took up a lot of space, Game boy was a major technological advancement.  Unfortunately, it wasn't updated until about 1996, when the game boy pocket came out--a significantly smaller game boy which used black and white instead of the different shades of green.  Anyhow, people thought that the Game Boy pocket was just awesome, probably because they were stuck with the original ... game boy for so long.  Then, after the game boy pocket, came the LONG needed Game Boy color, in '98.  Nintendo sure did wait a long time to bring this one out.  They had the technology to do this back in '95 for god's sakes!  It's kind of stupid how they waited so long, but it is pretty impressive, now that it's come out.  It has around 500 games, I think, many of which are suitable for all ages.
Pros:
+The size of the gameboy color hasn't been changed since game boy pocket.  It can still fit into your pocket with ease, and is highly portable.
+Batteries will last a long time.  I think that it goes for about 30 hours without needing a change of batteries; I've only had to change the batteries once in the 4 months that I've had it.
+A very wide selection of games, ranging from platformers to RPG's; suitable for pretty much all ages.
Cons:
...
-The colors really aren't that great...  A lot of the time, they're hard to see, and I feel like I'm just playing a black and white game.  It's hard to find the right lighting to get the maximum benefit out of the colors, and when you do, they still don't look as spectacular as you'd hope.  Nintendo could've done a much better job.
-Since the screen isn't backlit, you can't play it in the dark.  I don't know why Nintendo didn't think to make the Game Boy's screen backlit...  Maybe it's because they wanted to get even more money for selling a clumsy worm-light which makes the game even less portable.
Conclusion:
Overall, the Game Boy isn't a bad system.  It's got a lot of games, good battery useage and it's very small, but I still feel like it should've been better.  the hardware inside the tiny machine is 8 years old, and that's pretty pathetic when you think about it.  Neo Geo Pocket, on the other hand, made an excellent stab at the pocket console world (too bad it's discontinued now.)  It features 16-bit graphics, a cool analog joystick, a backlit screen which is significantly larger than GBC's, and MUCH better colors than GBC.
I personally prefer my Neo Geo Pocket Color over my Game Boy Color, primarily because of it's graphics, but if you're looking for an easy-to-carry-around system with hundreds of games which will help make long car-rides go quicker, buy a GBC.
If you are, however, looking for a portable system with good graphics, which is the same price as a GBC, but only has around 30 games, by all means get an NGPC.
It's your choice, they're both good consoles.",3.0
"...The buttons stop working after a couple of weeks, thus making it a cheap disposable joystick. It worked great for me, until the buttons stopped working. So if you're low on cash but need a joystick, this would be ok to get, just don't be surprised if it gives out in a few weeks.",3.0
"I've owned this stick for years and it always served me well, until the advent of Windows XP and M$'s infinite wisdom in deciding NOT to support XP with the Sidewinder Game Controller software!

Yes, the stick will work with XP just fine, that is if you enjoy erratic and very touchy control in your favorite game.

With the aforementioned software you could control the dead spot in the stick's center (size, etc.), you could control the sensitivity of the stick's movement on all three axis, custom program the buttons, etc.

All of this is now gone and you have a basic, but very good joystick, which has basically been castrated by M$!

I would have given this stick a 5 out of 5 years ago, but under XP and the lack of the software support from M$, I have to drop it down to a 3.",3.0
"I have a Playstation 1 console, I previously owned a MAD CATZ 1 Steering (The old grey 1998 Model) which I used to play Gran Turismo 1 which was a popular game at that time. I later gave it away (stupid, I know). I wanted to relive the full fun of this driving game once again. So, I purchased the Interact V3fx Steering Wheel which is designed to work with PS1 And PS2. Unfortunately, after many trial and errors, I realized that the V3fx has poor control and sensitivity despite its own adjustment controls (30 - 150 Degrees angle sensitivity). I even tried using the GT setup menu which indicated that everything was set just fine. When I played the game...it took only a small turn of the wheel to cause the car to go from one side of the track to the other and run into walls hence the car was difficult to control. I think that this steering wheel's design is geared more towards Playstation 2 and Gran Turismo 4 rather than the previous Playstation.",3.0

"It's pretty cheap, but the joystick is not in great condition. so if you just need a controller and you don't care too much about the joystick it works fine.",3.0
"The controller I received game in what looked to be very good condition. The only issue was the dpad which got stuck while testing. I heard that this was a semi-common problem for n64 controllers but when I owned the system during it's prime, non of my controllers had that issue. I disassembled the controller, claned and fixed the dpad, which works great now. During further testing, all the buttons responded well and precise. The joystick was just right where it never stuck and returned to the middle without further calibration. Shoulder and z buttons responded well too. Cord was in great shape except for the normal wear and tear. Controller was colored on by previous owner in a permanent marker. Will attempt to remove it using alcohol pads. Delivery was fast and packing was well thought of.",3.0

"I live in a neighborhood with around 30 children in it, that all play Nintendo. I love Nintendo to no end but these controllers break easily! That is why so many colors and versions of them are sold! The buttons break easily where they no longer work when pressed, especially the L and R buttons, the directional pad also breaks easily where you press up on the pad and it moves left or you press down and it moves left. Because of the handlebars on the side of the controller, that allows the plastic bends quite easily. I have noticed when children get upset or frustrated with a game they twist those handle bars, causing them to break, bend or crack. However a controller is a controller, but for this price you can find something cheaper that is more sturdy and reliable.",3.0

"Abe's Oddysee is often billed as some kind of platformer. This is all wrong--it's closer to Prince of Persia. It's ahead of its time in many ways, but backward-looking too.

Abe's Oddysee feels more modern than its contemporaries. It is mostly 2D with cleverly interspersed 3D cutscenes. Everything is pre-rendered so it actually has a coherent art style unlike its late 90s contemporaries that struggled just to render blocky polygons on screen. The story, too, is presented mostly through gameplay--you get a sense of the world through interacting with it, not by being told about it.

Unfortunately, it's the gameplay that feels dated. Even though you have unlimited lives, the game is so unforgiving it feels more like playing the original Prince of Persia than Sands of Time. Each level is divided into invisible sections that have a restart point. If you die near the end of a section, you still have to replay the entire section over again. The sections are pretty long and the boundaries are only marked about half the time, so it's really easy to get frustrated.

Finally, because the animations are beautifully fluid, they can trick you into thinking you are playing an action game. You're not. Your input starts off each animation but you can't do anything else until it's over. The result is more like a rhythm game in which you have to figure out the order of button presses based on the current puzzle.

Abe's Oddysee is frustrating enough that I recommend you only play it if you have already played similar, later games like the Prince of Persia series or Abe's own sequels. They are less frustrating and will let you know if you actually like this type of game.",3.0

"I'd have to agree with a handful of the other reviewers here who were disappointed with the psx release of 'Lunar: The Silver Star Story'. It just can't compare to the sega cd version for me, and will never hold an equal place in my heart. Aside from a couple of good songs, the music of the remake is HORRIBLE compared to the original's. The subtle differences in the drawing style irked me (particularly something about Luna's chin...). And the story alterations REALLY bugged me. Even though couple scenes moved me a teeny bit, it just wasn't as emotionally affecting or engaging, and overall the feeling was a lot more cheesy for lack of a better term. Alex sounds like a [girl] now, and Luna's voice came off slightly on the annoying side. Fortunately Ghaleon has the same va, but somehow he seemed less cool than before, especially near the end (I swear, they took all the mystery and depth out of his character, and turned him into such a typical villain!! rant rant rant! =<). Ok ok, so I'm ranting a little bit. But it's only because the game in question is one of my absolute favorites of all time, one that I've always connected with a great deal of purity and integrity. ... Don't get me wrong though, I'm not trying to detract from anyone's experience or turn anyone away from the psx title. It's still a excellent game, especially if it's your first time playing through SSS (... not to mention that a lot of people seem to prefer the changes actually). But I still had to speak my mind about this, if only to echo those who share similar feelings and sadness over this matter. For me the sega cd version will always be the one, true Lunar.",3.0

"I feel so hypnotically enchanted floating through endless rings as Superman with the distant soaring effects peacefully sounding in the background.  For the first few minutes Superman seems challenging as an early 3D experiment to figure out which ideas work and which ones can be tossed aside and... you'd certainly *think* that floating through ring after ring would get boring after a while but... the opposite happens.  You get unusually attached to the endless task.

After a while these floating rings just seem to call my name.  It's like I'm destined to fly through them for all eternity.  I don't want to do anything else in life but fly through these hypnotic rings.  Sometimes I bump into bad guys and shoulder bash them away, other times I pick up items and toss them at specific targets but... the rings.  They always call me back for several minutes of peaceful daydreaming hypnotism at its purest.  I'm enthralled in this games beauty.  The graphics are decent too.  I have to go now.  The rings are waiting for me.  *stares off into space*",3.0
"I bought this game, and actually tried to play it, rather than giving it one star and paraphrasing the Angry Video Game Nerd. It's actually not as bad as most people would have you believe. Would I have paid $60 for it, even in 1999? No.

The graphics are about average for the N64: nice but full of blurry textures and gourad shading, as well as a tiny draw distance. The stock music is odd, but the voice clips (thankfully, used sparingly) are crystal clear. Sadly, they don't do anything to make the story any less incomprehensible.

Now, we move on to the controls. Flying Superman is simple, if a little loose. Making tight turns is a problem, but you have a lot of freedom with the controls; you can even do a vertical loop without the need for a second analog stick (see Superman: Shadow of Apokolips). Getting him to stop is tricky, which can be a hassle if you need to land somewhere fast. Camera control (using the + Control Pad) allows you to rotate the camera around the Man of Steel, and his movement with the Control Stick is character-relative. Zooming in or out is also possible, so any Superman fans who want to make machinima about the last son of Krypton, go right ahead.

For some reason, you can't save at all unless you have a Controller Pak; but when I did have one, it never prompted me to save, nor did it do so automatically. Perhaps I didn't get far enough into the game? There's not even a password feature, so playing later is difficult.

The mission structure consists of vague objectives linked by timed flights through floating rings. Unless you have completely spastic fingers, the ring stages shouldn't be too hard; I was able to do the first one in two tries, not 100 (like many people seem to need).

Overall, the game certainly isn't the worst ever made; not even close. It could have been so much more, but thankfully, people learned from the mistakes of Titus and made the much better Shadow of Apokolips and Superman Returns.",3.0
"I'm starting to think that people are just hating this game for the sake of hating it. It's not that bad of a game. The fact is, it's average. It is a generic third person action adventure game starring Superman, and that's where the initial disappointment came from at the time of release. The reviews were exaggerated due to the fact that this was nothing more than a mediocre game that had so much hype preceding its release that most everyone couldn't wait for it to come out. The game was almost 80 dollars when it was released, and that is what caused such a negative reaction from everybody.
However, now that's it's been out for over 12 years and you can find this game for less than 10 percent of it's original price or download it for free with the use of an emulator, there is no excuse for all the hate. The game is old, it's average, and it's dirt cheap. It's also pretty fun when you use a gameshark with it. Get past the flying rings that everyone seems to not be able to stop complaining about and you reach actual levels. Superman fights Metallo, Parasite, Brainiac, Darkseid, and others in addition to stopping crimes and disasters after each of the aforementioned ring levels.
Yes, the graphics are bad, but if this game came out two years earlier it would have been considered great. At this point, in 2011, complaining about graphics in a game this old is idiotic.
I think a lot of the negative reviews are coming from people who haven't even played the game. People who just HAD to share their oh so witty little ""oh god it's burning my eyeballs!!!"" remark with the world regarding something that is probably older than they are.
I don't go by reviews. I don't base my opinion on the opinions of others. I actually enjoyed this game back then, and I still have fun with it every once in a while through an emulator on my pc.
Again, the game isn't the best ever and I'm sure that this will receive too many comments from people who feel the need to tell me how I think, but it's a fun game and I would recommend it to people who would like to see the history of their favorite superhero in video games. I am a huge Superman fan, and I even remember playing the NES game as a kid which I thought was better than this game, but still an acquired taste.
If you're open minded and not someone who has been raised on Halo and Call of Duty, give it a try. There are worse things you can do with 5 dollars.
By the way, I'm 25 years old, a lifelong Superman fan, and if you're planning on writing a response that contains any combination of the words ""TROLL"" or ""WORST GAME EVER!!!!"", you can save yourself some time. If I was trolling I would have given it a five star review and called it the greatest gift to mankind since Jesus.
Anyway, like I said, don't buy into all the reviews. This can be a pretty fun game if you let it.",3.0
"Bloody Roar II: The New Breed - Circa 1999

GOOD:

- Nicely Balanced old school PS1 3D fighter

- Beast change really brings something new and unique to the table

BAD:

- Graphics are dated, for today's generation

- Somewhat small staple of fighters

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:

- Playing a Tekken/Virtual Fighter rip off where the fighters can transform into animals

-  Has some old school ""dial-in-combos""

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:

- Virtual Fighter 3

- Tekken 3

- Soul Blade

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- Bloody Roar II has almost every thing from Bloody Roar (the original) except for three fighters, besides that Bloody Roar II has everything the original had and then some

- Later Bloody Roars such as Bloody Roar 3 and 4, where not as Balanced as this one but the graphics were better",3.0
"I like this game...i really do, but i just don't get it.  I'll agree that the concept is wonderful, and the graphics are great, and the story is stellar...but geez, i just don't get a lot of it!

I think that's what urks me the most...i  have no idea what i'm supposed to be doing half the time...and somehow that  diminishes my enjoyment of the game.  I'm not certain whether to recommend  this game or not.

"Hexen is a brilliant game, but its N64 transfer is not.

In fact, the only thing praise worthy of the N64 conversion is the nice little paragraphs you get when traveling from one level to another.  These little descriptions of where your going are not available in the PC version.

Otherwise, Hexen 64 is a terrible mock up of what is a brilliant game on PCs today.  Yes its dated, but many people have taken the source code and made it a much more enjoyable experience with better controls, lighting effects, and so on.

The only reason you should buy this, as far as Hexen fans are concerned, is the ease of having a multiplayer match.

If you've never played Hexen before, buy the PC version, go to [...] and download the source port there that allows smoother graphics, 3D model support, lighting effects, and more.  This is the Hexen we die-hards know and love

In fact, you should also look into [...] for the single greatest Hexen MOD there is.  It really takes the game to a whole new level.",3.0

"This may just be my personal preferences, but here's what I think about Riven.

The graphics are beautiful, stunning even...but not as beautiful or stunning as those in, say, The Legacy of Time.

The puzzles are thought-provoking, but they can sometimes be difficult or impossible to understand simply because you don't know what you're looking for: there's no internal logic to the puzzles. In, say, the 7th Guest each puzzle has a clear goal, and a clear set of rules/guidelines/parameters.

The worst problem, though, is that it's lonely. I just find myself wishing for more people.

My recommendation? Borrow it from a friend or rent a copy from a video game store to see whether you enjoy it before you purchase it at full price.",3.0
"I enjoy playing the Myst games once through, they are fun and challenging. However my computer would not allow me to hit a certain switch for some reason, and I was therefore never able to get to the location on the cover. Even if I had, I would never play the game again, I would know how to do everything, and therefore, what would be the point? At least it is better then Myst in which you can win within about 15 minutes of starting the game, but still... Any 60 dollar game (as it was when it was released) should last longer than this. With the detail put in, the game itself is rather short, with puzzle solving accounting for much of your time. Also some puzzles can be so frustrating when you know what to do, but can't (the stopping the scopes thing, the puzzle at the top of the dome on the first island). I thought it was a beautiful game, but I wouldn't get it unless it is below 20 dollars, otherwise I don't really think it's worth it.",3.0
"Riven looks like Myst. Riven sounds like Myst. Riven plays like Myst...sort of. The producers emulated Myst in almost every way but they decided to change one important thing: they made it more open-ended. In Myst, you start on a small island, told what to do (collect pages) and have unlock other areas to proceed. In Riven, you are dropped in large area of five interconnected islands with only the vaguest idea of what to do. To find your way on your own requires a meticulous manner and loads of free time. My advice is spend a reasonable amount of time then use a walkthough as needed.
A technical note: I could not this running in Windows 2000. Riven requires Apple Quicktime 2 to run and after installing that I could get the sound to work. It may have a conflict between Quicktime 2 and Quicktime 6/iTunes also installed. The game ran fine on Windows 98.",3.0
I love the game but in the last level when you rescue natalie it bugs and repeats then after the giant car battle it freezes,3.0
"Many years ago, I played this game at a demo station and wished that I had gotten a PS instead of an N64. Having recently gotten a PS1 memory card for my PS2, I decided to get this game which I had very much wanted. I started it up, and... the game hasn't aged well. It's full of good ideas and originality, but the draw distance is pitiful and really diminishes the sense of exploration, and it sticks to some very outmoded design conventions.

If you're interested in videogame history, however, this is a fascinating game, as it shows what early attempts were made to justify having two analog sticks",3.0
"Ape Escape is pretty fun. I ordered it for my boyfriend because he is in LOVE with it. The graphics are kind of lacking, but it's good game play =]",3.0
"This game was fun for my kids for a little while, but they quickly grew bored with it.",3.0
"To wit, this game quite fun. Since my game play style tends towards using the analog controller whenever I can, this game seems to be custom made for myself. And of course it is. It's a pretty neat concept having the monkeys (I don't think the manual writer did a lot of research on monkeys since the book uses ""baboons,"" ""apes,"" and "" chimps"" interchangeably)  escape from the zoo and having your job to chase down and capture them. Nice non violent plot really, one of the very few games that I buy and my girlfriend is willing to play.
And while the game has a nice plot, the programmers also spent a little time on the graphics in the game. Since the PSX is showing its age there is only so much any programmer can do. But the programers did a very good job. The smooth graphics, ""large"" worlds and a grand variety of scenes make this game a delight to explore (Never mind the obvious use of some of Sony's stock SDK files, usually evident by the ""Pa Rappa"" look in some areas). Throw in a huge variety of weapons and usable ""tools"" make this a winning formula indeed. In fact it is likely that after the PSX goes the way of the Atari 7800 that this game will be one of the reasons that die hard fans of the PSX will dust off that gray box (Or blue if they upgrade to the PSX2) and play a few levels. However, I have one major gripe.
It shocks me that many people consider the Ape Escape camera to be nice and well behaved. This camera is one of the most ill-behaved I've come across in a long time. Just what are some people comparing this camera to? Super Mario 64? If that's the case, then that's a hard judge. SM64's camera was pretty bad but at least it was aware of walls and didn't go behind them too often. Ape Escape's camera not only goes behind walls but it goes through them as well! Haven't the programmers at least heard of a ""Jelly Cam""? C'Mon, there are numerous examples out there of what to do and what not to do with the camera. Ones with decent (mind you, decent, not perfect) camera's include Spyro 2, MDK 2, and Zelda 64. All of these games had cameras that were somewhat well behaved (although none show the classic ""Jelly Cam,"" A Jelly Cam is a camera that when it goes through a wall turns the wall, or anything else, into a semitransparent entity. You know it's there but at least you can see what's going on on the other side.) AE does not fall into that category. I can't tell you how many times I've run back and forth in a level looking for a way out only to discover the camera wasn't ""swinging"" in an appropriate direction. Some pundits may tell you that only adds to the difficulty of the game. Someone should remind them of the difference between skilled difficulty and annoying frustration. Never, Never should any one ever lose a life because the camera wasn't doing a good job of showing what is happening around you. ""How about blind spots?"" Some may ask. What about them? It is very possible to design a game and camera to allow the classic ""leap of fate."" My gripe lies with the camera refusing to shift at appropriate times so that I can at least survive the darn jump! Or Shifting to an appropriate angle to allow a fair fight against a baddie. All to often I'm getting pummeled by a monkey with a machine gun or rockets simply because the stupid camera doesn't know enough to swing around a column. And using buttons to ""fix"" the camera's faults is a cheap trick. Sorry Sony, A big company like your self should know better.
This game gets three stars due the rotten camera work. If the programmers spent more time with this crucial element then the game would certainly win five stars. Too bad Sony, the frustration with the camera is simply too high. For those who think the camera works ""perfect"" play a few more games for comparison.",3.0
"I won't lie this game was really cool back in the day and i play it with utter pleasure,(at that time) it was only my second 64 game i ever borrowed, sure the graphics was stink and at times the game play frustrating the heck out of me, however this isn't one i'll call a classic it's no Zelda, Perfect Dark , Donkey Kong 64 and i can go on and on, if you don't believe me try to play this game now!!!! you will find yourself saying yuk! yuk! yuk!

"I first saw this game on Retsupurae, and was intrigued by its hammy dialogue and weird fighting style. After buying it (and it arrived in great condition), I found it to be enjoyable, but nothing special. Really the only things that keeps me coming back to it are the characters and voice acting. Each character is an anime stereotype, and the voices range from over-the-top (like Paul Eiding's Gally and John St. John's Dazaiver), to melodramatic (like Lie and Ihadulca's voice actors), to exactly what you would expect from a low-budget anime (like Chris Cox's Keiya). The gameplay only uses two buttons for fighting, attack and block with your distance from the opponent wand what directional button you press changing your attack, which seems stupid at first, but turns out to be a style that's easy to learn but difficult to master. There's a decent amount of replay value, like filling up the encyclopedia by beating each character's story and unlocking alternate costumes and announcer voices by beating the arcade mode. However, I can't recommend this to anyone other than gamers who are looking for something really obscure to play.",3.0
"Saying I went into this game with high expectations is the understatement of the year. I came into this game with no nostalgia, but I came into this game absolutely sure it would be some sort of narrative masterpiece I could recommend to everyone else on earth and play for four hundred hours and at the end still love it as much. Can you really blame me? I mean, LOOK at the reviews! Everyone on steam and amazon and all over the internet seemed to collectively agree it was the most amazing game ever to grace our mortal minds. But when I actually played the game? Well...

This is an opinionated review! I know I'm not going to agree with a lot of people, as I am going to be a little harsh here, but that's only because all anyone ever says about it is glowing praise so I need something to balance those out and properly warn people who want to buy this game. Also keep in mind I have not finished the game. I can't figure out how to progress even after I looked it up. But I'm on, from what I can tell, somewhere in the middle/end of disc 2. So maybe later I'll change my mind on some of this and give the game glowing praise when the ending rolls around. But for now, I have a good grasp of what this game is, and I'm going to review it how I've experienced it.

GAMEPLAY: I do actually really like the gameplay in this game. I will admit, the mixture of turn based and time based RPG combat is interesting, but it really takes some getting used to. I had never played a Final Fantasy game previously I came from playing Pokemon competetively, so I was expecting something more like that, but after you get used to it (and the inability to pause during battles) it's kind of fun. Also, if you really don't like it, there is a menu option to change it to completely static. I really like the Materia. Like I said, This was my first Final Fantasy, so I can't really say how it compares with other games in the franchise, but I thought it was a really neat addition to the game. It's pretty much necessary to have magic in a JRPG, but they could've just left it at magic materia and have been on their way but they decided to add independent, support, command, and summon materia, all with different uses and able to pair with other materia for some deadly combonations (my favorite is Final Attack+Phoenix. It's brutal and as long as you have the magic, you're unkillable). It's a little difficult to master, but the core gameplay is one of my favorite takes on this type of RPG. There really isn't that much else to say.

I don't know if this counts under gameplay, but I think it does, so I'm putting it there. All this game's versions of quick time events are just insufferable in my opinion. It tells you the controls and I spend two minutes mashing the keys I'm supposed to how it says I'm supposed to while nothing happens on the screen. It's totally responsive every other time, why not now?! I've never really failed any of them, even the one with the train in North Correl, but a lot of them I just found completely pointless and taking away from my enjoyment of the game. The only one I really liked was Tifa's slapping contest and the Piano in Nibelheim, if you can call that a quick time event.

And as far as minigames, Chocobo racing is amazing. I know I spent at least four hours riding around the Overworld on my Gold Chocobo Ra, so do consider breeding one of those. They're super fun. Also the Basketball minigame in the Wonder Square is actually strangely addicting, but all other minigames are just sort of meh in my opinion.

VISUALS: Yeah, ok, I get this is an old game and I know the graphics were revolutionary for it's time, I'm not going to get on it about that, but I had an issue (and still sort of have, although not as strong) with knowing where I can go. Everything always has a habit of blending into the background and I still have to use the assist thing that shows you what you can climb and what is a door you can go through. It makes everything about 20 times easier. Also, this is expected, but although the background visuals are beautiful, sometimes they don't mesh at all with the character models or Materia laying on the ground. This, like the inability to tell where to walk, is somehow more prevalent at the beginning of the game than any other time.

The FMV is pretty good too, for what it's worth, except they did all seem very unemotional or expressionless during it.

STORYLINE: I was... really underwhelmed. I tried my hardest. I really did. ...I'll go through this from the beginning.

The first three and a half hours I hated everyone. You had nearly every cliche in the book- Token Main Character who has a big sword, sort of angsty and doesn't particularly care about anyone else or feel emotion for some reason, Token Childhood Friend who probably secretly likes you because of course (Cloti over Clerith regardless), Token Love Interest, Token Angry Guy who curses every other sentence and is also black because of course he is all on a token mission to destroy the token evil corporation who has taken over the government. I realize this was probably intentional so there could be a subversion of expectations later on when this has a better narrative, but this is a FINAL FANTASY GAME. I'm expecting hundreds of hours of amazing plot more akin to a rollercoaster than a story, not a token game with good gameplay being it's redeeming factor like Call of Duty or something. JRPGs don't roll like that.

So anyway, after that, you get some more explanations for backgrounds and then the weirdest part of the entire game starts... The Honeybee inn portion. If you've played this part, you know what I mean. I've gotta say, this really only appealed to the part of me that enjoys the delightfully awkward, which is such an acquired taste I'm surprised anyone would've put it in a game.

*SPOILERS*
I'll admit, maybe knowing Aeris (or Aerith I suppose) was going to die from the second I heard about this game (That's HOW I heard about this game, actually. 7 spoilers that would most certainly ruin a game for you by OutsideXbox. Go watch all their videos) turned me off from getting to know her. But do you want to hear a way better version of this? Fire Emblem Awakening. You're told that Chrom is going to die from the prologue and even the name of the chapter he's going to die in. And you're told that you're going to be the one killing him. All of the dialogue and everything that happens is accenting Chrom's character and how tragic it will be when he dies, but not in the in-your-face kind. Subtly. Small bits of character development and interactions make you feel more guilty by the second, eventually culminating into me nearly breaking down as the cutscene rolled. And I NEVER cry. And this was KNOWING what was going to happen. I couldn't even force myself to care about Aeris. I wanted to make her death more meaningful or as emotionally destructive as everyone says it was but I just... didn't care. Sorry.
*END SPOILERS*

Most of the plot centers around giving the main characters backstories and developing them like that, but it still couldn't force me to care about Barret and I still hated Yuffie just as much, so I felt like I just had a character with a backstory rather than giving these characters more of a drive or reason as to how they act. Tifa, Cloud, and Vincent's stories were pretty great, Red XIII/Nanaki, Cait Sith and Cid's were all decent, I just didn't really get why we had to spend so much time on them. I like these characters, especially Red XIII/Nanaki, (he's my favorite team member besides Cloud) but I just didn't particularly care for his story.

The rest of the story... There really isn't that much to say. Really I found the rest of the story completely unworthy of note. Not that nothing happened, because believe me it did, but I was extremely unimpressed. Everything that happened I was either too confused by or didn't care enough about the characters to be surprised at or react much more than ""Oh. That happened. But what happened?"" Except Cloud finding out about himself and who he truly was with Tifa in the Mako stream. That was pretty neat.

Another thing this narrative has it it has the same problems that I had when I played Okami. It just doesn't get when it makes no sense where I'm supposed to be going and what I'm supposed to be doing when I get there (although Okami was a little tamer in this right). I've had to look up things that they should've made absolutely crystal clear, the most insufferable of which that I remember being where to go to fight Sephiroth when they first tell you to do that in Disc 2, so circuitous and confusing not even a guide could really help me. ""Soooo... are we going to the Shinra HQ? I thought I saw that was on disc 2... Nope, doesn't even mention it... how about just going back up north? Well, I can't get to the crater by Chocobo and he won't let me climb the cliff because It's too windy or something... No point in going here... I went there anyway, nothing narrative... THIS IS PROBABLY A CLIMACTIC FIGHT, WHY IS THIS SO HARD TO FIND?!"" And even if it's not, GIVE ME SOME INDICATION OF THAT! I don't know where I should be going. I already fought the Ultimate weapon and did all the sidequests. I don't want these games to hold my hand, but come on! Give me SOME indication of where I should be going to progress the story. I eventually stopped trying here. I'm planning to finish it, because I never leave a game unfinished, but I just need a break and time to play some other, better games before I continue.

I know Final Fantasy VII has many different installments, like Advent Children or Crisis Core, and I know the characters are expanded on far better there, but this is not those games, and in this game, the narrative was ok to good at best and I didn't particularly care about more than three of the characters. I give it 6/10 purely because I enjoy the gameplay and the narrative isn't bad or insufferable at any point, it's just not as great of a game as everyone makes it out to be. In my opinion, at least.

I didn't hate this game. It was pretty good, overall. But it wasn't perfect. If you want to buy this game, don't expect it to be perfect. ....Except, the worst part is the more I see past me desperately wanting to like this game, the more I realize it has a slow start, slow and a totally broken, confusing and uninteresting story, boring characters, and odd and confusing symbolism that doesn't really mesh with anything and I now realize I'm being very nice in the rest of this review... I can't recommend it, basically.",3.0
"This Final Fantasy is a pretty solid game.  Its strongest point is the battle system.  I honestly think it has the best battle system in the series with the exception of FF12.  It also has an interesting story and a really good system for dividing magic and abilities among your characters.  Unfortunately, the game is plagued with annoying mini-games like no other Final Fantasy ever made.  And the vast majority of them are mandatory.  Sometimes the camera angle is set a certain way that makes selecting the enemy/character you want to select nigh impossible.  In addition to all that, there are a couple of really annoying characters I just couldn't stand.  Overall, I'd recommend renting this game first instead of buying.  In my personal opinion, it's way better than 10 and 13 (because it isn't so linear or AS infested with annoying characters) but not quite as good as my favorite FFs: 6,8, 9, and 12.",3.0

The of course Tifa was all the range because her extra large ""pixles"" and all I heard was young boys every where talking about that and it was sad .  the story itself was a departure from the traditional FF series and this is a more post apocalyptic and dark. I myself did not like the graphics because the characters look silly to me all blocky and the backgrounds while interesting  I had a hard time seeing where I was supposed to , or could go. So therefore I had to spend a lot of time checking all areas .

I left with the impression that Square wanted to make the game longer without necessarily forcing the player to grind in dungeons, so instead they forced the player to complete minigames to mix things up a bit. I think it was a decent idea, but the implementation was off a bit. No, Squaresoft, I do not want to practice marching in step and doing parade drills in sync with other soldiers. Fortunately, only a small amount of the game is devoted to these, leaving the majority of the game enjoyable, if not particularly outstanding.

I'm not concerned with the graphics, given that the game had already entered development before the Playstation was even on the market. I think the underlying story is one of the better ones among the games I've played. The story itself is probably 4 to 4.5 stars - but again, the implementation is sloppy. Key plot points that should leave the player breathless are muddled and instead leave them confused. That said, the game does follow up nicely on some of its most powerful moments. After a catastrophic, very emotional moment for the player, the game developers send you into an exploration of unusual, largely unexplored territories. This tactic worked nicely to re-engage me in the game world and get me down to business again, without making me feel like the scene had no meaning. A moment that powerful is a VERY hard act to follow, but Square pulled it off brilliantly.

The characters are all very by-the-book. Granted, some of them wrote a good portion of that book (Cloud, for instance). Square was careful to include a certain amount of backstory and a decent motivation for most characters. I got the impression that developers had actually paid attention to all the party members, and yet - they still entirely failed to capture me. I was fond of Red XIII and actively disliked Cloud and Yuffie, but I was apathetic towards most of the rest of the cast. I found most of the antagonists shallow, which is unfortunate because they were otherwise diverse. Square could have done fantastic things if they had given individual goals and motivations (of any consequence) to, say, the Turks. If they tried releasing this game today, I would give the characters one star. Still, the cast is reasonable for the time period.

It goes without saying that FF7 has legions of fans who will defend it to the death and question the intelligence of anyone who thinks otherwise. They are, of course, fully entitled to their opinions. I still think that public opinion of the game has been inflated by factors other than gameplay, such as its convenient release time and superb marketing. I also think that since its release, its reputation has led other gamers to think of it as ""the best game"", rather than developing their own internal standards and then comparing the game to those. That said, I'm sure that there are many people who would love the game regardless of its environmental factors, and my thoughts on this matter in no way lower the validity of their preferences.

TL;DR: A solid game, just don't expect miracles. Would make for a decent addition to your game collection - but not at $200.",3.0
"I would like to make one thing perfectly clear; I love this game. I love the story, I love the battle system, I love the pacing, I love the nostalgic feelings I get when I replay it. That being said, let's be honest here. This game has risen to an untouchable legendary status that is simply ridiculous. Anybody who badmouths this game is ridiculed and pretty much ignored. This game was amazing when it came out, it revolutionized everything and is still the standard with which every role playing game afterward compares itself to. Now, for those of you hardcore FF7 gamers, this is the part of the review you may with to stop reading. The story, for what it is, is entertaining, but the characters are cardboard. Cloud's a prima donna, Barret's a stereotypical angry black man, Tiffa's the tough girl/fan service model, and Sephiroth is a whiny kid with an Oedipus complex. Honestly, the only real reason a lot of these characters gained the popularity they did was because of their designs. And they are pretty kick ass, let me tell you. But then, most of this game is all about design. The different areas have their own tone and feel, which enhanced the game play and made the story progress more seamlessly. Now, aside from the main story line it also has a bunch of side quests which can keep you busy for hours. Some even intersect with other side quests. For example, the worst side quest, in my opinion, is the Gold Chocobo breeding quest. It's time consuming and boring, and you may as well just use the airship to get around. However, once you get the gold chocobo you can get the most powerful summon materia in the game ""Knights of the Round."" the boring time consuming chocobo breeding sucks, but it is well worth it just for this one materia. Used properly, it can be used to take out the hardest bosses in the game. Which, as it turns out, is not the final boss, Sephiroth. That's right, ladies and gentlemen, Final Fantasy 7 is so packed with side-quests, it has optional bosses that are way harder than the final boss. This is true of pretty much every Final Fantasy game, but I think it's particularly true of this one because it has multiple bosses like that. Others have multiple optional bosses, but only this one has 2 that are much more difficult than the final boss. Hm, I seem to have gotten off topic so I must digress. I defiantly recommend this game to any fan of the role playing genre, but not because it's so legendary and perfect as most people would say. I recommend it because it IS a decent game and you will enjoy playing it.",3.0
"People everywhere tend to price this game for what they feel its worth, not the price it would actually be worth. It was a great game for its time, but that was 12yrs ago. I bought this game for under 20$ back then, and as great as it may have been then... Times have changed and this price does not reflect that fact in the slightest. Pay half the price and get a recently released game, you won't be sorry. The fanboys will hate me, but this game just isn't worth it.",3.0
"It seems like ever time someone tries to point out the flaw of gaming history that is Final Fantasy VII, EVERYONE jumps on top of them and pummles them with corrections, anger and most importantly, hate.  It's like this game is some untouchable relic of gaming culture.  Honestly, its not.  Infact, Final Fantasy VII may be one of the most overrated games of all time.

But i'm getting off topic here.  Final Fantasy VII is a good game.  Actually, it's a VERY good game.  The gameplay is very solid turn based RPG action with some great additions.  A lot of the characters are great like Tifa, Cid, etc.  Hell, I hate Cloud Strife with a passion, but he really didn't get emo like until Advent Children.  Plus, if you are a true fan and know the entire story (i'm not a fan, but I know all there is to know about it), you probably can feel for Cloud.

Even though the gameplay is solid, it's pretty standard and isn't too challenging.  Also, the Limit Break ability that you can take advantage of isn't as balanced as you would think.  Some characters become overpowered and others don't.

The story is pretty stock and the writings is horrible.

My biggest problem with FFVII isn't the game itself, it's the community it created.  FFVII was probably the first game to over hype the fans to the point where they would become OBSESSED with everything about the game.  You might know these people as FANBOYS!  You can't speak one word about this game without being corrected by a fanboy, who seems to come out of no where (like they have some signal that warns them to potential FFVII hate).

Final Verdict: Final Fantasy VII is a pretty easy RPG and if it will be your first game of the genre, then it's a good game to pick up because it doesn't overcomplicate things like other RPGs do by adding TONS of options to deal with.  If you've played other RPGs before, don't give this game a second look.  The game is very good at what it does, but is hindered by the stupid story and horrible writing.

Recommendation: Buy Final Fantasy IX",3.0
"Since this was the first pure Rpg I had ever played, there were alot of things I found really neat about Final Fantasy 7. I liked most of the secondary characters and found their plot development well executed.

That being said, this game has one of the worst protagonists ever. Cloud. The reason he doesn't take the top honor of this? Because there are far worse protagonists, one of them being Squall. I guess emo kid Protagonists just don't do it for me.

It also relies very heavily on plot, that came before it (in that it shamelessly rips off 6 and previous Final Fantasies to the point of hilarity) in order to stand on it's own merits. Most Final Fantasy 7 rabid fans, probably couldn't actually play this game, due to the fact it's frankly no longer pretty enough for them. These are the same people that will try, in vain no less to convince you that X is a great Rpg. (and boy is that one TERRIBLE at the end.. don't get me started on the sphere grid, love story... anyway back to 7)

If Final Fantasy 1-6 had never existed and 7 was original I'd have a much higher opinion of this game, but between the rip off nature and Cloud it really kind of drags the game down for me. I never quite got the hype, yes there are a few characters that still stand out as pretty neat, Vincent and Cait Sith, Red XIII, Aeris, Tifa and Cid. But almost everything else is miserable. Even the Iconic of Bad Guy Sepiroth Yeah I've seen better since him. Far better.

I wouldn't recommend this game really, there are much better things you can do with your money, such as Xenogears, Final Fantasy 1,2,4, and 6. Final Fantasy Tactics, IX, or even XII.",3.0
"I love the Final Fantasy series. The battle systems, the story, you name it and I love it. I've played through every game in the series and loved every one of them. And while I'm glad I played through VII, it had some severe downsides.

For starters, every FF game had a well balanced battle system that was unique and its own, and VII is no exception. But contrary to the hype, the battle system in VII had some issues. The magic system was not well planned. When you get to the end of the game, your party members are at least around the level they should be (that's pretty good planning). The materia (how you learn magic) on the other hand was usually only about half way leveled, and that's IF you took the time to unequip and reequip every party member each time you switched them out for a new character. You should be able to leave people equipped and still hold a chance at learning all the moves. But if equip a character with materia and don't switch it, chances are he/she won't even be learning the second move. Really, the materia requirements should have been halfed to fit the rest of the game. Same with the power moves (or limit breaks). Unless you really go out of your way to train, don't plan on getting above the second break level. These really should have been halved as well.

As for story, it was excellent, as is to be expected. But the way the characters handled themselves is just embarrassing. I felt like I was watching a children's cartoon at points, and that's not what I should get from a FF game. I was actually embarrassed to be playing when I saw this happen: Cloud and Tifa had just gotten back on the highwind after spending the night consoling each other on a cliff. Which is fine. They're adults, both above the age of 20 and are allowed to snuggle. But for some reason, when confronted, Tifa decided to get stupid. Barret mentioned something about seeing them together, and Tifa yelled (While flailing her arms around like a fool) You saw us?! then she proceeded to run across the room and lie face down on the floor while the rest of the team acts like nothing happened. It doesn't fit the story. She's a mature adult for most of the game, then she acts like she's in a Fox kids cartoon all of a sudden? And that kind of thing happens more than you'd think.

I'm not saying that VII is a bad game, I'm just saying it's bad for FF standards. Every other game's battle system was well balanced. And EVERY other game (while sometimes poorly translated) still had a story in which the characters were consistent and didn't act like 4 year old children at times. I played the game a long time ago before I was aware of the hype, and I wasn't too impressed. So I played it again recently hoping that my lack of amazement was solely because I was young. But I still wasn't impressed.

Final Fantasy VII was a pretty bad game in comparison to other games in the series (and for clarification I'm only comparing it the main games in the series with Roman Numerals).",3.0
"Final Fantasy VII had huge hype when it came out.  The first Final Fantasy game to be on the Playstation and the first to use the newer graphics the Playstation offered.  I really enjoyed playing the game and thought it very good.  I do not judge games on graphics and thought FF7's was pretty good although sometimes it was frustrating but was very much made up for with the gameplay.

I'm going to go out on a limb here with some of the FF7 lovers and say that this game was extremely overrated.  I agree it's a great game deserves more than one or two stars but I will confess that it seems the creaters of this game were lost a bit.  Upon research I found that yes Final Fantasy VII was not slated for a Playstation release and in fact was for a Super Nintendo, but then switch to the Playstation.  The grpahics were put together rather hastily but in my opinion serve there purpose and work.  The storyline however feels like it was changed around a lot and there seem to be holes all over it.

The gameplay is awsome and the materia system is great and I truly love the summons and there attacks. (although it was repetative watching them over and over during battles with big enemies) The only disappointing thing about this game is it tries to lead us away from the fantasy elements of the previous games.  Yes I agree FF7 is a fantasy RPG but it has strayed from the way in which it's older siblings fared.  My only complaint and this is a big one is that the story just seems to be fragmented.  When playing the game I can see writers changing there minds and new writers coming and going and the script being changed again and again and many forgetting what happened earlier in the story while writing the end.

No matter what others say this game is not the best and definately not the worst RPG out there and is definately not the worst FF game. (come on Mystic Quest wasn't that bad...""dodges tomatos"")

It is true this game was highly overated and the gamers that started Final Fantasy with this game hate the older ones only because of the old grpahics and the fact VII was their first.

This game is great and I highly reccomment it.  You will find the storyline to have problems but they quickly fix themselves as this Final Fantasy game is a bit more faster paced than previous ones.(added snowboarding and bike racing games)

Overall I gave this game three stars and four for the fun because I feel it could have been much much better but it's still an awsome game and will always be.

"I own Final Fantasy VII-X and this is by far the most overrated game in the entire series. My sister told me she bought this game at a vintage store for $60 and I rushed onto Amazon.com to see if she could have gotten it cheaper. I was absolutely appalled. Don't by into the hype. This is a good game, but it is NOT in ANY way worth the price of buying it on this site. Go buy it at a garage sale for $10 or borrow it from a friend for a month or so. People who are expecting others to pay that much money for this are morons.",3.0
"Final Fantasy VII was a revolutionary title to say the least. The game contained several things that wowed gamers everywhere such as beautiful graphic, new battle system(limit break, materia) and actually engaging plot. When I played it in 1997!!, I absolutely loved it and thought that it was one  of the greatest game ever made.

  However, I can't say I should recommend this game to new gamers right now (2006). Once beautiful graphic looks horribly jagged in today's standard (i.e. Cloud's hair) and frankly, battle system is just another japanese rpg battle system (now, gamers are more exposed to Japanese RPG than ever so it doesn't feel so special. In another word, you have seen it before).

  Many aspects of game are outdated and I am not sure new generation of gamers would appreciate Final fantasy VII as we older gamers did. I am sure about one thing though. It is not worth 70 bucks.

  So if you are looking for new solid rpg to play, look elsewhere. A lot of innovations have been made over 10 years and most of it is for better gaming experience. It was a great game in 1997 but you will enjoy other newer rpg more now.",3.0
This was a realy excellent game.  I had no complaint with its overall play or plot.  The one thing that really ticked me off though was the death of Aeris.  Allegedly in the original Japanese version you could resurect her but in the American version they were in too much of a hurry to get it on the shelves to finish this subquest.  SO as another reviewer put it you lose a major character in the game that you have been leveling up through the whole thing and are forced to start all over with someone else.  It is very frustrating.,3.0
"To sum things up, FF VII is a good game, but I find it is overrated.  When it was released in the late 1990's it set the standard for graphics not only for RPG's, but for all video games from there on out.  But in terms of the game itself, it leaves some things to be desired.

The characters for example, were not as well developed as they should have been.  The lead character, Cloud, got about 80% of the character development, while the others only small bits are known about them.  But I will say that each character does have his or her own unique personality so this area may not bother players too much.

The music in FF VII unfortunately, was horrible in my opinion.  Especially when compared to other Square titles such as Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VI, and even Final Fantasy IV (which is well over 10 years old).  The battle music was good, but the rest was flat and uncreative, especially the music on the world map.  Those of us who are familliar with the work of Square had expected much better in this department.

The game play was good.  The materia system was a nice touch that added variety to the basic magic-using RPG.  Basically, every character in the game can use spells, but they have to equip a materia onto their armor or weapon, and gain points through battles to learn each spell the materia has to offer.  The only downside is that once the materia has been unequiped, the spell(s) go with it.  But nonetheless, the materia system had breathed new life into the RPG world of magic-using.

You also have side quests, secret/hidden items and weapons, and secret characters just like most RPG's.  The graphics are good, although the characters look very polygonized in their smaller forms.  The CG scenes are beautiful.  This is one area Square always dominates.  They did a great job with those in FF VII.

It saddens me to give this game only 3 out of 5, but I must be honest.  I love RPG's, especially the classics from Square, but I just don't think that FF VII deserves to be up there with CT, FF IV, and FF VI.  Even the ending of FF VII was disappointing, because they did no follow-up on the characters.  It's a good game overall, but it had the potential to be great.",3.0
"The saving grace of FFVII is the Materia system and the Battle System.  Unfortunately, the only real challenges (which force you to learn how to use Materia effectively) are the Weapons-- most of whom are totally optional.  You can easily get through the game without having a clue of what you are doing, or ever formulating a strategy beyond ""Fight, Fight, Heal, Wait.  Fight, Fight, Heal, Wait.""  This can get very tedious.

Also, and I know I will get flack for this, there was no reason to pack the game with so many unnecessary mini-games.  I hated the mini-games with a passion when I first played the game.  I still hate them.  I don't see why I should have to play a minigame for Cloud to do CPR on a drowned girl.  I don't see why going to the Northen Continent requires snowboarding.  The only fun minigames were the ones that were built into the main gaming engine, such as the fetch quests and the infamous Wall Market section.  Remove the minigames entirely, and I swear the fun factor of this game would go up by a whole star.

Now, graphics wise... I'm very old school.  I don't care about old graphics except that they're consistant and that they work without glitches.  Alas, FF7 is full of graphical glitches and bad design.  Polygons disappear at inopportune moments, the careful, seamless blend between gameplay and FMVs falls apart after the end of disc 1, playable characters sometimes disappear into an overly large and detailed (though beautiful) background, and the shift between the ""marshmallow head"" figures of the map and the full-sized figures of battle sequences is a bit jarring.  Either all the figures should be ""marshmallow heads"" all the time, or realistically-sized all the time.  Switching back and forth doesn't work too well.  Compared to its contemporaries, such as Wild Arms, it lacks a certain attention to detail.  And man, could it ever have made use of a fully 3D environment with a user-controlled camera.

Plot-wise, I think the general concept is quite good.  FFVII is an RPG take on your typical dystopian cyberpunk world.  The story is, at its core, inspired by Blade Runner, GUNNM/Battle Angel Alita, Alien, and other sci-fi classics of the Postmodern era.  But, again, it's inconsistent.  Putting aside obvious relics of a very bad English translation, the script, though good, could use some heavy editing and perhaps two or three more drafts for coherancy's sake.  Many characters remain thoroughly undeveloped, such as Cait Sith-- and why the heck not?  He was technically there from the beginning of the game!

FFVII, in my opinion, was a good game that would have been great if it hadn't apparently been rushed out in a bid to win the hearts of new Playstation owners.  Put your hopes into a playable remake; I certainly look forward to one, with FF7AC being so close to release.

In short, if you don't mind an unpolished, slightly glitchy game, give it a try.",3.0
"I understand that Final Fantasy VII is like the Holy Grail for a lot of younger gamers, but their rabid obsession blinds them to several simple and obvious truths.

The basis for any good RPG is its story and that is the first place FFVII is lacking.  It's completely linear with almost no twists, and those that it has were poorly executed.  From a writer's perspective, the story is amateurish and the plot has more holes than a large anthill.  I admit that the first disc showed a lot of promise, but the subsequent ones degenerated horribly.

The characters were a big failing.  While they were quite diverse, they were also stereotypical.  There's almost no character development, but when you do get a bit, it turns out to contradict what you've seen before.  That lack of continuity shows very sloppy writing.  Sephiroth (the main villain) has an interesting look and seemed quite threatening throughout the first disc, but he disappears for most of the game.  Like the others, his story has holes in it, mostly regarding his connection to Cloud, which is never adequately explained.

Another fundamental element of a good RPG is its gameplay, which is also severely lacking.  Movement is a chore because instead of the usual layout, which defaults on running and allows you to walk by holding a button, FFVII defaults on walking even though you'll want to spend most of your time moving quickly.  On top of that, the buttons don't move you in the same direction in every area.  It's a minor irritation, but the little things add up.

The battle system is fairly clean for the most part, but has its own issues.  For example, the limit breaks (powerful special attacks your characters are able to use periodically) neutralize your normal attacks until they are used.  That means you often have to waste a limit break just to keep a character functioning normally.  Another complaint I had was the length of some of the attack animations.  They could go on for a long time and got really monotonous, so a shortened version or a skip function would have been nice.

In most RPGs, there's a special system for powering up your characters.  For FFVII, that was the materia system.  Materia are gem-like objects you can equip to your weapon and armor, often giving effects, stat increases, etc.  Some of my complaints come down to personal taste.  Primary among them is the fact that materia allows for complete customization of all your characters and the ability to quickly alter them to suit any situation.  That makes many of the characters useless because they don't have a particular role to serve.  I prefer each character having their own function within the group to keep them from being dead weight.

The problems in the system that remain despite your tastes are centered around management of materia.  It lacks a sorting function, which turns management into a chore.  Also, a method of quickly removing materia all at once from your party members would be a welcome addition.

For a video game, the music (composed by Nobuo Uematsu) was quite good.  The themes were well-written and I found Aerith's Theme in particular to be very touching.

If you want a challenge, look somewhere else.  This is probably the easiest of the Final Fantasy games.  As the story progresses, you're always told where to go next, so exploration is optional.  All your party members level up with you, even if they're not being used, so you can neglect them for most of the game and still use them when necessary.  There are some difficult optional bosses, but I'm only discussing the main path.

All in all, it's a decent game, but I'd hardly call it exceptional.  If you're under 14, you'll probably love it, but if you want a 3D Final Fantasy game with a bit more story depth and better design, try FFIX or FFX.  If you like older games, check out FFVI, which is probably the best in the series.",3.0
"This game is almost 8 years old and you are comparing it to games that were made as little as a couple of months ago.

For its time it was revolutionary.  The FMVs were incredible and the battle graphics were excellent.  However, the characters on the map screnes and other parts of the game looked blocky and dated.  The backrounds are incredibly detailed and colorful.  However, none of these affect the gameplay or the fun of the game.

Sound was top notch.  The music score is almost unchallenged to this day for its power and fitting themes it tries to portray.

You complain the analog doesn't work.  The controller wasn't available (mid-late 97) before the game's release.  Yes this can make controlling the character very odd today.  I myself sometimes cursing over that.  The materia system is very simple and very effective, and is one of its greatest assets.  The menus are traditional and function flawlessly.

The story I believe to be solid.  It's not best-selling novel good, but is video game/B-movie good.  It starts off very strong with the first reactor plan, shifting to saving the world from a madman Sephiroth (one of the coolest looking villans in the FMV form).  To those who said that Sephiroth was not a good evil character, he was insane, Shinra was the evil.  Sephiroth was out of control but he didn't believe he was doing evil...that is pure insanity.

The mini games are fun, and Chocobo breeding allows you to finish the game correctly.  The game also has many things that people worry about, the environment, evil corporations, overcoming fears/embarassment/illness.  Cloud is an anti-hero, he didn't ask or want to be the hero, but he eventually accepts his fate and stops being a whining loser.

To those whining about the using a Phoenix Down to bring Aeris back to life were missing the point of her character and her death and what is was meant to represent.

I enjoyed spending 100+ hours finishing the game complete start to finish, but it has lost a lot of its thunder because it has been almost a decade since its release and a decade since its original inception.  It has spawned so many copycats that I do consider it one of the best RPGs of all time.",3.0
"*Warning-This contains spoiliers*
I find it interesting that everyone who claims this is the greatest game ever admits that it was their first Final Fantasy. To that end, of course no subsequent Final Fantasy is going to live up to it. There is something magical about the Final Fantasy games, at least in my view. But the first you play is really an experience. I'm completely convinced, however, that had VI or VIII been the one to break through to the mainstream, then one of those would be hailed as ""the greatest game ever."" If you want to strictly look at which game was the most innovative, and most fun, hands down the ""best game ever"" title should be awarded to FF VI. And while many will disagree with me, and my review will receive countless votes for being unhelpfull, pretty much everyone who's played FFVI (and is willing to accept the inferior graphics since it's an older game) tends to agree it's the best of the series.
That said, there is a lot to enjoy in the 7th installment of the Final Fantasy series. The graphics were beautiful when this game came out, the storyline is immense (although this is true of every FF past the fifth), and there are enough sidequests, minigames to satisfy even a picky gamer. The characters are interesting enough, although I never took to Aeries. In fact, someone revealed to me (unfortunately) that she ends up biting the bullet before I even recruited her in the game. I'm willing to concede that I might have been more impressed with the game, had this not been blown. People I've spoken to seemed to think this was a very emotional moment for a game, but it didn't mean anything to me as I knew it was coming. The villain is all right, to be honest I'm not sure what about him fascinates so many gamers-he seems pretty standard to me. The game loses a little momentum for awhile after you exit Midgar, and the aspect of ""saving the planet"" seems to be dropped almost entirely.
I would say that any Final Fantasy fan is likely to enjoy this one, I just personally can't believe that it's the best of the bunch.",3.0
"This is a decent game, but it quite overrated.  The linearness of the early game is strangleing.  The lack of a pause function also hurts the game.  Many of the characters are sorely weaker than the others.  Plus, there are far too many subgames that are annoying that you have to waste lots and lots of time to accomplish something that should be quite simple.  Being able to make all you characters steal or cast great magic (usually from the Enemy-Skill materia) is great, but it kills individuality.
If you need your RPG fix, get it, but be forewarned that it is nowhere near as good as FF6, FF9, or Chrono Trigger.",3.0

He is supposed to look up to the reactor but he doesn't do anything. I pressed every button on my controller and I reseted it about 15 times. The same thing happens. I can see the other animations working but Cloud never moves. This is kind of odd for a PlayStation and there are no scratches on it.",3.0
"After playing Final Fantasy VIII (my first RPG ever played) i decided to get FF7 since i was addicted to RPG's from that point.

Graphics: 7/10
When you first see the beginning FMV, you're pretty amazed by the cool colours and 3d perspectives. Don't be fooled by it. The characters are simply horrible. They're a bunch of glued together polygons with vague looking eyes on it, though the characters look alot better in battle. The backgrounds are amazing as well.
Gameplay: 7/10
How can people like this? The battle system is the same as any other one. (""hack and slash"") But with something called ""Materia"" in it. It's a way of learning spells. You equip it, beat monsters and you gain Ability Points. After collecting enough AP you master a spell. Generally this is okay, but it is so overrated. I mean, it was a complete rip-off off the FF6 Esper system where you basically do the same. But generally, it's pretty okay.
Story-Line: 6/10
Probably the most overrated section of the game. You play as Cloud Strife, a guy dreaming to join SOLDIER (some elite police group working for the Shinra company). After succeeding he later on decided to quit seeing Shinra's evil ways. Cloud joins a resistant group by the name AVALANCHE to earn some money. He later on becomes friendly with the AVALANCHE members and decides to fully co&ouml;perate with them to beat Shinra. Though there's another evil force. Cloud's old friend Sephiroth has come back with a plan to steal the earth's energy and become stronger. You (Cloud) are chosen to beat him with your fellow comrades you meet in jour journey. The story gets a little farfetched and hard to follow. It's not all that great and sometimes the story gets annoying because of all the useless talk. The main character seems like a cold cool guy but he is in fact a major loser that can't do anything himself and must always rely on his friends. As for the other characters. They seem a bit shallow and i didn't care for them. Though Red XIII was an exception.
Overall: 6.7
It's overall a pretty cool game worth your money. Despite its weak points it is worthy of shining with the rest of the Final Fantasy games. I've seen better though.",3.0
"I did enjoy this game a bit while I owned it, but I do not at all believe it's the best of the Final Fantasies (that honor belongs to VI and IX, in my opinion), and I certainly don't think it's the best Playstation RPG (that belongs to FFIX).
Now, on the positive side, this game did have an interesting story, pretty good music except for the dreary town songs, and some good development on a few characters (Cloud, Tifa, Red XIII).  The materia system was also quite unique and original.
Unfortunately though, this game also has some major flaws that seem to be generally overlooked.  For one thing, this new sci-fi setting...  Now, don't get me wrong.  It's not just the plain fact that it's sci-fi that bothers me.  I can deal with that.  After all, another cool RPG series I liked, Phantasy Star, was also sci-fi.  What bothers me, though, is that the atmosphere here is so drab and gloomy that it provided no motivation for me to continue on through the game.  Now, this problem was compounded by another major flaw:  Cloud.  He was the most unappealing hero I had ever seen, that is, until Squall Leonhart.
The other problem lies within the materia system.  While it is original, it also causes some trouble.  Mainly, it completely wipes out all the uniqueness and strategy from designing a party.  It doesn't matter who you put together at all.  In fact, there are no real differences at all between the characters except for their weapons and limit-breaks.
I do believe that the best FF game on the PSX was Final Fantasy IX, for a number of reasons, particularly the characters, the gaming system, and the much more inspiring atmosphere and music.  Now, I don't dislike FFVII just because it's different.  I think it's a cool game, but the fact is, it just isn't Final Fantasy.  You just can't take something and remove every familiar feature about it, then slap the label on it and call it a sequel.  It's an entirely different product.
Overall, it's a good game in its own right, but I honestly prefer the original Final Fantasy, FFIV, FFVI, or FFIX.",3.0

"Showtime is a good game with all the pushing and roughhousing and all the mayhem. What i am trying to say is any basketball fan who whants to play basketball games where its played the rightway do not buy showtime. Here are some examples for instance,you can pretty much punch the living pulp out of the player to steal the ball and the dunks are unrealistic and last but not least everybody shoots way over averege in the game. So anybody who loves basketball with no rules get this game the only problem is that the options get old real fast.",3.0
"Overall NBA Showtime is a pretty nice game. But I guess the NBA Jam formula has just gotten old because I remember Jam on Genesis being more fun. If you have never played Jam this may be great spectactular fun with lots of cool options. Again, this overall is a pretty cool game, not the best but still alright. Midway has now succsesfully created good x-treme football and Basketball games so lets get workin on a baseball one.",3.0
"Overall this is a good RPG.  It adds a new element in the graphics department to the FF series.  Compared to the FF3 the graphics are amazing.  The story is great also but you'll have to play the game to find that out.  The only thing i don't like is that squaresoft took out classic FF  concepts.  There is no more armor just a little bracelet thingy.  I think  that buys armor for all parts of the body is more entertaining than FF7's  armor.  You have to buy or find all your spells instead of earning them by  gaining experience.  I think that this is a very good game but it does not  compare to FF2(FF4) or FF3(FF5).  They were the last great RPGs, along with  Chrono Trigger, to come along.  FF7 just doesn't beat them.",3.0
"As Need For Speed games go, I must say....this is the poorest installment.

I'm a racing game fanatic, and have always been a fan of the Need For Speed series, but this one is mightily flawed.

The graphics are average at best, but the videos and information on each of the cars was superb. The graphics and frame rate take a major hit when you go really fast, and actually, the cars at times don't even feel like they're on the ground when driving.

The cars control just okay....but on the more difficult tracks, it is really hard to keep up with the leaders of the pack because it isn't really that easy to take hard turns and hairpins all perfectly like the computer always does.

Being able to drive a Ford GT90 and my dream car, the Jaguar XJ220, is what made me buy this game, but then being able to use them in the game made me really wonder if they should even be dream cars.

Look to Gran Turismo 2 if you want a better selection of excotic cars that are actually controllable.

The sounds of the game are just so-so....all the cars seemingly sound alike when accelerating....and you'll get used to the grating metal sound of nailing walls at high speeds....

The best aspect of this game is the music, quite possibly the best of the NFS series, but when you buy a racing game for the music....that's pretty pathetic.

If you're a fan of the NFS series and HAVE to have every NFS out there, sure, pick this one up for a very cheap price. It's not worth more than 4 or 5 bucks nowadays, so don't pay any more than that.

Die-hard racing fans? Look elsewhere.

Overall, 5 out of 10.",3.0
"I was not expecting the cartoonish graphics.  I was hoping for a game more like Soul Calibur.  This game bored quickly, even playing with a friend.  The special moves were hard to pull off, leaving us to just punch each other.",3.0
"I use to like this game alot when it came out. But, after trying out Street fighter 3: third strike. This game is for the original fans of the alpha series. The cool thing is now you get to choose a variation types of super styles. More modes making fun to play than the arcade. The weirdest but could be cool is the mode where you can already fight bison(vega) mode. If you beat him you get to see the ending for you chosen fighter. Why bother playing arcade mode then if you want to see every persons ending? I hate the two button idea of grabbing and two button recovery after being poped. Couldn't they just make it like the original alphas? Capcom seemed like they tried to add some street fighter 3 flavor to this game. I say it is fun if you challange your friends.",3.0
"For The Love Of God Don't Believe The Hype! This game had so many people kissing it's butt it wasn't funny. I got it and it was a huge let down. Soul Blade on psone was better then this! Sure it's all pretty, but it's basically just a virtua fighter clone with wepons and smaller backgrounds.alot of the charactors are basicly the same (Astoroth&Rock/Mina&Kilick/Lizardman&Sophitia/Inferno&Edgemaster) The backgrounds while pretty are basically just the old 2-D backdrops used on the first 3-D fighters. The ""innovative"" world tour mode had been done in SFA3 already so that wasn't a huge plus either. Dead or Alive 2 kicked this things butt as did the painfull to play VF3. If you have either of those forget about this.",3.0
"While this is the only good port to any of the Marvel vs. game prior to MVC2, this game still has a few problems in comparision to just playing a CPS2 ROM.

First off, the sound is god awful.  Everything from this game sounds like it's coming from a small FM Radio with nearly dead batteries from the other end of a long tunnel.  It's that bad.  Not to mention that there are a few sound glitches where some of the sound effects don't even play for a few moments.  So, for example, you periodically won't hear Ryu yell, ""Hadoken"" for a short period of time.  But the sound doesn't make the game, the controls do.  And that's my next gripe.

Unless you are on an Aracde Stick, you'll have a harder time playing this game then you would on a keyboard.  Not only does this game not support the analog stick, but the control pad isn't very responsive at all.  And no, it's not the controller.  I've played KOF 98 and 99, Street Fighter 3: Double Impact, and Soul Calibur 1 all on the same controller.  And I haven't had nearly as many problems with the controls on those games as I've had here.  Not to mention, you have shoulder buttons for the FP and FK.  In MVC2, you won't mind shoulder buttons because that game has a 4 button layout with FP and FK used almost souly for calling the helpers.  MVC1 still has the 6 button layout as its other Capcom brothers.  Meaning a standard Dreamcast controller isn't very suitable for a fast paced game such as this.  Every nanosecond counts in this game and you can't have sluggish shoulder buttons slowing you down.  Street Fighter 3 and Alpha can get away with it, but not this game.  In short, get a Mad Catz Dreampad or some sort of Aracde Stick if you're going to get this game.

Single player also gets rather dull pretty quickly.  This game is meant for competition as far as I'm concerned.  Casual players will enjoy this game, but the computer is either very easy or very hard and there isn't much middle ground.

On the plus end, the game itself is completely intact from the CPS2 version.  And it even has the added Onslaught Mode after you unlock all the hidden fighters.  It also has a 4 player tag battle mode as well.  And that is probably the main reason to get this game.  I, myself, play 4 player tag battle with MAME on Kaillera all the time and I have a blast.  But for those of you that don't believe in emulation and have 3 friends around, this is just as good.

All in all, this is one of those party games that's good for playing at an Anime/Video Game convention, for instance.  And while most people sing praises about MVC2, MVC1 is a very solid and competitive game.  The characters are quite unbalanced.  But it doesn't seem to hinder the game in the least bit.  Sans the small rooster of characters, this can be considered supieror to MVC2 in certain ways.  Pick it up if you have some friends around.  You'll have a blast.",3.0
Well this wrestling game was it and I played it a lot.  The moves were  tough to pull off and sometimes didn't work all the time.  Nevertheless  this was a hell of a lot of fun.  Trust me.....save your money and buy  Smackdown! or something else from THQ.  It blows this away.,3.0
"This was Acclaim's sequel to the horrendous 1998 release of War Zone. And while I will say that Attitude was 5x better than War Zone, I won't say that it didn't feature some of the same flaws that War Zone did.

I'll start with the goods first. There were a hoard of new match types added to the game. And while I won't list them all, I will say that some of them were a Triple Threat, Fatal 4 Way, Fatal 4 Way Elimination, Handicap, Gauntlet, Stable, Battle Royal, I Quit, Last Man Standing, First Blood, Royal Rumble, King of the Ring, Survivor Series, and many more. The variety was overwhelming and was bound to keep players busy and satisfied for the time being when playing.

Another plus to the game was the realistic entrances of the superstars. In War Zone, the entrances only consisted of you seeing the superstars come to the entrance ramp before cutting to the ring. In Attitude, they diligently take time to accurately add a touch of realism to every superstar's entrance. For example, when Undertaker is on his way out, the lights will slowly dim before he makes his entrance. The only thing I don't get is why the entrance way includes steps for them to walk down on. You could also pick from the Raw, Sunday Night Heat, or Custom arena to fight in. This was another cool feature as you could pick the ring skirt, choose the lighting color, the color of the ropes, etc.

War Zone's Challenge Mode was replaced with a Career Mode. The superstar you choose to play as starts off on House Shows, trying to work their way up to Raw, then eventually PPVs and earn challenges for the European, Intercontinental, and WWF Championships.

Perhaps the most frustrating thing about this game is the gameplay. The moves are slow and extremely hard to perform and sometimes don't even work. How slow you ask? Lets just say that when you try to attempt most moves, it gives your opponent enough time to attack you. The gameplay is what makes the game completely unenjoyable. It's too slow, the simplest moves are too generic and easy to perform and get boring easily and the crowd will let you know their disapproval as well as they begin to boo you.

Overall: Attitude is better than War Zone but only in aspects that don't involve gameplay. More options to choose from but the gameplay is probably worse than War Zone where at least in War Zone, most moves were easy to do. I still say that In Your House was the best of the 3 games made from Acclaim. But fortunately this would be their last WWF game they ever made. WWF's next major video game was Smackdown that would be developed by THQ",3.0

"Acclaim Sport's release of Attitude revolutionized the way wrestling games look and sound. The WWF Superstars' faces and bodies were scanned with stunng accuracy and detail. Along with visuals, each competitor's theme music and (partial) entrance was added as well. Collision errors and long loading aside, this game is something else. However, the controls were less than responsive. Acclaim used the Mortal Kombat button combos for each set of moves and, to be frank, it was a like Chris Beniot, a pain in the neck.",3.0
"These games (Warzone, Attitude) are fun wrestling games, but they are much more difficult and less fun then the WWF No Mercy, WWF Wrestlemania 2000 style games. It's still relatively fun, but there's too many cons to shake a stick at:
1) God, the wrestlers look two-dimensional. I'd expect much better coming from a Nintendo game... And they walk like penguins!
2) Too confusing to do moves. The buttons are all over the place, and each wrestler has an individual list of moves that requires thumb acrobats to complete. The finishers are the worst, with anywhere from a two button to an eight button combination to complete the move. That removes a lot of the fun that comes from seeing the cool finishers the wrestlers can do.
3) The announcing is so repetetive it makes you want to break the game. They sometimes even say the same thing as many as three or four times in a row.
If you can look past all those flaws and still see a good game, I both applaud you and question your sanity. If I were you I'd stick with the other wrestling engine, the one that WWF No Mercy was built upon. Better graphics and not nearly as difficult to learn all the moves.",3.0

"So how does Resident Evil Code: Veronica compare with the previous RE games? Despite the new look and outstanding visuals, Resident Evil Code: Veronica hasn't really offered anything new, and instead delivers more of the same RE gameplay.
The story is very awkward. As the game progresses, Code: Veronica's storyline begins to lack the cool plot twists and startling mysteries found in the last Resident Evils. RE:CV relied on too much puzzle-solving to drive the story. There aren't any interwinding plots like before. Instead, the story reveals a weak cast of characters. This includes transvestites and unnecessary characters who have nothing to do with the main plot and RE storyline.
As you might expect, the graphics are mind-blowing. Its the best-looking Resident Evil yet. Gone are the pre-rendered backgrounds and still perspectives of the old games. Code: Veronica's sound is good, but has some bad voice-acting.
What's disappointing is that the dodge feature from RE3: Nemesis has been removed and the auto-aiming is so annoying, causing you to aim at unwanted targets and wasting ammunition. RE:CV's puzzle-solving, box-pushing, and switch-pressing will eventually become tedious especially to experienced Resident Evil players.
Resident Evil Code: Veronica pales in comparison to the other Resident Evil games in almost every area. Once you forget about the awesome graphics, you're left with nothing but the same Resident Evil we've been playing all along.",3.0
"This game to me was a disappointment. I got it for really cheap and that's what it was worth to me. The graphics were cheap, the colors were bland, the story and dialog were a bit lacking, and the overall feeling of the game was very dark and demonic. Of course, I'm pretty sure that's what they wwere going for, but it didn't suit me well.
The story of this game is actually somewhat intriguing, but I think they could have developed it a bit more.
As far as the controls for the game, I found them to be a bit unrealistic and fairly difficult to maneuver. The low quality graphics and monochromatic wash also makes things such as items, ropes, bridges, holes, etc. difficult to see and use.
The main redeeming quality of this game, in my opinion is the fact that the main characters have very interesting backgrounds and stories to go along with their poorly designed graphics.

Pros:
Intriguing storyline
Neat character development

Cons:
Bad graphics
Dark, washed, bland colors.
Underdeveloped storyline
Difficult controls
Overall pervasive dark, evil feeling through the game.",3.0

"I have to admit, it's not as enjoyable (at least to me) as Tomb Raider 1 & 2. This game does have much larger and more in depth worlds than the previous installments, but the fact that you can choose the order in which you complete the three worlds in between the first & last (something that, on the surface, is a pretty cool idea) makes me feel like, if I'm having trouble in one area, I'm wasting my time. I'd have to guess the reason is I love to see the level designs for the different regions & if I can go wherever I want, there's no real reward in completing anything.

But, I digress- still building from weapons, skill sets & basic traps/ puzzles from the previous two games with several new elements like quicksand, thieving monkeys, deadly piranha swarms, a freeze-to-death meter for the final Antarctica world alongside the breath meter & more. Brings back Eidos' weird dinosaur fetish they appear to have had in the 90s full force (All three of the original Tomb Raider games have dinosaurs, as well as at least one other Eidos game from the same general time called Deathtrap Dungeon. It doesn't make sense because it's a fantasy game, but neither do the 2 T-Rexes under the Great Wall of China in Tomb Raider 2.) And the PC version, once again, has bonus levels.

"For a few reasons new people of the Tomb Raider games should not start out on this one, unless they are really skilled at video games. Seriously I beat Tomb Raider One and Two and even Four with a heck of a lot more ease than I did with part Three. So no I would not recommend this to new gamers but people that want a challenge this is the game to get.

One of the biggest reasons this game is so hard are the secrets. They sometimes put the secrets in places you would never even notice. So I advise, if you want the secret level at the end of this game, to get a strategy guide cause 99% of the time you cannot find all the secrets on your own. The secret level though is not neccessary to beat the game at the end, and not truly worth the bother to me. I was so happy and exhausted to just finally beat the game that I could have cared less about a secret level and wouldn't have wanted to play it anyway.
And that was another problem. How hard the ultimate boss at the end was. I thought the dragon in part two was difficult- at least when it hit me I didn't automatically lose. With the ultimate boss in part three if you get too close he will spew this stuff at you and right away you drop dead. It was difficult and frustrating and took me forever to beat. Yet I cannot say it is impossible, for I did at last beat it, but it is NEARLY impossible and will take you most likely a long while like I. What I did was the best, I got out my rocket launcher and just kept blowing away at him while jumping around and around that platform. I definitely would not stand there or get too close make sure you are as far away as possible for he will not spew that stuff at you unless you are close.
Then I guess the next hardest part of part three was just the levels themselves. Some parts of the game were very difficult and without the strategy guide next to me I would have encountered many, many dead ends or stepped into a place that just ended Lara. It grew pretty frustrating at times and the worst part of it all is that you cannot save anytime you like- so unless you cheat and get a load of crystals you will do some backtracking.

Worst part of the game:

Nevada- In this part all the medi packs you saved up, all the ammo you saved up before- the guards take it all away from you so you have to go through the levels finding your guns and picking up as many medi packs as you can. It grew to be very difficult and I hated that part of the game. The only good part of this level was at the very end when you got to see a few alien bodies.

Best parts of the game:

South America- For its lovely scenes and it wasn't impossible to beat. I also liked the dinosaurs they put in, it reminded me of Tomb Raider One all over again.

And London- London was fun as well I enjoyed playing there, with what looked like the same Sphinx- like statue placed in this part as was in Tomb Raider One, except this time you don't go into this one.

So- So Levels:

India- Sometimes a challenge that got on my nerves but then the rest of the time it was just normal Tomb Raider stuff, a little boring of a level compared to the others. The statues coming alive were pretty scary though.

Anartica- Creepy part of the game. At the ending part of all Tomb Raider games there is some breed of creatures you have to fight- in part one it was what looked like animals turned inside out- in part two she fought what looked like action figures- and now in part three she has to fight mutants. Creepy definitely. Got a little scary sometimes. And this part of the game was not too hard, but indeed I was always kept on alert with those mutants. One problem I hated in this part though was the carts- those mine carts drove me crazy I was always dying in them. Just keep working at it though, eventually you get around those corners without dying.

Overall I give this game a 3.5 to a 4 star rating. It is definitely not as good as the first two, just a heck of a lot more frustrating but indeed it was a challenge and Lara Croft is still a fun character to play with so I can't hate this game, but I definitely will not play it again for a long time. It is just too stressful and hard of a game to play all the time.

Do not think Tomb Raider Four is just as stressful and nearly impossible- Part Four is a lot better and I recommend it highly.",4.0
"Yes, TR3 is a bear (so to speak ;-).  E.g., there's a particular spot at the very outset of the game, hiding under the leaves, which you have to make a blind leap to find, and would never guess is there if someone hadn't told you.  But that is in the grand old tradition of Adventure -- the one point remainder (a postage stamp, usually, in the old days, or dropping the magazine in a particular place when you're at your wit's end).  The impossible puzzle drags you out of the game and forces you to kickstart your social life, and ASK REAL PEOPLE for the answer.  Very legitimate.  Same as, ""Don't kill monks at Barkhang Monastery"" (TR2), and don't kill monkeys either (TR3)!  This game is a heckuva lot of fun on a great many levels OTHER THAN gameplay.  It's full of visual splendors that rival the next to last discontinuous maze of TR2, and I enjoy everything about it ... except playing.  The game part is tedious, unfair and annoying beyond belief.  But it's a real collector's item, especially on PlayStation 2 (be sure to keep your PS1 memory card!), and in our family, it's in its second generation of total immersion.",4.0

"The third in the hugely enjoyable instalments of Lara Croft's adventures, cyber-babe Lara continues to collect artifacts whilst casually eradicating the world's rare animals (including the last T-rex).
This time Lara begins her adventures in a temple of Kali in India, after a piece of an ancient meteorite with strange powers. The storyline is weaker than in the first two movies owing to the new feature of a non-linear plotline. After India, Lara can choose to explore the south sea islands, London, or Area -51 before finally venturing to Antarctica.
Whilst the storyline is flimsy the new weaponry is the best to appear in the games. Along with the usual weapons Lara now can have a Desert Eagle pistol with great stopping power or the Heckler and Koch MP5 favoured by special forces. Her new skills this time round include crawling and a very useful sprint function that means you don't have to bounce around like a fool to cover ground quickly. The graphics are sumptuous, the animated Kali statues look fantastic. New ways to die include immersion in cold water and shoals of vicious piranha that can kill in seconds.
New vehicles include the quad bike and a very difficult to control (but still fun) kayak. The essential skill to master this time is to be able to crouch whilst letting Lara happily blast away with her handguns. Useful for taking out cobras and unwary guards. The levels are satisfyingly huge so you'll be spending a lot of time finishing this game and for the hard-core purists, this time all the secrets unlock a hidden level called All Hallows.",4.0
"I own a playstation but i hardly think it's that great a console. Blame it on the N64 for their exceptional games- but i do believe that the Playstation may have some hope left in it.
Well Tomb Raider 3 is a good  example. This is a huge game with a lot of 3D explosions and gunfire and  lots of jumping. Also if you have something against people and animals,  then you won't be dissappointed either.
You also get to blow uo raptors  and a T-rex by the way. Despite being a solid title, i beta the game long  ago and have since went on to other 'pursuits' like Zelda. I'm not gonna  compare the two, mind you, but let's say that while TL3 is a really good  game and somewhat long- it's not gonna make a classic or give Mario or  Sonic a run for their money.
Simply put, all the TR games are long and  filled with adventure. Lara's cute and i like this game but it's just not  gonna be what i'm looking for long-term.
It's also tedious to have to  play through it again. I think it's a mood-game; you're likely to bore  through the WHOLE thing when you're in the mood, and that sounds  extreme.
But as you can tell 4 stars is saying alot cause this game  definetely restores my faith in the playstation and it's over-rated games.
If Lara were to make the jump to the Dolphin- i wouldn't be surprised;  Tomb Raider always had the potential to be a great game; it's just that  sometimes- you need a lot of patience and perhaps, this will fit  nicely.
Finally, the graphics and the sound are passable. Levels are  detailed but heavily pixelated and sound sounds cranky or too soft at  times.
But given any new Lara Croft game, i'll be excited and i'm looking  foward to the new game after the last one last Christmas.",4.0
"The game is overrated. Don't get sucked into all the hype. It's more nostalgic for the people who played it when it first came out.

I played through it and although the gameplay schematics were a bit...strange, it was oddly addicting. Multiplayer is a lot of fun though when you have friends sitting down in the basement all hooked up. It can get pretty intense on split screen, seriously. 5 stars for the split screen! 4 stars overall because the gameplay was repetitive and the graphics were vomit.

"I came upon this game in the late 90s/early 00s. Me and a couple of friends would play it religiously and I must say that although the characters are better and more original in this game, Perfect Dark (if you haven't had a chance to play that) is the superior shooter.

They both are fun in their own right though. They were both made by Rare which did WONDERS for the N64 gracing us with the aforementioned games and also Diddy Kong Racing which I played for hours on end with friends also.

Fun levels to play in and the music was pretty damn good too. Like I said, I liked the characters, Natalia being my absolute favorite and I kept coming back to this game.

Even the single-player mode was fun. Just not nearly as fun as the multi-player mode.

"Banjo Kazooie is a game I've played many times since I got it in the early 2000s and while its fun, its not the most entertaining game I've played. There's two main objectives in Banjo Kazooie: hunting and gathering. You hunt for these jigsaw pieces called Jiggys to help you complete jigsaw puzzles to open worlds. You gather all sorts of items within each level like musical notes, Jinjos, Mumbo tokens, feathers, etc. This concept gets boring after awhile but nevertheless the game is pretty fun as a whole. I'd recommend the sequel, Banjo Tooie, instead as its 10 times more entertaining.",4.0
"I had to use a Gameshark to get the extra levels on this game.  It's tough.  It shows you just how hard it would be to be a secret agent.

There are two features about this game that I really like.  The first is what I'd like to call maim-ability.  If you shoot someone in the leg, they'll hold onto their leg, same with the arm, the head, and even the groin.  Before this game, the most you could hope for was that characters would bleed when they were shot and fall down when they'd die.

Still maim-ability doesn't mean that when you shoot them in the leg they won't be able to run again.  They'll limp for a few seconds and then be as good as new, except take a lot less shots to kill.

Some of the tougher characters take a lot of hits before they're even to the point of getting to maim-ability.  You have to shoot the boss of the game 10 times in the head before he even shows signs of weakening.

The second thing I like about this game is the spy feel of it.  You go on missions, and you work with gadgets (although some are indeed lame).  But the cool thing is, on some missions, you've got to be really quiet and sneaky.  You sneak down halls and pick off unsuspecting guards one by one with well-aimed shots.  Of course, if you get bored of that, you can always make a lot of noise, have a bunch of guards come after you, and blow everyone away.

This game is pretty realistic.  There may be better games now, but during its time, this game was cutting-edge stuff.  It's worth remembering, even though it was hard as heck.  I usually just like playing the easy levels and maiming bad guys quietly.",4.0
"I didn`t first play this in `97 when it fired onto shelves,it was the best game i ever played with 25+ levels i nevaer made it to the very last level,i`m stuck on the Cuban mission thats right after the ""Jungle"".When i 1st played this back when i was 6(You can considder that too young to play it then) and my brother traded 1080:SnowBoarding game for it in senior school and when we turned it on i was really proud i didn`t realise that he was only swapping for a couple of months i was sad when it left every time i went into a game shop i would surch for it but they never had it! when i was 8 i had made up with 2 guys who had N.64s and i traded my WWF WarZone for Mission Impossible But it was good but not as good as my thoughts on GoldenEye i soon gave up my interests on my N.64 because we had put it into the attic and i got a blue GameBoy:Color i still dreamed of getting 007 Goldeneye and complete it i then got a PS2 and none of the games matched Goldeneye,it was still on top even after 3 years until i played GTA:Vice City and Driver 2 but i still wanted 007 GoldenEye(I Know it sounds more storyish).But one day i came up with a idea to get 007 GE. my friend who still has his N64 had goldeneye i traded Turok:Rage Warz for it and now i have it but im still styck on ""UnderGround facility"" level,but i still have the determination 2 complete it my self. I can not play my n64 bcos my GameCube has took its place cos i only have place for 2 consoles. Goldeneye is worth 100/100 points for it fun factor as u know you play James Bond and is set on the Movie and you get a good number of guns and the gore is good you can set bombs and use your watch as a lasergun 2 cut down metal locks and also to kill a Russion Soldier you also get a magnet 2 steal jail keys of the russian guard and make your escape before they send out the ""Firing Squad"" to gun you down as your Death Penalty in the game you will meet the Russian Soviet Union Army as enemies,Natalya and 006 Travalyen(face) as allies,secret agent scientist(in a disguise) to give you a key and Ourimov and Travalyan Janus(This time the enemy) and Onnatopp as boss enemies.

"I'm a die hard Blizzard fan and for all of my knowlege, Starcraft is the best game for the pc, EVER, PERIOD. When I saw Tiberian sun for the first time it seemed as if they were trying to convince people that when you rip-off a well known software company (Blizzard in this case) you get an awesome game. However I DIDN'T think the same. For a while i HATED the thing. But like many games I start out hating, it eventualy becomes one of my favorite games. This game is actually one of the only games i play now (behind Starcraft) while I wait lustfully for C&C generals. anyway, unlike what some people say it doesn't need to be like all good games with upgrades and such. And only having 2 races with slightly idetical troops is kind of a refreshing break from all thr sci-fi stuff. In my mind it's more like REAL, down to present day/near futureish combat. It's actually one of the ost unique games i've played that isn't horrible beyond belief Though it isn't THAT good of a game, i still give it 4 stars and any1 who thinks otherwise should just keep playing it until thay start to like it.",4.0
"All this game needs is one thing, in my opinion:  Mortars!  Without them, you have to go all the way around to find a way up that ridge or that hill, to knock out those enemy soliders who have the snipers advantage.  It's also prettly pointless when one of your aircraft flies in-- and you have no control over it-- and it gets wiped out by a SAM site.  Other than that, not a bad game.  Extremely addicting, though.",4.0

"Developer Rare is a master at infusing originality into their imitations. This isn't a knock against them. William Shakespeare pulled stories and plots from other writers and crafted masterpieces. Rare is gamedom's Shakespeare, in that regard. Banjo-Kazooie is obviously influenced by Super Mario 64, although it's always unfortunate for a game to be compared to that masterpiece. While Banjo-Kazooie lacks Super Mario 64's magic and ingenuity, it has its own magic that sets it apart from Nintendo's behemoth.

The Good:
+ A fun story
+ An imaginative use of its characters
+ Creative worlds to explore

The Bad:
-- Too easy and short
-- The few parts that are too hard

The Ugly
? Why is Kazooie so insulting?

Story--9/10

The first thing that stands out is the dialogue, especially of the evil witch, Gruntilda, or Grunty, who speaks in clever rhymes. It's refreshing all the more that what she says is often funny. The game begins with her asking her mirror, ""Who is the most beautiful of them all?"" Of course, it couldn't be Gruntilda. There's nothing even remotely pretty about a fat, green hag. The most beautiful of them all is Banjo's younger sister, Tooty (who looks similar to Tiny Kong of Donkey Kong fame). So Grunty sets off to kidnap Tooty and succeeds, leaving only the mole, Bottles, as a witness. Bottles must survive a downpour of Kazooie's insults and witticisms to explain the kidnapping to Banjo and Kazooie. The question becomes, can Banjo and Kazooie save Tooty before Grunty robs her of her beauty and transfers it to herself?

Gameplay--8/10

Here is the game's bane and boon. Everything else sets it up wonderfully. The soundtrack is great, the visuals are very nice, and the opening story sequence is funny. The game controls smoothly and you have plenty of moves to learn and use throughout. The levels are varied, with plenty of collectibles and other goodies to discover. But these levels are so small, so short, so easy. I never spent an hour and a half on any one level, and most of them took less than an hour to complete. In that time, I could collect ten jigsaw puzzle pieces, one hundred musical notes, and numerous other items such as the Mumbo Jumbo skulls, extra lives, and Jinjos. Compared to Super Mario 64, I can't help but say, is that all?

There are a total of nine worlds, as well as a main hub world, which is too labyrinthine for its purpose. Rare goes a little overboard as to the amount of collectibles they expect gamers to gather. Unless you use cheats, it takes 94 out of the 100 Jigsaw pieces total to unlock every single world, including the final fight with Grunty. That's not too difficult, as I'd say about 97 of those Jigsaw pieces are a piece of cake. More than 880 of the 900 music notes are needed in order to give you somewhat of a chance against the unfairly difficult fight with Grunty (you just can't count on Rare to make a strictly children's game: see Diddy Kong Racing).

These are mostly criticisms, but they comprise a small percent of the game. You will spend most of it enjoyably. Despite the very easy difficulty, it isn't boring. There's plenty to explore in the levels, and as they go on, they become larger and more complex, especially the sprawling final level. Rare flexes all of its creative muscles in that level, revolving around the four seasons, and even includes a few semi-stories with some new characters. Not that the other levels are clunkers, but if only they could provide the same sort of entertainment, the rest of the game would have been that much more enjoyable.

Longevity--5/10

A game should only be as long as it needs to be, but I think Banjo-Kazooie needed to be a little longer. Considering what Nintendo did years earlier in Super Mario 64, it's no excuse that Rare couldn't match that level of magnitude. But it's unfair to compare any game to Super Mario 64. Most gamers will complete this, all 100 Jigsaw pieces, almost all 900 music notes, in less than twelve hours. After finishing it, there's no reason to go back. The cheats only give you infinite resources, but what's the point when you've already finished the game? The only way a game like this can extend its life is for the single player adventure to be a little longer.",4.0
"This was the first C&C game I ever purchased. I got this game when I wasn't playing much else apart from EVERQUEST, upon a friends recommendation. I wasn't to familiar with the C&C franchise of RTS games from Westwood. Now I am a fan of the series.
If you don't know, TIBERIAN SUN is a RTS about two military forces at odds with one another. The evil NOD, that wants to rule the world, while the honorable GDI wants to protect the world. The single player missions are on two discs. One is GDI and the other disc is the NOD single player missions. Both are quite fun and it helps you to learn the gameplay. I can't say I liked the full-motion-video sequences, but they are quite funny in an unintentional way!
The online multiplayer is where the real fun of TIBERIAN SUN is at! There just is no way to describe winning a long 2 hour match online and not getting booted off!
This is a good value for the money. It may not be as great as AGE OF EMPIRES or STARCRAFT, but TIBERIAN SUN is fun nonetheless. Enjoy!",4.0
"When I first got the game, it was ""Wow"", thinking it would be the best.  I have to admit, it is better than some games I have already played, but it just didn't have the zing of the other C&C games.
The computer stinks.  I could beat them playing as GDI(good guys), which is hard because NOD(bad guys) has all the best vehicles, units, and structures.  I love the Missile Silo.  Talk about blitzcrieg on your opponent!!  If you want to have about a 65% chance of winning, stick with NOD.
I wouldn't recommend the missions, because they are all too easy or all too hard.  I stick to skirmish and internet games myself.
I might venture to say that it is worth an inexpencive look.  Maybe even borrowing it from a friend.
All-in-all, I would have to say that the graphics are superb, stories are bad,  sound is so-so, and gameplay is dependant on which side you choose(NOD being better).",4.0
"Okay I admit it, the two main reasons I bought this game are James Earl  Jones and Michael Biehn, whom I believe are bloody great. However, the game  in itself is lots of fun. I'm making my way through the GDI games at the  moment, and having a good time!",4.0
"The product was in great condition, even better than I expected for 'Acceptable'. It even included a quick guide for cleaning methods of the game, should it be unplayable.

"I have always liked this game overall, and it will always have a special place in my heart. With that said, the rubberbanding A.I. in this game is beyond ridiculous. No lead is safe as the game cheats to catch up to you by increasing the speed of its controlled drivers to higher than they can possibly go. I don't know if later Mario Kart games ditched the rubberbanding A.I., but its presence is strong in this one.",4.0
I don't normally play  strategy games but this one has really caught my attention.  I played the original C&C: Red Alert and I realize Tiberian Sun hasn't brought much new to the genre but this game still manages to be  addictive. The cut-scenes are great with possibly the first good acting  ever in a computer game.  Get a a couple of friends to buy this game for  the multi play as that is one of the best parts about the game and it is  very satisfying to storm a buddies base.  The graphics and sound are good  also. Buy it.,4.0
"I have to admit something, I love the way this game looks!  It is spectacular in the graphics sense, but the story just left me out to dry.  The orginal command and conquer storyline was way better.  The GDI missions  are a joke in this game and I have to say it...NOD RULEZ!  The NOD missions  are very fun to look at and play especially the evil HAL computer that  talks to you in the cool voice.  The game play units are completely  unbalanced!  On GDI side, all you have to do is amass a huge army of Tank  Mechs and you can destroy any base no matter how fortified it is.  On the  NOD side, amass a huge army of 30 mobile artillery and nobody can stand in  your way.  The game is worth buying to see how it looks, but the gameplay  is horrible and some of the missions are close to impossible which may  frustrate some novice players.  Ok Westwood you have provided the  interface, now quit slacking and give us a good story!",4.0

"Banjo Kazooie is not for everyone. Before purchasing this game you should first ask yourself how much you like platformers. This game is hard. The graphics give it a kiddie appeal, but after you conquer level 1, and/or 2,

the game starts getting pretty hard. Harder then most platformers. If you like SuperMario64, then there's a good chance you'll will like this game.

This game is like a offspring of Mario.

There is some cool stuff in the game, like being able to fly by collecting feathers in connection with using a jump pad thingy. This is a good game if you like to spend a lot of time wandering around through worlds and collecting objects to progress, in Mario fashion.

This isn't a Zelda type game. You don't grow as a character, and you don't recieve much items that offer change to your character, Banjo. I just bought this game, and I keep going back little by little for about two hours a day to play it and progress through the levels. The game still offers a lot of gameplay, but is a little bit of a ""card-board cut-out"" type of play. You don't really get envolved with any real substance (wether it be story or adventure) to really ultimately care about it. Banjo Kazooie is good, but I wouldn't give it a A+ if I was to rate. I would give it a average B, which says alot compared to most games. Gamespot rates this game as ""Superb"" 9.5, and I just don't see it. But then again, Gamespot has down-rated a lot of really good games that offer ""superb"" gameplay. Winback, being one that comes to mind. BanjoKazooie is a Good game, it will distract your mind and keep you entertained on those rainy days, but it isn't excellent.",4.0
Another great one for 64.,4.0
"I've had this game since way back when it was released; I just never got the chance to write a review.

The Story: Banjo's sister, Tooty, was ""the most beautiful girl around"" and Grunty the witch wanted her beauty, so she pulled an Amber Alert and took her to her lair. Banjo's lazy bum the whole time was sleeping. It's up to you to get jiggy's and notes and what-not to stop Grunty and get Banjo's sister back.

Graphics: 9.5/10. Awesomely different and creative worlds. From a sewer, to a pirate ship on an island, to a desert and into an icy snowland, there are tons of different and unique worlds to play through. The graphics are stellar for the N64, with bright colors and cool characters with good animations. This is one of the best N64 games as far as graphics go next to games like Donkey Kong 64 and Legend Of Zelda: Majora's Mask.

Sound: 9/10. There aren't really any voices in this game; just kind of sound effects that are different for each character. Blubber on Treasure Grove Cove sounds like he's burping or throwing up, Kazooie sounds like a gagging bird, Banjo sounds like a big old hick of a bear... and so on. The music in this game, though, is some of the catchiest and the best music i've heard in really any adventure game. The music doesn't really get old, and whoever created it is brilliant. Overall, the sound is really, really good.

Control: 8.5/10. Being an adventure game, there are a lot of different controls for a lot of different moves. And since the N64 controller is the way it is ( pretty annoying ) it's easy to get confused even after playing for hours on end, just because you go brain dead. The controls are a bit strange at first to do some of the attacks, but you will get used to them anyways.

Fun: 9/10. A great game from beginning to end. Get the jiggys, move on. Get the notes, move on. That simple? No. This game is challenging and is for all ages, even if it does have a kiddy approach. The game lasts maybe 40 hours or so depending on how fast you get through the game. Great characters, great level design, and fantastic music makes this a must buy. This is one of the best games on the N64, and I.M.O., the best adventure game. Pick this game up now; it is better than its sequel and the Game Boy Advanced ones, even if all three are fantastic. Buy this game!!

"Zelda: Ocarina of Time is one of my favorite games. Unfortunately this game is only available for N64 (and now nintendo 3DS) but if you happen to own a N64, this is one of the games to get! I don't know anyone who doesn't like taking Link on his adventures through Hyrule. While, a little mature for kids that might be under High school age - I was playing this game in Middle school. And I loved it. I still play it to this day.

When playing, you get to take Link on an adventure through Hyrule, starting out in the Forest with the Great deku tree, and continuing on. You learn things like how to play the Ocarina of time, and at one point, you use it to travel from when Link is a boy to an adult and back again. Link is a ""boy"" who doesn't have a fairy in the beginning (which, is un-common and he is an outcast.) - Navi comes to Link and becomes his fairy on his great journey to save the Forest and Hyrule. Link travels outside the forest and meets some interesting characters along the way, including an Owl - who will stop and talk to you from time to time, to a farmers daughter, who helps you get Link's horse, to the Princess Zelda herself.

Zelda would be the best birthday/Christmas gift for anyone who ""loves"" games - and has an N64 system, and likes Zelda. I'm sure that there are many Adults out there who would love to play this game again.",4.0

"""Turok 2: Seeds of Evil"" has a lot to love about it.  The music rocks.  The graphics are still quite good for N64 standards (especially if you have the Expansion Pak).  It controls just fine (get used to the C-button controls).  There's some good multiplayer.  It's a bloody, gory mess.  And the weapons are freaking awesome (just wait till you see the Cerebral Bore).

But there's a big problem with it: DESIGN

I'm not talking about the art direction or graphical look.  ""Turok 2"" is still a good-looking game with gruesome enemies and solid lighting effects.  But these levels are confusing as all hell, with the exception of the 1st one.  If we had a better story to go along with it, then maybe there'd be a reason to plow through.  But for whatever reason, Acclaim & Iguana decided to force the player to scour every inch of the 6 levels, and if you're stuck, you're stuck for good.

You will be required to light beacons, find keys, and rescue children.  Again, Level 1 isn't so bad, but Levels 2-6 are gonna be a pain in the butt if you get lost.  The map you're given sucks.  And to make matters worse, you can't leave or quit levels once you've selected them.

But if you're not too proud to grab a strategy guide or go online, then ""Turok 2"" will be more fun than perhaps some of us had back in 2000.  The combat is still a blast (although the final Primegen boss is impossible without cheat codes).  The presentation is sharp.  And the Turok world is still very unique from today's overload of military/war shooters.

""Turok 2"" was one of the N64's most critically-acclaimed titles for the console, rightfully so.  But be warned, it'll test your gaming logic more than you expect.",4.0
"Mario Kart 64 is pretty fun. 8 characters and 16 tracks. In 1996, that was a lot. I still think that you should download it on the Wii Virtual Console for $10.63. Four hundred dollars is a lot of money. Yoshi's Story is six hundred. Both of these games I downloaded on the VC.",4.0
My game has no issues. Like new condition. Endless fun with 4 players. I was a little surprised that a new game could cost as much as a new system. Used gane for me.,4.0
"This game is really fun, but I honestly enjoyed Crash Team Racing for the PlayStation a lot more. One thing that annoys me about this game is that you can't look behind you. I pressed every button and I can't get the camera to face behind the racer and this makes it impossible to shoot green turtle shells from behind without proper aiming. So nine out of ten times, I'm going to miss my target. How did Nintendo screw up this badly. And the racers are pre-rendered much like how Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong were in Donkey Kong Country for the SNES. I was wondering why wasn't it computer generated like Super Mario 64? It's still a nice little game, a little pricey, but still nice to have in your N64 collection.",4.0
"The movie ""Goldeneye"" was a box-office hit and now it comes to nintendo. Every wonder how James Bond found Natalia, how Xenia died, or how Bond killed Trevalyn. Now you get to do it yourself. You travel to Siberia to recover blueprints, go on a battleship to save hostages, launch a space shuttle, and shoot all the bad guys you want with over 30 weapons from Gernades, lasers, all handguns, machine guns and rocket and nuclear bombs. Try out the game to see what you would do if you were Bond. Here's your chance to be 007.",4.0
Love this game.  So much fun.  It is even better with the cheats.  One of the best games for the N64.  I can play this for hours apon hours.  I love this game.,4.0
"Turok 2 was and still is a magnificent first person shooter. the graphics are like that of an early ps2 game. the game has a wide array of different levels from cities, to spaceships, gigantic mantis hives, underground lairs and even more surprises. what really stunned me about the game was almost life like quality of it. you would see birds flying in the sky, fires that were almost realistic. sometimes if you have been playing the game for a while it almost isn't a game anymore. you actually feel like you are turok exploring these massive worlds. the only two complaints i have are the jumping which plagued you in the first game. Finally when you got into a firefight with several enemies at once the screen would become glitchy. all in all turok 2 is a title worthy of a spot in any fps fans collection.",4.0
"Mario Kart arrived in great condition, and is a very fun game.  My son enjoys racing games, and I'm pretty terrible, but this one was actually quite fun, especially with being able to throw shells at competitors, or zap them with lightening, etc.  I even can stay on the track for most of the time!",4.0
"I'm an expert game player and this tested me. It had the most amazing graphics! The levels follow the movie perfectly with a few exceptions. You get to shoot a lot, but once in a while you have to think about what to do. In other words I have this game and I love it.",4.0
"Turok 2 is a great first person shooter. It's only real fault is the frame rate, which is horrible. In Turok 1 the framerates weren't bad, although they had problems. In the sequal, the framerate ruins the whole game. Everything else is almost perfect, the graphics are astounding, as is the AI and weaponry. Even with no baddies on the screen, the framrate dips pretty low, and if you have 2 or more monsters on the screen, it gets almost impossible to shoot accuratly. Don't get me wrong, this is a great game, but if you can't stand low framerates like me, you might want to hold onto your cash. Well, maybe for ... you can give this a try, that's not much more than for a rental these days.",4.0
This game is awesome. Either something is wrong with the price listing or the people who think they can sell a 64 and games like Mario Kart for hundreds of dollars are completely out of their gourds! This game can be found for around 20 dollars so do not get ripped off.,4.0
"This is a must-have for your N64.  It is fun to play by yourself, but the most fun is when you play with 1-3 friends.  :)  The graphics are not the greatest, but it usually doesn't affect the gameplay.  A classic N64 game.",4.0

"I have been playing this game since it first came out and this game never gets tiring. It is a real blast when playing with friends, siblings, or whoever.

There are 8 characters to choose from (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Yoshi, Wario, Donkey Kong, or Bowser) with 16 tracks available to race on. During the races you can obtain many different items to get the upper hand in the races (shells 4 shooting at opponents, mushrooms 4 speed boost, bananas 4 traps etc). The characters and environments are very well designed considering this game came out in 1997, and has good catchy music. I think this game is ok if you plan to play solo. You can earn trophies and do the time trials to get the best times on a track. That is all you accomplish when single playing. The game is much more fun when playing with others. The game also has the balloon challenge which also adds fun to the multiplayer experience. Overall, great game when playing with friends. You could still have fun playing on your own, but don't expect much. Still a good game.",4.0
"I have to be honest: Normally, I'm not into these first person shooter games.  They're just so clunky, most of the time you can't tell where you're going, you don't know if an enemy is behind you, (Or at times even in front of you, if you get a weird camera angle) and plus might I add that you can't see your character, which does not really, (For me, most of the time) give that whole imaginative feel that you ARE that character.
  Well, Goldeneye is an excellent and well made game.
  I don't know why people complain about the graphics...it's actually kind of cool, and plus the enemies in this game are from head to toes so detailed that you think they're real.  The scientists in the facility level are well detailed, and most all the characters are animated incredibly.
  Besides, you take on the role of James Bond.  James Bond! The hero that defined action! This game is not dull, and at times it is so scary when you are overswarmed by a bunch of enemies in one small room.
  The multiplayer mode, is, of course, wonderful.  You can choose from power weapons, sniper rifels, Dostovals, Shotguns, PP7's, proximity mines, hand grenades, laser guns, and basicly everything else that you can think of.  It is an entertaining game, and it is well worth the money.
  The camera angles rock.  you never get lost.
  So, why didn't I give this game Five stars?  Read below and find out.

  THE BADS OF THE GAME
  There are some major glitches.  You can see your enemies literally walk through walls, not completely, but almost there.
  At times the doors, when I command it to open with the B button, it still won't open, even if I already DID get an access card for the door in the first place.  The reason behind that is the fact that an enemy is probably trying to open the door as well, but how am I supposed to know that? So, I stand back, the enemy comes in, and oh, guess what, it turns out that there isn't just one of them, there's thirty, so they all shoot at me, and I die.  You can easily die in this game just due to glitches, which makes it very difficult and frustrating.
  If you forget one thing on a mission, just one small thing which most of the time has nothing to do with the story, then you have to start the whole mission over again.  You don't just do the thing you forgot, either, you have to do all the things that you did do, as well as the things you did not.
  The game is predictible, due to the fact that it follows the movie, although when it does not follow the movie, (Which it does a lot) then it gets kind of dissapointing because what you expected did not happen.
  The puzzles can be frustrating.  I'm still trying to figure out how to get the bottling room on the facility level.
  The game is also very gory.  I don't know why they gave this game a TEEN rating instead of a mature...it should of been rated mature.

  Now, for the GOODS of this game.
  GOODS
  Use an incredibly large arsenal of weaponry and more weaponry...prepare to save the world, it's gonna be a rough ride.
  It follows the movie really well, (Most of the time, anyways) And if you're a big fan of james bond you will really enjoy this game.  Even if you aren't you'll still enjoy it.
  You play the role of james Bond, which is worth it within itself.
  This game is the greatest First person shooter game for the N64.  The controls aren't so difficult that you'll get lost and forget which buttons to use while you're losing, but they are simple and easy and at the same time fun.  And even if you don't like the controls, you can decide which buttons you want for which ones the controller screen.
  There's nothing that you can't shoot or destroy.
  The cheats are FUNNY!  I mean, honestly, try the invisibility mode. You can shoot a near bye dashboard when a Gaurd is near, and that gaurd will start freaking out and look around to see who did that.  This makes the game easier also, and the invincibility mode is good too, although I tried and realized that you can't have the invisibility mode and invincibility at the same time.  You can also make the bad guys heads small and stuff, which is really funny to see.
  The way that the characters are animated are almost identicle to the characters in the movie...they look exactly like the actors.
  At the end of every level, it tells you how many kills you did, how many limb shots, how many head shots, and how many body shots you had.
  The artificial intelligence with the badguys aren't all that challenging, but when there's a whole crowd of them, watch out!
  This game is excellent.  Did I mention that it's excellent? Let me repeat it again: This game is excellent! Excellent I tell you, excellent!",4.0

"I got this game because every person said it was the best game ever. For 1998 it is, but now it's just good. Not as good as wind waker or twilight princess. The level design is good. Parts are 3d, others are resident evil camera. In short it works okay, but I screwed up many times becaus of it. the graphics were good several years ago, but now they are muddy and polygonal. Aside from that, it's zelda. Nothing new. If you buy it, don't expect it to live up to all the hype.",4.0

"Good graphocs, multiplayer mayhem, secret levels of which the first is kind of like a part of the movie ""Moonraker"" (earn this level by beating the game on secret agent) and the second of which is where you have to beat Baron Sameidei with the Golden Gun (earn this level by beating the game on OOagent). The game is not overly gory. If you shoot someone a red patch appears on there clothes, but it is hard to see on most of the 3d characters. With twenty levels in all and ten or so multiplayer areanas it is no wonder this game was voted game of the year in ""Nintendo Power"" magazine. The music is excellent and can really get you excited and it can also get you scared. The AI is pretty dumb on the agent setting, it develops about a fifty percent intelligence upgrade on secret agent setting, and on OOagent you had better find some cover! The game can take a while to beat if you want to get all the secret levels and secret codes for the game by beating the main game missions in a certain time with all of the objectives met. Have and watch out!",4.0
"This mario kart changed all mario karts in the future. This is the first mario kart that has mini games and computer generated graphics. I mean the 64 as u can tell the graphics have changed allot from the snes. This mario kart has many more features and great graphics. The sound is great also. If i had a choice of which mario kart to have for free if i did not have any of them it would be this one. I don't know why but for some reason this one is really fun.

"Mario Kart 64 is one of that games that is hard to find, but that effort has a very good reward, 'cuz this is one o'that games that began the real 4-player madness (you know...), it's also considered as one of the best Mario Kart games ever (better than Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, and maybe as good as Mario Kart Wii). The only thing that I didn't give the 5/5 is that this game is a bit tedious. Yes, I know that graphics... forget about the graphics, 'cuz first, it's the N64, and second, graphics are not important in this game that focus on fun.

"This is a kid friendly racing game. Many are big turn offs with sexual, and violent usage.
The various levels,and terrain, are fun to explore, with simpler navigation. Each area brings gamers new, and exciting obstacle challenges. Users can chose which character they would like to be. Adding a special pack, sold separately, gives players a feeling of riding one of these cars. A unique factor when a competitor goes off track they can go through water, and sand.
If I remember correctly, depending where you land you'll notice the slowing of your racer. In water you'll see bubbles.
Both a con and a helper is to race against the program. In the bad it often wins, but in the good you can gain awareness on how the track goes, learning to avoid most problems, and use  your tools to win!",4.0
"This shoot-em-up game is only for ages 10 and up. Heavy on violence and fun. The only problem is if you are standing in a doorway, and there is a guy facing you, he won't see you.  ...  Anyway, it's pretty good.",4.0
"When I had this game, I did not stop playing until I got to winning the game. It's fun for awhile to throw objects at people that are racing against you. It has a four player mode, which is not bad, but sometimes gets a little confusing when you're watching other people racing. The split screen should never be included. Although, that it is which is easy to get distracted. But Mario Kart is fun and it should be in one of the hand-held games, too. I wouldn't mind playing this. Oh, I have the one on Gameboy Advance, which is cool but not like the one from Nintendo 64. Now, that confused me.",4.0

"Mario kart is an awesome game. Even though it can be sometimes hard to see with the not so good graphics this game offers tons of fun. There are sixteen tracks each different and fun. There are alot of awesome owerups and a good variety of characters to choose from. There is stratagy in how you start and to come in firsts you must use you're skills. The variety in this game is awesome. You can race anywhere from a twisting track called Choco Mountain to Dk's jungle and even race in Bowsers castle! There are other tracks like Rainbow road and one of my favorites, Sherbet land!
But I was dissaointed that I actually didn't know how to win the game on single player mode. Even though it's quite simple. Come in first throughout the entire cup. (There are four cups in the game). But other times it appears as if Peach get's all of the good powerups! Like triple red shells! But besides this I love the game...",4.0
"Mario Kart: 64.  It is such an improvement from the Super Nintendo version.  The graphics are quite detailed in comparison to the other 64 games out.  I would say, above average.  However, the graphics is not what sets this game off above the others.  It is the enjoyment level!
Not only is it fun to compete with others like your family, friends, or even the computer player (AI) but it's got a great Grand Prix mode in which you can compete for a Gold Cup.  Get all gold Cups and you gain a bonus.
The only complaint I have about this game, (reason why I gave it a four instead of a 5) is that the AI are too smart.  Races sometimes seem to be unfair.  You throw items at them, knock them to the side, speed ahead of them and it seems like whatever you do, it doesn't matter.  This can be frustrating.  Though the controls are WAY improved over the Super Nintendo version, it still is hard to control the carts (karts) around corners.
Overall, this is an addicting game.
Have a Super Nintendo? Buy Mario Kart for Super Nintendo
Have a Gamecube? Definetely buy Mario Kart: Double Dash for Gamecube.
And finally, if you have a N64, Mario Kart 64 is one to deeply consider",4.0
"One of the first games for the Nintendo 64, Mario Kart 64 is actually a sequal for Super Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo system.  That game was a blast and this one is just as good.
Think go-carts with the Mario gang.  You can choose one of a group of Mario characters to race with.  Each character has it's own attributes, both positive and negative, and can greatly affect how well you do, so you may find yourself trying different characters until you find one that best fits your racing style.
While racing, you have the chance to grab special items (turtle shells, invincibility stars, banana peels, etc.) which you can use for yourself or against your opponents, dodging their items at the same time as well as any obstacles inherent to the particular race course you're on.  The higher you finish in each race, the more points you earn.  After 4 races, the winner is determined.
This game is just as fun to play as the original Kart game from the SNES.  My only suggestion is to take care that your wife isn't more competitive than you, otherwise you're in for a beating.",4.0
"This game is defanitly worth the time and money.(...)You can choose from either mario grand prix,VS.,battle,or time trial.

 In mario grand prix you choose from a wide selection of characters wich one you want to be. You Can pick from four different cups,each with four different race tracks. Then it's time to race as you play against the 7 other characters. Up to 4 people can play mario grand prix.
 In VS.,you play against one computer character or 2 family members or friends. You can choose any course is the game. Up to 3 can play VS.

 In the battle mode up to four can play. You get 3 balloons and the other player(s) try to pop them. The last one standing wins. Up to 4 can play battle mode.
 Finally,in time trial only one person plays. You can choose any course,you try to make a good time and if you want,you can try to beat it. Only one player can do time trial.

Otherwise,  the courses are so real and the competition is definately hard.  I luve the mushroom cup the best because of its tropical island course!",4.0
"I got this game in '97 and it is still fun to play. Unlike the original Mario Kart for the SNES or the new Mario Kart Super Circuit for the GBA (both of these games you have to use a control pad to drive)you can use the control stick on the N64 controller ot drive your go-kart which is a hundred times easier than a control pad. The game is easy in the begining, but it hets much harder as you get closer to finishing it. The graphics are spectacular, and so is the music. In one course you can go off roading and drive around and look at Princess Toadstool's castle form Super Mario 64! The tracks are cleverly designed and all to often you'll find yourselft barely winning or completing a race. The game does offer a good challenge with eight drivers to choose from which onclude the following and their speed: Mario average, Luigi average, Peach average, Toad fast, Yoshi fast, Donkey Kong slow, Wario slow, Bowser slow. The speeds come to play in the later levels where only Toad and Yoshi are your best bet for first place. Again with the GBA and the Gamecube (which launched today as I am writing this) Mario Kart 64 is a must have for N64 owners who can't get the Gamecube or the GBA for now. Also each character has his or her own course and the game has race and battle multiplayer modes where in the battle mode each racer has three balloons arround his or her go-kart and everyone has to try to knock out everyones balloons.

"Ahhhh! I love this game! It's so great. My friend gave it to me and I fell in love with it fast! I played Mario Kart for the SNES and thought it was the best thing since sliced bread. When I found out Mario Kart was for N64, I went bezerk. This was the first game to my N64 collection. You choose between 8 characters. You can get over 10 different powerups, including the legendary star which makes you invincible, banana peels which make opponents skid out of control, lightning bolts which makes characters small so you can smush them, mushrooms that boost your engine, and 3 kinds of shells. A green shell will go and bounce off anything, A red shell will do its best to find a character and smash them, and a spike shell with automatically find the player in 1st place and destroy them without fault. The reason it is 4 stars is because they didn't go the extra mile. If you play 1 or 2 player(s) you can do a Grand Prix, but not with 3 or 4. In player 1 mode you cant do a battle or do a vs. with the CPU. Battle only contains 4 tracks. I guess what i'm trying to say is that i wish it was more open. Taking shortcuts won't work because Lukita drags you back when your at the top of the mountain. This game would be the best if you were allowed to do more.",4.0
I think its A GREAT RACING GAME. IT HAS GOOD GRAPHICS. ITS ENTERTAINING & FUN. ITS A RELAXING GAME FOR THE MIND & TOUGH ON THE HANDS.,4.0
"Graphics: 9/10 - Eye-catching, bold and pretty, Mario Kart 64's graphics are fulfilling and nice to look at.
Sound: 8/10 - Lots of bells, whistles, engines and da-da's in this game. They are just small sound, but bring out some sort of livelihood.
Value: 8/10 - Even though I don't have a Nintendo 64, if I did, I would probably buy this game because it is lots of fun to play. It can also be very strategic at times, which is good for a racing car game.
Overall: 8/10 - Nothing too memorable, but it's delightfully entertaining to play when you are actually using the controls. Mario Kart 64 gives you things to do and stuff to work out. It's the first game I played on Nintendo 64 and as far as I'm concerned, it's well worth the time.",4.0
"This is a great game. Awesome levels in single player, Cool characters, awesome graphics, no glitches that I can think of. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the multiplayer mode.

For example, the Kakariko town music is completely recycled from Zelda: A Link to the Past. In fact this game borrows a lot from Zelda: A Link to the Past, though they do manage to change some things in OOT here and there. Still for what it's worth Zelda: OOT is still a pretty darn good game, though I think the story should have been more original.",4.0

"Before Digimon or pokemon there was- Azure Dreams? This playstation 1 title has all the basics of the monster collecting genre are all here. The pace is a bit slower though because you collect monster eggs to increase your stable of creatures as opposed to just capturing whatever monster crosses your path. I believe this is is balanced out by the random layouts of the Monster Tower floors, and the fact that you get to fight too, not just your monsters. The role playing aspect of the game is also a bit more difficult- you can actually mess up and say the wrong thing. Which makes sense as the hero is also completing quests, collecting girlfriends, trying to build public structures, and improve his family's home.
 On the downside- the translation from Japanese to English left a lot of grammatical errors. The social, emotional, and pesonality issues in the relationship conversations may be a bit too complex for your average 10 yr old pokemaniac. Over all a great game with a little human violence, but otherwise safe a clean. A good bet for young teens that are losing interest in other monster hunt games.",4.0
"I love me basket ball games and Grand Theft Auto. And it is fun to play games with your friends and all but none of them has this Masterpiece.

The only problem is the graphics but this game was made in 1998. So you can't on my boy Link for that. This game has a very well thought story line although it does have that save the princess kind of story line to it. But it is really good game with Link starting as a child and, well I'm not going to tell all of it to the people that still haven't played it yet. This is a very fun game to play if you don't use a stupid guide book. You can still beat it if you really sit down think. That makes it fun, it is a very long game too, although you don't have much to do after you beat it. And it is not a two player game, And no internet thing. I just don't think no game has this one.

Since Sept. 98, that cycle has been broken, stopped by one game that never got replaced, even by it's sequals, nothing ever ended out better than Zelda: Ovarina of Time. This game has revolutionized 3D gaming with its Z-Target system. It has enchanted and bewildered people with its magnificant storyline. It has taken the lives of thousands of people because of all the side-quests and collectible items in it. This game, I am predicting, will probably still rain supreme until the next system comes out (The one after gamecube). Its Z-Targeting system makes Link (the main character) look at an enemy, within this looking, he can circle around it in stategic patterns, accurately aim and strike the sword without missing and hitting air a yard away, and eaily and quickly dodge and backflip attacks. Many games, even nowadays, imitate this system, but fail to get it as correct and perfect as Zelda did/does. The storyline starts off telling of a magical forest with many never-growing children in it. All these children have one compainon fairy with them, except one boy, who does not. Right from hearing this setence in the game for the first time, you know your in for an adventurous, complicated yet slightly realistic storyline that will take your life for at least a month. And, this game has many, many side quests to do. There are 100 special spiders to defeat and get treasures with, 50 magic beans to be planted and give a passegeway to unaccesible areas, 25 heart pecies to collect to get a whole lot of health with, 15 masks to sell and play around with, 6 empty bottles to collect, a chicken to rais, and a huge trading sidequest that eventually leads to the possesion of the strongest weapon in the game. And much more. This game also has the perfect sound to it. The cheerfull, happy nature of the magical forest can be perfectly heard in it's background music. The adventurous, wide and far meadows of hyrule feild are perfectly expressed in it's background song. The fast-paced and action-packed lives of the desert theives is clearly expressed in it's song. Everywhere you turn in this game, you are greeted with a new background song that sings perfectly the attributes and unique features of that place, and transations perfectly with whatever the player/link might be doing in that place. This game's sequal, Majoras Mask, suffered horribly from the lack of this. And the prevous games in the series didn't meet this either. One more thing though, I'll admit it to the world, I hate the main Zelda theme. I'm glad its not in Ocarina of Time, In a game that so clearly stands out with it's music, one old sounding, bland song that dosnt fir well with hyrule feild wouv'dv ruined the experience of going out of kokiri forest and seeing it for the first time. Oh, I forot to mention that part too, the game has a perfect attidude for adventure in it. The places are designed very well, and when mixed in with the fabulous background music, gives a feeling of adventure that is completely unparelled to any other game, whatsoever. The first moment you walk out of the small and cramped kokiri forest, which actually used to seem so big, onto the your first grasses of hyrule feild, the sun will blind the screen for a moment, and as rising, reveal this spectacular, wide open feild with a tuft of trees, a monstor here and there, a ranch in the middle, and a clear blue sky with a brightly shining sun. Along the feild, a rise in elevation starts, as you climb the hill, you can see even more than you could before, a magestic, huge catsle, a winding clear blue river, a deep valley, a menancing volcanoe, and a huge lake, along with a tuft of trees, and a monstor here and there. As you travel to new places, you will feel almost the exact same feeling of adventure too, when seeing the towering windmill of Kakariko village above the small, humble houses of the village below it, with the perfect backgrond music for example. With this great feeling of adventure, huge enviroments, much huger than even the ones of nowaday games, and a great storyline and absolutly stunning soundtrack, Ocarina of Time is the Greatest game of all time, until a greater game will come out, wich will probably take a very very long time. If you don't already own this game (Shame on you), you should buy it immediatly, and while waiting for it to ship, download an emulated version. Now. Or else.",4.0
"This is still a great game to own, especialy if you missed it, but the graphics are dated.  If you have a GameCube, find a way to get it on there, and be happy you did.",4.0
I was always a fan of Zelda when it first came out for the original Nintendo.  This is a fairly challenging game and I got bored with it quickly.  There isn't a lot of violence in this game but I think it's too advanced for kids to play.,4.0
"I'm not really a fan of N64.  I've always been more of a Playstation one fanatic, but Zelda is undoubtedly the best game that I have ever played.  If you think that Final Fantasy is good, then Zelda will make all of the installments in final fantasy look like junk.  There's only a couple of games on the nintendo N64 console that of which I liked, and that was Gauntlet Legends, Super Mario, and Donkey Kong.  But this game beats them all by a longshot.
  Then why did I give this game four stars instead of five?  The reason is because of the...problems listed below.
  1.  This game is HARD. I don't mean hard as in ""Challenging"" I'm talkin' about the whole you-possibly-will-never-ever-complete-the-game-without-a-strategy-guide hard.  The type of frustration which can rack your nerves big time.
  2.  There are a couple of glitches in the game. Example: I dare you to cut a sign with your sword.  Then play Zeldas lullaby with your ocerina of time.  The piece of sign which you had just sliced and diced will float.  That's just one of the glitches.
  3.  A little confusing, as far as the story goes.  It's better to play the game twice and see if you still understand it.
  4.  Replay value isn't very high.  Once you complete it, that's it.  It's so hard that I wouldn't ever want to go through the same frustration again, as to the fact that it was very difficult, even if you do know what you're doing.
  Okay, those were the bads.  Here are the goods.
  1.  The graphics are outstanding.  Wow.  The whole world of Termina reminds me of middle earth, only a lot less dark and ten times more exotic.
  2.  Once you beat the game, you feel satisfied with yourself.  Sure, this game is a little short, but it will still take you a long time to beat it, no matter how experienced you are with gaming.
  3. The plot is good and twists a lot.  I know that I said it was kind of confusing, and it kind of is, but it's still fun and the things that of which I did understood surprised me a lot.
It's sort of a mystery.
  4.  Fluint and absolutely excellent cut and FMW sequences.  It's true.  Like I said above, the graphics are wonderful.  And plus, exploring a small portion of Termina, which you do through out the game, is an experience that you don't wanna miss.
  5.  The bad guys are challenging, but not so challenging that you'll be ripping your hair out.  Once you beat them, you feel satisfied.
  6.  Highly addictive gameplay and plus you won't stop until you beat the game.
  But there's one major, and I mean MAJOR problem with this game.  This game is so addictiive that you might forget about everything else in life.  Remember your family?  You won't when you get this game, since you'l be wanting to play this game even more. A Anyways, get the game.",4.0
"I am pretty picky when it comes to video games. When I buy a fantasy RPG game I think Middle Earth. You know a serious swords and sorcery type thing. This game may have fabulous gameplay,good music and decent graphics but I had to take that last star away due to this games rediculous light hearted theme. Some characters are so unessicerily cartoony it makes me want to rip the game out of the system and toss it across the room. Now don't get me wrong I like this game alot. It starts out great. A good cinematic and a good opening dungeon. It keeps going strong for a while with what is a great plot. Then somwhere it just gets too goofy for my taste. For example this is a fantasy game yet there is a ranch in it. When you enter the ranch twangy country music plays and the owner talks like a texan. See what I mean its just out of place. I have not fully beaten the game but so far aside from the comical arrow in its butt this is a really good game.",4.0
"do u want a fun game? if so then Buy Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time! this has so many challenges and puzzles u'll wish u were at school where the tests are easy(actually no one wants to go to school unless they're derranged or something). If u have a choice between this game and Majora's Mask,  buy this because it is alot more fun.  Link is back with new enemies, friends, and oh yes the fat gorons that want to hug u!  buy this game",4.0
"I got this game 2 years ago and I still like to play it. It is a really neat game and is fun for a long time, because there are so many ways to go. I like it when the horse jumps over the fence right after you rescue it. But I think it should be rated teen not everyone because it has some gore and blood. This is a a great game and I recommend it for new gamers.",4.0
"I haven't played any other zelda games besides this one, so take that into account if I sound ignorant. I just finished playing through this game the second time. I mixed feelings about it.
Gameplay: I am fully ready to admit that it is one of the best games I've played as far as gameplay. The 'action' type RPG is refreshing after playing turn-based games for a while. There are some cons to the 3D style used though. Although the vast majority of the time the shifting views will only help you on your quest, you will without a doubt experience times of frustration when you just want to smash the controller into little pieces. This often happens when you warp, and shift from the 'movie' type frame to the gameplay frame. That's not really a big deal though. The organization of buttons and their respective functions is usually very handy too. There are times when you wish there were more 'c' buttons, but all controllers have limitations. There were also times when I wished I could use the arrow pad instead of the poorly designed analog (I've been spoiled by the playstation controller).  Another whine I have is regarding your companion fairy. There were a few times when I found her mildly helpful, but usually when I was really stuck and in need of assistance, she would just tell me the same thing she told me last time, which only frustrated me more. Its a good thing you can find tons of great FAQs and walkthroughs at gamefaqs.com (wink wink).
Graphics: I was very impressed with ""Link's"" graphics. All of his movements and features are realistic. It is obvious that the same amount of time was not spent on the majority of other characters, however. I was very disappointed at the apparent lack of dedication when it came to making all characters at least somewhat realistic. I would just prefer consistency. The dungeon graphics are always very good. The monsters and especially the bosses were meticulously designed to look menacing. Some of the world graphics were disappointing. The one that comes to my mind is the market, where you rotate from the well (you'll know what I'm talking about). The resolution stinks pretty bad. On other places, like the frame right before that (when entering the town) it is very nice. I'm not sure why there's a difference, though it may have something to do with the fact that the market scene has to move, whereas the second one doesn't.
Story: This is where I feel that the quality drops off. The whole ""save the princess from the evil man"" story worked at first when RPGs were just beginning, but now developers have a better opportunity to make engrossing stories. This is frequently demonstrated on turn-based games like the FF series. In fact, I feel that a great story has become a staple of turn-based RPGs. Although the story here may be slightly more complex than my initial description, it is predictable throughout the game. Any personality shown by a character is very shallow. I was usually too busy working my way through one of the many incredible dungeons to worry about the story though (I suspect this was the intention of the makers).
So, in conclusion, great gameplay, some good graphics, shallow story. Get the game; it's worth it.",4.0
"Zelda ""occarina of time"" is much like the rest of the Zelda series... it doesn't disappoint! With really cool items to collect and using your songs/spells to warp around, the entire game offers whole new dimensions.
Things such as a horse you can call and run about the world, play carnival-like games to win power-ups, collect hard-to-find items such as the two-handed sword (which is better than the master sword, but you can't use a shield), magically powered arrows, and more!
This game is fairly easy to beat, but finding everything will take you much longer!",4.0
"This game was a tad on the easy side for the most part, but it was still great fun. One of the best Zelda games. Cool places to explore and neat items to find.",4.0
"This is overall one of the best Zelda games to date. It has lush environments and crisp sound effects and music. And the controls are super!  You have great control over link and the camera. The weapon system is good  as well. The story line leaves something to be desired though. It is a very  basic story: Ganondorf kidnaps Zelda, Link tries to save her by going to  the future. THAT'S IT! There are very few twists in the plot, if any, that  I can remember. Also, The game was way too short. I bought the game around  Thanksgiving and had it beaten by the 2nd or 3rd week of December. But,  putting those negatives aside, this is one hell of a game. (Oh yeah, the  Water Temple is TORTURE! )",4.0
"Fans of dedicated single-player ""first person shooter"" games who've never played this game before should definitely not pass it up.  HL takes an utterly unoriginal idea for either games or movies and crafts an utterly unstoppable gaming experience.  You play Gordon Freeman, who works in the bowels of an ultra-secret, underground research facility called ""The Black Mesa"".  (Having played the game yet I'm still not sure what's supposed to be going on in BM - it's what happens that matters.)  Oozing high-tech, the facility is host to another dimension when you/Freeman accidentally...do something that tears a whole in the fabric of our own - allowing beings from that other world to enter ours.

Now, if you think that these otherworldly denizens are peaceful beings intent on fostering cross-dimensional love, or that your fellow human beings will enter the Black Mesa unarmed intent on warmly welcoming these beings to our world, I'm afraid you've picked up the wrong game entirely.  For in the bowels of ""Black Mesa"" you'll confront howling dog things, flying crabs, alien-zombified versions of your colleagues, gigantic aliens that breathe fire through their fists, aliens that hang from ceilings (and entrap their victims using these vine-looking things) and squads of human special forces troops intent on killing everything that moves.  If the above attracts you because you think it may be the setting that elevates the nobility of the human existence, I should warn you to look elsewhere - for in ""Half Life"", you'll find yourself acting indiscriminately with a 9mm automatic, a submachine gun, grenades and (most regrettably of all) a nasty crowbar; you'll make few friends and find yourself (for the most part) alone and (not infrequently) exiled to ventilation ducts (again with the ducts!!) to avoid getting shot at by humans, or burned, bitten, bolted or tongue-bathed by aliens.  Complex problem solving skills (as much as marksmanship or bullet-saving) are crucial in this game - in which your enemies have above-average levels of AI.  There are unfortunately times when a level may be hung up by the failure to achieve some specific mission-goal, but this is on the whole a game in which the goals are sufficiently complex to make you feel cool for achieving them, yet not so complex as to be impossible to solve.  The settings are fantastic - from the vast to claustrophobic.  The game is long - uncommitted gamers may find it tedious - but the scope of design here rewards those who keep up with it.

I ran this game on an XP-equipped P4, with a 64MB AGP card, and had no problems (other than those involving the evil aliens and homicidal fellow humans).  Graphics and sound were smooth, and I suffered no CTD's.",4.0
"Alright already. It's a great game. Good AI, graphics. Runs well. Atmospheric. Great story and dialogue. Comedy. Blah, blah, blah.
Wait a minute. I got a complaint! That movie in the beginning. You can't escape  it. It just goes on and on babbling while you're stuck in a stupid tram  car. Sheesh. What a bore. That kind of nonsense will cost you a star.  Later, I went thru that ride a few times because I grew to like the eerie  understated music. Still, I think I should have been able to skip the intro  movie. Ruined the whole game for me.",4.0
"If you're into First person shooters, this game is a must have.  From an interesting and complex plot to enemy AI that will keep you on your toes throughout the whole game, Half-Life is well thought out and designed and a  lot of fin to play.

"This game is definitely a hundred steps past Quake and others of its type. The AI is great. The evolving story is great. The fight against the Special Forces team is nerve wrackingly great.

"This is my favorite game in the Crash Bandicoot series, but there are some things I really, really hate.

First, the graphics are great. This is one of the better looking games on the PS1 in my opinion, and it has aged fairly well.
The sound is excellent. The music is very enjoyable to listen to, and Crash isn't full of the 'tude that most video game mascots in the 90's had.

The gameplay and controls are really nice, however the jumping and spin hover physics can get a little wonky sometimes.

But what really chaps my ass are the non-platforming levels. This game tries to add some variety by including jetskiing, motorcycling, and flying levels. The control in the motorcycle levels is too tight and its hard to make sharp turns. The flying levels are extremely frustrating because the enemy fighters can drain half of your health in one go, and there are a limited number of health powerups.
Thankfully, these are only about 5 total of each of these levels.

This is one of the best Playstation games ever, and I recommend it to all owners.",4.0

"I am shocked and *very* pleased to report that Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is a DRASTIC improvement over the original Crash Bandicoot.

As you may have heard, I am definitely NOT a fan of the very first Crash Bandicoot game released for the Sony Playstation in 1996.  I am, however, incredibly surprised to find that Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is actually a really fun adventure game that may have been slightly overlooked at the time of its release because of the seemingly never-ending amount of wonderful games released for the Playstation in 1998.

Just so you know, I can't compare Warped to Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back because I haven't played that one.  I can only compare Warped to the original Crash Bandicoot.

Before playing Crash 3, I was almost CERTAIN that Crash Bandicoot was an overrated video game character because my first and only exposure to Crash was the very first game.  I thought for sure Crash Bandicoot was either a Mario or an Earthworm Jim rip-off, and didn't deserve all the attention it got.

For 10 years the original was the only Crash Bandicoot game I knew, and truth be told, it was a pretty average game because every stage featured basically the same uninspiring, repetitive island environment where the object was to run to the end of every stage collecting berries and smashing all the boxes as a way to earn more lives and receive a better overall percentage.

Simply put, Crash's very first outing was BORING.  It desperately needed variety.  Walking through island/jungle stages all the time can only provide so much fun before it inevitably gets boring.  The creators of Crash Bandicoot must have realized how boring this formula was because Warped does just the opposite- Warped features nothing BUT creativity.  In Warped every stage certainly does NOT have the same feel.  You will encounter something drastically different in every stage.  I like that.

The main objective of Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is to find the purple gem found in each of the 25 stages of the game.  You HAVE to find all 25 purple gems otherwise the game won't allow you to fight the boss at the end of the world you're in.  For example, if you're in World 4, and can't find the purple gem in stage 3, you won't be allowed to face the boss at the end of that world.  You're stuck there until you find that darn purple gem.  Once you find the gem, and face and defeat the boss, you move on to the next world and repeat the process of collecting one purple gem per level and face the boss.  By the way, there's 5 worlds total and 5 stages in each world.  That comes to 25 stages total.

The amount of creativity that went into each of the 25 stages is simply incredible.  Unlike the first Crash Bandicoot game where you mainly just spin around through a jungle environment breaking boxes and jumping over cracks in the ground, Warped offers a LOT more in the way of variety.  In Warped you will encounter a few motorcycle racing stages (where you're required to get first place so you can receive the purple gem), a couple underwater stages (with VERY neat-looking backgrounds and deadly, puffy fish swimming about), a couple levels where you're steering an airplane and required to shoot down blimps and other airplanes, and not to mention those tricky, tiger-riding stages.

Oh, and I HAVE to mention the ultra-cool futuristic robot stages (which require near-perfect jumping patterns in order to complete).  The Jet Ski stages are really fun because you're located on top of the ocean and I guarantee you will have the time of your life jumping over ramps while avoiding those floating bombs.  Yup, it's awesome.  This is what makes Crash Bandicoot 3 so great- you won't know WHAT to expect until you enter the level.

Probably the worst thing about Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is the fact that the game offers little in the way of challenge.  That's not to say the game is a cakewalk, either.  People who think Warped is an easy game are only comparing the challenge to the previous two Crash Bandicoot games.  If you compare Warped to say, I don't know, Spyro the Dragon, it's not such an easy game then.  It's definitely not a hard game either.  You WILL beat it.  I think the challange is comparable to Super Mario Bros. 1, the old NES classic.

The one thing I find challenging in Warped is the boss battle in World 3 where you're required to jump over bombs and laser beams heading in your direction.  This is one case where practice doesn't necessarily make perfect.  Also the second airplane stage can be a challenge if you don't bother shooting down the enemy planes.

One thing about Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped that IS incredibly easy is the object of finding those purple gems.  Most of the time you can NOT miss those gems, because you basically walk right into them on your way to reaching the end of the stage.  I mean, they are always RIGHT THERE.  RIGHT in front of you!

After you complete a stage, you can always go back to it and the computer will then give you a new option to complete the level in a certain amount of time.  Finishing the stage in a certain amount of time is actually quite hard.  It means you *really* have to take off running and not stop for a single moment to smash a box or spin-attack an enemy or ANYTHING.  It means you have to run run RUN!  Just so you know, completing the stages under a certain time is NOT a requirement.  It's entirely up to you if you'd like to accept the challenge.  I'm too much of a wimp to accept it, personally.

I like how you can save your game after you complete a stage.  You can actually complete one stage and go to the save room, if you wish.  Very convenient.  Oh, and get this- if during the middle of the game you decide you want to stop playing and shut off the Playstation, when you come back to the game later all the lives you collected up to that point will STILL be there!  I can't think of any other game that will save all the lives you collect.  Speaking of lives, they are *so easy* to find in Warped that you probably can collect up to 45 of them.  That's a lot, and you will probably need them because, even though the challenge ranges from low to medium, your first time through the game won't be THAT simple.

When Crash gets hit or smashed by something, I think it's funny the way he yells ""whoa!""  It reminds me of that comedian Carrot Top.

The reason Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped isn't going to receive a 5-star rating from me is because of the same problem found in Spyro the Dragon- in the flying stages (in this case, the airplane stages) when you hit down on the D-pad the airplane flies UP, and hitting up will make the airplane go DOWN.  The game company made the direction the wrong way!  Oops.  At least when you steer the airplane left, it will go left.  The same with right.  Unfortunately, many game makers have made, and continue to make, the same mistake.  It needs to be corrected once and for all.

I realize having your airplane fly up when you hit ""down"" on the d-pad is an example of realism since that's more or less how REAL airplanes operate, but the thing is, Crash Bandicoot isn't supposed to be about realism since it's just a platform adventure game, and furthermore, it still doesn't change the fact that up and down are reversed.  This adds unncessary frustration and challenge in learning something that definitely feels backwards.

There's a toxic underwater stage in Donkey Kong Country 3 where the controls are reversed as a way to add challenge, and in my mind at least, having the controls reversed when trying to operate the airplane in this game definitely falls under the same category of unnecessary challenge.

I hope you buy this game for your Sony Playstation and experience a fun time.",4.0
"Crash Bandicoot: Warped = Orange, cool, creative, fuzzy, neat, great graphics, awesome design, introduction of secret levels for the series, power-ups, new bosses (including a big boss), and a new playable character.  These things are what make this a major improvement on the two previous games.  Crash 1 was a breakthrough, Crash 2 opened up a new world, and this game completely blows it all away.  This was how I got hooked on Crash Bandicoot.  I played this and loved it.  I recommend it.",4.0
"I should probably review some modern games while I'm here, but I've been kinda GTA'ed out recently, so I decided to put the PS3 away for a minute and bring up some old games from the past to see if they're just as fun as I remember them as.  One of those titles was WCW/nWo Revenge.

Released during WCW's heyday (and roughly a few months before WCW's eventual downfall), the game showcases an astoundingly deep roster for game that came out in the 90s.  A total of 63 WCW/nWo wrestlers were divided up into different factions:  WCW 1 (main-event wrestlers), WCW 2 (mid-card wrestlers), WCW 3 (opening match wrestlers), WCW 4 (Cruiserweight wrestlers), nWo White, nWo Red, and Raven's Flock.  Further, there were roughly a dozen or so other wrestlers listed under the imaginary EWF and DAW leagues included in the game; these wrestlers were modeled after Japanese wrestling stars but had their likenesses changed to avoid copyright issues.

The controls of the match are simple enough for anyone to jump in and learn, but you have to understand the psychology of wrestling (and use the controls accordingly) if you want to go deep into the championship modes of the game.  Players use the B button to strike, A button to initiate a grapple, the d-pad to move, and the joystick to either taunt or execute a special move.  The player can differentiate between a weak strike/grapple and a strong strike/grapple by holding the respective button down until the move is executed.  The more ""worn down"" your opponent is, the better chances you have of successfully hitting them with a strong attack.  Yet if you try to initiate a strong grapple on an opponent who's not worn down, they'll likely reverse the attack and counter with one of their own.  So much like real wrestling, you have to wear your opponent down with the weak attacks until you move up and hit them with the strong ones (and also like wrestling, it's a good idea to generate a response from the audience by letting out a taunt while your opponent's down.)  Once your spirit meter is full, you can strike an opponent with a special move by initiating a strong grapple and then moving the joystick (or alternately using the joystick when on the turnbuckle if the finisher's an aerial maneuver.)  The controls also allow you to run, leave the ring, block/counter an attack, dodge an attack, and set your focus on another opponent if you're involved in a handicap or tag team scenario.

The game has several modes:  Championship, Exhibition, and Special Modes.  The exhibition mode is a singles or tag team match where the player can face either the computer, a friend, or a few friends since the game supports up to 4 players.  The championship modes allow the player to compete for the WCW TV Championship, the WCW Cruiserweight Championship, the WCW Tag Team Championship, the WCW United States Championship, and the grand-daddy of them all, the WCW World Heavyweight Championship (affectionately referred to as the Big Gold Belt.)  While the path to the Television titles and the Cruiserweight titles aren't terribly challenging, you will need to bring your ""A"" game when competing for the higher-tiered titles (or you can dial the difficulty down to Easy, either or.)  The special modes essentially allow the player to engage in specialty handicap or battle royal exhibition matches; with the former allowing for 2-on-1 or 3-on-1 battles while the latter will have 4 competitors fighting each other in the ring until one's eliminated, with the option to allow up to 40 contestants to enter the match.  You're also given a mode where you can customize the given wrestlers to either have different names or to have them wear different costumes.

The upside to the game is that it's still fun to play, even 15 years later.  As I said earlier, anyone can pick up the controllers and jump in, while the subtle nuances of the game don't take much effort to figure out as you go along.  The soundtrack is limited but I don't ever think anyone confused WCW's entrance music with the music that Jim Johnston (of WWE fame) has released over the years (with the only exception being Goldberg's theme.)  The graphics were a work in progress considering where the franchise was at by the time WWF No Mercy was released, but it was still leaps and bounds better than what most expected from the gameplay of other systems at the time (as a reminder, this game was released for a console that is three generations removed from what's available today.)  If there was one drawback from the game, it's the limited gaming options that exist.  Once you beat the championship mode, that was essentially it as far as beating the game was concerned.  There were no steel cage match options, tag teams were limited to 2-on-2 action, and the create-a-wrestler option wouldn't be introduced until THQ/AKI began releasing titles for WWF.  Other gripes I have are that you can't seemingly control whether or not someone interferes on your behalf and the fact that the CPU can ""Hulk up"" their spirit meter rather effortlessly while the player has to do all the little things right to make that possible.

With all that said, however, the game's fun factor makes it a legitimate ""must have"" for wrestling fans and should be considered by N64 fans who are looking for a beat-em-up button-masher where the top prize is the WCW Championship.  I recommend this to N64 gaming fans, wrestling fans, and people who watched wrestling ""when it was cool.""",4.0

Bring back memories of when i was a little kid going over to my firend house and kicking his butt in some wrestling.  Good game not as good as no mercy but you are able to play as some of the great wcw wrestlers,4.0
"I have to say for owning this game and playing it over and over agian, I have to say one of my favorite parts of the game is the wide selection of characters available on the game which range from Hollywood Hogan,Randy Savage,The Stinger,Scott Hall and Kevin Nash to wrestlers like Chris Jericho,Rey Mysterio,Eddie Gurrearo and last but not least the Stiener Brothers. Second, I have to say at the time that this video game came out in the late 90's I think it over ruled the WWF video games. Third, I have to say that my favorite wrestler on the game has to be and will forever be Hollywood Hogan.",4.0
"Pretty good game, especially considering when it was made. One of the first wrestling games to have the grappling system used today. Not on No Mercy's level, but probably the best game WCW put out.",4.0
"Fun game featuring older stars such as Hulk Hogan, Goldberg, Bret Hart, Raven, Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, Randy Savage, Lex Luger, Sting, DDP, among others.

Fantastic gameplay, visuals that are passble by the day's standards and a fun multiplayer mode.",4.0
"The N64 series of games Like No mercy, WCW Revenge and WM XX, were the best wrestling games around AT THE TIME. They were all carbon copies of each other as far as the engine goes, which isn't really a bad thing. This game really has the Golden Years of WCW down as far as Roster goes and they also added Misc. Fake wrestlers such as AKI man. Something that does get on my nerves about the people who review games is when people speak in ""ebonics"" speak such as the reviewer a few reviews ago. I thought a pre-schooler wrote it, da this and da that, its called Phonics! Hooked on Phonics Might work for you!",4.0
"After passing the second and then the first, I was attempted to do this one. The graphics are much better than the previous two, but the story got very boring. The adventures, too, became very uninteresting. Regarding saving and hidden place this one is by far the simplest.
The story here continues from where it ended in the last part, if you have won, that is. As oppose to aku-aku, we see the evil uka-uka who is the Big boss of Dr Cortex. And we see that Crash is forced to fight them! Why? Why, to save the world, of course!
In the previous 2 parts we had gems. Now, this was not enough for the overactive designers. They introduce trophies in this new part. For a trophy, you have to finish a level within an allotted time. This is not that difficult, but you cannot achieve it in every levels. Some levels are extremely difficult to finish fast. I picked all the gems and all but on trophy, and imagine my frustration.
If you are a crash fan you might like this one, but you cannot help being disappointed.",4.0
"I always hated the WCW. I was playing Warzone, Attitude and WWF titles for a long time. Then I somehow ended up owning this game and I inteneded to dissmiss it, but I found myself playing it more and more every day and eventualy loved it. I was happy to hear THQ got the rights to WWF and went from this to Wrestlmania and then the best game on the 64 NO MERCY. However, this is the foundation of where it started and I respect it for that. It brought a lot of awsome memorys and entertainment on hot summer nights. I recomend No Mercy over this, but this original version deserves your respect.",4.0
This game was really good even though I didn't beat all of it.  I love all the Coco levels (favoring the china ones! Pura is SO cute!) This game has alot of freaky mindboggeling levels. I recomend it to any expert PS player.,4.0
"Once again, Crash Bandicoot takes a big step up to greatness! ""Crash Bandicoot 3: WARPED"" was fantastic! It was even better than the second one. Better graphics, story, music, and gameplay. The enemies were fun just like in the first one and the new vehicles available were awesome, like the bi-planes, space fighter, Pura the Tiger, and the jet-ski. Also, it wasn't as difficult to gather the Crystals and Gems as it was in the second part. The environments were better and the new powers that Crash Bandicoot acquires are totally awesome: the Super Belly-Flop, Speed Shoes, Death-Tornado Spin Attack, and the totally awesome Fruit Bazooka! This is definitely one of the best of the games in the Crash Bandicoot Trilogy. You Crash fans MUST get this game!",4.0
"With even more gameplay options than the 2nd, and even better Graphics-Crash Bandicoot 3:Warped reinvented the whole Crash series with a totally different look and feel.  Gone is the native island undertones, the sounding drums and beats, the native temples of the past. Instead Crash 3 pushes for a much more different aproach. A world of collected different time zones-the medival era, aincent Egypt, the stone age. Crash 3 takes on a whole new look of it's own, making it more than a perfuctionary sequel, while Crash 2 remade the orignal, at the same time bringing more innovative gameplay, Crash 3 strides to be a game that can seen as a game that stands on it's own. Mounted with even larger proportions of gameplay and bigger levels, Crash 3 trys too hard to be at the top of it's peak, and yet to an extent it succeeds--that is the games main weakness. While the devlopers at Naughty Dog* stressed with creating more advanced gameplay, at the same time one can say they kind of fell behind and forgot about the whole story aspect-for this is even less story driven than it's predeccors. Like I said the  attention is more on gameplay-not a bad thing, but the only problem this time around the makers are working with a totally differnt enviorment than before. With Crash 2 the makers had the distinct advantage of going back and making everything better, while at the same time coming up with new enviroments as well. Not only that , Crash 3 lacks some of the depth in it's levels that made the levels in Crash 2 so darn fun to keep going back again and again. The levels in Crash 3 are lacking in that respect. Like I hhave mentioned in past reviews (for the other 2 games) Crash 3 in the lightest in tone-not problem with that...it just might bother people who are familar or die-hard gamers of the first 2.(I can say it bothered me abit, but thats e of course, I'm really picky) Anyways Crash depsite some minor draw-backs, is still one of the very best platformers ever made--in fact on it's time of release-it was  called the very best Playstation had to offer. Everybody is entitled to their own opinions, thats why I  can say I prefer the 2nd game.

"I love the original version of this game! The graphics are lame (I admit it), but it was something I enjoyed playing more than 8 years ago. Unfortunately, I purchased this from a seller here on amazon and received the wrong item. I still don't have a copy, but would love to have one.

My friend and I made a game out of running over people and seeing how long it would take for the police to kill us (I know, not a nice thing to do, but it was funny when I was 13). If you're used to playing the 3-D version, you would hate this.",4.0
"and you just became part of it.
Pros:
Brought violence and profanity in videogames to a whole new level
Very good sound effects
long enjoyable levels and misions
A short, but destructable arsenoal
Very useful cheat codes(Despit I usally don't cheat)
Pretty good music
Cons:
The graphics are plain out horrible
one shot death(A bit too realistic)well, unless you have armor
Can't save until you beat a level
definitly not for kids
The game suffers from slowdowns, if too many things are on the screen
In 98 this game was jst a instant classic, despite being overshadowed by loads of games(especially Metal Gear Solid, and Zelda:Ocorina of time).  It's definitly unknown since GTA 3 and Vice City overshadowed it by a loooong mile, but yet I still play this game from time to time.  In this game you could even say ... the police and let them eat the gat, take out a squad of them with a machine gun, blaze them up with a flame thrower, or just blow them away with almighty rocket launcher(That was propably the main reason this game got a lot of heat form contaversy).  If you're used to GTA 3 or Vice City, then this game will hardly be interesting to you, but if you have this game, then I'm sure you appreciate the joy the classic burng to you, and took you on the crazy ride from this, all the way to vice city.
Final Words:Speaking of Vice City, That was one of the levels in this game, and so was liberty City, and San Anderess is the last city.  Could San Andress be the next Grand Theft Auto?  Hmmmm...
peace",4.0
"The original Grand Theft Auto was a classic for the PC, but it's gleefully unabashed violence, simple graphics, dark humor, and addictive gameplay garnered the game much appeal and controversy.  Eventually Take 2 Interactive (now they're called Rockstar) published GTA on as many systems as it could: the PS1, Dreamcast, and even the Game Boy Color.  These days anyone and everyone are GTA nuts, but only when it comes to GTA 3 or Vice City.  The original GTA may seem simple enough, but it is undeniably fun for the most part, no matter how simplistic the graphics seem.  The missions can get rather tedious, and the fact you can't save your progress in game (a problem which would be corrected in GTA 3), and eventually you'll lose interest, but for the most part the original GTA is still loads of fun.  Those who have only played GTA 3 or Vice City will not like this original installment, but it's a great ride while it lasts.",4.0

The game came in good shape not great but good. Still satisfied with my purchase though. Does work great just not a collector's choice. Not worth sending back  for the flaws it has but am only going to rate it 4 stars. It said like new condition but was not quite like that when received. Was packaged well but did not say fragile handle with care on it like others I have ordered. Still one of the best games of all times though.,4.0
"This game is excellent, with a few exceptions. The first exception is the fact that despite the fact that there are 15 regular missions, not one of them is set in space. Every mission is set within the confines of a planet, be it in the upper atmosphere or skimming the surface. This isn't a crippling disadvantage, except some people like fighting in space. Ideally, this game would have both space and surface fighting. Another bad point is the lack of diversity in opponents. There are basically 6 enemies you'll run into - TIE Bombers, Fighters, Interceptors, Stormtroopers, Missile and Laser turrets. Thats basically it for opponents. Not that that is bad at all, it just gets boring after a while. Other then this, this game is excellent in all respects. A definate must have for any hardcore Star Wars fan.",4.0
"The X-wings have a slight lag in the control. When the speeders turn its not quite as sharp as the real speeder and much is slower.  If you don't know me, read the book X-wing wraith Squadron.  Wish me luck in marrying Tyria!",4.0
"Rogue Squadron is a fun, addictive, pretty game.  Unfortunately, it's not perfect.
This game offers beautiful graphics, fairly interesting music, a range of different craft, with different views, functions and special  abilities for them.  It has clearly defined goals in each mission, although  often the backstory of the mission itself was somewhat silly.  And it has  sixteen levels, each on different and unique worlds.
With so much going  for it, why doesn't RS3D qualify as a ""great"" game?  My biggest  complaint is mission difficulty.  There is no difficulty selector, and the  levels are not paced very well.  For example, the entire first chapter is  extraordinarly easy, each level being completed withing five to ten  minutes.  Afterwards, some of the levels are equally easy, and then there  are those that are impossibly, frustratingly difficult.  My other chief  complaint is technical -- this game takes place before Empire Strikes Back,  which is when the tow cable method of tripping AT-ATs was concieved.  So  why is it being done left and right here?  Just on a minor note, the  dialogue and voice acting was also pretty bad.
Another area that's not  really bad or good, but just a note -- there are no cinematics here.  Before and during every Star Wars game, I have always enjoyed the  high-quality videos.  None of that here.  Instead you just get some  game-engine pictures of the starfighters flying around and hear the pilot's  voices.  Just, in the beginning for example, seeing Luke and Wedge talking  about establishing Rogue Squadron, laying some background for the game,  would've been nice.
Don't be expecting X-wing.  A flight sim it ain't.  But if you want a fun, good-looking, fast moving little game, then I  definately recommend this one.",4.0
"""Rogue"" is kind of the bastard love child of ""X-Wing Alliance"" and ""Grim Fandango"".
Like ""Alliance"" there are a series of missions to perform, a rich audio environment, and  the fun of flying.
But ""Fandango""'s sumptuous graphics and  building storyline are here too.  Far from the simplistic, spacy sameness  that plagues ""Alliance""'s missions, each new level here is an  entirely different, planetary environment.  So rich are the graphics that  you're bound to spend some time in each level just gazing at the  surroundings. When you finally dig into the hard work of your mission,  veteran game players may find parts of the levels somewhat easy, but there  are always one or two trouble spots that elude even the greatest of space  pilots for a while.
Most importantly, like ""Alliance""--which  has entirely more missions than it should--""Rogue"" knows when the  party's over.
This is, in short, an adventure gamer's flight simulator.  It keeps you going by having a story unfold while entertaining with exotic  locales.  No, you can't share these locales with friends over a network.  But you can feel as though you are actually part of a Star Wars movie.  And  that, it seems to me, is the precise point of a Star Wars game.",4.0

"Surprisingly I never got a chance to play the original on the computer, but the N64 version seems to portray the insanity well. As I understand it the weapons, enemies and level textures are the same, but the actual level designs are N64-exclusive, which is a neat touch. Much like the first Quake it's not a thinking man's shooter like Perfect Dark or GoldenEye, but there are some surprising elements such as the enemies that take potshots at you in their death throes. And while there's no online component, it offers a commendable split-screen experience.

The N64 did well with shooters, and Quake II is a solid addition to the library. My only real gripe is with the series itself; from this point on we lost the moody Gothic feel of the original for something much more sci-fi. Still, that may not matter when the enemies come tearing into you.",4.0
