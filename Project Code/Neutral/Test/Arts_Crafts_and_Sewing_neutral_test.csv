Just ok. Read better knit books.,2.0
"Beware -- Dover Little Activity Books are just that ----LITTLE. They are only about 5-3/4"" x 4-1/4"". This makes it difficult to keep the book open to the page that the child is working on. I bought some of these at the same time as other books that looked the same size online. The other books were normal in size and great. These are not.",2.0
I didn't like this item too much due to the material of the paper. It seemed much more a normal paper than the ones to the origami craft.,2.0
"It is fine - the sheets are tiny, but the description says that. I was expecting more from it, but it will work for my purposes.",2.0
Not easy to follow.  Not enough patterns and not very interesting to put together. I was expecting something better and more exciting.,2.0
"If not for the fact that I really needed this book and could salvage the pages that I needed, I would have returned it immediately! The Table of Contents are a complete loss because this book either survived a flood or the handler neglected to tell me that the pages were going to be stuck together so I could not salvage it... WTF were they thinking sending the book out like that?
The book in itself is a fantastic find and I plan on recouping my loss brand new when I can afford it, but for now reading it in its present state is all I can afford.",2.0
"The beads themselves are attractive enough, slightly smaller than marbles, but they're strung on a very thin rubber band that feels as though it's about to snap under the slightest stress. Think of this as a pack of colored skull beads, not a bracelet.",2.0
"In the picture, you can tell that is wood with the textures and colors. The one sent is plastic. Cute, but absolutely not what is pictured.",2.0
Really small.,2.0
way to small and very to get them off the sheet. Would never order these again,2.0
"I thought it was going to be the best thing out there, but there isn't much at all in the way of personalizing the book. The last quarter of the book is all space for specifically labeled holiday photos. Several in which most do not actually celebrate. I have since purchased a different book.",2.0
"the pages in the book are shiny and too hard to write on - takes too long for the ink to dry.  Also, should have more areas where one could write more comments on the dog's ""happenings"" and not be categorized.",2.0
"I have seen TONS of cute quilts on line made from  the different blocks from this book.  I was really impressed at all of the different quilts people came up. I couldn't wait to get this book and make some of the things I'd seen.  I particularly liked the cow, turkey, pig, corn, peas & carrots, tractor,  trailer to go behind the tractor, cake on the cake stand, barn with silo, strawberry, and the farm girl. Turns out the only blocks of all of these that are actually in the book are the strawberry, tractor, and barn with silo.  The cake on the cake stand and the trailer are on line for free, all of the others I listed are available on line for additional purchase for $6 each. There are many more available for purchase, probably all of the cute ones you've seen in the different projects that made you want to buy this book.

It is a nice book, spiral bound, great pictures, with really cute patterns it was just disappointing to me that I paid for the book and then was going to have to spend more than what I paid for the book getting the patterns I thought would be included.  It's a nice book with very cute patterns, just know what you're getting when you order it.",2.0
"I've never been so excited to get a book before. Seriously bummed after I had picked out (instagram and pintrest) 5 of her farm girl  squares to start on as soon as I got the book. Even drove an hour to joanns. None of them I was wanting are included. The cow, the corn and tomatoes, cherry pie, sewing machine, etc aren't in here. Still a lot of stuff I'm anxious to try. But definitely bummed I have to spend $5 for each square that I thought was in the book!",2.0
"Measurements were off.  I've made 4 of the 12"" squares, and 3 of the squares had the measurements listed incorrectly.  I ended up having to add 1/4"" - 1/2"" on several block pieces.  The runners were just for my own use, so I wasn't too worried about the additional seams, but I was a little disappointed.",2.0
Cute book but doesn't have a pocket for Preschool and Pre K. They need to think about the kids doing TK as well.,2.0
"Disappointed in product.  When using my home HP printer, the ink smeared to the touch-ruining the quilt pattern to be papered pieced. Had to wait a while for ink to dry.",2.0
Not what I thought it was but its ok,2.0
Not as heavy as I expected.,2.0
"I was excited when I first got this as a gift.  I like the 4 in 1 tool option, but the cap comes off all the time on the stiletto side. I have accidentally poked my fingers a few times when the cap came off in my sewing bag. Good concept, but bad delivery.",2.0
"Good concept , poorly made. I did use a small piece of masking tape to tends where tools attach and that helped.
This was a present and I love the design not the quality. The seam ripper broke, it just pulls out but no one sells just that piece that I found. I can still use the stiletto and now that the end covers will stay because of tape I can use the the presser and turning pieces. I will still use what I have.  I will use another seam ripper though.",2.0
"The ripper broke the 3rd time I used it and although the company promptly replaced it, the ripper on the replacement one broke as well.  The other parts work fine, but I prefer the Clover ripper for its ergonomic hand grip.",2.0
The stiletto tip pulled out after only a couple of uses. This is not up to Alex Anderson's standards. I've had to throw it away and got a brass one instead. Sad as I love Alex but this was just not 'her'. Very disappointed in this :(,2.0
Like the idea but the wooden tips keep falling off.,2.0
"I ordered this tool after receiving one as a Christmas gift and liking it.  This one was broken when it arrived (the tip of the seam ripper had broken off and the cap wouldn't stay on).  No problem returning it to Amazon of course.  A day later, the one I had received as a gift also broke.  Great idea but poorly made.",2.0
"I bought this because it was a 4-1.  I thought I loved it and it worked very well, however, I dropped it and the pointy end broke off of the seam ripper end.  I was pretty upset because it was so expensive. I guess it was a decent deal for the 4-1, but now I have to buy another seam ripper and I'm not purchasing another one of these.",2.0
"Lace Collections-Beautiful patterns but I had no idea I was buying a very very used book. At least when I got it it was all bent up and had a tear in the spine, and was bent very bad on the back, after what I spent I was a tad disappointed, to say the least :( . It was shipped in a very thin plastic sack that offered no protection via mailing so maybe shipping packaging should be better, but the large bend or dog eared back cover couldn't of come by poor mail handling.",2.0
Very nice,2.0
These don't stick very well,2.0
I bought these thinking they were the size of old luggage labels to put on an old suitcase. They are mostly small stickers that are more suited for scrapbooking.,2.0
"Pattern Design is attractive, but paper quality is no better than the generic file folders in Office Supply Stores. Quality/pattern doesn't warrant price. I'm disappointed in product.",2.0
"These are a bit, um, avant garde for my taste.",2.0
"There were no patterns included, just a bunch of photographs.  I am a v good sewer, but i do like a little more to go on than a photo.",2.0
This book isn't what I thought it would be. The patterns are just plain ugly. The colors they chose for their pictures are hideous.,2.0
I just wanted the buyer to know that they listed the item as NEW but on one of the pages there is a stain and it a fungus stain. My only issue would be the price as it was listed as new and in a plastic wrap they provided but the book had a moisture fungus stain. If I had known I would not have bought it for that price. For a discount used price it would be worth it.,2.0
"I ordered this book sight unseen because the concept sounded so great. It's a disappointment. Although the book is nicely designed and some of the stitch patterns are clever, the garments that incorporate them are contrived, unflattering, and impractical. (I live in a cold climate and have a fairly traditional perspective on knitting: I expect sweaters to keep a person warm rather than to expose an anorexic model's vestigial cleavage or her navel, and I don't like bits of my tank top trailing to either side, unless the idea is to imitate the ears of a Basset hound.)

And what's with the models: are they space aliens? are they pithed? or did the photographer have a thing about pale blue contact lenses?

I might keep this book around to adapt stitch patterns for other uses, but no way will I ever knit one of these garments. Disclaimer: I've never seen a Norah Gaughan pattern in a magazine that I would want to knit, either, so perhaps I should have been warned. YMMV.

For interesting interpretations of geometric and organic forms, I'd recommend instead the work of Pat Ashforth and Steve Plummer, and June Oshiro's great DNA scarf.",2.0
"This would be a good book for a beginning shawl-knitter.  Most all of them are triangular shawls, the only difference is the border.  I found it boring and not worth the money.  I'm sorry I bought it.",2.0
"The book is ""deceptively"" not easy. I'm an experienced quilter and was very disappointed with this book.  I will go through it again.",2.0
"This tool doesn't really do more than a color wheel would do. After choosing a color card, you flip over and it shows you the correct color group for monochromatic, complementary, split comp. and triadic colors but nothing more.
The color samples shown on each color card are about 3/16"" wide x 3/8"" long. along with a color coding system for the Pantone scale, i think.
Joen Wolfram's book on color is very good but I don't think this Color Tool is worth the money or the bother of carrying it.

I must add that I have background in interior design and I am a quilter. For someone who has trouble remembering how the color wheel works this item may be of value, but you could carry a small inexpensive, color wheel with you if you needed it.",2.0
"I recently took a class from Joen Wolfrom and found that my tool had issues with some of the colors being off.  It was so bad that my tool is useless.  I was told in the class that the printing of the tool was being worked on.  I have recently seen the tool elsewhere and it seemed to have better printing.  I believe that a new printing in June will correct the issues.  BTW, ALL of these versions are the 3rd version.  I have yet to tell how to differentiate from one printing to another.  Once the colors are corrected, the tool should be extremely useful!!",2.0
"While some of the shawls in this book are beautiful, they are often too complicated and time consuming. I found the directions to be obscure and often hard to follow.",2.0
"Okay, so I didn't read the actual blurb, but I wanted a book about ART journals, not about making journals.  But, if you are looking for good ideas for cute journals ... this is it.  Lovely art work and clear instructions.",2.0
I don't understand how to use it,2.0
"Might be okay for markers or drawing, but is too thirsty for watercolor. Every color I tried dried with a hard edge.",2.0
"Arrived damaged!! One corner was super crinkled, 90% of those pages will have to be straightened somehow.",2.0
"Although fairly inexpensive, I found this paper's surface difficult to work on.",2.0
This watercolor paper is described as 140# acid free.  I had to return this paper as its texture is too smooth for cold press.  Watercolors would not merge effectively.  It would be good for detail.,2.0
"Needed to sharpen over half of these out of the box, so poor quality control. A super sharp sharpener is required to keep them from breaking, they are triangle shape which feels funny to me but they won't roll off the table. The colors aren't labeled on each pencil which can be confusing. They're kind of hard and don't really blend that well. I wouldn't recommend these for more than a 3rd grader and for the money there are better brands of school grade pencils. Blick has a better 24 pack for about $4.",2.0
I didn't think of this at the time but you also have to buy a triangle sharpener,2.0
"These pencils, although having a nice range of colors and the color layering and blending nicely, do have a downside as far as I'm concerned. It is the triangular shape, which makes the pencils feel smaller when gripped in my fingers, and after a few minutes of coloring, I had to stretch my fingers to keep them from cramping.
I have pretty much solved that problem by purchasing some gel pencil grips to slide on the pencils and it makes them easier to hold. I have not ever had a need to use the grips on any other pencils and I often color for many hours at a stretch.
If the pencils had been made somewhat larger and with a textured finish on the barrel to offset the triangular shape, I feel it would have helped immensely with the grip problem I have experienced.",2.0
"No true colors. No red at all! Only rust and dark orange. What's up with that?? Also, they don't color brightly, you have to push too hardHey",2.0
I don't know if it was bad packaging or what but when I got them most were broken. The led inside was just bad so when i sharpened the pencil the tip keept comming off.,2.0
Thin pages. Writing is seen and felt on the back of the page. Little room for listing ingredients and process. Beautiful design that Im sure is great for shorter recipes.,2.0
"I did not like it. I really like Moleskine Products but I do not like their lack of description on some of their products. This one is a recipe book. It starts off with a table of contents, and food calendar, food facts and measurements. Then there is the recipe section as shown in the picture 1 recipe per page and they contain the ingredients, precess, difficulty, time and people it serves, rating, wine pairings. The recipes are separated with tabs and they are already titeled in this order: appetizers, first courses, main dishes, side dishes, desserts, and cocktails. After this there another set of divided pages with blank tabs this time; however, the pages are not completely blank there are 5 horizontal lines going across the pages. I did not like these horizontal lines on the tabbed pages, for me this ruined it because it leaves little to use the pages for. I thought of using them for extra recipes but the horizontal lines ruin it. Finally there are a few blank pages in the end that are not tabbed and completely blank, and it ends with an index to for your use.",2.0
The pages are very thin and it's not very customizable. I wish I could get this cover with blank pages!,2.0
"Unlike the previous 10 or so Moleskine's I've purchased from Amazon, all three Folio A4 Squared books I've received have been severely dented and missing their quality control number!

I sent the second book back to Amazon and the replacement came today, this one is dented worse than the one I returned!

Curiously, I notice that each of the A4 Squared Folio books is missing it's quality control number.  The sticker is there but instead of a quality control number it's just blank.  This has been true for each of the 3 squared notebooks, each of which has arrived with large dents that permeate every single page in the book.  The lack of a quality control number prevents Moleskine from replacing your item for you (a service they provide on their website).

Very disappointed",2.0
I got this for my 25 year old son and it works great.  Looks just like a book.  I would give it 4 stars!,2.0
I cannot read the inside print. It wasn't at all what I was expecting and I don't find it user friendly or functional at all.,2.0
"The journal is great. It's got a lot of good functions, but I ended up feeling that I could not meet the journals expectations, and it was disappointed in me. I think this works better for those who have decided to turn their life around, or work out a lot.",2.0
"Without capsulation, just like a used one.",2.0
"If you have a lot of time, this journal would maybe work.  However, it is sectioned so that to make a complete daily entry, you have to go to about 6 different pages.  It's divided up into categories, such as diet, fitness, etc.  You have to go to each section to make a daily entry.  It's not organized by date.  I haven't started using it because I don't have the time to make one daily entry.",2.0
"The main problem with this journal has already been expressed repeatedly: the division of pages is uneven, especially with regard to the diet section which only covers 29 days. Additionally, there's no place to track weight, measurements, or BMI over time. I would think a place for these would be the starting point of a wellness journal. Additionally, I'd prefer a day by day approach, tracking my diet, exercise, and progress in a linear fashion rather than having to switch from section to section to record different elements of my progress. One bright spot is that Moleskine seems to have recognized this shortcoming and compensated by adding three bookmarks and tabs for sections.
I love my Moleskine notebooks, lined, blank, and cahier, but though the materials and construction of this journal are excellent, the organization of content renders it almost useless.",2.0
"Don't get me wrong, this is a beautifully constructed journal that lives up to the Moleskine name. The problem is that less than half the pages in the book are the recipe pages you see in all the pictures. Most of the book has pages that are just divided into 5 sections by horizontal lines. All of the blank tabbed sections look like that. I have no idea what they expect people to do with these pages. They're useless. I understand the addition of a few blank pages in the back, and the reference charts and guides in the front are wonderful, but I really wanted most of the pages to have the nice layout designed for writing recipes. It is, after all, a recipe journal!",2.0
"This is not bad, but I think it is somehow misplaced.  I use moleskines for a LOT of things, but it seems that keeping a log of wine, or cigars, or a cheese journal just makes more sense.

Maybe it's the way the book is laid out or something.  I keep a lot of notes scattered around in moleskine cahiers, but for some reason I just don't refer back to the Recipe Journal often enough.  It's almost TOO lock-step.

In any case, it might just take a more organized person to really appreciate the strengths of the recipe journal.  I just couldn't seem to 'get into it'.

Sorry Moleskine, I LOVE your other stuff!",2.0
"I love moleskines' look and feel, and was excited to get this since I love to cook (I usually buy the drawing and watercolour pads).

This recipe journal is true to the moleskine esthetic, has cute lil stickers to decorate the recipes and the margins have useful sections such as cooking time, amount of servings, etc.

The problem is that the space given to write the recipe is tiny. I usually need to use two pages, which wouldn't be an issue if a third of the journal wasn't wasted on empty, sectionned pages. So I doubt I'll be able to write a lot in this.

Too bad, cause the concept is great.",2.0
"I love moleskine products and when I saw this journal I had to have it because I loved the design.  From the outside it looks like a typical moleskine journal except that it had the kitchen themed impressions on the front cover.  I really like that it not only has the areas designated especially for recipes, but a lot of blank pages to fill in with whatever you like.  The quality of the journal is of the same high standard of other moleskine products.

To be completely honest, the only thing I did not like about this journal was the size.  And yes, from a practical standpoint, that was enough to give it only a 2 star rating.  There is not enough room to record recipes. Cooking is a huge passion of mine and one of my favorite hobbies.  I have a ton of cookbooks and am always reading recipes online and often I create my own recipes.  I thought this journal would be a good way to help me get my recipes organized, but with this journal it's a lot of trouble.  The layout is great.  I love how everything looks on the page, but it's way too small and there is not enough room to write down anything except a really short, simple recipe.  My handwriting is small to begin with, so I didn't think I would have an issue with this journal, but even so, I have to cram when writing my recipes down.  For recipes that were a little more complex there was not enough room to write down all the ingredients without cramming.  This journal would be amazing if it was larger with similar proportions.  For instance, if it were a 8""x10"", I wouldn't have any complaints, but when you actually think about having to use a recipe journal where the words are crammed together and written extremely small by hand when you're already trying to cook and keeping busy in the kitchen, it's just way too much trouble.

Because I've already got the thing and don't want to throw it away I've decided I will use it to organize only really short, basic recipes that don't require a lot of writing.  I'm still on the lookout for a good way to keep track of my recipes, so if anyone has any suggestions please let me know by commenting on this review.",2.0
"Synopsis: This would be a great address book if I did not plan on using it every day and keeping it in my pocket.

Good: I'll start with what is good: The open layout without fields is great as you can choose what to do with the space. It looks very nice before use. The letters are unobtrusive and are spaced well enough to give you ample space for names however you order them. This is where I the good stuff ends.

Bad: I've been carrying this address book around for less than half a year and I have already had to mend it myself and it finely broke along the binding today. I could see using this if you only kept it in your purse or a drawer but I need a phone book that can go in and out of my pocket and doesn't fall to pieces. I got this current phonebook after getting a replacement for one that was fraying at the corners after only a week of use. After this one came it did the same thing and I was too agitated to request yet another one. I mended it with super glue and continued to carry it. It finally tore along the binding today.

Verdict: If you do not plan on carrying this on your person it would be a great buy. It is stylish and has one of the best layouts I've seen for a  address/phone book. If you plan on using it daily, you will be disappointed. It will break down quickly.",2.0
"Doesn't take paint that well, doesn't take non water-based markers or inks. Very toothy. In short, I was hoping to be able to use prisma, copic and chartpak markers in this. You can't. They bleed. It will kind of take gouache or watercolor, but the paper is going to get wildly warped. The paper is also very toothy, so it's not great for drawing either.

I loved the idea of a square format because of how much art I post on Instagram but I haven't used it very much and instead prefer my Moleskin over this product. It's a pass.",2.0
"These beads arrived in a timely manner; however I was disappointed in the quality.  The crystals did not sparkle in the least, in fact they looked more like flat black plastic.  I returned them for a refund.",2.0
Thanks,2.0
Some of the stones were missing when I received them,2.0
Picture shows a mixture of blues and greens but the yarn was a more solid 1 color of blue-green.,2.0
I was disappointed in Don't Let Me Cross Over. The song Isn't exactly like the original. This is all I know how to explain it.,2.0
Not worth the money.  I found a better kit at Michaels.,2.0
"Took a very long time to get hard enough that I could leave any impressions, even then, you can't even tell it's a dog print in it.",2.0
Just ok. Could go to local pottery store and probably get something better. Wasn't happy with the end result.,2.0
Mine just came without the stones or cookie cutter. I hope it at least works as well as it's supposed to.,2.0
Pretty much sucks. I used gildan heavy cotton shirta. They printed fine but we had to let it sit for like 20 mins longer. Couldnt get a start point to peel the back off. Also they edges shearded durning peeling glad i didn't have a full picture.,2.0
"very easy to use but one wash and its gone, if you are using it for a one day event great, if not don't waste your money",2.0
Didn't work for me.  Followed the instructions word for word.,2.0
"The decal paper is readily printable, but I have never been able to get them to transfer to any kind of cloth.
For me, it was a waste of money.",2.0
My shirt mess up after it was wash,2.0
"2 stars for me personally. I couldn't find any useful explanations regarding this product. I specifically needed to transfer a white outline to a dark red sweatshirt and noticed these were the only transfers that printed transparent where you didn't have any image. I figured that would work fine. The truth is that the entire image is completely transparent so when you print them on any shirt other than a white one, they mix with that color. For example, if printing a green box on a yellow shirt it would come out blue. Nobody explained this and it was my first time using this type of product. I ended up going to Michaels and buying transfers for dark fabric and photoshopping my image by matching the negative space with the dark red garment. It didn't come out too good.",2.0
The transfers did not work,2.0
Not at all pleased with this product.  The transfers did not work on the project I intended.  Uncertain if this was just a bad batch as HP products are usually top-notch and I have worked with them several times in the past.  I followed the instructions to the letter and the transfers never adhered to the material.,2.0
"I got these to make t-shirts for an event.  It's a good thing a friend had backup, because, even after following directions, mine didn't work.  I printed and gave one to another friend and his t-shirt came out very ""so-so.""",2.0
"I've done this a number of times... making ""Big Brother"" or ""Baby"" t-shirts.  When using the HP paper, the white transfer backing stands out substantially against the white of the t-shirt.  The end effect is that of a 1970's ""patch"".

I had better luck when the paper had to be ""reversed"" and then transferred onto the t-shirt.",2.0
"My 8 yr old son got this from his grandfather for Christmas. I was eager to help him with this, as I had a similar woodburning kit when I was his age.  From what I recall about my set, it would actually ""burn"" the wood.  This one doesn't get hot enough to use effectively.  My son traced 3 letters in his name and got bored with it because he had to move the iron so slowly with lame results.

It seems to me that, over the years, they regulated the fun out of this toy. :(",2.0
"I was expecting a better quality product. A woodburning pen produces a very soft/light impression on the wood, which could be barely seen. Plus, one of the cutout pieces was missing from the box.
I've had a similar kit when I was a child, which was much more fun to use and easier to operate.",2.0
"Wood burning tool is essentially a soldering iron.  It is very cumbersome to hold and control.  I had purchased this a gift for my daughter, and after one use, it hasn't been touched again!",2.0
"This is a cute table, but it's so light that it slides around all over the place. My 2-year-old son likes eating snacks at the table, but when he leans against it, it slides away and he stumbles. Same thing with the chairs. It's just not really practical to have this table slipping and sliding all over the kitchen. I'll be looking for something more sturdy that actually stays in place!",2.0
A little too bulky and difficult for little ones to move the chairs.,2.0
"Like some of the other reviewers mentioned, my toddler could easily flip the table and chairs. The set also does not stay still on wood floors.",2.0
"Really not what I expected. I got this for my two year old. The chairs don't have much support to them so he's mostly falling off or tipping over on them. The table is only big enough for one toddler with a coloring book. Table and chairs are both light enough for toddlers to turn upside down,side ways, etc. Thought it would be more sturdy considering the price.",2.0
Didn't work very well.,2.0
"Actually not worth bothering with.  It's ok if your child is interested in this type of thing but my granddaughter just wasn't into it.  The company I purchased it from was Great.  The box was destroyed when I received it but they were so good about replacing it at no charge.  I would buy from them again, just not this type of toy.",2.0
"I have been using PC biscuits for several years and have gone through many batches of them.  One thing I have noticed is that the number of defective biscuits per container has risen markedly as I purchase newer batches of them.  The current batch I have been using has shown about 30% of the biscuits to be defective (by defective, I mean that the biscuit compression is inconsistent, and that many of the biscuits are too wide for the slots cut by plate joiner.)
I store all biscuits in double sealed, airtight containers in a bone dry basement, and am religious about protecting the things.
I simply may have gotten a number of bad batches of biscuits from the several supppliers from which I have purchased them, but I continue to find that a large portion of the units are unusable.  While those which do fit in the slots function fine, I'll probably end up buying a batch of the Swiss ""L"" brand biscuits next.  Though they cost twice as much, they are reputed to be extremely consistent, and the cost of the PC throwaway biscuits makes the cost per usable unit of the L brand biscuits extremely competitive.
Be aware, you may have to pick through your batch of biscuits just as you have to pick through stacks of lumber at the local yard.",2.0
I have a Dewalt joiner and I think these biscuits are too loose. Some are tighter and some looser.... not consistent from one to the other... at least not the 20s have not tried all of the different sizes.,2.0
"I have average to long fingers for a woman and I could barely grip this monster, much less control it.  This is for BIG Men doing BIG projects! While the nozzles might be small, the gun itself is too big for detailed work.",2.0
I was not happy because I expected to be hotter than the glue I already. Because of the temp control,2.0
"I wanted to use this for varnish  and for sealer for my slate floors. Tried on slate, streaking. It does not absorb to hold the sealer so you have to keep dipping. The result was terrible. I had to redo with a mop applicator pad.
 I had the nerve to buy 24. What a waste. I guess I will try on paint and see how it goes.",2.0
"I only bought this to try and get paint out of some jeans and socks...I followed the directions on the package but it didn't work at all. Not even a little difference. Oh well. I'm sure it works for cleaning brushes, but once paint dries on jeans you need something a lot stronger than this stuff to get it off!",2.0
"I do not recommend this awl.  There are better ones out there. I had an older stanley that was great until I lost it on a job.  The ""steel"" is weak and I doubt it will last. Point was not machined properly at the tip...I had to grind it a little to form a point.",2.0
"This looks like your grandpa's awl, so it has to be good, right? Wrong. Sure, it has a wood handle and a nice feel, but right where it counts - the point at the end of the steel shaft - the softness of the steel become apparent. I've had mine for years but I've had to literally re-straighten out the point using pliers. It re-bends easy enough and gets sort-of true, but every time I use this thing I think why didn't I just by a better one? A construction nail is harder than this.",2.0
"The point of the awl is what I'd expect - like any sharp tool, it needs occasional sharpening, and I have a more narrowly tapered awl for other purposes. There's something to be said for the tang of the awl going all the way through the handle. You see the same piece of steel at the top of the handle as at the working tip. If you drive the awl with a hammer, that might be just what you want.

But not what I want. I usually push the awl with the rounded top of the handle in the palm of my hand. So, when the wooden handle slides down the tang of the awl towards the tip, it pushes the back end of the steel rod uncomfortably into the palm of my hand. I haven't had problems with the ferrule coming loose, unlike some other reviewers. I kinda wish I did - that's easy to fix, unlike the loose handle.

If, like me, you usually push your awl by hand, you might prefer one where the tang goes only partway into the handle, not all the way through.

"The day I bought this the metal sheath fell off the wood handle - still works, and I guess I get what I paid for, but sheesh..",2.0
"This awl has the dumb secondary bevel on the tip (you can see the extra pointy bit on front) that makes it impossible to make gently tapered holes with this awl.

For that reason, I do not like this awl. It is a bad awl.

The secondary bevel provides you with 1/8"" of usable tip before you plow this english bulldog straight throw your project on accident.

Skip this awl, there are better ones at similar price points.",2.0
not the greatest quality but ok for what I paid.,2.0
"On the day I purchased this and as of this writing 9/9/16, the product image clearly has USA stamped in the handle, leading any reasonable person to assume that USA is the country of origin. Do not be fooled, this tool was made in China.

Now I hardly expect a tool like this to me manufactured anywhere but China these days, and I fully expected as such when I went looking for one. And then I was pleasantly surprised to come across this cheap tool that perfectly serves the purpose I purchased it for and it's proud display of USA on the handle. Of course that is the one I'll choose! But it was not meant to be.

Don't get me wrong, it's a perfectly fine awl for under $5, but it was not made in the USA. I expect Amazon will change the picture out soon, but until then don't be fooled.",2.0
"This tool was a disappointment.  I have an older Stanley awl from approximately 25 years ago and it's been a great tool!  Full tang shank, ferrule screwed into high quality wood handle.  This new version of the awl is little more than a headless nail stuck partway into a handle.  The ferrule is glued on - not very well.

I don't know when Stanley outsourced the production of this tool to China, but the quality of the current tool is very poor.  Amazon needs to restrict the activities of paid reviewers who give this a 5 star rating with a few superlatives thrown in the description.  If you're looking for a cheap (disposable) Chinese Awl, check out Harbor Freight - even their quality is better than this thing.",2.0
"Arrived with a deformed tip -- sort of a hook with a bump in it.  Rather than return it I honed a new tip.  Still, this suggests that Stanley's quality control is lacking.  Probably, most of them are ok.",2.0
"Not very good quality.  I keep mine in a rack and treat my tools well.  With occasional light use, the collar has separated due to a poor glue job and poor friction fit.  The finish has worn where the tool sits in the rack and I've only had it for a few months.  Tip is also not the pointiest compared to other awls I've owned.  My recommendation is to spend money on a better tool.",2.0
"Not what it used to be! The chrome collar between the spike and handle popped off after some light use. I have an older one of these, and and the new one has a smaller handle and is just generally not as well made. The cost cutting in the new product is clear, and unfortunate.",2.0
"Stanley really blew it on this one....  First, the Old-Timey version of this awl had the ""spike"" run all the way thru the handle to a metal ""button"" on the top.  So there was metal from the top all the way to the tip, making a solid tool.  This one, the metal spike only goes part way thru the handle and (I'm guessing) is glued in.  Second, on the item I received, the Stanley logo and part # that's stamped on the handle is CROOKED.  Not just 2 or 3 degrees off kilter, but 28 degrees off (yes, I got out a protractor and measured - Stanley certainly didn't).  I doubt that this is as intended - looks more like 4:30 Friday afternoon after a 3 martini lunch and the QA guy was off that day.  Third, the tip is not exactly what I'd call a point.  Up close, it's pretty blunt.  It still makes a nice divot in wood - but it should be sharper. All in all, this tools quality is a disappointment.  Stanley should know better, they certainly used to.  It gets 2 stars because it can mark a spot in wood (I don't think I'd try it on metal) and it hasn't fallen apart (yet).  So it works - but given the (lack of) quality, it will probably end up in the back of a drawer - and then in a ""anything in this box - 50 cents"" box at a yardsale.",2.0
"Doesn't work at all as a cutting tool, which is the reason I bought it. The knife blade is quite long...which would be great except the tip of the blade never really gets hot.

The first one I received was one someone had bought & returned...plastic was opened & tips were missing. Second one was complete & new but doesn't work as a hot knife. Seems like it would work fine if what you wanted was the wood burning or just to melt initials into plastic for ownership purposes.",2.0
"so, this item is simple, and that's often good. The wood-burning tips are fair--the thin one barely leaves a trace, it is rather too delicate, though the wide one works fine. The hot knife was not heat-proof and the shaft that screws it in melted upon first use. I have not used the item for soldering, as I have a solder iron.",2.0
Seems quite flimsy.  I keep worrying that it's about to break due to the bending of the screw in tips.  Maybe I need to let it get hotter?  How long should I wait?  I've waited like 5 minutes for it to warm up?  I am using it to cut plastic roofing so maybe that's too much for this tool.  I expect I'll return and buy a bigger hot knife.,2.0
I'm really sorry to say but this broke within 10 minutes of using it. I should have listened to the reviews in that the tool gets so hot that the screw that holds the tip in became super weak and broke inside the machine. Now it's unusable.,2.0
"I make cosplay armor and needed a hot knife to cut through foam floor mats. The hot knife with exacto blade was too flimsy, bent after my first use and I only cut 2 floor mats. I don't recommend this tool if you will be doing a lot of cutting. One small piece okay, but 8-9 pieces, not so good.",2.0
Very flimsy.,2.0
"Used this on a couple occasions for maybe a half hour at a time. Worked very good to cut thick (30 mil) HDPE sheeting with precision (albeit slowly, maybe about an inch every 1.5 seconds). By the third or fourth time the tip was bent and wiggled at the end of the tool, and finally sheared off completely. It cannot be replaced and cannot be disassembled, so this is now useless.",2.0
"I was very disappointed in this Dremel product. There is no way it gets over 1000 degrees, the heat was very inconsistent and the heat didn't transfer well to the interchangeable tips, you basically had to lay the tips down in order for them to burn. Would not buy this product again",2.0
hot knife attachment broke under pressure. almost threw away but i figured out how to unscrew the broken off part.,2.0
"I love this so much but it breaks so easily. The bit broke off into the knife and now it is completely useless. I got a replacement and it happened again. I'm getting a replacement for my replacement, but if it isn't for the fragility then it would be awesome.",2.0
"broke, not worth it",2.0
"I thought Dremel design are smarter than this; any $10 solder tool can let you change bits occasionally. This Dremel 1550 T2 versa tips internal thread got stripped after a few uses, can't change bits. Any engineer can design a harden internal thread and let the soft copper bits take the wear and tear. If they think we're going to buy another one, they need to go back to school.",2.0
Very light wt. and can not take much pressure when in use.  We had one broke before Christmas day was over and grandpa had to give up his he has had for 10 years.,2.0
Once iron heats up the standard tip starts to bend with just slight pressure. Becomes more and more difficult to control.  No temperature control means limited range of time to work effectively. Spend the money for a better one.,2.0
"I was very excited to find a heat knife for what I thought was a reasonable price.  It got really hot which was good but you have pay close attention to not melt things by accident.  I loved it until it stopped working after 5 uses.  I turned pluged it in the other day for it just to never heat up, I pushed the cord in some which I had to start doing after use 3 but nothing ever came of it.

I really did love it until it stopped working.",2.0
"I'm using the hot knife attachment to cut 1/2"" thick foam rubber mats.  The blade cuts cleanly and smoothly after it reaches temperature.  However, it cools quickly in the foam and there's always the fear that the thin metal will break.

The bigger problem is how the blade attaches to the handle.  The blade screw is inserted through a bushing and screws into the handle.  It's tough to tighten and regularly works loose.  The last time I tightened it the screw broke off down in the handle.

I'll order another one simply because it's cheap and pretty much exactly what I need for my one-shot project, but I'm disappointed at the overall poor quality.  Do not by this if you have heavy duty work or need something that will last a long time.",2.0
"I purchased this tool specifically for cutting foam balls used for Christmas ornaments.  After cutting only five 3"" balls, the base of the knife blade has bent.  I guess the heat was responsible for this and the tool kit will have to be returned or exchanged.  I am disappointed in Dremel.",2.0

"Mine didn't come with an engraving tip, I was able to make a piece of tungsten for a tig torch work however. Quite difficult to use because if you squeeze it at all it stops it from vibrating, but it's a tool that requires squeezing to operate. It vibrates a lot in your hand so you need a firm grip on it to stop it from slipping out of your hand, you also need to hold it firmly to draw straight lines but if you squeeze it it stops the point from engraving like it should.",2.0

I was looking for an engraver that gave me control and a decently smooth cut for writing on metal. This tool is awkward to hold (can't get a comfortable grip) and it doesn't penetrate the metal very deeply. It is also quite loud and obnoxious to work with. I was disappointed and I still look for an at home engraver that performs to quality standards.,2.0
I do not know yet how this product works as mine did NOT come with the drill bit. Apparently by some reviews some did and some did not. Mine did not. Now I have to purchase this and the screwdriver to put it in.,2.0
"I recently purchased this item and went to use it for the first time.  After securely fastening the engraving tip I began to engrave on a metal surface.  After about 5 minutes of use, the set screw that holds the carbide tip in the unit came out.  I went to replace the screw and found that what threads were available to grab and hold the screw in place had stripped.  It appears that there are not enough threads to hold the tip in place and/or the metal the base is composed of is just not hard enough to hold the screw.  It doesn't make sense that a device designed to vibrate at 7,200 strokes per minute (120 per second) would have a hardened carbide tip but the base that holds it wouldn't be designed to withstand the force (the base looks like to be POT metal)",2.0

I was disappointed with this.  I thought it was American made.  It is not.  It is Chinese made.  The point is blunt and rounded.  The awl cannot be used to scratch or scribe.

"I ordered this paint by numbers because I was looking for a nautical themed picture that would be somewhat challenging and would not come out looking like a child's painting. I loved the look of the picture on the website but was quite disappointed when the product arrived. Although I realize that one must use various techniques to achieve the look of the picture shown on the site, a child's art project is exactly what this item looks like. I have not even started working on the painting yet because to get colors similar to those shown on the site, I am going to have to purchase all new paints.

Perhaps a picture of the packaging from the painting rather than a finished product would show more clearly what one is dealing with if they order this item. The only reason that I am not returning this is the fact that the price was considerably better that what I have seen in stores for comparable items.",2.0
"This is my first experience with a paint by number kit so I have nothing to compare it to, but I do have two concerns.  There are many number errors on both the painting surface and the cardboard box as well (ie: different numbers on the same location, paint numbers that don't exist in this kit).  Secondly, some of the lighter paint colors (white especially) don't cover the pattern lines or numbers well.  I've applied a second coat, but that gets tiring.  I guess the solution is to always view the painting from a safe distance!",2.0

"This is a complete disappointment! I'm an artist whom likes to do paint-by-numbers to relax. This... was not relaxing. It was aggravating and infuriating.

This didn't get one star because the picture is so beautiful.

The paint is pretty much see through and the numbers are printed in a very deep blue ink that's very hard to cover up. I have some pictures shown. The green is two coats and you can still see the numbers. The cream was, believe it or not, four coats!! Yes, you can still see the numbers!! How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop?!

Right now, I'm at the point where I'm either just going to throw it away with nothing done on it, or I'm going to get out my other paints and see if I can get the numbers covered and use my own coloring. If i Do that, I will post a follow-up picture. I'm not sure any paint will cover up the numbers with one coat. Gesso maybe. But I would hate to Gesso then paint. Seems to be a lot of unnecessary stress for such a cheap paint-by-number.

If you want to do a paint-by-number that is wonderful with paint and coverage pay a little more and go with the Dimensions brand. I've done several of those and reviewed them as well.",2.0
This was my third paint by number and by far the most difficult. A LOT of mixing colors and inevitably running out of certain paints. I would say 70% of this board was mixed colors ... Which made it difficult.,2.0
"First, it arrived with a shattered paint brush and torn packaging leaving a bend in the cardboard canvas. The ""canvas"" soaks up the paint leaving horrible lines and the paint seems watered down (which is probably a reason why it's getting absorbed so easily).  Not impressed at all by this product because I loved my last paint by number from another company",2.0
Very disappointed with this set. The paint is to thin . It like painting with water color. Plus some of the areas are not numbered. You sort of have to guess. I will not buy from this company again.,2.0
"I was very disappointed with the paint. It was translucent like the paint used on clear suncatchers. Even after 3 coats you could see the numbers easily. The design, outline and picture were nice but I gave up and gave it to my daughter so can use it for practice. One other issue is that about 1/ 2 the numbers are drawn with arrows and when you start painting you end up painting over the other numbers. There is a paper copy for reference and since the paint is clear you can see the number but if the paint covered better it would be tedious.",2.0
Colors didn't always match with what's pictured. A couple spots weren't numbered. There was barely enough white paint to complete the project - especially if you want to do an extra coat to hide the numbers / lines. Overall not as good quality as the Dimensions paint by number brand.,2.0
"I got frustrated with this one. I ran out of paint, which I have never done before. More than 10 spots were missing numbers.",2.0
Product is great just as expected but two of the color pans where cracked and there were pieces of purple all over the inside of the case when I opened it.... there was no cushion inside the package to prevent this so I blame the seller if anything,2.0
Numbering on canvas makes this very difficult to paint.  Numbers are placed in spaces with a line leading to the area to paint.,2.0
"This is the second review I've written about a PBN by Reeves company. I love the picture, but so far I have had to buy 4 replacements paints at the hobby store, because the paints were so thin they didn't come close to covering the mat and they separated as I stroked them on. Also the paint board is an odd size 15 3/4 by 11 3/4  and there are no frames to match it. I can either buy a custom frame on EBay that will cost me 2times the original cost of the PBN or I can cut the board down and lose a lot of the picture to fit into an 11x14 frame. I had to do this on my other picture and it really took away from the painting.
At this point I may not finish it, as I see I need another replacement paint. ( I have been buying Ceramcoat in 2 oz. .bottles)
Buyer Beware.",2.0
"Somewhat confusing with numbers.  Not enough blue paint and confusing instruction!  When instructing to mix two colors, don't label it 86/48 with another dash!  I like the other brand much better!",2.0
"This product is such a pain to use. First is the paint- the containers are very difficult to open so its easy to spill when opening and closing them. I'm talking about splattering all over the place. My biggest issue with this is the way the painting is labelled. The numbers that guide your painting aren't directly in the area that you paint. So let's say you are painting 15, but within the 15 area that you have to print there is a 10 with an arrow pointing to another area you need to paint. If you completely paint the 15 area, you won 't know about the 10 anymore. There is no separate guide, so once you've painted over a number, that's it.
The only positive I can share is that the paintbrush included is actually an appropriate size
If you are looking for this type of product I would suggest the Dimensions brand as it's much easier to use",2.0
This painting kit has more mixes than you can imagine. I can not recall ever buying a paint by number kit that had so many arrows. If you like to paint using these kits save yourself the headache now and take my words seriously. I cannot tell you how many times I wanted to just toss the painting. It was just not worth the money. The picture is pretty but not worth AT ALL...the price of the hassle that came with it. I hope that this helps.,2.0
"This paint by number is one of the most annoying that I've bought. It requires color mixing (which a lot of paint by numbers do), but it is not intuitive at all. The numbers on the ""canvas"" are in a handwritten type font, and are almost impossible to read. There's no guide like most paint by numbers have, just a reproduction of the ""canvas"" on the packaging. The paint pots are difficult to open, and don't appear to have much product in them. There are some spots on the canvas that are just completely blank, with no way to tell what color they should be. In the smaller spaces an arrow is used to indicate color, but if you paint the larger areas first (as recommended) you'll cover them up. And lastly, in order to achieve the look on the packaging, you'd need to do a lot of painting even after filling in every space. I'm not a fan of this paint by number at all.",2.0
Ok,2.0
WAY too small. I thought this was going to be even just a little bit bigger than it actually was. I assume the colors are good to spend 13 bucks for something so small. I didn't open it because I returned it. Very bad misrepresentation of how big it is. If you're looking for small watercolors. This is the perfect product for you.,2.0

"I'm happy with the colors but the palette is useless as the little plastic dividers that hold the pans in place are bent.  They would fit fine if the pans came unpackaged but they came wrapped in cellophane and had a paper wrapper around the outside as well.  This added bulk to each pan and the pans were placed in the palette with the dividers, hence the dividers bent to accommodate the extra bulk of the pans.  I ordered this and another palette (same thing but with full sized pans) and encountered the same problem.  It makes the fit for the dividers/pans pretty crappy and useless as it doesn't hold the pans in very well.  I just bought a sturdy metal palette to put my pans in to avoid this crap.  Also, even with the dividers that aren't bent, the pans do not stay in the palette very well.",2.0
"This is so very small, and seems too expensive for what it is. I sent it back because it was a gift ins it didn't seem like enough to give as a gift. I personally have a wn travel watercolor bag that came with a kit inside, and it is a much better buy. I've been using it for 15 years.",2.0
"Disappointed even if it did arrive 3 weeks early. As you can see from the photo, the tray does not look the same-there is only one side with 3 pockets for paint. They need to be more open about the size too-5 inches doesn't leave much room for mixing and the brush is so small that it is hard to hold-nice small point though that will get all messed up every time I put it back in it's sleeve-1/8 inch if not smaller. I was expecting a larger tray for mixing and much larger paints and brush-at least twice the size. I thought the price was great for a larger tray, but I feel ripped off with this (the size is way down on the bottom of the page and it even says it's 5.2 inches not 5). I haven't used the paints yet and won't be disappointed there. Windsor and Newton have always had good paints-I'll post a new review if not! Just sad that it was not the same product as shown on Amazon and how I was mislead by size.",2.0
"I love winsor and Newton watercolor paints. As all we know W&N is premium quality when it comes to watercolor. I previously owned the 12 color small box . My daugher went thru it fully and i wanted to upgrade to a larger color collection so i bought this 24 color set. However I reduced three stars for the design of this box and the way pans are placed in the cradle.

First of all opening this box is the most difficult thing in this whole wide world. The only way i can open the box is to press the part where it says press here to pen with the lower part of my palm and keep the box a bit slanting. THATS THE ONLY WAY IT OPENS. If someone says its a knack you learn as you use this paint more, I would say a paint box shouldnt be this hard to open PERIOD. I have used Koi field sketch set, pelican sets ALL of them provide an easy design to use. W&N is a known name with highly pigmented high quality paints they SHOULD pay attention to design aspect and convenience of use.

That being said when one opens the box keeping it slanting all the colors fall off of the pans and if anyone is as picky as i am i need the colors to be in the same order of the description given on the box. Some have suggested we tape the colors into the pans. Pls try that with the size of these pans its a project that will engage you for life time.

Anyway hope W&N takes note of their customers frustrations and changes the design soon. Otherwise i am a fan of W&N watercolor best in the industry.",2.0

I usually use the smaller 24 pack of crayons but find the students kept breaking them and they were too small for their hands to hold. Students had five of the large crayons roll off their tables and break the tip off in the first day of use. I was disappointed in this and now make sure they keep the crayons in the basket when not in use. Because of their weight, it must make them prone to break when dropped.",2.0
Crayola markers are great. Except when they are NOT washable. I purchase markers for my kids all of the time and wasn't paying attention with these. That red stain on my shirt will not come out. Buy the washable markers instead and enjoy them.,2.0

I only needed it to secure my duvet cover with the insert. I just cant get the middle parts cause no convenient string, but hey the corners are a big help. Just wish these actually worked :/",2.0

"The good news is they are cheap. The bad news is they are really cheap!

If their intended use is for something like a boat tarp, and all you need is the female side, they might work alright as long as you get a really good mushroom when you hammer them together.

If you are trying to make a cover where these snaps are used to connect pieces together, then don't be surprised when you find out things aren't attached after a mild breeze.  They come undone very easily.",2.0

"Ive used Xacto knives off and on for 30 years.  These seem to be of the same quality I would expect.  However, the set collection is a nightmare.  They come in a nice wooden box, but theres nothing to secure the pieces inside.

Theres NOTHING to hold the cheap plastic trays in place.  Closing it from either side means dumping out the contents of that tray.  The blades have a cheap magnetic strip to hold them.  The serrated blade is made of a non-magnetic material, so it just falls loose by default.

I plan to try to glue the trays in place, but thats an iffy solution at best.  Bottom line, I should HAVE to come up with a fix to their disastrous design!",2.0
one of the pieces broke after a few uses,2.0
Tools broke first day,2.0
They were not sharp at all.,2.0
Good blades but the reason I bought the kit was to have a place to store for safe keeping. The box is crap. Nothing stays in place. Should have bought the cheaper kit.,2.0
"I specifically selected X-ACTO instead of a cheap Chinese knockoff because, well, I didn't want some cheap Chinese knockoff brand.  It turns out that a cheap Chinese knockoff would have been better than this mess.

Actually, the knives themselves seem OK, though I can't vouch for their quality yet - they seem adequate.  I expect they will work well enough.

I only gave two stars because of the ridiculous box they come in.  In the pictures it looks like a quality wooden box with fitted inserts for the knife handles and a magnetic strip to hold the blades; in fact it's a cheaply made splintery box with crummy, crookedly mounted hinges and latch, and absolute garbage fitted inserts that are just vacuum formed from thin plastic sheet.

The bottom insert holds the handles and, while it does an adequate holding job it has a cheap creaky feel and will likely crack and fall apart in a few years.  Plus, it isn't actually attached to the bottom of the box, it just sits in there.  Turn the box over and it will fall out.  Or, try to remove a handle to use it, and the insert comes out of the box too.  You wrestle the handle off the insert, then drop the insert back in the box.  Great stuff....

Having the bottom insert not attached isn't that terrible, but the top insert is a different story - gravity works against you here.  And not only does the top insert fall out of the lid when you open the box, but its magnetic strip is too weak and sits in too deep a recess; so when you try to stick the blades to it there's a gap between the blades and the magnet.  The larger blades in particular don't stay put because of this.

So, when you open the box two things happen.  The first is, the upper insert falls out of the lid and sits upside down on the bottom insert.  The second is, when you lift the fallen-out insert half the blades fall off of it because of the weak magnetic strip.

So every time you open this box to use a knife, you will have to replace half the blades on the magnetic strip, then gingerly re-close the box for the next go-round.  Every time.

I have a Harbor Freight (i.e. cheap Chinese) set at work that I've been using for some time, and while the Harbor Freight box is plastic instead of wood, it's engineered better than this ""genuine X-ACTO"" version.  I will say however, the handles of the X-ACTO set are made better than the Harbor Freight versions (for example the collets in the HF are plastic, while the X-ACTO are metal).  So again, the tools themselves seem adequate, and may turn out to work just fine.

I'm going to have to modify the box so I don't get a bunch of moderately sharp razor knife blades falling on my foot every time I open the box to use the tool.  It would have been better to ship the tools without a box at all, rather than this cheap piece of crap.  I probably would have given 4 stars, maybe 5, for that product.

So rather than buying this ""genuine X-ACTO"" set, I would recommend you go for the cheap Chinese knockoff instead.  You'll be glad you did.",2.0
"Ive only owned this for a couple months and never used, I opened it yesterday to find half of the knives have rusted... I stored them in my house, a dry environment...",2.0
I got this as a gift from my wife.  The box is nice but it feels like 10 bucks worth of stuff for a 40 dollar price.  The plastic backing that holds the blades is very brittle and hard to take things in and out of.  The tools do work but in the end the price is too high for what you get.  I would buy it at 20 bucks but not 40.,2.0
chisles don't fit the handle well and are dull.  top plastic blade holder falls out of case.  Decent starter set but buy a good set of blades and chisels.,2.0
"I used to use Xacto products in school, and I was reminded of their quality and usefulness when I used a friend's Xacto set that he's had for almost 30 years, so I decided to buy my own.

Unfortunately, Xacto has gone cheap. These are nowhere near the quality of my friend's set. They are much more lightweight and clearly poorly made.  They work, and I don't want to be hassled with returning them, but I won't buy Xacto in the future.",2.0
Crappily built. The blades are held to the lid by magnetic strips that hardly stayed attached.,2.0
Not as good as Xacto use to be when I was a kid. Have bought generic knife sets.,2.0
"I made sure to buy X-acto brand. I didn't want just. Well the wood box these knifes and blades come in is junk. Shame on them. When you close the nox all the blades fall in. This was after I rennet the tray so the magnetic would hold and a taped the holder down so it wouldn't fall in.

I feel safe.",2.0
"I've had my current X-acto for the past ten years and loved it, so naturally, I was very exited to get this kit. To my surprise, these knives were a complete disappointment.
I expected the stencil knife to hold its blade like the gripster knife, when in fact its grip (if you can call it that) consists of nothing more than a threaded hole, allowing the blade to fall out easily. (See attached photos.) Needless to say, I'm not comfortable handling something that sharp with a less than adequate tool. The other knives are a little bit better in construction, but the quality still pales in comparison to my original X-acto (and other brands, for that matter.) The box itself is nice, and had the knives been better I might have considered keeping it. Its only downfall (as others have commented) is the foam insert that shreds every time I take out a knife. Overall, I'm left wondering what the h*** X-acto's quality control was thinking...",2.0
"I am very unhappy with the ""wood"" box that this comes in. It is beyond cheap. It's like molded sawdust. There is no way the hinges will stay inside this crap material for long. I will be returning this and getting the same kit that comes in a zippered bag of sorts. It looks better and has to be better than this darn box. The plastic inserts holding the pens and blades is ridiculously tight. I had to pry the knives out with a screwdriver. Just things to think about if you ever use this regularly. Great set, just in a horrible box...",2.0
"Xacto's blade design and quality is well known, and I can't say anything against them. The blades do what they were designed to do, and this package come with a variety of blades. Unfortunately, the container leaves a lot of room for improvement. The box itself is made of wood and is quite nice. But the stuff inside the box to hold the items in place is thin plastic, and nothing holds it in place but friction. Worse, the top section that holds the blades is held in place by double-sided tape. But this tape--at least with my box--is not sufficiently sticky. And the strip that holds the blades, along with those blades, all fall out when I close the top. Kind of unusable as is. Perhaps I can find some glue or stronger tape. I was surprised by the poor quality of these few elements and would gladly pay a bit more for something better to hold these knives.",2.0
"I really like the way these blades cut, very precise and smooth, however the blades are either way too stubborn to come out, making me almost cut myself when trying to switch them out, or so loose after I finally manage to switch the blade for another, that the blade keeps falling out while I'm working on something. It really is a problem and I wish it weren't, so because of that I can't give more than a 2 star review.",2.0
low quality.,2.0
only one handle and poorly packaged.  not like exacto knives i've had before,2.0
"not real sturdy but good for the price......needed to glue plastic frame inserts and magnets because they fell out easily....good for the price, get what you pay for

edit: not liking this product, the blades break horribly easy, and handles won't hold them half the time....lowering my rating on product and would recommend spending better money for a better buy.....stay away unless you are working hobby boxes where the wood is soft enough and even then i wouldn't trust the durability of the blades, give it 2 stars because the blades were at least sharp",2.0
"Lots of supposedly fun and useful tools with no way to figure out how to use everything. Was very excited to receive this kit. After all, I am a burgeoning crafter with lots of ideas and projects that I felt this could help with. However, I was so VERY disappointed that there was not one piece of instructional material that came with it. There are a few pictures on the box but not every tool is pictured in action. I have never owned an X-Acto kit of any kind so I don't even have experience with the basic knife. I don't know a wood working blade from a paper trimming blade nor how to use the knife with what looks like a planer or even what some of the other tools are for.

I went to the X-Acto website to look for e-format instructions. There are a few links to videos and some FAQ's about some things but not for this kit. I did, however, learn that Elmer's Products recently acquired X-Acto. The customer service team was quick to respond and helpful as much as they could be. They also looked for instructional info for the kit and also could not find anything. They sent the info they had which included a breakdown of the blade and other product names so that I could at least try and look up other info online.

Having never owned an X-Acto product, I am unable to compare it to the X-Acto products of old. However, if you have experience with X-Acto products and these different blades, this may be a good kit for you. Reasonable box strength, Reasonable quality of the handles and blades I have used so far. Excellent customer service with quick responses. I requested that this lack of instructional info be forwarded to the appropriate personnel for development and was assured this need would be forwarded. For their support, more than anything, I leave a rating of 2, especially if you have never used X-Acto products.",2.0
"Admittedly, I was a bit surprised to find that I could buy an X-acto set for 20 bucks. When the package arrived, it was clear that these are not the same X-acto knives I used as a child.

Upon opening, all of the blades were loose and floating around in the box. I had to glue the inserts to box prevent this. Not good. I've since used the set twice, and was again surprised; this time at the difficulty I had cutting PAPER with them.

I'll probably end up tossing these. I'd be willing to pay considerably more for a quality set of hobby knives, but I wouldn't pay five bucks for this one.",2.0
"I completely agree with other reviews - the interior plastic holder is very poor quality. The plastic doesn't stay in place and the magnetic strip is too far inset, causing several of the blades to fall from holder. I'm returning this set. I expected much better quality from X-ACTO and had hoped that due to prior reviews for the same issue, they would have fixed it, but they have not.",2.0
Spend more to buy an expensive set. Chipped several blades on thin plastic,2.0
"Not as nice as sets from 30 years ago.  The plastic trays fall out.  I seriously considered returning it but need the tools for a project.  The cases used to be solid wood, now they're MDF with a veneer.  The top plastic tray broke when removing a tool.  The tools aren't as nice as I remember, either.  The sad part is that I would pay more for better.  I guess that's not a choice.",2.0
I bought this for my teen son for Christmas. Within one day the handle of one of the knives had broken. Some of the blades are flimsy and not safe. I do not recommend this product.,2.0
The quality of Xacto isn't what it used to be.  I have a set of these when they came with only 5 chisels from 20 years ago and the new set is not as good of quality as the old ones.....,2.0
Not deaigned for wood carving.  Blades kept loosening and slipping.,2.0
"Definitely not for heavy duty projects, dings up real easy, not sure what these tools are good for... but I'm no pro...",2.0
"It probably would carve softwood, but my butter knife would carve soft wood too if i sharpen it on the cement. I received this as a gift and it look pretty cool at first glance, it's kinda of  like a cheap pocket knife that lays in your garage because you really have no use for it unless you are using it for clay or foam.
Quality is so so.. remind me of dollar store quality blade with a nice box. Handle is like a screwdriver, try caring with that! After all you do get what you paid for. A real carving knife (just 1) would probably cost you the same as this set. If you getting this to practice carving wood, DON'T. This will probably work good as a ""Clay/Foam Carving knife"".

Had mine for 2 years and used it about twice, mainly to cut cardboard, not wood. The first time I used it to carve maple it turn dull in about 15 min and since it is a thin blade, I had to stop before I break it. It does rust as expected. Good cheap gift to give people with no thought behind it.",2.0
Cool..needs a larger box though.,2.0
"SO not worth the money. Came DIRTY and SCRATCHED UP. Visibly old and used. The box has a large, deep scratch on its lid.",2.0
Too much of a toy - recovered my money easily by selling it on Craig's List,2.0
The blades break with almost nothing.,2.0

"I'm on a roll here, with reviews!  I obviously need to shop less, and get a life!  I purchased this set, because someone walked off with my old, trusty Xacto, a little while ago, and I thought, well, maybe that means, I should upgrade..Sorry, though this set has a couple of bells and whistles in the fact that it's pretty, mixed, and the box is pretty, it doesn't come with blade protectors, which now, I have to purchase separately, IF I WANT TO KEEP MY DIGITS WHERE THEY CURRENTLY RESIDE!!!
I never thought about checking whether the set came with shields, so the joke's on me!  I'm going to have to create a pseudonym, ""THE JOKE'S ON ME"" ALSO, THERE'S THIS TOTALLY HORRIBLE, DANGEROUS MAGNETIC STRIP, I SUPPOSE INTENDED TO HOLD THE BLADES IN SOME SAFETY, IN THE BOX, AND WHOEVER THOUGHT OF AND DESIGNED THIS FEATURE, SHOULD BE DRAWN AND QUARTERED, BY EXACTO BLADES!!  OH, MY GOSH!!  THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE  MOST DANGEROUS PACKAGING I'VE SEEN, SINCE THE 'FORD PINTO'!!

BE CAREFUL, UNLESS YOU NEED TO PULL AN INSURANCE SCAM, THIS IS SCARY DANGEROUS, ADULTS ONLY, FOR GOODNESS SAKE!!",2.0
Like a previous reviewer said about it being from x-acto. I thought it would be half decent but these chisels are not that sharp at all. I tried to carv and cut into the softest piece of wood I had and it struggled to even dig in. Very disappointing coming from X-acto. I am going to try and sharpen these and hope for the best.,2.0
"The set itself works nice and I love that it comes in a wooden box, but when my set arrived, I was missing the smallest knife (handle and blade) in the set.

Other than that, no complaints. Just -3 stars for the quality assurance.",2.0
good for couple of times,2.0
"Decent enough knives, but the black inserts are paper-thin blow-mold stuff that falls out. I threw away the top piece since the mag strip wouldn't stick to it, and I glued the mag strip directly to the wooden box lid. The box itself is oddly very nice, but I'd have been happier with a slightly cheaper box for overall higher quality packaging.",2.0
"This set is not for carving basswood or other similar woods.  The blades are OK but the gouges and v-grooves leave a lot to be desired.  The first v-groove I tried to use on basswood bent in half.  I think this set would likely be OK for balsa wood or Styrofoam.  If you are a wood carver, buy Flexcut or other quality specialized wood carving tools.  You could buy one good carving knife for the price of this kit and be ahead of the game.  I'm going to be trying some paper cutting projects in the near future that I think I'll be able to use the blades for so the set won't be a complete waste of my money.",2.0
"I was not impressed with the quality of the carving tools. Didn't have an issue with the blades. I ended up returning it. I purchased a $5 set at AC Moore which I actually got for $2.50, using a coupon, and that worked so much better! Hard to believe but true.",2.0
"Cheap handles broke within the first few uses.  None of the 3 handles solidly hold a blade anymore, the blades keep falling out and won't tighten enough to keep the blades in.  Maybe these were a better quality at some point in the past but they are garbage now.  I was only using them on thin plastic and they broke.  Going in the trash.",2.0
"such weak blades, post 8 heads in one night,a couple of them didn't even snap they just kinda fell apart, and no way to contact the seller",2.0
Smaller than expected.,2.0
I got this set many years ago I found it of very little use. The tools would slip in the handle and were too thin to be safe to use. Couple of them broke and I cut myself in the process. It's better to buy things with fixed blades.,2.0
"Within the first hour of use, the large chisel and the thin chisel both cracked at the bases. And before you cite poor form, I have been using the angled chisel from the set for the past 2 days without any problems. One of the small knifes for the precision handle (""A) also broke shortly after use. Overall they are sharp but tend to break easily. Also, the red handle of the large one was delivered dirty with lots of lint on despite being in the plastic wrap. Decent for paper working, but not for wood (balsa or bass)",2.0
The metal used to make the handle is poor quality aluminum. It wouldn't lock the blade in place after one or two uses. The blades may have been good quality I don't know never got to use most of them. The magnetic strip ment to hold the blades in the lid isn't strong enough and most fall down. Waste of money pass this one up.,2.0
"I have been very happy with the quality of X-Acto products in the past, but this set was a major disappointment. Every piece of this set screams ""low quality"". The box is very flimsy, the plastic pieces inside the box that keep the blades and handles couldn't be made any cheaply. The handles have rough finish and they look like they won't last very long. Blades are all soaked in some kind of oil and nowhere near as sharp as X-Acto blades used to be. The saw blade doesn't even stick to the magnetic backing. I am switching to Olfa knifes and blades, which seem to be much higher quality.",2.0
"I bought this because it came in the wooden box with plastic insert to hold the blades. The box isn't bad, but the hinges are super chinzy and the plastic insert that hold the blades is terrible. It is very thin and does not hold the blades very well. Only a couple of the blades actually stay put, and it is a royal pain in the butt to get the knife out of its holder.

Other than the quality of the box/holders, the blades and actual knife itself are good. This only got 2 stars because the blades and knife itself are good.",2.0
"I was pleased to see the quality of the wooden box but was somewhat disappointed by the quality of the tools. You get a sanding block with ONE piece of fine sandpaper. Really? The knife blades are one each, like a sampler pack.  Some still have burrs on the edge where they were poorly sharpened, others are well sharpened. There is only one blade for the coping saw. The ""plane"" uses a tiny thumb screw in a plastic frame to hold the blade in place and is not acceptable.
The handles that hold the blades are good quality.",2.0
"Pros: The blade. Follows exactly what you'd expect from a company like X-Acto
Con: The handle. There doesn't seem to be a way to lock the blade in to the middle-sized handle. The grip twists effortlessly in both directions.
The smaller handle works as I expect it to, and I haven't tried the largest.",2.0
"OK, I did not buy this item from amazon but I did get the identical item elsewhere. I would like to have given it more stars, however I used to have this set years ago and it was excellent. This one is not. It does have three good knives and a good selection of blades. But the good stops there. The box is no longer made of wood, it is however workable. Just not sure how it will hold up. The really bad thing is the plastic knife and blade holders inside the box. These are make out of the cheapest plastic I have ever seen and there is no way it will last, this is a big disappointment. The reason I got the set was so I would have a good way to store the knives on my workbench but this thing will not last even a couple of months. I'm keeping it until I find something better. It's really sad that so many things are made so cheaply in china, it's a sad testament to this country.",2.0
"Old timers like me remember when X-ACTO was made in the good old USA. The quality now is no better than any other Made-in-China off brand you can by in one of those ""freight"" stores for much cheaper. I'm very disappointed. Also the package arrived without any of the accessory blades pictured on the box. Save your money. Buy the cheap stuff, that's what you are going to get anyway!",2.0
"Blades are not very strong, many broke right away and they dulled rapidly. I guess you get what you pay for.",2.0
"I had an X-acto knife set in 1976. The blades were made of high alloy steel. There are no more American made X-acto knives. After the free trade agreement, the company went broke. It has sold several times, but I am told it is a sister company now owned by Elmer's Products Inc.

I bought this set to use in detailed woodwork, thinking it was the same as my old set. While masking off a project for painting, I grabbed the red handled knife to trim the masking tape. It would not cut the paper masking tape. After using a razor blade to finish the job, I inspected the X-acto knife blades. Each blade was a different angle. It looked like my five year old tried to sharpen them with a file. The blades are now made out of soft metal, much like a $1.00 pairing knife from the Dollar Store.

This situation is not going to get any better. Now, all wood cutting tools have to be redesigned by the buyer, including very expensive wood planes, so here is what I did to make these knives usable. I used my Lansky knife sharpener set to resharpen each blade. I first changed the blade bevels to seventeen degrees with a course stone. Then, I sharpened each blade razor sharp. It doesn't take long because the blades are soft metal. Now that the blades are at the correct angle, it won't take long to touch them up when they dull. Sorry, this is as good as it gets in America. If I find I am using these daily, I will order a better set from Germany, or Switzerland. Both countries have much pride and quality in the tools they sell. Hope this helps others. This set is usable, it just needs to be corrected.",2.0
"Other than the handles, this is a pretty low quality product.  For this price, just buy the individual packs of Xacto knives and save yourself the money.  The wooden box is poorly assembled, the hinges and lock are not square and the black inserts which hold the knives and handles are made of the thinnest cheapest plastic.  The plastic is so bad, in fact, that the shrink wrap used to seal the items into the black inserts cracked and warped both the top and bottom pieces.  Now neither will stay secure in the box, the top piece just falls out when I open the box and the whole bottom lifts out when I try to pull a knife up.

Would not recommend this kit.  Just buy the individual knives/handles.",2.0
"Tools were a smaller than they look, won't do what he wanted it to,  should of sent it back,  not impressed",2.0
"The Picture shows a nice storage case as I am familiar with. But the one I received was cheap and crappy to the max!!!! The storage inserts are not even close to the size of the box and extremely flimsy beyond belief, They are shrink wrapped and then glued to the box so when you unwrap it there is no means by witch to secure the trays. they are too small to fit snugly and are about useless. The knives themselves are acceptable but if you are looking for storage for them this case is not worth the low grade plastic within it. Not happy. :(",2.0
"I guess Exacto decided to offshore the production of their famous hobby knives.  The blades fall out of the handles and it is some kind of manufacturing problem.  Not a great job by the Chinese in reproducing the set I had 40.years ago.  Maybe some American company could make a quality version for a few dollars more.  This set looks nice, but does not work that well.",2.0
"As mentioned by other reviewers, the internal black casing is terrible.  Weak plastic, and it does not fit the case.  If you are buying this because it is a deluxe set - especially for the wooden case - look elsewhere.  Otherwise, the tools seem OK.",2.0
"This tool set is generally pretty good. As with most Xacto products, the blades are shape and the tools all there upon arrival. They do not all fit into the little holder thing which I felt was a little unsafe for the main carving knife blade to be free floating in the holder. At this time, Owning the product for about 72 hours now, I have since broken 2 blades, bent the saw tool blade and really wish I had gone for a different more stable tool kit all together. This kit is ideal for many, however if you are a beginning wood worker, stay away from this product. Go for tools that are solid in construction.

The blades are decent, but really leave much to be desired. Switching blades out can become a hassle, even if the tool handle is comfortable, switching tool bits out when your in the moment of carving takes too much away from the experience. The blades break quite easily, bend very easily and are frustrating to use. Perhaps this item is more adept in its usage by more experienced wood crafter, but for a novice, I am honestly sorry I went with this over my other option of solid tools. In general I honestly can not say this tool kit is absolutely useless, I can see great potential for this kit, if it were used for scrap booking, or perhaps even small wood projects. If you buy this intending to do only wood carving, I recommend you buy something more stable and solid.

Best wishes,

"I am making shirts for my sister's wedding party and I wanted the lettering to be the same color as the shirt with a white background. I meticulously color matched the letters.

I noticed after just under a minutes, the red tshirt began to bleed through all of the white areas on the design.  By the end of the total 3 minutes, the red could be seen through almost the entire design, light and dark areas.  I am guessing that the time is either too much or the heat should have been lower.  Poor directions, either way, and a ruined Tshirt.  Also-- word to the wise-- do NOT trim the entire design before pulling off the backing.  Leave one edge untrimmed & ""tear"" it slightly outside the design to get the peeling process started.  If you trim the whole thing first, you can never take the back off w/o ruining your design.",2.0

"I purchased these transfers because they had decent reviews and are cheaper than Avery transfer sheets at almsot $7 for 6 white sheets. Well, you get what you pay for.
I make 100's of shirts a month that I sell on another site and the quality of these does not compare to the Avery white sheets. These are hard to get to transfer perfectly. You have to be VERY careful. I haven't gotten one perfect yet and I'm an expert at this! I've made 1000's of shirts and bags! Plus the transfer paper sticks and you have to scrap it off!
Avery's are easy to transfer. Also, their white transfers don't feel the way these do. These do feel like the dark avery transfers. Almost like a sticker has been put onto the front of the shirt.
They held up ok to washing but for what I do, I need them to transfer perfectly and me not have to waste shirts trying to achieve that.

Followed the instructions precisely. The gel was still thin and ran all over the pan but my 4 year old did a great job of holding still and we were able to get the print despite how thin the gel was and the fact that it took more then 5 minutes to set.  Mixing the gel 4 minutes instead of the printed time or using a small dish to make the mold might help. Mixing the plaster in the bag was a disaster.  The bag is quite thin and had a leak so liquid plaster got all over the kitchen counter as soon as I started knead the bag.  A bowl would have worked much better. I poured the plaster into the pan a little too soon just to stop slopping plaster everywhere.  I then broke up the clumps with my fingers to try to smooth the plaster out in the pan...more mess.

"Two stars because it does serge all right.
BUT...  it's a bizarre model that I can't find needles for.  I've been to my local Singer dealer, manual in hand, to try to get him to order needles for it.  Been on the phone to Singer's 1-800 number a half dozen times getting part numbers and numbers of service centers from New York to Michigan.  One service center said ""we don't sell that machine.  why would we stock parts for it.""
In fairness, after enough calls the 1-800 number said they'd send me a ""sample pack"" of two needles...  which hardly gives me a lot of confidence as to what I'll do some months down the line.
And the New York place said they'd look into it and phone me back in a few days.
But folks, my time is too valuable to spend chasing around like this.
So...  I'd recommend sticking with another brand, unless making frustrating phone calls is one of your particular hobbies....",2.0
"Yes, it does work as it should if you fiddle with it long enough, and the stars align in just the right way. It rattles, loses tension, doesn't do the stitch width specified in the manual, and forget any special effects, you will go gray just trying.

I thought it was me, and bought how-to books, and watched youtube videos on serging, and after a few months finally decided the machine is a lump of junk. Singer could have made this machine much better, for the same price, as evidenced by the Brother and Janome models in the same price range that are much easier to use and reliable.

From the get-go, the motor smells hot when I use it. The needles they tell you to use I can only find through the internet on Singer's website.  It's very time-consuming to thread.

It threaded pretty easily with clear color-coded instructions but nothing else has worked.  Three needles have broken, one bent (I'm only sewing flannel here!).  Now I am out of needles and as others have mentioned, they aren't easy to find.  I will have to order new neddles online which is fine with me at the moment as I could use the week long break from this frustating machine!

"Unlike the old cases where the machine snugly fits inside and the lid over it, This is an inexpensive piece of plastic with latches on the sides.  The machine just sits on a plastic grid bottom with nothing to cradle or hold it in, so it can bounce around inside when walking or if tipped over.  As for walking with it, the handle in strangely and cheaply made.  There are ridges for grips, but they don't work well since they are raised ridges which dent your fingers when you hold it, due to the weight of the machine. If you're moving it in a short distance (across a room) then you're not holding it long enough to hurt your fingers.  Hmm, can't find much good about it, except it is a good dust cover.  Why would Singer make such nice machines and skimp on the carrying case?  It is the type of quality that would be given away at no charge, with the purchase of a machine.",2.0
"I got this carry case per Amazon's recommendation to go with the Singer 6038 machine.  While it's functional, it's very basic and doesn't allow the machine to be integrated into it like the case I have for my old White - you have to remove the machine from this case to use it.  Also, the pedal for the machine I bought has to be shoved between the arm and the needle in order to get the case closed, which worries me.  The fit is poor - it's a slightly protective dust cover and carrying case and not much else.
Now that I think about it, it's not even that comfortable to carry (and down it goes from 3 to 2 stars) - it was a poor engineer who decided to make the underside of the handle (you know, where all the weight presses on your fingers) a bunch of thin ribs of plastic.  So instead of hanging on to a nice solid surface, you're gripping this things that's trying to bluntly slice your fingers into 1/8 inch strips.  Sure, it's strong, but it's exceedingly uncomfortable to carry any distance.  I'll have to wrap mine with some padded vinyl or somesuch.
In short, it does the job, but not especially well.",2.0
"This case does allow me to carry my sewing machine but, because it is ""universal,"" it does not hold the machine in place.  I have to wedge the machine with rolls of fabric to keep it from bouncing around.  The case is suitable for light duty only.  As the picture shows, the cover is held in place by a wire clip at each end.  There are no clips along the sides.  All the weight of the sewing machine hangs from those two wires, which latch onto plastic.  The case is not sturdy enough to protect a sewing machine from crushing if something were to tip or fall onto it.  It is useful for storage since it keeps the dust off.  Portable sewing machines used to come with sturdy, secure cases.  This thing just does not compare.",2.0
"I works OK. It's cheap and it's effecent.  I don't think I would have bought, though, it if I had know it has staples to attach the metal to the plastic.",2.0
"I bought this case as a cover for my machine a few years ago, and it was great for storing my machine when I wasn't using it very much.  In the past 6 months I've started taking classes, and taking my machine with me, in this case.  The handle is the MOST uncomfortable design.  It's astonishing... I created my own ""padding"" handle so I can carry it further than a couple feet without pain in my fingers.  My machine is not very heavy, it's just an awful design.

It gets two stars instead of one simply because if you plan on putting your machine away, and never carrying it further than a couple feet, then it's probably an alright case.",2.0
I was not very pleased with this case. The handle looks like its missing a part and there is no cushion on it for ease on lifting.,2.0
It amazes me that a beautiful sewing machine would have such a major design flaw.  The removable sewing arm on this machine is held on by two tiny pieces of plastic.  One of which was broken off by the time the machine was delivered.  This resulted in the arm not staying on the machine making it impossible to to sew without taping it in place. It is such a nice machine what a shame they did not come up with a better design.  Amazon did arrange for UPS to pick it up the very next day which was nice.  I am now waiting for my refund so I can purchase another machine.,2.0
"My sewing is limited to hems, and items for my house, including pillow shams and duvet covers.  Although I don't sew often, my standards are high.  I use good quality materials, and want my seams to the straight and even.  I expect a sewing machine to be heavy-duty enough to sew through two layers of upholstery fabric, plus trim or cording, including where the trim overlaps for tidy joinder.  I found the Singer 6038 was not up to these, and other tasks.  Specifically, the automatic needle threader did not work after I changed the needle the second time, it was not sturdy enough to sew through overlapping trim or cording, even when I tried to urge it along manually, and I was never able to get the one-step buttonhole feature to work, despite repeated attempts. The machine has a cheap appearance, being made out of plastic, and I am wondering if Singer makes a model with all of the new features, but also with their former sturdy construction.

I did like the convenient storage in the base of the machine,  the push-button reverse, and the ease of changing needle position, stitch, and pressure foot.  However, overall, I have not been satisfied with this machine, and, after working with it for two years, have given it to my mother.  I am now seeking to buy a model that will sew through more than two layers, and has a buttonhole feature that works.  I recommend spending a little more for a better quality machine.",2.0
"*** UPDATE 03.2014 ***

I have had this machine almost 10 years now.  It's still go some real quirks.  I can't make the buttonhole attachment work at all.  It has some issues from time to time with sewing that seems like the feed isn't working properly.  Cleaning it helps a little, but doesn't solve the problem.  I have done a bit of sewing with it over the last 10 years and it still mostly works for simple straight seam sewing.  Some day I'll replace it, but overall, I'd say I got more than my money's worth out of it.

***Updated Info***

I will post the update BEFORE the review I posted a while ago.  I think it will be more helpful that way.  The problem that some people are having with this machine might be the same one I had.  The booklet has a misprint in it about the type of bobbin this machine uses.  It says it takes a class 15 bobbin.  This is NOT true.  The real bobbin type needed is a class 66. And I must say, to Singer's credit, their customer service department has been very nice throughout this whole ordeal.  Once the bobbin mix-up has been cleared up, I have no complaints with this machine. I'll leave the first review here, in case anyone has similar problems to the ones I had, so you'll know how to fix it.  Everyone with problems should check their booklets, it might be attributable to same misprint in the fold out pamphlet, page 9, in the parts list section.  Use class 66 bobbins, not 15s.

***Old Review***
I have been sewing for a LONG time.  I've always used Singers.  My first sewing machine was my grandmother's 1902 pedal model.  There have been numerous sewing machines in my past.  This is by FAR the worst one I've ever had the misfortune of trying to use.  I HAVE followed all the istructions for threading both the top & the bobbin.  This machine will not maintain it's tension.  It starts out sewing a seam beautifully, but at random times during the seam will change its tension from too loose to too tight and back to normal, thus producing a totally unusable seam.  No adjustment seems to make it happy.  It does this regardless of thread or fabric involved.

The main trend I've noticed in the reviews here:  the novices to sewing think this is a great machine.  They obviously have little or nothing to compare it to.  The people who sew more have less good things to say about it.  It's a very easy machine to learn to use.  It would be nice if it actually worked once you've learned how.  It only sewed properly for me on 3 garments.  After that, it started having it's problems.
  Personally, I've not had a problem at all with the automatic threader.  It's one of the few things that works correctly on this machine.  It's certainly less frustrating than actually SEWING with it.  The bobbin winder works fine.  It's not difficult to thread.  I have had a problem getting the thread to go into the bobbin case slots, it's very difficult to get in sometimes.

Overall, I wish I had not wasted my time and money on this machine.  It's been more frustrating than productive.  So far, it's produced only 5 pair of pajama pants & 1 Halloween costume, and most of that was accomplished with much coaxing and constant adjustments.  The decorative stitches don't all work properly either.  If you've sewn in the last 10 years, or sew regularly, buy something else.  It's a cute machine, colorfully different.  Sometimes being cute isn't what matters.",2.0
I agree...don't trust Singer.  My machine never sews a good stitch and the bobin continuously falls out it's case causing huge loops in my stitching. I contacted them and got a standard e-mail- they didn't address the issue at all and didn't offer a suggestion or solution.  $199 down the tubes!,2.0
"My daughter purchased this with her own money. Looks very neat, but a sticker making machine from any scrapbook store functions much better. Rather than applying the adhesive to the back of the material being sent through the machine, a clear plastic layer is applied to the top, and stuck to another paper layer on the bottom. Thus one needs to ensure that there is a border left around the sticker created to keep the top layer adhered to the bottom layer. Very poorly designed. I have also not been able to locate any replacement materials, so the machine becomes useless in short order.",2.0
My daughter got this for christmas.  It isn't great.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  It is difficult to figure out.,2.0
"Hello Kitty Sticker Maker
My four-year-old daughter received this for Christmas and was unable to play with it without some major assistance from me.  The idea is a good one, you make your own stickers out of virtually any teeny little picture by inserting them between sticky tape and sticker tape.  You crank a little handle and the picture slides through (if you're lucky) and is now sandwiched between the tapes and a sticker is born.
Unfortunately, the sticky tape and the new stickers have a tendency to get jammed in the slot where they exit when finished.  This happened our first time out and, because we didn't realize what was happening, my daughter turned the handle far too many times and the paper and tape turned into a crinkly mess.  I managed to fix this with scissors but we were left with very little sticky tape after the ordeal (the set comes with a very skimpy roll by the way).  The next few tries were met with varied levels of success.  Many of the stickers did not come out smooth.  ""They're bumpy mom"" ~ my sweet child cried in dismay after our third lame attempt.  Also, if you do not line up little pictures one after the other you will waste a lot of this precious tape.
This product is overpriced for what you get, if you ask me.  The sticker machine, the two teensy rolls of tape, a few little cards, a sheet of Hello Kitty printed paper (this is cute), a Hello Kitty stamper & ink pad, stencil, scissors, four cheap crayons, and a storage bin will give you about one hour of frustration.  To make matters worse (and up my frustration level to new heights) there was no reorder sheet enclosed in my box for the tape rolls so I have to go on a search to find rolls that'll fit.  More likely though, this toy will end up on a shelf collecting dust.
My advice?  Save your money and buy yourself a roll of clear packing tape and some self-adhesive backed paper instead.  You'll get similar results without all of the aggravation.",2.0
the only reason i give this 2 stars is because I expected to get a blue colors scissor and a magenta colored one arrived.,2.0

"Being unable to pick a color is ... less than desirable particularly when they send out gender specific colors (and no, colors should not be considered gender specific, but society being what it is and public schools being what they are -- so then you have to go to Target buy another set of scissors because the ones you bought online won't do, and the whole reason you bought online was because you have disabilities that make it hard to shop in the normal way in the first place.

They specifically recommend formica, but I don't have any!

Also, nothing here says I can use a 100% cotton t-shirt, but I couldn't find white cotton/poly blends.

And this doesn't apply to me, but they do not put this on the package and I think it's pretty important.  This paper will not work in HP Deskjet 1200C and 1600C printers because they apply heat.

I understand simplicity of package design, but they are missing some critical info.  It dupes people into buying what they cannot use.  But then, maybe that's the point.",2.0
"The transfer paper was eazy to use. It looked really nice when the shirt was made. Throughout the day it started to look terrible. It was wrinkly on the shirt.

"I bought a plain white cotton flat rim hat to use these on... And it turned out horrible.

"I followed the directions, but my shirt didn't turn out well.",2.0
"I just really hate any light fabric transfers, way to thin. i prefer dark fabric transfers",2.0
"There are a couple things one needs to know before purchasing these. First thing is the back is very hard to remove after applying the iron. I've had mixed results with these papers. Some turned out good. Some terrible. The paper backing is very hard to remove after ironing on the transfer. I followed the instructions exactly and still had trouble every time. I found wetting the paper a little helps rub down to where the backing can eventually be pulled off but that process is very messy, time consuming and still may not work. Third is the background of these papers are white. If you plan on transferring letters to a colored piece of fabric the white background will be behind them unless you cut each letter out separately.

I've noticed that Cricut and silhouette sell printable iron-on transfer papers. I'm going to try them next time. If you find something that works well stick with it and avoid these. These are a hassle and give mixed results at best. In my opinion they are only good as a last resort. As a matter of fact I had better results with the Iron-ons that Avery makes for dark colored fabrics. I would try those on light colored fabrics before I'd use these again.",2.0

Peels quickly after washing it. Doesn't hold up well.,2.0
I found these really difficult to use. Followed all the instructions precisely and still had a very hard time getting them to stick well to the shirt and when peeling off the backing large portions of the iron-on design came off.,2.0
"I've tried other brands, and this one was the absolute worse. There are times I had to go over the paper several times for it to stick to the shirt. After that, I had to be careful removing it because sometimes it wouldn't stick.

Consider this a one time use. After washing, my effort was pointless. Cracking, peeling, and change of color of the transfer where ink wasn't applied. I'd look for a different alternative.",2.0
Followed directions exactly. Even after hand washing the letters started to peel off.,2.0
"I just now got around to opening this to use it. Product said 6 sheets, there were only 5 in the package. I waited too long to file a claim.",2.0
"They do not print very well. The transfers for dark fabrics works a lot better.
This one tends to melt in the printer and the transfer is distorted. It works if you are going for a vintage look, but I found it wasted a lot of ink as well as time and effort.",2.0
they don't always stick down on the edges and when the shirt is worn the design stretches and breaks. Cheap and good if you only wanted to majke a few shirts.,2.0
cracked and peeled after one wash,2.0
"I would never buy these again. They printed beautifully and after lots of HARD pressing on a HARD counter top (not an ironing board) they adhered well to our t-shirts.  However, they are peeling off after the first washing. Just way too much effort for a one and done. Total waste of a perfectly good t-shirt. Bummed.  And, yes, I followed everyone's tips and tricks.",2.0
Followed the directions on washing and they all faded. One cracked. :(,2.0
While these worked. My pictures were all blued for whatever reason. The pictures I needed it for were pictures of my daughter. She was in while onesies in all of the photos and one I ironed on the transfer they and her were a light blue. Pretty much ruined the project and I had to find another way to get the result I was looking for. Wouldn't buy again.,2.0
Transfers peel off despite being ironed on really well. What happened to the quality Avery?? I used these to make a shirt for my husband's birthday and it didn't survive being washed once. I suspect that you can't dry the shirts all the way after these transfers are applied. Maybe Avery should make that more obvious in their instructions and advertising. The older versions of this product worked just fine.,2.0
Transfers work great. But the color on the back of the paper ironed on to the shirts and ruined them,2.0
They were ok they left a white shading all across the back of my short and started to peel with in two months of wear.,2.0
Left strange lines in the iron on when using it. I even followed the instructions exactly. So disappointed with this product.,2.0
"This was kind of sad because we were excited to transform some shirts. It worked on some and not on others. Also, on some shirts it started to peel after the first wash. I would buy something different next time.",2.0
I ordered this thinking that I would apply it over the cork bulletin board that I already had up.  The item was shipped without any shipping protection and I received it bent and partially destroyed by shipping.  On the bright side the seller refunded my money immediately.,2.0
Not good.  Ordered 2.  Only used 3 times.  One of them is falling apart.  Legs getting stuck and/or not receding.  Rubber tips on legs do not grip well and fall off.  You are lucky to find them.,2.0
Found the lower legs to be a bit flimsy. For being a Heavy Duty unit it has NOT impressed me at all.,2.0
"This would be good for my class but it is too lightweight and my flipcharts keep falling off, and the board too.  I wish it were a little heavier in weight.  So disappointed but too late to send back.",2.0
great product but this is a deal killer. We only used a few times. Purchased in April. Easel's now don't work properly and there's nowhere on the amazon website to purchase or request replacement pieces.,2.0
"I was not impressed with this item!
They are typical crayola crayons but the numbers in the box were WAY OFF!
We had plans for these, we needed the equal numbers that were listed on the box but we got assorted crayons. Some colors had 16 while others had 53.",2.0
I was very disappointed in the condition in which the crayons were delivered.,2.0
"The box was a mess, crayons were just thrown in, not what I expected.",2.0
"WARNING:  My purchase several months ago did not have the correct count in about 9 of the 16 colors.  There were up to 9 missing in several colors.  There were excesses in other colors.  If you are dividing amongst the same group of kids, this could be a problem.  Crayons don't color as well as they used to--they seem to more waxy with less pigment in my observation.",2.0
crayon count is not correct...some colors are missing as many as 11 crayons.,2.0
"I am giving this review two stars instead of only one because this package did arrive in a very timely manner. Unfortunately, the product information specifies that there are 50 units of all 16 colors, making a total of 800 crayons. As I was putting together supply bags for my classroom, I noticed by the end that I had very few of certain colors and more of others. I definitely only received 40 green crayons but had more than 50 of other colors, such as orange. Just be aware that the count might be incorrect, which might not be a big deal for most. When you are trying to divide them evenly among students, however, this can cause a problem.",2.0
It didn't stick to the cloth for photography backdrop long enough. Maybe it was not sticky enough or maybe I bought the wrong kind.,2.0
Sorry this is not waterproof Velcro.  It does not last outdoors.  Was not impressed.  I have replaced this material in the same spot at least three times.,2.0
I used them to strap a battery to the frame of an electric bike. one strap broke the first time I used it.,2.0
"actually these were terrible. they were ""low duty""...meaning not heavy duty!!! In fairness i don't think they make any claim to be heavy duty. So just realize if you have a heavy task or need to pull hard on the strap...it will break. The velcro grip will hold but the rest will rip.",2.0
Not very strong... mine tore when I tugged it a little too much recently.,2.0
"compare with the price, not stronger as I think",2.0
break very easily,2.0
"I needed a cinch strap to mount  some equipment, but the gripping material is only on a short piece on the end so it does not grip very well.",2.0
The velcro fell off the end the first time I used it. Once i fixed the  product it was  nice but I had to sew the velcro end strip back on.,2.0
"The description clearly says ""Velcro USA 90440 Velstrap Strap With Handle, Black"".  I received the right product, Velcro brand, item 90440, but there are no handles on the straps.  At under $7 (for 2 of them) they are not worth returning.  They are good straps though, so I will find a use for them, just not the one I intended them for.",2.0
"I do not agree with the other reviewers for the 5 star ratings. I will try and prove my point with a detailed comparison.

I'll compare the Velcro Velstrap, Upto 50 lbs, Black (90482) 6ft to a Strap A Handle 6ft(SAH) .

The products are the same listed lengths. They do the same job, but they work very differntly.

There are 5 big differences:
1. The built of the handle
2. The orientation of the handle
3. The way the belt is tightened
4. The working length of the strap
5. The price

First the built of the handle: The Velstrap is just a piece of belt. So it is not comfortable to lift something heavy. The SAH is a nice cushioned tubular handle. So it is much better to lift long and heavy.

Second, the orientation of the handle. The Velstrap is oriented in the direction of the belt, while the SAH is oriented at a 90 degree angle. This matters because most of the times you will tighten the belt around the short side of the item you want to carry. The 90 degree angle gives you the best hold when carrying.

Third is the way the belt is tightened. The Velstrap uses velco, which holds well. The SAH uses two metal buckles that lock when the belt is tightened. This also holds good.

Fourth and very important is the working length of the strap. Because of the way the belt is tightened. The SAH has a better efficiency regarding working length. With the SAH you only lose about 2"" of the total length. With the Velstrap you lose about 10"". This is a major difference in favor of the SAH.

Fifth is the price. The SAH is a bit more expensive but it is really worth it. The SAH is a much better product for only one or two dollars more.

I hope this review helps you out to make a good decision.",2.0
Backing is not as sticky as I hoped. Tried using on the couch to keep the cushions from sliding off. Didnt really do the trick.,2.0
The glue backing is a joke. Velcro is strong. Need to apply hot glue or epoxy to get make it work,2.0
does not work well on porcelin,2.0
"A 5 year old can rip this off, I agree the velcro is very strong but the glue on the back of the velcro has been pulled of by my kids on many occassions, if you leave this in a humid room you will see it peeling of the walls.",2.0
It's resistant but not enough for natural and synthetic fabric. The product is advertised for that purposed but it doesn't work.,2.0
I bought the velcro to hang a mirror on my bedroom wall. It worked great but then I came home to a shattered mirror on my bedroom fl.,2.0
"After reading the reviews I had high hopes that this could hold my amp controller( less than 1 pound) to my dash with no problems. After applying this product and walking to the back of the credit to start adjustments of my amp, I came back to find it in the floor as the sticky tape is not sticky at all and will not even stick to a smooth dash section for longer than a few seconds.

Would not buy again. Threw away all of it, will find another option.",2.0
The Velcro is very strong. But the adhesive on the back-side is not. So you end up ripping the entire thing off. It defeats the purpose.,2.0
"I'm not sure what exactly they mean by industrial strength, but it's definitely not the adhesive on the back of the strips. I bought this to keep my duvet from slipping down inside my duvet cover, and the glue didn't even hold for three days. So if you need these to really hold onto whatever you're sticking together, plan to reinforce with sewing or another heavy adhesive, because whatever they used on this product sucks!",2.0
Does not support 10lbs. I recommend reinforcing the adhesive with super glue and perhaps puting what ever got sticking it to in a vise,2.0
The velcro is about ten times stronger than the surprisingly weak adhesive. This had a difficult time keeping a simple surge suppressor mounted on the back of a wooden night stand - failing completely after less than a week.  Ironically it took a huge effort to separate the two velcro halfs from one another.,2.0
"The velcro parts start detaching after some time, and it's not even under heavy load. Just a USB hub attached to the back of the monitor.",2.0
"The product was not ""sewable"" on fabric and not advertised as such.",2.0
Product is over priced.,2.0
I like. Wider more versetle 3-4 months later can  not unhook  grippers with out separTing adhered  surface  so it connects two surfaces toghter but it's permanent  The hooked sides hold better than adhesion just a one time use not what I expected  but see reviews here. It's a tough connector if two surfaces are just connected  to separate and use again  won't work  the hooks god so well it. Breaks the adhesion do can't be re adhesed  To bad. For multiple use,2.0
I should have gotten double sided carpet tape. Kept any how.,2.0
Doesn't stick well to Leather. In my case waste of money.,2.0
did a decent job sticking to a table edge to show banner,2.0
"Nice quality, but be sure to read the dimensions.  It looks like a small childs seat.  I wear a size 6 pants and my bottom hangs over the edges leaving me to feel unstable sitting on it.  I would return if I had saved the box.",2.0
"This product has excellent strength glue and you can tell is quality.

But it is a total scam, because they give you 2/3 as much of the hook-side as the loop side, leaving you with extra hooks. I'm trying to process the logic of this, but coming up empty.",2.0
Didn't hold what I needed it to hold. Could have been the texture of the item but that's why I wanted heavy duty. Just left a gooey mess,2.0
"The velcro is good, but the adhesive can't even hold a 1lb item securely. 2 stars total, unfortunate.",2.0
Definitely not what I would could industrial strength. Weak at best.,2.0
Not sticky enough on the back relative to the width of the Velcro,2.0
not as i wanted  i read product wrong or mis lead---???????,2.0
didn't work for what i used it for,2.0
Glue just will not stick.,2.0
"The adhesive backing for this velcro is not very heat-resistant. I bought this to mount a white electronic toll transponder to my windshield to try and black out the backing so it wouldn't be so noticeable when viewed from afar. The glue on the strip melted the next day in the sun and I found the transponder stuck to my driver's seat where it landed. That was pretty hard to clean up. I then used this to mount the crossover units for car speakers under the guts of the dashboard in my car because I figured that being in the direct sun was what messed up the glue. Well, today it finally climbed up into the 90s and I found that the adhesive for the velcro mounting my crossovers had melted as well. It doesn't matter how good the hook and loop portion of velcro is if you can't keep it mounted to the surfaces it's holding together. I got Scotch All Weather fastener tape instead, which has stood up to months in the sun without any issue.",2.0
I put it on my freezer door to hold it shut (it tends to pop open when the refridgerator is closed) and it only lasted a few weeks before not sticking anymore.  Maybe it is just the temperature in my garage that is effecting it but it did not work at all for me.,2.0
"Very usless and still in the box of a grab ,just pay the postage",2.0
"I bought this product to attach a lightweight cargo holder in the trunk of my car, but the adhesive will not stick to the fabric liner inside the trunk.  Although the Velcro itself is of good quality, the adhesive is not strong enough for my intended use.  Before purchasing this product, I advise that you first consider the type of surface to which you will be attaching the adhesive.",2.0
"Ive used this twice and I have to say, it can barely hold up a 8 oz charger. NOT industrial strength so use this for VERY light things.",2.0
"I bought this product on the strength of it being industrial grade.
Sadly it did not measure up to it5s description, after two days use it started to come unstuck.
Had I known this would happen I would not have purchased it.",2.0
"I bought it to use on my dashboard in the car. I'm in the Seattle area, not a terribly warm climate and any of the velcro exposed to direct sunlight on any given day just wrecks any sticking ability it had. It just makes a mess of things. Need to get something better for this use. Used indoors works as it should.",2.0
"Great colors, very thin paper.",2.0
This formerly 5 star construction paper has become a cheap faded version of what it used to be.  I would rather have them raise the price for the better quality it was a few years ago than buy this thin floppy faded paper for our school.  No longer good enough for our needs. What a disappointment.,2.0
"I was expecting more vibrant colors but these are very dull neons, almost like they've been fading in a cabinet for a decade.  This is typical rough-textured (compared to colored printer paper) old school construction paper but honestly the least vibrant colors I've ever experienced.  I would not recommend this paper and won't be buying this brand again.",2.0
I am an art teacher so I am familiar with various brands of paper.  I have Tru-Ray Pacon in my classroom already and was expecting the same quality. IT WAS NOT!  The paper was already faded and flimsy.  I bought red and blue for a specific project in school colors but these are all going in the recycle bin.  This paper was an add-on at a very low price and now I know why.  Proceed with caution.,2.0
very faded,2.0
"The paper was exactly what I wanted, but the box was all bent up and the top of the roll was bent to the side.  All of the paper has a crease across the top.  I needed to make a bulletin board, so I had to use it when it arrived.  My board has wrinkles all across the top.  The paper would have been fine if the delivery process had been more careful.",2.0
Very good quality. Unfortunately my order had a white streak down the middle of the yellow paper.,2.0
Arrived damaged - tube was bent in multiple spots so the whole roll was wrinkled,2.0
"It had a crinkle right in the middle, many feet into the roll",2.0
A lot of the glow sticks did not turn on or they did and they broke within 2 minutes.,2.0
"Love the color and quality of the paper. However, the whole roll of paper had a bend in it. So, when I put the paper on my board, there is a wrinkle all the way across, and it can't be smoothed out.",2.0
My hands became black after touching this paper,2.0
"I thought I would be using it as a hip and cute paper but it's actually really dark, like the tree bark color",2.0
It was like wrapping paper.,2.0
i didn't expect such a dark brown on one side and white on the other. Was expecting brown paper.  Planned to use for xmas wrapping next yr but might not work due to dark brown color.,2.0
"this is not 4' wide.  It's more like 8"" wide.  so my purchase caused me extra work.",2.0
"Larger than I expected, I was unable to work with the big size.  Had to send back.  Cost to ship back, item ended up costing more than it was worth.",2.0
"Based on the photo, I expected thick paper with a robust, red color. What I got was thin and desaturated. I had hoped to use this for Christmas present wrapping, but this sickly color is unworthy. Anybody need 200' of poor judgement on my part?",2.0
"Tears and scratches easily.  Have purchased other Pacon papers and was more satisfied with those colors.  However, did the job and covered the wall.",2.0
Thin.  Lighter weight than the 20lb paper in my printer.  It is double sided color.,2.0
"It is typical bulletin paper so it serves it's purpose. However, when I put it up in my classroom the black rubbed off on my fingers and it ended up getting on my bright colored boarders.",2.0
Slightly faded looking. Plenty wide & long enough. Got the job done,2.0
"We ordered blue paper, but we received a green roll of paper and a flag poll.",2.0
The paper is a very green teal. I was looking for something to match our branding and needed it a truer teal.,2.0
Paper is very thin and not what I was expecting for heavyweight paper.  Less than the thickness of 20# copy paper.  Also the package looks like it was returned and the roll is not tight when it arrived.,2.0
It is alright.,2.0
I bought this to use to make book jackets and without reading the reviews.  Its much thinner then expected.  The middle of the roll slides out and doesn't slid back in very well.,2.0
The paper is fine. But ordered black and just received red.,2.0
"2 out of the 4 packages I bought were not sealed, so they had banged up edges.  Not what you want when you are starting a project with a fresh piece of paper.",2.0
Did not realize that the paper size would not work with a regular US printer :-/. Unable to use for the reason I purchased it,2.0
"I read that this could be used as wrapping paper and trusted it - that's my bad. This is regular butcher paper that you probably used in high school to make posters and stuff (too see-through for wrapping). I didn't use it to wrap gifts, but may use it to cover tables for craft projects and things.",2.0
"Dull color but good paper weight, however tears easily. Looks faded by sun. Not great.",2.0
This is equal to fax paper. It is not heavyweight as described. Its lightweight and tears easily.,2.0
"The paper was fine, nice weight.  But unfortunately I didn't check to see if the order was correct until I opened it for my project.  I received a roll of white instead of black.  But it was too late to return and I needed the paper for a project so I had to re-work my design and change my color scheme.  Shame on me for not double checking.  It turned out to be a waste of money.",2.0
"This paper is black on one side and white on the other, I needed it to be black on both sides.",2.0
it was white on the back and I wanted it to be brown on both sides,2.0
I thought I was ordering lime green paper as it appears in the picture.  The box contained a dark green paper and it was too late to return the item.  Be sure to check the color as soon as it arrives.,2.0
Slightly moldy smell and not very thick. Had to double wrap my gifts that weren't in white boxes.,2.0
"I was hopeful that this paper would work for some gift wrapping projects I had planned. Unfortunately, the cardboard box it was shipped in somehow got bent in transit and my roll of paper now has a 6"" long section that is crumpled and wrinkled. I am using it anyway, but wasting a lot because I have to cut smaller pieces to avoid the wrinkled section. These tubes either need a cardboard liner tube so that they don't bend in shipping or a sturdier box. Or maybe I just have bad luck. The paper is okay to work with, it doesn't cut easily for wrapping gifts though. I think the description of ""art paper"" is true. I might just let my kids have it to draw and paint on. I wouldn't purchase it again.",2.0
I was rather disappointed with this product only because I had specific use in mind it was not fit for that use.  I bought to use as wrapping paper after reading reviews it was thick enough to cover boxes.  I was so disappointed when I sat with my stack of gifts and could see right through the paper :(  I did not return this product because I have three art crazy children so I'm sure for that purpose it will suffice. Packaging and delivery were good,2.0
Not to be used as drawing paper....it's really thin,2.0
"Truth to this order.. its paper

 NOT ""HEAVYWEIGHT""
NOT 2 SIDED FINISH

cheap cheap thin almost parchment paper.  this is not the thick 2 sided finish i have had in the past from other people .  WILL NOT BUY AGAIN",2.0
"This paper is a lot thinner than I expected. I was planning to try to do paper flooring with this, however, the paper is too thin and see through. And since it is white there is no contrast between sheets of paper. Actually, because it is so thin, when you overlap it looks horrible because its much whiter in the spots that overlap. You would have to make sure the flooring underneath is white as to not have this happen, but then you won't see any variations at all which makes it pointless. You mine as well just use white floor paint and call it a day.

All aside, as mentioned, the paper is somewhat see through. I cant imagine using this for too much else, other than for scrap paper for spray painting objects on, wrapping things / packages, etc....but isn't that what news paper is for?",2.0
Was not the color they show..,2.0
We used it for a poster and the paper tears very easy.  It is extremely easy to rip and you have to be very careful with it.,2.0
Has not changed our water quality,2.0
The paper is like a faded black not a pitch black and not a nice background for our bulletin board.,2.0
a lot thinner paper than I was expecting.,2.0
"I don't know how to contact customer service to let them know that this paper is puckered and a lighter weight paper than the paper we have recieved before. It also lacks the smooth finish. We already cut some and are under a time crunch as we are making over 20 backdrops for an event in three weeks but this paper isn't the product we ordered, even though the labels on the boxes are the same. Either the manufacturer has changed their product or shipped a different product.",2.0
This is listed as heavyweight paper - but in fact it's a similar weight to regular printer paper. Transparent and wrinkles easily.,2.0
"This paper is not what I would consider heavyweight.  I'm highly disappointed, as I was planning to use it as wrapping paper -- but it's too translucent.  Even with two layers, you can read a movie stub through it.",2.0
"I ordered this paper as a backing for a school tree project.  I do love the color - it's a rich purple color - however the weight of the paper is rather wimpy.  When I googled the product, it was described as heavyweight.  I'm time bound to use this paper, but if I had a more leisurely project timeframe, I would have returned it.",2.0
"The paper was fine but the color was not at all the color I was looking for, so I was disappointed.",2.0
"Bought the paper to make garment and accessory patterns with and, while it's low priced for the size and quantity, the paper is very thin. I find it similar to butcher paper which I use for making moc-up patterns with, and I'll be using this for the same purpose. Purchased to make finished, sturdy patterns that will be used many times but it's not suitable for that. Thinner than typical printer paper.",2.0
I collect stitch pattern books so responded to an ad that this one included many new ones. Actually this was the cause of some disappointment for meas i foundfew I would want to use.  Otherwise it is pretty standard.,3.0
"This was the second sewing book I purchased, the first one being The Complete Book of Sewing by DW Press which was too overwhelming (covered every technique with one well written brief explanation and photo but lacked step-by-step details and photos...more like an encyclopedia).
I am a complete beginner and while Teach Yourself Visually Sewing did provide step-by-step instruction and pictures that were helpful to cross reference to the other book, the explanations exclude important details and their briefness makes them unclear so you to have to re-read them several times before understanding.
Overall this book was helpful (had good sections on types of needles and threads and hand stitching and some better illustrations of techniques than most), but the writing could have been better.  The section about hemming was horrible/worthless (skip it!).
Here comes the diatribe:  I cannot believe the number of ""complete"" and ""beginner"" books that don't bother to properly explain how to mend and take-in and shorten garments which is one of the main reasons folks buy a sewing machine initially.  I guess I need to buy yet another book that does explain this...the Singer one(?) or the tear apart and reconstruct type sewing book(?).  Also, why is it that no one has written a decent teach yourself beginner book series that includes everything you need to know in spiral binding with appropriate descriptions AND illustrations (forget about the projects, that can be book 2)?",3.0
"I have sewn most of my life and was hoping to pass some sewing knowledge to my daughter.  Since I don't claim to be any great expert on all aspects of sewing, I thought she would benefit from a good sewing book. This book does cover many things,  more so than some books, but I found some of the explanations too short for a beginner and many of the pictures are hard to see due to fabric and thread color choice. I had to reread some of the instructions more than once to understand what was being explained and I already know something about these things. Since my daughter is old enough to use this book on her own, I feel although it may be a decent reference, it is not the perfect book to learn by. I'll keep looking.",3.0
"The visuals really guide you through every step of the process, whether you are a beginner or just rusty. I recommend it as a refresher course.",3.0
"Complete and easy to use, pictures are clear enough to see exactly the machine parts and understand the instructions of how to proceed sewing a garment.",3.0
"I'd hoped that this book would cover things a bit more comprehensively, but it turn out that it's a bit basic.
Nice photos tho, just not as involved as one would expect.
I would recommend New Complete Guide to Sewing (Readers Digest) and DK's The Complete Book of Sewing New Edition. They are both terrific.

"Book is only 4x6 inches. Only 46 pages are mazes to do. The pages in the back are an answer key, not that you would need one. These are meant to use when traveling.",3.0
These Dover books are of very small dimensions.  Only get them if you are looking for an activity book to take along in your purse.  It may not hold the attention of younger children.  I would recommend them for ages 6 yrs. - 9 yrs. old.,3.0
These are very small books I thought they would be regular sized work books.,3.0
"The kids really enjoyed this paper, however they wished there were more sheets of the smae color for bigger projects.",3.0
The paper was fine. I used it with a basic origami book. My group of 7 kids went through it all in about an hour. It probably would have been a better value if I bought it at the local craft store.,3.0
"It was not quite what I expected, bit it is my fault for not researching more thoroughly. I thought it would be stained glass patterns when it clearly states it is a coloring book!",3.0
"The paper is standard origami paper, very light weight and flexible and comes packaged very well.  My husband had ordered this for me because I use Origami at work to teach teens patience, persistence, and teamwork.  I bought this to add some different colors to the mix of things.  The colors were bright and shiny and the origami turned out wonderful.  There just was not nearly enough paper in the pack for the price.  Other than the price, it worked great.  Just beware that some of the folds are a little harder to see where the foil is shiny rather than normal origami paper that is matte.",3.0
"For one thing, don't be fooled: this is a package of 18 sheets of 5 7/8 x 5 7/8 in. paper. It comes in 9 colors, which is nice, but this can be found in any large craft store, in more colors, larger sizes, for less money. For example, at Pearl, you can find 24 pieces of this same metallic paper, with more colors for about $1.95, and you don't have to pay for shipping, like if you order them offline.",3.0
"A great book, jammed with interesting textures and ideas. I was disappointed that there weren't many charts, because I find them so much easier to comprehend and to knit from, but otherwise this is a fascinating addition to my library.",3.0
"Some of the charts are very nice (for me.) I do not like that some of the blocks are colour-only and lack a symbol.

This is problematic when there are many similar colours called for in a chart. I also feel that this book is too expensive even on Amazon.

(Note: I checked this book out from my local library.)",3.0
Best,3.0
The problem with this book is that charts are in color and because of my eyesight...I need to enlarge the charts which makes them difficult to read and to mark where I am when sewing. The designs are good but I would like more dragons to place on sweatshirts!,3.0
The patterns are really pretty. The paper is like wrapping paper. Not for me but maybe for someone else.,3.0
"The paper is glossy, which I didn't expect.  So, when creases are deep, they get white.  If you're making a crease as a guide, but don't intend to keep it folded in that position, don't sharpen the crease or it will turn white.

"I loved Donnas book ""Millefiore Techniques"".  This book,  Creative Surface Techniques, while it has some good/great techniques, was not as "" new"" or fun as I had anticipated. Donna is phenomenal and so inspiring that I recommend the book anyways.  She has so much to teach and does it very clearly.",3.0
I bought this book because I wanted actual brand names for the products used in various polymer clay techniques.  Although I'm sure it's very self-serving of her she does mention what specifically to use and that made starting with clay much easier  and I'm sure cheaper in the long run than just guessing and the hobby store.,3.0
This book is a very good book for people who already know how to work with clay.  It was to hard for me as a beginner.  Alot of pictures and no instructions.,3.0

"This is the 13th book in a series of annual Christmas books by Gooseberry Patch.  It is okay, but not my favorite one.  Lots of yummy looking recipes for the holidays.  The shipping time was good.  I thought the price was expensive being as it is 2 years old.",3.0
"I received my book on time,but it was just one small thing that bothered me. There wasn't a thank you note inside the package,no invoice.",3.0

"Not much new for recipes, and I love to collect and try new holiday recipes, so I've sent the book back to Amazon due to the lack of new recipes. To be fair I have plenty of cookbooks to choose from so it's getting more difficult to find something new.

There are some creative and crafty gift ideas you can make, if you like crafting. The book is good for crafts and not so much for cooking.

A good portion of the book is pretty much ""Here, do it yourself because we don't know what to put here,"" for all the various holidays and such. I didn't think it was well organized, and a lot of the questions just didn't apply to my dog. I'm still relatively happy I bought it, because it gives me ideas to make my own, better book like this.",3.0
The book was purchased when my dog was young. I hardly read it but it is a cocktail table book that is attractive and a piece of interest.,3.0
"I'm happy the other reviewers enjoyed this book so much but it sounds like they were able to complement it with videos and demonstrations.  Without those, I find the book less accessible than some other books.  The quilts are pretty.  But I would think that the specific title would be honored in the book: look at the cover.  There are diamonds.  Maybe I'm too picky.  But I paid the full retail price.  You'll like this book if you buy it for less and already know a little about quilting.",3.0

"A small online fabric exchange group I belong to decided to do a 12.5"" block swap.  I got the Autumn Star, p. 9.  This block although it's 41 pieces should have been pretty straight forward as it used HST's squares and a rectangle.  I discovered that consistently block CEF was up to 1/4"" off, upon checking, rechecking and checking again my measurements and seam allowances were not off.  What is off are the measurements printed in the book.  I finally corrected by adding 1/2"" to each pieces dimensions.  For the 12.5"" block  Piece C I adjusted to 3"", piece E I adjusted to 3"" x 5"" and F was adjusted to 3"".  Once sewn together this then needs to be trimmed down.  I suggest trimming down to 4 3/4"" or 4 5/8 inches until you see how it is going to fit into the block.  Another tip is to do 4 CEF's and 4 mirrored CEF's at the same time using the first one of each as guide to trimming it up then compare it to the mirror to make sure you trimmed it down so it will fit together accurately. A huge disappointment considering the cost of the book.  I also pressed to the dark side after not liking the messiness of the open seams.
Pressing seams open seemed not to make a huge difference in the block being smaller(shorter) by 1/8- 1/4 inch.",3.0
ok,3.0
As a beginner some of the blocks I have made before and have done quite well but someme of the blocks have a lot of pieces in one block. 41 pieces would be a time consuming and a bit overwhelming for some beginners. I will keep this book for future use once I have better skills.,3.0

Like many others who have reviewed the 4-in-1 tool I was a little disappointed that the tool itself was cheap and nasty feeling and that the lids fall off easily. I also found that the lids can be difficult to put on (in particular the stiletto end - the stiletto isn't 100% straight up and down and the inside of the lid doesn't allow for this). I expected better from a product endorsed by such a big name in the quilting arena.",3.0

"I hardly know how to rate this book.  So I'm compromising between its best & worst features.  If it weren't for the errors in it, I might have made it a 4.

So here are the not so good things:
1) the plethora of errors, especially important in the quirkier designs.
2) the disjoint between title & contents, which seems a trend in knitting books lately.  The book is purportedly about the connections we observe between math & nature & knitting.  To an extent it is that.  However, in too many of the designs, any connection between math in nature & the project is tangential, at best.  The work of fiber artists has always reflected nature's inspiration.  One expects something more than a wavy line reminiscent of twigs in a book that promotes itself as looking for math in nature.
3) I truly hated some of the projects.  Too many were baggy, boxy, no fitting, looked to be poorly knit in terms of fit & drape.  My problem was not that they were ""over the top"".  To the contrary, a lot of them were just nothing great.
On the other hand, some of the projects were just bad, awful designs, for garments neither functional nor beautiful.
4) I really, really hated the colors.
5)The knitting techniques were pedestrian, to say the least.  designs that could have made good use of circular knitting, various cast ons, etc., do not.

OK, so now for the good things.
1)There were 3 designs I liked a lot, just as they were shown in the book:the basalt tank, the Hex coat, & the roundabout leaf tank.  I also liked the spiral scarf, though not in the color or yarn shown.  Still, that design has promise.  To my mind, the book is worthwhile just for those.
2)I also liked some of the design elements, especially in the fractals chapter.
3)Finally, the book was thought provoking.  I like designs that had unusual constructions, and the book does have a few of those.  Some of the ones that I found otherwise ugly did make me think of possibilities.
4) The basic theme of the book, reflected in a few of the designs, was an interesting one that I'd like to pursue.

It is a shame that the book could not have been more carefully put together.  The starfish shawl, for example, has an interesting basis (though hardly original).  It could have gone places.  Instead, it resulted in a garment that surely no one would wish to wear--both impractical & ugly.  The swirled pentagon pullover is a fairly traditional sweater, with an interesting yoke.  But it is shaped badly, doesn't fit the model well, & the neckline is surely no knitter who doesn't want to be accused of the ""loving hands at home"" look would produce.  The ogee tunic is a lovely design--but the unshaped, baggy garment with ill-fitting shoulders obscures the design possibilities.

Truly a shame.",3.0
"This is an interesting book. Some of the garments are a little ""out there"", looking like stuff you'd only see on a fashion runway, and not something anyone would choose to wear in real life (unless they lost a bet), while others are stunning and have me itching to cast on right away.

My one major complaint with this book is that most of the patterns have the smallest size at 36"" bust or larger. I don't consider that an extra-small. For a coat, that's okay, since you usually want a bit of positive ease for it to fit over your other clothes, but for a pullover, it's just too big. If you're a petite woman like me, you'd better be good at being able to resize patterns, or you're going to end up with a lot of pretty tents. I'm a fairly experienced knitter, so this is not a problem for me, but it would be very frustrating for a beginner.

Most of the patterns are charted, so again, not for a beginner. I was also surprised by the lack of waist shaping, or with the fact that the round-yoked sweaters had the lower pieces knit flat and seamed (why not just knit the whole thing in the round?) Many of the sweaters also had no finishing on the lower edges, but were left to roll, a look I find unflattering on nearly every body type. Again, all these things are easy to modify if you're an experienced knitter, but would be very frustrating for a beginner.

And as others have mentioned, there are a lot of pattern errors. I found an errata page on abebooks website, and it was mindboggling how long the list of errors was. When I purchased this book new from Amazon this year (December 2009), I got the second edition, so most of the errors had been corrected, but there were still a few. So definitely search out the errata before you begin to avoid frustration.

All in all, I'm glad I bought this book, as there are at least four garments I definitely plan to make from it, and perhaps more in the future, but I'm also glad I didn't buy it at the beginning of my learning curve, before I learned how to downsize garments, or I would have been very disappointed.",3.0
"I love this book from its pictures, but I read the reviews here and checked out the errata sheets on the internet. Here is a link from the publisher to correct the mistakes.

[....]

With the availability of corrections, I'll buy this book. I rated 3 stars because I had to give a rating, not because it means anything. I really like her pieces and probably will rate this book higher afterwards.

As for errata being present, it is somewhat hard to edit even easy knitting patterns, so I am willing to cut the publisher some slack with these odd modular designs.",3.0
"At first glance I felt that the composition of Knitting Nature is a bit weird, I still cannot see all the relations between the patterns of nature and the knitting patterns.

A bit disappointed I put the book away, but to my surprice -- when I took it out to review it -- I found that I had placed markers on several of the patterns. I especially want to knit the Target Wave mittens and the scarves. Living in Norway we are in constant need of warmers and it brightens up the winter day with unusual patterns and variety in colours. I also like the womens sweaters in different forms and decorations placed in unusual places on the garments. Maybe the book will be one of my favorites. I haven't tried it yet.",3.0

"My initial read of the book wowed me. I've long combined my own love of math with a passion for knitting so I felt instantly at home with Norah's approach. The book has inspired me to incorporate some of the concepts into my own designs. However, I don't recommend attempting to knit directly from the patterns. They contain so many errors that it's clear no one tested the patterns before publication. This is very disappointing for such an expensive and beautifully designed book.",3.0
"I bought this book because I'd heard that the patterns were outstanding. A brief perusal of the book would seem to confirm this. Gaughan's construction methods are innovative and exciting...as long as you are making her women's patterns. Almost all of the sweaters for men are drop-shoulder sweaters, which is a little disappointing. It is still a great book and worth having...just not for the men's patterns.",3.0

The shawls are very simplistic in this book...it would be good for the beginning knitter...many of the shawls are plain stockinette until you get to the bottom of the shawl where you knit a bit of lace patterning that I've seen elsewhere.

Product arrived on time and in good condition.  The tool is very similar to all other color theory approaches.  Compact enough to carry in your purse when purchasing material.  However I think a book on Color theory would be more helpful.  A small color wheel from any art store would provide the same information.  If you do  not have any color tools this might be a handy beginners tool.  Will keep and perhaps if I find it not useful will give as a gift to a beginning quilter or artist.,3.0

"My husband put the lamp together which was simple.  The magnifier is great and the light never gets hot.  However, the lamp disconnects from the base all the time.  It could be made better with some screws as you cannot move the lamp unless you hold the bottom or the pole disconnects and you need to be very careful when putting back together as the cord gets in the way.

I've had the lamp for about a month and it just stopped working,  We also put in the batteries but it still won't work.

I can't find any instruction booklet for it either, I don't think one was provided.

As for functionality, the lead doesn't break, they are easy to sharpen, and I like the triangle shape when coloring (though sometimes it's a little awkward).

I probably wouldn't buy these again.",3.0
"Several pencil points arrived broken (5 out of 12, to be exact).  Pencils are decent, but I am not as pleased with these as I thought I would be.

"I'm a big fan of Moleskine notebooks and I really like the idea of this notebook. My biggest issue with it is the thickness of the paper. It is really thin to the point that I think it will be a big problem if you write with ink, it will bleed through and ruin the next page.",3.0

"I love the whole concept of the film journal, but I dislike the ""cast"", ""quote"" and ""awards"" section. I don't usually remember that many people that was in a film (to fill up that whole space) and that many quotes! I certainly don't know what awards a film got all the time too. To fill those spaces, I end up having to search for them online and it just makes me wonder what's the whole point of having a journal if I'm just copying down stuff I find online... I would of liked it better if it were more opinion based (if I make sense), like ""why did you watch it?"" ""Favourite/least favorite character"" ""Favorite/least favorite scene"" etc so I don't need to search for anything and can just write it down on top of my head.",3.0
"I agree with the other reviews that the Diet section is majorly flawed. I love the Journal, and it is perfect in all other respects, but I'm not sure what the practical reason was for only allotting 29 days worth of diet tracking pages, especially considering that approximately half the book is blank so you can customize as you want. Moleskine should have made the blank page section far smaller to create more space for the Diet section. You can go online and print blank diet pages to then paste/tape into the book, but what a chore! I guess that is what I will ultimately have to do, but unless Moleskine fixes this issue, I likely will not repurchase.",3.0
"The journal is generally well thought out with lots of useful sections and enough space to customise to suit your own 'wellness' activities.  The section that hasn't been well thought through and that really spoils this journal is the 'Diet' section - each page is for a day but there are only enough pages for 29 days.  In contrast the exercise log has enough spaces for about 120 days and the personal goals covers 12 months.  I really like the journal, but it definitely needs a rethink about the time period it's intended to cover. If the time period was better thought through it would be a 5 star product.

The journal is organised as follows:

Planning - 2 pages with columns for event, date and notes
Seasonal foods calendar split into northern and southern hemispheres, covers 4 pages
Food facts (calories, carbs, protein and fat) over 3 pages with a further 2 pages to add your own foods and info
International clothing sizes, 1 page
Measures and Conversions, 2 pages

Named Tabbed Sections:
Personal Goals - 6 pages of weekly goals, 4 pages of monthly goals, 5 pages of breakthrough moments
Exercise Log - 29 pages with 4 sections per page with columns for date, exercises, time, distance & reps, workout notes and places to input the intensity and weather
Diet - 29 pages where each page covers a day and has areas for breakfast, morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner, night snack and notes
General Health - 6 pages each for: vitamins, herbs and other; healthcare; body therapy.
Games/Sport - Similar in look to the exercise log with with columns for date, event, participants and result/score with areas to rate the challenge level.
Inspirations - 20 pages with a space to write the title of the inspiration and the rest of the page is blank.

There are then 6 unnamed tabbed sections for your own personalisation.
There is an index at the back and a double pocket on the rear cover which contains 3 sheets of stickers - some for personalising the unnamed tabs and some for decorating the pages of the journal.",3.0
"I just got my Wellness Journal!  Before buying it I was kind of frustrated that I couldn't find photos or a more in depth description of the pages (the bookstores in my area didn't have it in yet), so before I start using my journal I'm writing a quick review.  This would be a 5-star rating IF the first 3 sections covered the same periods of time (goals section = 1 year, exercise section = 116 days, diet section = 29 days).  This is a big enough flaw to me that I'm considering returning it.

For those still interested, here's what's included:

Food Calendar - Shows you what fruit/vegetables are available during which months of the year (both Northern and Southern Hemispheres)

Food Info - Gives some basic info for 7 dozen common foods (cal, carbs, protein, fat) with 62 blank spots for you to fill in your own (you can set the titles in this additional section to whatever you want, i.e. points, fiber, etc).

6 Labeled Tabbed Sections:

1. Personal Goals - within this section there are 3 types of pages: weekly goals, monthly goals, breakthrough moments.  There are rows for up to 54 weeks (9 weeks per page).  Each weekly space is enough to jot down a couple of sentences.  The monthly goals start in January and end in December.  There are 3 months per page, enough room for about 5-6 sentences.  The breakthrough moments are blank versions of the weekly goals.

2. Exercise Log - 29 pages with 4 days on each page.  The column headers are: date, exercises, time, distance/repetitions/workout notes.  There is also a place to fill in intensity and cute little pictures to select the weather that day.  If you're looking to fill in 4-5 workout items that'd probably fit, but you'd have to write little.  If you're someone like me who wants to write, ""Walking, 30 min, 2 miles, tired"" then this will work well.

3. Diet - 29 pages with 1 day per page.  This seems kind of dumb to me.  Why would you only have 1 month of diet pages, 4 months of workout pages (assuming you workout everyday) and 1 year of personal goals.  AUTHOR/EDITORS: Could you please fix this!  Terrible, terrible design flaw.

4. General Health - 3 subsections, one for vitamins, herbs, other, one for healthcare, and one for body therapy.

5. Games-Sport - If you regularly play sports, this section allows you to record it: date, event, participants, result/score, challenge level.  I don't play sports other than the Wii so I'd probably alter this section.

6. Inspirations - Blank pages to put people, places, photos, quotes, songs...

6 Blank Tabbed Sections - 12 pages each

Index where you can fill in the title for the included pages (all of them)

"Great idea by Moleskine, but the alphabetizing aspect is lame. Six movies per letter of the alphabet? Right. You couldn't fit the Star Wars saga on the S pages soon, and if you did, what happens when you want to write up Spectre? It's a silly thing for Moleskine to have done to what is otherwise a very nice journal. If I decide to keep it, I'll ignore the alphabetizing factor.",3.0
"I had hoped that it contained more room for goals, and lists.  It is a beautiful Moleskine as always, it just didn't offer the content that I was looking for.",3.0
"I bought this to keep track of my diet and workouts.  After unwrapping the notebook and thumbing through the pages I found that there aren't enough days in the diet portion for a full month.  While there is a full year of weekly goals and monthly goals.  So the portion of the book that I will use will get filled in quickly leaving the rest of it unused and wasted.

I would strongly recommend going to the Moleskine website and looking at the previews they have there.  I wish I would have done that before I made this purchase.  If I did I would have purchased the 12 Months - Passion Planner - Wellness instead.

The quality is good and will be useful for the most part.  Just wish Moleskine would get rid of a few pages from unnecessary section to add in more pages to the diet section to make it more of a monthly book.",3.0
"After reading the description of this journal, I was expecting a bit more. But there isn't much space for writing, not very many details, kinda small. it isn't terrible, really, but I was just hoping for something a little bigger, a little more detailed.",3.0
it doesn't have a lot of entry space for you to write anything for meal intake. I was pretty excited about it but I just didn't end up using it. I just use a plain moleskin instead.,3.0
"I'm extremely active and under the exercises, I have super small to fit in all of my reps, workouts, and times.  I pretty much had to revise a whole bunch of things.",3.0
"I purchased this for my wife, who was thrilled to receive it.  Her appreciation for the journal is tempered only by its brevity as it is only good for 30 days.  If it were a 3 month journal, we'd gladly give it five stars!",3.0
"In this computer age I was looking forward to a journal for my fiance to track the lifestyle changes she was making. Unfortunately I was disappointed by the organization of this journal. It does have some nice qualities.

Pros: Beautiful cover, my fiance loves carrying it in her purse, multiple ribbon bookmarks to keep your page in each section saved, and she loved the customizable stickers that came with it.

Cons: The Diet section is far too short. With a day taking up a whole page you don't even have one month's worth of pages. These pages would have been a lot more useful than the ""Games & Sport"" section.
The goals, exercise log, and general health sections are fine. The inspirations section is great for her but may not be applicable to those that aren't into storyboarding their visions that way. The blank sections are plentiful which helps to personalize the journal for the individual. However, that being said, it wasn't enough to steer her away from tracking the same things on an app for her phone instead.

Bottom line: It depends on what you are looking for. It may be right for some people, but it wasn't for my ""Wellness"" fiance.",3.0
So much wasted space. Highly recommend using a blank moleskine and setting it up with the info you want.,3.0
"It doesn't offer a lot of room to write unless you are a very neat and meticulous writer with extremely small handwriting. But even then, because I am that kind of writer, it still isn't enough! It would have definitely helped if it was lined, even if it had to be more narrow than college-ruling. I've unfortunately stuck to half-sized notebooks that I can get for $1 at CVS because I don't care if they get dirty and I can add all the notes and modifications needed to new recipes and developments. I can see this recipe book being great for final recipes that have been proven tried and true. Now if I can figure out how to get this in a printer...",3.0
"The planner is really great quality!  It has a durable cover and the inside offers plenty of boxes for little notes/ratings/time/wine pairings.
However, there are things I don't like about it.  For one, the book has a total of 234 pages in it BUT ONLY 45 pages (front and back) are actual recipe pages that have the ingredient lists etc.  (54 pages if you want to consider the cocktail section a recipe page)  My ingredient list on my recipes are longer than the box given to list them in.  I think if they got rid of some of the other side boxes/sections on the recipe pages, then it could allow more room for the instructions/ingredients.  That's really it as far as the cons.  It would also be nice if they offered other colors than the black.",3.0
I was hoping for a cute little journal to keep my favorite recipes but this seems more like a blank journal. I wouldn't pay so much money for a blank notebook.,3.0
"good design, but the paper is really thin...
a little disappointment about the quality.
it's fine, but not as good as I expected.",3.0
"I loved the concept but it needs at least one extra page per recipe.  Unless its a quick recipe, it will not fit.",3.0
"Really great concept--excellent place to collect all your recipes--but the pages are so thin, the ink bleeds through and the pages are easily damaged. Since the journal is essentially for use as a cookbook, I was disappointed in the paper quality. If you're a neat cook (HA!), I highly recommend. If you're like me... maybe go for something more heavy-duty.",3.0
"As a film enthusiast, I will be saddened when I have to pick only 6 moves per letter of the alphabet (Six entry slots per letter),
However, aside from that, the book looks great, nice matte with some gloss film/movie tools design all over the cover.
Of course, being a Moleskine, the book feels sleek and intellectual. It is the most right environment to keep film notes, techniques, maybe shots and angle, all written down in one elastic band kept notebook.",3.0
"I've used Moleskines a lot over the past decade, usually for personal journaling. When I saw the new line of Passions Moleskines, I was excited to have a journal dedicated to my particular hobby. I'm very pleased to have it, and have already started using it and personalizing it to meet my own needs, but there were a few minor disappointments. The paper quality isn't nearly as good as regular Moleskines. It's much thinner and not as smooth, and ink bleeds through and is pressed onto opposite pages. The paper quality is hands down my favorite thing about Moleskines, so this was really disappointing to me. One of the tabbed pages was also slightly damaged.

Overall, I'm looking forward to using this, but it just doesn't live up to the same high quality as other Moleskines I've used.",3.0
"I got this book to write down my favorite recipes from the new ones i try.
I found the first sections wonderful, the sections where its actually printed (ingridients, instructions, cooking temp...and more) however half of the book is empty,.... which bothers me. Also the pages are very thin, so you can see writing from the previous page. I do like the page that are printed, they give you alot of choices for your recipe.
overall its an ok book, that i will use to put in recipes that i like. However once its full-- i will transfer the recipes to a better book or maybe type them up and make my own book.",3.0
"Appearance is nice but I found it far too small for my handwriting.  The binding is also too tight for it to lay open.  If you can write very small, you may be able to get a simple recipe on one page.  Many of my recipes take several pages.  I've decided to make my own book with desktop publishing software and a 3-ring binder.",3.0
"I loved the idea of this journal and did keep it after reviewing it, but It does need some help.  Only half of the journal is pre-printed with pages for recipes. You have to write very small to make a recipe fit on one page and the paper is so thin that the writing shows through so bad that you cannot use the next page. The second half of the journal is nothing more than blank pages. It would have been nice if these pages could have been put to better use like the first half of pre-printed pages for recipes.

There are also some stickers provided for your use in the journal, which is good, if they made any sense at all. Most of the stickers make no sense at all.

The Recipe Journal is very well constructed and a good idea, but this one is a very poor design.

This Recipe Journal would be perfect for someone that is going on a trip and likes to pick up recipes along the way.",3.0
"Nice idea, and I like the overall feel of the journal.  But like others here have said, the page format is a bit restrictive.  Now that I have the book in my hands, I don't like the tabs at all -- I would want to put most of my recipes under just two or three headings, and if there are tabs, I want to be able to move pages around between sections.  To me, a ""journal"" suggests that recipes should be entered as you make them, rather than as a catalog -- otherwise, why not just get a basic recipe organizer? I also agree with others who've said that the extra blank pages at the back weren't in an especially handy format.

Looking back, I probably would have been happier just getting a blank journal and customizing it.",3.0
Sturdy cover to protect this Movie Journal.  The journal is well organized to catologue all of your favorite films.  There is ample space to write down memorable details of each film.  The journal also looks great on a book shelf or would look nice sitting out on a coffee table.  Recommend for Movie Buffs like myself.,3.0
"This is a small format journal 5 1/4"" x 8 1/4"". There are a total of 12 tabbed sections each of them can record 16 recipes. 6 of the sections are already identified as Appetizers, First Courses, Main Dishes, Side Dishes, Desserts and Cocktails.

Each page in that section is printed with the recipe journal template that divides the page into pre-labeled sections. About 1/3 of each page is taken up with sections to note difficulty, servings , preparation time, cooking time, cooking process, wine parings, notes, and 1 to 5 star rating. I would prefer not to have that space on each page dedicated so I would have the flexibility to include only the information I feel is necessary and have that extra space to record the recipe or notes. The note section is 1"" x 1 1/2"", too small to be practical and I don't need a dedicated section to record whether the recipe is prepared in an oven, microwave, or stovetop.
The cocktail section has a different template and includes sections for alcohol content, servings, ideal occasion,tools, suggested glass, decoration, rating and notes.
If you are not able to print neatly in a very small font, 8 -10 point you would have a hard time using this journal. The small journal size will also limit the length of the recipes you could include.

The six tabbed sections that are unmarked also can record 16 recipes but those pages do not use the recipe journal format the pages are divided horizontally into 5 equal sections.
Inside the back cover is a two pocket accordion file where you will find some pages of stickers. Two pages of them have stickers intended to use to identify the unmarked tabs or you could use them to reassign the pre-marked sections. The two other pages one red one grey include stickers like love this!, hate this!, great tip! best ever!

They do include a section at the end with the page numbers so you can create your own index. There are two pages at the beginning of the book to list events with dates and notes. Also a seasonal food calendar and 3 pages with nutritional information of misc foods and a ""Useful Measures and Conversions"" page.

At the Moleskine web site you can print out a .pdf of 4 blank recipe template pages or you can type in the recipe into the template and print it out. No way to add photos though and you can't save the filled in .pdf on your computer you can only print it out.
When typing into the .pdf  it will let you add unlimited information, a scroll bar will show up on the box you are typing in but none of that additional information will print out so if the scroll bar pops up you need to edit and remove words until it disappears.

There is no way to bind those pages into your journal so you would have to tuck them into the pages loose or put them into the accordion pockets, or paste them onto a blank page. I cut the templates out two pages side by side, folded in the center and used one of the ribbon page markers to hold them in place.",3.0
"This ""recipe"" journal is not just another recipe holder.  When they call it a journal, they mean they expect you to write out a whole page on how the recipe went over for your dinner party, what you served with it, how you prepared it, etc.

If you are a serious cook who hosts dinner parties fairly often, and you like to think of each meal as an experience, then you may enjoy having this journal for keeping track of your best  recipes.  Each page has templates and suggestions on what to write down, what to keep track, etc.  It is the type of thing that could be handed down generation to generation once it contains all your secrets for your best meals.

In the back cover there is a pocket containing stickers you can use for tab dividers, and other things.  There is also some sort of guide on measurements included.

My only beef (no pun intended) was the writing was too darn small!  If I were to describe it in terms of font size, it's about an 8 or 10 point font. Pretty small for my middle-aged eyes to read.",3.0
"The Moleskine Passions Recipe Journal is a well made diary sized (5""x8"") notebook printed on medium/light weight acid free paper with 240 total pages. It contains sections for most typical areas of cooking; Appetizers, First Course, Main Dishes, Deserts, etc. plus several unlabeled sections for the owner to personalize. In addition there are weight, measure and temperature conversion charts, produce and fruit harvest/ripeness charts, food information charts and sections for notes, event or party planning. The cover is cleverly embossed with kitchen utensils and includes an elastic strap to keep the journal securely closed. Also included are three handy attached bookmarks and an expandable pocket in the back which contains the two sheets of stickers (for personalization) that come with the journal.

The pages for recording your recipes have limited space for writing, you'll need write carefully and small to fit most recipes on a page. The pages are not removable and pages cannot be added or moved around. The print in the book (charts, tables, etc.) is nearly microscopic. I found it very hard to read anything in the journal. As well the current and recent prices listed here on Amazon make this a very expensive and hard to justify choice.",3.0
"***
These little post-it type notes are very classy and tasteful, in earthy colors instead of the ordinary pastel tones of regular stickies. There are quite a few sizes as well--I like them. Each of the pads you can see in the picture has 20 stickies, so there are eight pads of the very small stickies (2 pads of each color--pumpkin, mustard, olive, and gray), four pads of the oblong stickies (1 pad of each color--pumpkin, mustard, olive, and gray), four pads of the medium rectangular stickies (2 pads of mustard and 2 pads of olive), and two pads of the large rectangular stickies (both are pumpkin in color). All of them are a dull white on the reverse side--the color is only on the front of the stickie.

I am disappointed in the cover, however, since it is not a heavier Moleskine cover or softcover folio but a black lightweight paper folio with ""Moleskine"" stamped onto it. I think that Moleskine missed an opportunity here to have a quality cover with refills; such as they are, I would not purchase them again. If you are looking for some nice stickies and don't care about the cover, these will meet your needs. As such though, I think they are quite overpriced.

Recommended only if you are buying these for the colors and variety, not the cover!

It takes several attempts to get the HP Iron-On transfers to work.  I've tried a few different types of transfer paper and although these HP Iron Ons don't work perfectly they're still I think the best of what I've used.  I used my ink jet printer to print a JPEG of my image and after many attempts was able to eventually get a decent copy onto one of my cotton shirts.  The image fades after maybe 10 washes. Applying the right amount of heat and especially the length of applied heat from the iron is key.,3.0

"The tie dye kit gave me lovely colors which totally would not take on any fabric except cotton.  The parachute that I tried to dye was still white after I dyed it.

"The first one of these I had the trigger broke. I exchanged it for another, so far so good. This gun is well made and I was sure glad to see a heavy duty glue gun atlast. And hats off to stanley for such a cool looking tool. It is comfortable in the hand and clearly well designed. But the price well...... It's just too much. I've heard the trigger malfunction is a common problem. Maybe stanley has worked that bug out. I haven't had any problems with my replacement gun. This baby sure puts out the glue volume and heats up real quick. The dual temp is a nice feature also. the auto shut off takes some getting used to but it will extend the life of the gun.

"the fold out stand is junk. cheaply made, not well attached, I needed to fold it up to get it out of the way and then it is awkward to get down again. An unattached stand would be way better. Although it will be easy enough to make one.  My other major complaint is the rubber guard around the nozzle. It is too big and almost always in the way. It is easy enough to remove and then you have a nice long nozzle. I feel that it's an okay gun but it's way overpriced.",3.0
The glue gun works great until you use one of the extension nozzles. Having a nozzle fall apart in the middle of a project is quite an experience. The aluminum nozzle expands much more than the copper extension tube which allows the copper tube to fall out into the middle of the hot glue. They should be made of the same material. This is a safety hazzard.,3.0

I was disappointed when the new shears arrived; the design of the shears has definitely changed over the years.  The shears are closer to 11"" long (rather than the 10 1/4"" they used to be and are listed to be).  The handles are heavier and larger, meaning the pivot point is further down and my cutting surface area isn't as efficient as with the old pair.  This was a noticeable problem for me and my smaller hands.  The new WISS shears are definitely more unwieldy than the old pair overall.  The old pair is marked as ""Made in USA"" - no such mark on the new shears, and I wonder if this is why the quality isn't as satisfying.

"one reviewer said it was just like the ones made years ago....I have one made years ago and this one is NOTHING like it. The one from years ago had much better steel and thicker too. It also had a metal cap so you could tap it with a hammer and it had an audiable ""ping"" to it when tapped with a hammer which sounded like quality. The old one also had a larger wooden head. This new one does not have any of those features. It is also made in .....you guessed it ""China"". It's not just Stanley who are sending their tools over seas and to Mexico. But that's a different story. If you want a ""cheap"" awl to get by...this is it, if you want a quality awl...look somewhere else.",3.0
"So dull it wouldn't scratch pine, had to sharpen it.",3.0
"Different than pictured, but seems okay. Worked well to start holes in dry wall to hang some items. Made in China, not USA as in the picture.",3.0
"For the price I paid I did not expect much. The metal cap did come off but I took care of that with some rubber cement. It's now a good functional awl. However this is NOT the older USA made ones, these are your typical ""made in China"" awls.",3.0
"I bought this awl after my old Stanley (69-122 USA) that called my toolbox home for nearly 20 years decided to do a walkabout.  I don't have to tell you how versatile an awl can be and I'm sure you understand why I replaced it right away.  The first time I used this one the metal collar slipped off.  (I wish there were an emoticon for rolling your eyes.)  I can't attest to its other qualities because I gladly gave it away after my original awl became so homesick that it resurfaced, to a very warm welcome.",3.0
The metal cap has come loose. This does not affect its functionality.  I will glue it back in place with silicon. Otherwise it works well.,3.0
"The handle fell off day one...

I wasn't even using it, in fact I didn't use it at all prior to it falling off.

I glued the handle back on, and it's fine... But it shouldn't have been an issue..",3.0
"I guess it's partly my own fault for looking at the picture instead of reading the product details. This is NOT made in the U.S.A. It looks nice enough, but the shaft doesn't go all the way through the handle and now that I've read some other reviews I see that it will probably end up bent or dull before too long, which doesn't surprise me. I'm honestly not one of those guys who require that everything be made in `murrica - in fact, for most things I don't even look because it doesn't matter. But when it comes to basic metal hand tools, if they were made by anyone but Americans or Europeans then you are headed for disappointment every time. This is just an awl, and it only cost six bucks, so I'll keep it for now and I won't be heartbroken when the handle breaks or the point gets dull too quickly. And next time I'll take a closer look at the description.",3.0
"The old one has the metal rod running through the handle so that you can strike it with a hammer without worrying about splitting/damaging the handle - this one has the metal stopping short and doesn't protrude out the top... inferior design? Time will tell, but the old one also says ""Made in the USA"" on it and is dark blue in color. Oh, and the 'point' was ground off center... I think Dean Martin could have done a better job grinding it after a night of drinking with his Rat Pack pallies. I think next time I need a scratch awl I'll just buy a phillips screwdriver and grind my own point on it. Disappointed the once great ""Stanley of New Britain"" tool manufacture's name has become associated with cheap China made junk.",3.0
"No joke, the first time I used this, silver metal part that slips over the wood handle portion came off.  Just slid right off.  Kind of disappointing, however, with that said, the product doesn't even need that little piece of metal to still be 100% functional.  For the money, this is a fine product.",3.0
It worked great but broke quickly.,3.0
"Very hot tool for basically BURNING woods! This requires a very hot temperature to BURN.
Many people seem to get confused & used this tool for other purposes, plastic melting, soldering, etc.
Soldering for electronics, e.g., needs much lower temperature,
 else, the tip literally burns & break, the solder won't stay covering the tip
(tip oxygenates quickly & expels the solder, no silvery tips).
The soldering tip is long, can break at high temperature.

This is the 2nd unit I bought, not quite used this one to give full review,
  but I had use this before with TEMPERATURE CONTROL which I made.
This is indispensable part of this unit.
I made up another one yesterday, spending about $13+ at Home Depot.
Light dimmer cheap one $7, electric box(1900)/suitable cover, receptacle, electric cable($1.50),...
It is very easy to make a good temp control w/o electric knowledge.

Anything other than wood burning, you need to cool down the temperature,
  else you will ruin your tool & work sooner of later.
(for very hot work, only tip safe is the short tout, slanted default tip).",3.0
My tip broke off in mine after a week of normal use.,3.0
"I do like this knife, and it gets the included tips hot enough for working with plastics as I need. When using Xacto blades in the knife attachment, however, it just can't keep the tip hot enough for detail work. Only edge of the blade nearest the heating element gets hot enough to easily cut through the plastics I'm working with. Wish it had a bit more power.",3.0
Worked pretty well for the first couple days but the main tip I used wouldn't stop bending when hot.,3.0
"Product arrive quickly. So far it has worked OK. The pointy end of this knife tip does not get very hot, most of the heat is produced at the rear of the blade. The key is to draw a cut line on your fabric, place fabric over a board or long strip of wood and PUSH THE BLADE SLOWLY using the point to guide your way and let the back end of the blade melt the fabric. The fabric edges can also melted using the side of the blade to "" butter it "". Practice. If you are cutting a lot of fabric buy a better knife but this is a cheap alternative. I've cut about 100 ft. so far with about 40 ft. to go.",3.0
Purchased to burn designs into dried gourds.  It doesn't work well for this project.,3.0
"I've purchased two woodburning kits at Michaels over the last two days.  The first didn't didn't work at all and the second, one of the bits broke off in the tool and I can't get the screw piece out.  Overall I think these tools are unreliable.  I'm hoping the Dremel will be a bit more dependable because I really like the burning process and results.  If someone has a brand they like, please let me know.  rebeccaibb@aol.com",3.0
Useful but needs an On/off switch to improve its convenience.,3.0
"Never really wood burned before but I would think the tool has a lot to do with your experience. This is on the cheaper side and when heated, some of the attachments began to bend. Overall, the design is a bit akward if you are attempting to use as a ""pen"". I would go with something a bit more geared toward professionals but for a one-time job (as mine was) it gets the job done.",3.0
not higth heater,3.0
"Mehhhh, doesn't cut as easily as I expected (probably because it runs a bit on the cold side). I don't think I'd consider ever using this to solder.",3.0
I would have rated this five stars if there were more than one heat setting and the biggest default of this Dremel is that there is NO Shut Off switch.  I have to dig for the outlet to shut it off.  This is a Big pain in the *** because it is hard for me to bend or get on my knees. You would think that a tool like Dremel would have an on and off switch on the tool.,3.0
A little more heat and it would burn better,3.0
"It's not the tool, it's me - got burnt a couple of times.  It was hard for me to work safely when I'm working with small hobby items.",3.0
"Don't get me wrong, it may be just the thing for some. It was wishful thinking on my part. My application is to use it for removing instrument tops. It worked quite well for melting glue and really getting into a thin seam. Unfortunately, it broke after second use. If one comes on the market with a tougher industrial build, I'll buy it. For others (small model hobbyists) this may be for you!",3.0
It's okay. It does get very hot so be careful. I don't have a whole lot of uses for this but I can tell you it does work.,3.0
I like this tool but they say to cut foam with it which I did and it seems lethal. Too bad but smoking plastic foam is really bad for the lungs. A nice simple tool for other projects I suppose.,3.0
This is an OK item. Not as versable as they make it sound. OK for the price. Not too bad.,3.0
"I needed something with a little more power.  I was burning signs and the tip doesn't stay hot long enough.  I was using soft wood and noticed some moisture.  This could be the reason.  For small projects, this item may fit the bill.",3.0
"I felt this wood burner worked well, specially considering the price.
 I did find it difficult to hold at first (since the grip isn't rubber) it would have worked better if the grip lines they made were horizontal instead of vertical (straight up and down) my hand would get sweaty from the heat and slip causing me to burn myself, though I did get the hang of it.

it worked well for a small project but if you plan to use this seriously for multiple projects I would look around more and see what your price range is.
this is only well suited for a novice, as you cannot adjust the temperature.
but as they say you get what you pay for.

It worked well for what I needed and I was ultimately satisfied.",3.0
When I first got this product it heated up very well and stayed hot.  The different tips were very useful.  After maybe 4 hours of use (over different days) it didn't get as hot and I had a hard time finishing my project with a consistent heat created a uniform look.,3.0
"The product was delivered in good condition and recieved in a timely manner.
We could not use it for the job we wanted to use it on.  It created too much toxic smoke to cut foam for model train layouts.  Would be fine for some projects , but not for ours.",3.0
Made a major mistake while purchasing the tool is built to US specs & runs on 110 volts. Had to get a step down transformer to use this tool. Build quality is average. I guess thats what you will get for such a low price. Works well .,3.0

"liked that it is not battery operated
Didnt like the fact that it doesnt come with more than one engraving tip.",3.0
"Works, but isn't the quality I expect from Dremel. A flexshaft solution would be preferable because of weight and vibration, the unit is loud, the power switch is awkwardly placed and doesnt allow push-to-engrave workflow, speed control can vibrate to different settings, screw instead of collet to change bits, bits seat very long, about an inch or more from tip of dremel meaning fine work is harder to control. I would expect better from the dremel name.",3.0
Not really the quality that I was expecting for a Dremel product.  If you only need light pressure to write on something it is fine.  I bought this to replace my 35 year old Craftsman engraver that finally died.  The Dremel doesn't compare to the Craftsman.,3.0

"My husband and I throw an annual bloody mary party (you're welcome for that idea!), and he uses this to engrave glasses for our guests to take home. It works fine, but you're not going to make art with it. Luckily he's a bit of a cartoonist so his drawings are clear, but there's not going to be nuance or shading. We also couldn't get the included bit to work with the stencil - it seems to be too wide to fit in it. Also, and I guess this should be obvious, it vibrates A LOT. Your hand will feel weird and numb after a while, like 20 minutes. It's also super loud and makes a lot of glass dust, but those are pretty obvious too. I'm not kidding about the volume though, I'm sure our neighbors can hear it in their apartments.",3.0
Have issues getting the screw out to put the tip in.,3.0
"Wow. I didn't realize how loud this tool was. I saw it on video and thought it was loud, but not THIS loud. The first time I turned it on, I scared my cat (she freaked and ran away) and my ears were in pain after I turned it off. Didn't realize it was so loud I needed ear plugs. I have a cordless drill and the Dremel is probably 3x louder than my drill.

After preparing myself mentally for the noise, I tried the tool on a piece of wood. It does engrave nicely and I was able to write my name in cursive. However, it takes getting used to, especially on wood when you move the tool over the grains. Depending on which way you move, you'll need to get used to the tool so you know when to slow down or speed up to get over those grains. With glass and metal it will be different as they are smoother.

Unfortunately with the loudness, I won't be using it too much as my neighbors can actually hear me use it.",3.0
Doesn't really work as well as they describe. It's ok at best.,3.0

I have a hard time using it because it vibrates all over.  I need more practice,3.0
"UPDATE - after another 20 minutes of fussing with the screw holding the engraver point, I discovered the screw needs to come entirely out before the engraver point can be inserted and tightened.  Directions on that fact would have been helpful.  The engraver seems to work ok.  I raised by evaluations from 1 start to 2 stars for working properly for at least the first 10 minutes.  However, my comments below still apply.

FIRST REVIEW
Opened the package, need to install the engraver point with an extremely small screwdriver.  This small screwdriver is tiny and much smaller than most people would carry in their tool chest.  Then off to Home Depot to spend several dollars on a tiny screwdriver.  An hour later I am back home with my new screwdriver only to discover that for some reason, the engraver point won't stay installed no matter how tight I tighten the screw.  I now have nearly 2 hours invested in the product that is useless.  I am sending it back.  A couple of side notes:
1) Many sellers of products include unusual size tools in their packaging - why not include a 10 mini screwdriver
2) Only one engraver point?  Why not include a few others.  These probably cost the manufacturer a penny a piece!
3) How about a small cheap storage bag to store the unit, engraver point, template & instructions (that the manufacturer says to keep)
The one thing they did not forget was the order form to order more stuff.  This almost feels kind of like a bait and switch situation.  Advertise a product for one price, but to fully use the product, you need to spend more time and money.  How about just selling us a complete product.  I plan to avoid any ""Dremel"" product.",3.0
"I used this to engrave names on baptismal medallions.  It gets the job done;however, the end result is far from being ""neat.""",3.0
"It works great, but you may want to buy some ear plugs for this one its screams when you turn it on.. a lot louder than I expected it to be. If you can handle the noise it s great!",3.0
"Performs generally as described , works wonderfully - not very much variety for tips though .",3.0
OK,3.0
A bit bulky and doesn't seem to engrave as neatly and cleanly as my older model but should do OK.,3.0
"Very loud. If you buy this, invest in a pair of earplugs and some padding to put under your project. Still, makes a nice etching effect on resin, ceramic, and glass. Is not meant for cutting, sanding, etc (I was a bit confused when I purchases this). You do need a flat head screwdriver to change the bit.",3.0
Works great but very load. Get ear plugs!,3.0
"it was defective, but dremel sent me a new one. that made it ok",3.0
Works OK.  Wish it came with a case and an extra engraving tip or two.,3.0
"This is really loud.

It works, but ...

it's REALLY LOUD.",3.0
It is so loud. I was hoping to use it instead of a battery powered engraver I bought but it makes too much noise for me. I prefer to use my battery powered engraver even though that tool can only do so much on batteries just because the noise of this engraver bothers me.,3.0
"Engraver works fine, especially the variable speed.  Plastic template practically useless as the tool doesn't penetrate through the template deep enough.",3.0
This Dremel is incredibly loud and is a bit awkward to hold but if it's for items that you really are not trying to make pretty it's fine.,3.0
"Although this does a fine job of engraving, not only is it extremely loud, but it gives a ""fuzzy"" look.  When you engrave, it chips off small pieces around it so it doesn't look very smooth.  I bought this to help build my business, however, it's definitely not a very professional product.  Would be great for little personal things though!",3.0
"I own a few Dremel tools and, I have always been please with the tool and the results.  This one left me a little disappointed.  Engraving is hard.  You really have to press hard to get the result you want. (becareful not to damage the item).",3.0
"My first engraver, but it should come with a warning label about the noise level. You WILL want ear plugs!",3.0
This engraver has a little more power than the one I previously used so it was a little more difficult to hold steady.  The letter stencil that came with it was pretty useless since the tip would not fit in to it. It will take practice in order to able to use it  well.,3.0
"I was upset after receiving the engraver. I did buy this on Amazon only because it shows in the photo there is an extra bit. 1 in the engraver and the 2nd next to it. Even reading the description it doesnt clearly state that there is one or 2. I mean this is an engraver and the only way to use it, is with a bit, otherwise you won't be engraving anything. So why put in the listing that you're getting a bit with the engraver .... like its something special!? I mean is Dremel really going to sell just the engraver with NO bit!?

Anyway the engraver works well for the money but the on/off switch feels cheap like itll break if you don't baby it. Also at times when you go to turn it off the switch doesnt click into the off position even though its off. Be sure to listen and/or feel for the click when shutting off.

I have an older model that was made in the early 70s that is very well built to last and still works great and will no doubt last another 40+ years! This new one has a more hand friendly grip to it but is definitely made out of cheaper material that probably won't last 40+ years. I know most things we buy today are just throw aways when something breaks and that is mainly because they don't make replacement parts or the replacement parts cost almost as much as the tool itself.

I upload some pictures but Amazon likes to take them down and you'll have to click on my other reviews to see the pictures",3.0
"I bought this tool yesterday, I went to use it and I haven't been able to yet. It uses a set screw to hold the engraving tip in place. I haven't found a screw driver small enough to loosen this screw yet. I have gone through several. This should have a keyless chuck system or come with a screw driver. At least a notice on the packaging letting you know what you need in order to use it.",3.0
"I had never done any engraving and I'm not sure what I was expecting. I guess I thought it would be easier to do. I didn't expect to be a professional but I bought this one because it came with stencils and was highly rated. The stencils are worthless, they allow far too much play to make a straight line and the lettering always looks sloppy. I'll readily admit that could be me though.",3.0
I was really surprised by the return policy.  I had a problem and within days - I got a new replacement!  100% satisfied!,3.0
"A simple tool. It works. You could spend more, but why?  Having the ability to pt a quick id code on stuff is helpful.",3.0
"Dremel engraver works pretty well now that I have managed to get it working, and yes it does what it says, BUT knowhere have I read where you have to buy an adaptor (polarised) to be able to use it. Cost me an extra 20 to buy before I could get engraving. Also the adaptor was hard to find, after trying several electrical stores I was eventually pointed in the right direction. The information regarding an adaptor SHOULD be includer in the technical information, Had I known the eventual cost would be over 50 pounds I probably wouldnt have purchased this tool.",3.0
"I was hoping for a ""palm type"" engraver action...(strokes rather than rotations) to retrace my existing engravings on my lacquered brass saxophones. I had used a Dremel rotating drill before with bad to so-so results. This gave me the same bad to so-so results. Maybe it's the lack of REAL (shaped) engraving points available. If Dremel could offer them (if they exist at all), it may be a different story. I couldn't get the point bit (even the diamond tip) to cut smooth. It just wanted to jump around, giving a rough, rather crude look.
Too bad.... it was a waste for me.",3.0
Shakes extremely bad and is very loud but did work good and variable speed with the diamond bit is nice.,3.0
"I purchased the Dremel Engraver to engrave my woodworking projects. The balance of the unit was good,fit in my hand perfectly. After one hour of practice I was able to engrave one of my projects with ease. The letter and alphabet template that was supplied with the Dremel Engraver leaves a lot to be desired. After one try with the template
I gave up trying.

"According to one review on this tool, it didn't come with an engraving bit so I purchased the engraving kit.  It DOES come with the proper bit so don't waste your money purchasing the rotary tool engraving kit.

If you don't need precision letters, this tool is fine.",3.0
"I purchased two of the Dremel Engravers. I have used Dremel tools for years and have never been disappointed, this time is different. The screw that holds the engraving tip is so short and difficult to screw in or out that I have dropped it several times. The thread depth is two short to allow the threaded screw to get a good hold. And the tip I really need is for glass and while the one provided is passable for a few times it will not be servicable for the long term for the glass I engrave. Over all I am disappointed and would like a better solution for the engraving I need to do. JM",3.0
"When I received my engraver, I was all set to start engraving all our cell phones, ipods, etc.  Unfortunately, there were no engraving drill bits included (it came with a template, so I figured it would have at least one bit). They are purchased separately.  I wish I would have known that so I could have ordered at the same time and saved on shipping.",3.0
"Works great on soft surfaces such as plastic or aluminum. However it does not do much to hard metals and glass as it claims it does.  Works good for the money, just don't expect to be able to engrave your wrenches and it be deep enough that one swipe of sandpaper wouldn't take it off.",3.0
Engraver works just fine for the price.  The letter and number template included with the engraver is useless due to the fact the slots are too small for the engraver to penetrate to the surface.,3.0
The carbide tip is held in the chuck with a small set screw.  The chuck is low quality aluminum and the set screw tore out the threads of the chunk before it even started to tighten down.,3.0

It's good to have a decent scratch awl.,3.0
"The pointy end is sharp enough to do what I need done, but it doesn't taper - the photo makes it look like the end is long and skinny, which would allow one to poke a hole and then gradually enlarge it as the item slides up the awl, letting you choose how big to make the hole. That isn't the case: the pointy end is short and very quickly widens out to the diameter of the awl at the handle. It's fine for poking holes in a few layers of paper but there's no way to enlarge the hole, unless you want the hole to be fairly large.",3.0
"It is a little larger than I thought it would be, but there were other reviews hinting at this so I kept an open mind. I don't mind the size as much and it's good for putting holes in covers.",3.0
"The scratch awl that arrived had a larger diameter pointed end than what was pictured on the Amazon site. I would have preferred a thinner diameter scratch awl (like in the picture) with a less sharp taper to the point. Also, the point was not as sharp as I had expected. That was easily fixed with a few light touches on a grinding wheel. With a sharper tip the awl makes a good scratch line. But for scribing lines, the thicker awl with a short sharp taper to the point is not as accurate as an awl with a small angle on the taper.",3.0
"I wanted just the tip.  if looking for something as sharp as something that a dentist would pick your teeth with, this is not the product you wan to buy",3.0
"the metal portion of this awl is much thicker than i had anticipated, but I really think that might have been my fault for not fully reading the product description or the lack of a description.",3.0
"I was hoping the point would have been a bit finer, but I can grind it down if I'd like.  Otherwise its an ok product.",3.0
"I recently had this item ordered (same item number 818) and it was not what the picture shows.  The awl is not long and tapered into a fine point (which is what I need for book-binding), but rather has a short and stubby point.  I had to have it altered to work properly.",3.0

"So, at first I didn't really care for these. They were sticky and tacky and not at all what I had in mind. But I worked through them. First off, use water only for the cleaning process. If you want to thin the paint use the thinner that Winsor and Newton also sells. I ended up buying walnut oil to mix into the paint. It seems to do a better job at making this paint more fluid and less sticky. It was a much better experience! I felt like the linseed oil that you can get with these paints help but not as much and the walnut oil did.
Anyway, these are nice because most hobby store keep this brand in stock. You can use the water mixable linseed oil with regular pants and you can use regular oil paints with these paints.
Water mixable is nice because you get to clean up with water, no smells! Next time though, I'm going to try the Holbein Duos. I've heard good thing about their water mixable oil paint!!",3.0
"This stuff is okay. I wish I would have done my research though. I guess wn water mixable oil colors are actually some of the worse in the market, but they are the only ones they sell in stores. When I painted with these, I found them to be sticky and hard to move on the canvas. But clean up is easy at least. This was my first time using oil paints but I think after I use up these paints that I'm going to try the Holbein Duo brand that everyone is raving about. If you are thinking about buying water mixable oil paint, I suggest that you try the Holbein Duo instead too. People say those are better!
Edit: I found that using walnut oil with these helped the feel quite a bit!",3.0
"I give these paints three stars for being what they claim to be--oil paints you can thin and clean up with water instead of turpentine.  Otherwise, I was not terribly impressed.  The paints were very stiff and congealed coming out of the tube and required a lot of work with water and medium just to get the paint smoothed out and workable enough to apply to the canvas (ironically, I did like the fast-drying medium they make specifically for these paints better than the paints themselves).  I also didn't think the pigment load was all that great.  I've tried other water-miscible oils which were easier to work with, so I'll stick with those.",3.0
"Came on time, but the box was a total mess. Inside seems fine, but the box looks like it is old and used. Somewhat disappointed.",3.0
"Impossible to open the case. So frustrating.  I used my fingernail, coin, screwdriver. When opened it doesnt lay flat so wobbles back and forth. Takes time to get wrapping off of each tiny paint cube. Then takes more time to place in each compartment so they lay flat. Its definitely small enough to travel with. Id suggest getting a bigger one. This was a disappointing purchase.",3.0
"My pocket Plus version doesnt close. It's really annoying. The top just keeps swinging shut, and the water colors just won't lay open flat. The lid just keeps bouncing forward and even if I try to hold it down and slwoly lift my finger, it wants to keep moving. Not going to be convenient at all when trying to paint, and will be really awful if theres water on the pans under the lid and it suddenly swings and pours colors all over the pan. Really confused and can't seem to contact a seller.",3.0
"This product is much, much smaller than it appears. It is smaller than my cell phone and the brush is actually in two pieces and requires ""assembly"" because the paint box is just that small. The tiny packages of paint are doll-sized and impossible to open.",3.0
"I have the Deluxe Sketchers Pocket box which comes with 16 paints in a wonderful variety of colors. Of the three watercolor sets I have had, these paints are truly superior. The color and texture is impressive. The issue I have that gave this item three stars is the really lousy format inside the box. The separators are flimsy and fall or pop out constantly and putting them back into place is fussy. They bend even if they don't pop out so that the individual paints cannot stay in place. I will definitely buy this brand of paints again but never in this pocket boys format.",3.0
"Lovely kit, very nice. And great quality. But the colors available are a bit off.",3.0
"This is a nice kit. However I found the picture for the product looked more like an oil painting, but the product itself, the picture is more ""cartoon graphics"". Lots of tiny lines and details that need to be added after the printed parts are painted, makes this somewhat a tedious craft kit, and needs a patient hand and tiny brush. I like the picture, and the kit, but was slightly unhappy that some of the detailing and alike were not well presented in most sales listings for this item on various sites. I ended up giving it to my son to complete as my hands are no longer steady for those tiny lines.",3.0
This would be a lot better if I could find matching paint colors available by the manufacturer- It always takes me additional paint than what is provided to finish these no matter who manufactured the product.  The finished product came out very good even though I had to try and eyeball additional paint and mix them to match.,3.0
Very difficult! Definitely not for a teenager!,3.0
Hot air balloons -  A very pretty picture but some words of warning.  You have to do a lot of color mixing and there are a lot of fine lines in this picture that are very difficult to see.,3.0
"Don't pick this one if you've never done a paint-by-number before! I've done many, and I found this one rather challenging. The numbers are hard to read and some areas just aren't labeled at all. The numbering is weird sometimes too, like some areas will say ""21/36"" while some say ""26/31,"" and it's not clear if these areas are supposed to be mixed differently or what. I know from experience that the photo on the box doesn't necessarily represent what you'll end up with, but this one was really, really different. Large areas of the numbered kit are COMPLETELY different colors from the sample image, especially in the water part, so I basically ended up inventing my own color scheme for a lot of it. Also, all the tiny details of the ship's ropes and stuff aren't on the numbered image at all and I ended up having to draw them on with marker. I am fairly happy with my finished product, but this took a lot more work than any other kit like this I've done.",3.0
"The paint is OK. The color choices are a bit weird to me - I got cobalt blue and ultramarine, which are very close blues. I wish one of them is Prussian blue. The two yellows are too similar too.

The palette box won't lay flat on itself, so you have to hold it somehow, and that did not work out in a outdoor sketching scenario for me.

The size 5 portable brush looks nice, but somehow does not compare with Cotman brushes that I got separately. Brush does not come to a point, and the hair bend too easily from where it connects to the handle.

I wish I got the smaller sketcher pocket box version. I end up DIY a portable palette from tin candy box and using a waterbrush.",3.0
decent enough,3.0
"Not so good. The paints are opaque acrylic, and the final results opaque too. Not sure if the paint colors were adequately chosen, specially those of the sky. Definitively not close to the image in internet. The ships require a lot of detail (very fine detail, and you have to buy an extra brush (a very fine one). The sea was satisfactory, thou.",3.0
"The package was torn, and all the paint cups were scattered in the packet.  It was as if the package had been opened and then returned.",3.0
"Nice-----once you get over how you wanted to slit your wrists taking struggling with taking each color out of its slot (hard!), then more struggle taking the tiny wrapping off each one. Frustrating",3.0

This is one of the better Reeves paint by numbers. It turns out ok if you are lazy and don't want to use any painting ability.,3.0
There was not enough paint to complete the picture. With mixing the blues and the greens I ran out.  Is there anyway I can get extra paint?,3.0
"The paints on this set are very thick so be prepared to add a small drop of water. Although I put a small amount of paint on a plastic dish ( so I don't keep the container open)  the paints tend to dry quickly. Also the paint containers are a difficult to open, and I end up with paint on my fingers every time I open one. The instructions are not full size  so I had to enlarge it on the printer . The packaging could have been better. My sets arrived in a plastic mailing bag with nothing else to prevent the set from bending. The company could do better with that. Putting it in a box would be a good idea.
On the positive side, the paints do cover well and so far ( I haven't finished it yet) he colors are bright. The paint brush supplied is not so good,so buy a fine one from the art store.. The board is a good thickness and the printing is very clear and easy to see . In this particular picture there is a lot of mixing to do. So as suggested by the manufacturer  do the whole number first and then do the mixed numbers. All in all it will be a good picture to frame if I can find the right size !It's an odd size and so far have not found the frame to hold it!",3.0
"The picture is beautiful, but there are some problems. The numbers show through the paint even after multiple coats. There is not enough of some of the paints to complete the sections that need that color (maybe due to needing multiple coats to cover the numbers). I have had to supplement the white with other paint. Some numbers have to be covered up with paint before you get to that section. A copy of the picture is provided with the numbers so you can still see what number you covered, but some of those numbers are so small you cannot read them. I would not recommend this picture for anyone under 16, for anyone with vision problems, or for anyone who has any shaking at all. I would recommend you have some extra paint on hand.",3.0
These are student grade watercolors. Spend a little more and get the artist quality if you want to avoid paying twice. The colors are less vibrant and transparent than the higher quality paints. Brand doesn't matter as long as you stick to the artist line. I regret the money and time I wasted using inferior products.,3.0
"The picture depicting the final results looks somewhat odd, but the finished painting looks even stranger and not at all natural.",3.0
I bought this painting along with 2 others of similar style and brand to make a set. together the pictures look great on their own not so much. all of the colors especially the blues are much darker than the picture leaving the entire picture dark. I never expect the final picture to look like the photo but some of these colors were just off. if you want it with other similar pictures as a set I highly recommend it they look great together and I get plenty of compliments since they look like they come together but if you want it as a stand alone picture I would recommend something else.,3.0

Great paints but the actual paints are a lot smaller than I thought they would be,3.0
It is MUCH smaller than what's pictured. When it arrived we almost didn't find it in the box with the other items.  Looks more like a toy.  Then I read the caption closely...pocket sized. More like wallet sized.  Went back for return right away.,3.0
"It's a good student grade option.  The colors work well together.  I recommend a drop or two of water (or gum Arabic) in the bottom of each pan under the watercolor to help settle them in.  The latch is not secure so if you drop it, expect them to scatter.",3.0
"I was happy to find these and try them out. The price was pretty good here on Amazon, better than what I found in stores at the time. I like the size of the palette and color choices, and really most of the paints I like pretty well, but I've found other sets I enjoy more for less money. They are quality. The little brush has a nice tip, too. But I prefer metal tins, and other paints wet easier and have bolder colors. One or two colors are really hard to wet with these. I like the Prima line better as a hobby grade BUT, I suspect these are a better quality paint (light fast etc) I don't know that though, and unless I was taking a class and needed specific colors (the prima aren't labelled with color names or pigments) I'd try the prima for less money and more fun. Advantages to the conman: windsor & newton quality, traditional color name and pigment labeling, good palette colors, sturdy palette if you like plastic, Can replace colors individually. I won't buy them again, but each time I try to get rid of them, I stop myself!! I don't hate them, and if I couldn't purchase others I'd use these a lot.

I was a little disappointed in the intensity of color in these paints. I didn't see a lot of vibrancy. They don't mix particularly well - most of the colors were muddy. There is only one purple in the 24 set so not a lot of options there. I realize that these are student grade and that's exactly how they perform.,3.0
Much much smaller than it looks.,3.0
I'm new to watercolor so this was all kind of new to me. The colors were al very vibrant and the palette was very helpful to put paint on,3.0
"Pros:
Good colors, good pigments. Nice palettes. Additional space for 3 tubes.
Cons:
It is big for such amount of colors. Really. A lot of free space between pans - just holes what is unusable for mixing.
Pan holders are really bad: they don't hold pans without paper wrappers: so it just fly out of them. So you need thermal glue to lock pans in holders.
This is really and really bad: because i choice this one as an addition to pocket set to have an ability to change colors in a pocket one for street walks. But now this set is just giant home container.",3.0
smaller than expected,3.0
I had one prior to this that I gave my granddaughter. it was wonderful!  Everything fit inside it in a easy non bulky way.  This newer one not great. The water container doesn't have that nice water flask shape like the old one but rather has a different water battle that is totally round cylinder shaped. its bulky and harder to slide in the compartment. Hassle!,3.0
Initially I thought this was a great sketchbox but I have since been frustrated by the short amount of time the pans dry out.  Great for sketching on the go but not so good for picking up the pigments.  It takes quite a bit of work to get the pigment out of the pan.  It does help to let it sit in water for a few minutes before working with it but it was still disappointing and the colors weren't as vibrant as the van gogh pans.,3.0
"This set comes in a lovely small travel case but its definitely a cheaper set of watercolors. Its a good starter set and I often recommend it to people starting out as the colors do mix pretty well. In the end, I keep the case and graduate to better quality paints since the colors are not all lightfast.",3.0
Christmas gift.,3.0
"I try not to be a watercolor materials snob so I continue searching for affordable paints.
I am used to using Daniel Smith ($$$) on finer pieces, but I enjoy using these for practice and less serious pieces.
These colors are okay, I have produced some lovely colors by mixing and messing around with the colors provided.
My biggest complaint is the amount of paint (a lot) you must use in order to produce anything that doesn't look very dull.
I work with a large pallet and in order to get any color on my brush I really have to work the paint in the pallet before applying.
I will continue to buy these because I am frugal and they get the job done well enough.",3.0
these are student grade paints not professional -- I see a difference in the paint quality -- they are great for students and a better price point than professional paint.,3.0
"I got this for a very very low price. Well worth it. The plastic is sturdy and has plenty of mixing space. Both mixing trays can be removed for cleaning. Also, the brush is pretty good for a free brush.

However, I also have some criticisms.
1. The colors they chose for this set are pretty pathetic for a limited palette. The cobalt blue and ultramarine are almost identical, so if you want to mix your own green you won't get anything but olive tones. The lack of a good middle blue such as phthalo blue really limits the use of this palette. The white is basically useless, who knows why they included it. Permanent rose would have been a much better choice over alizarin crimson as it mixes cleaner, brighter colors. There is no purple or black/grey included although these can be mixed. (Tip: you can remove the paints out of the pans and squeeze in your own tube paints).
2. The box closes very tightly and it's a huge struggle to get it opened every single time.
3. The mixing lid does not lay flat, so the paint drips down as you are mixing it, or even after.
4. There are spaces in between the half pans so they will rattle and move around as you try to use them (this drove me crazy, I had to put pieces of sponge in between them to correct it).

Overall, because of the price I would recommend this to a beginner just the palette can be customized and many of the flaws taken care of on your own.",3.0
"The paints are vibrant, no question. Blends well. So I give the paints themselves a 4 star rating.

As for the set that receives the 3.
It was pretty tricky to remove wrappers from pans (I even did google searches to find video tutorials) and it's still pretty tricky to be able to pop pans in and out of the container. The container is difficult to open. The trays provided are hard to take out as well.

I don't know if I got a one-off poor quality container but this makes me look toward paint tubes in the future. Also, makes me want to be my set in person to test out the container and make sure it's easy to use.",3.0
I love Winsor & Newton and the quality of the paints are awesome but they fall out too easily since they don't snap into place.,3.0

"The watercolors are really small, but they paint pretty cool",3.0

"Purchased these locally as part of materials list for an intro watercolor class.

I have no experience with which to review the paints themselves, HOWEVER, I did not realize each color was individually wrapped, once in clear plastic and once in colored paper. I should have checked the night before. I spent a good 30 minutes in class unwrapping, even the instructor came to help. This of course put me behind the rest of the session.

My hands have no problems. I found it extremely difficult to remove, unwrap, and reinsert each color in their teeny tiny little compartments. The blocks I did not place perfectly were extremely resistant to remove and align.  I have trouble even opening the box, as if there is some secret trick I missed.

Perhaps this is a skill/talent that is readily known by more experienced artists. I miss my cheap Crayolas.",3.0

"Wow, so odd! I just bought this product and Amazon poises it as I've already reviewed it and can only edit it? Do I have a doppelgaenger out there, posing as me? I have bought this product, but years ago when W&N still offered whole pans in North America. So there's a lot messed up here.
This is the second time I've purchased nominally, in name only, the same product. Liked it the first time around. Noticeably different then, the product then was made in England and many of the albeit Cotman whole pans included were indeed real cadmiums and cobalts. On the description here, erroneously they are said cadmiums and cobalts, but they are not, they are merely hues of cadmium or cobalt. Of course, elsewhere there's the salesman's caveat, ""contents may vary"", but this is not the kind of straight-forward one expects from Amazon. Also, the actual pans are in a different wrapping, each explicitly saying, ""made in China"". Seems W&N has come to this.  :(
(I have another  new W&N whole pan box, but delivered from Japan and in a nice metal box, 12-pan  format. Here the kicker is, ""made in France""! I have not used it so don't know yet if the colors are good. I like my Senneliers, so this may be okay. But the heck is going on with W&N and / or Amazon?!)
But now back to this Cotman box, or should I call it ""alleged Cotman"" box. With the 24 Chinese hues, not genuine British pans with cadmiums and colbalts like my older, earlier purchase. Although much is different, I still very much like the plastic box the colors came in. Just like the older one. Very good, serviceable. I've had a lot of good use with it. No problem at all. Don't understand the complaints in that area at all.
Oh, the price went up about half again, since my last purchase.
I'll give it 3 stars until I can test the pans in use and see if they're good, up to W&N (previous?) standards.
And still, what is with Amazon claiming I'd reviewed this before!!!!!",3.0
"we bought ME a set of these at our local Michael's store and paid WAY WAY WAY more than this Then... my hubby wanted one and I said ill find it on amazon and was flabbergasted at how CHEAP (price-wise) it was in comparison to what I paid at michaels for the SAME thing... (so my hubby reminded me we used the 40% off coupon and I felt better) its a cute little compact set, though the bottom palette is a TAD hard to pull out and it would be very nice if they could figure out a way to either include another water pan OR make the ONE an that is included BIGGER. for our fun outings and some art in the mix I am certain we will enjoy these, the paints appear to be a nice quality and a nice variety and the brush appears to be a nice quality too.

update: after attempting to pull the tray out a few more times and being a bit frustrated with the limited color choices, as well as having the little color pans fall out about 5 times so far (very tired of this) I ordered a different little travel paint set: Sakura XNCW-24N 24-Piece Koi Assorted Water Colors Field Sketch Set with Brush. about the same price for 24 very nice colors AND a high quality plastic tray as well as a water filled brush and 2 nice little sponges. I like the new one WAY BETTER. just an FYI.

LOL... and its NOT just the the pans fall out, the paint chip IN the pan falls out too so you have 24 pieces of stuff to gather up (during your ""travels"" BTW) and put back in order.... a super glue tube might have been a nice addition to the set. lol

update: today I took out my glue gun and glued all the pans AND the chips IN the pans to the ""set"" I also notice that if you use the mixing tray in the lid, you are screwed when you close it unless everything is totally dry b4 you close it. so you MUST use the not too easy to slide out mixing tray on the bottom. I am so HAPPY I bought the Koi kit because its SO Much nicer that I don't need to mess much with this one.

AND black and/or paynes grey would have been a REALLY NICE add to the color palette...",3.0

"I am very disappointed in this item.  The palette was a very flimsy, cheesy, bendable, thin plastic.  The top was made of same plastic and was too loose to stay on the palette without two rubber bands, which then made it even flimsier.  Picture shows a bottom box which may give some shape to it. Instead, it arrived in a thin, slip-in box.  Basically, this palette isn't worth using.  Colors advertised a Hooker's Green Dark but a Viridian was substituted.  I would recommend buying this only if you think it is a good value for the watercolors themselves.",3.0

These crayons have always been great. I remember them from my childhood and it's pretty cool that I'm now buying them for my son. He of course would rather see how they taste instead of coloring with them but he does like to scribble and use a lot of different colors. He's 2 so he's learning and having fun in the process.

However, they are much better than some of the no-name really waxy ones you might get.

I don't know what went wrong but for some reason half the colors were barely pigmented and basically just wax so they didn't work good for coloring .,3.0
"This is a very good box of crayons as far as the color go. But when I opened the box, about 1/3 of the crayons were broken. And the sharpener on the back is practically useless. After you're done sharpening one...all the shavings spill out.
Such a shame. The variety of colors gets 5 stars. But everything else is 2 1/2",3.0
"colors were all mixed up and out of order and don't even look like the belong to the same set. don't know if this is seller or manufacturer issue. they still work, so it's fine just weird.",3.0
"Arrived fast, however 1/2 the crayons were broken and/or melted.",3.0
Several crayons showed up broken. It is just better to buy these in the store.,3.0
"Not one ""red"" crayon!",3.0
Love my crayons but only 95 in a 96 crayon box? I am positive I will never ever miss it but poor quality control. Wasn't this a brand new box?,3.0
"These came looking like they had been used. A few of the crayons were stubby and broken, but not many. Right away when I opened the package, the box looked as if it had been opened many times before. The crayons still work, and there are none missing. I just wish it would have come new.",3.0
Crayons are crayons.  How can they earn a poor rating you may ask?  Every single crayon was dumped out of the Crayola box and rolling around the shipping container when it arrived.  It was impossible putting them all back in the correct (color coded) spot.,3.0
The box was still in decent shape with all of the crayons but 3  were broken and it appeared one had been broken prior to being packed as the part missing is the bottom inch of the crayon not the points that were broken of the other two and still in the box.  I had to sharpen 2 of the broken crayons.,3.0
what happened to colors being in order with like colors? when you open the box the colors are all over the place,3.0
"I really thought that the price was for 2 boxes of crayons...disappointed, because I could have purchased this 1 box of 96 crayons for less locally :(

Also, the quality of the cardboard box for the crayons is rather flimsy and not of usual Crayola standard. This box will NOT last long once my 4 year old gets a hold of it.

The crayons themselves are as expected.",3.0
colors are vivid. When I receivecouple of the crayons are totally broken into half. The colors are not even when shading.,3.0
"Crayons are fine, but the box is very flimsy.",3.0
I got a 96 count box with 90 crayons in it. I know it's only 6 crayons out of 96 but I specifically paid for 96.,3.0
"The crayons are great! My only reason for giving 3 stars is that a few crayons were broken when the package was delivered at my house. Not the biggest deal to me, but to a 4 year old it is!",3.0
"The crayons are great, but the box is very flimsy.  I was disappointed that you can no longer use these to actually store the crayons.",3.0
It was not packed properly and all of the crayons came out of the box and a lot of them were broken. I was very upset but I needed them for school for my daughter so I didn't have time to order other ones for her. I was very disappointed.,3.0
"While the crayons were lovely (and made my daughter quite happy), the box itself fell apart within a few days. The cardboard isn't the same thick crayon box cardboard you grew up with. I definitely recommend that you have an alternative solution to storing the crayons in mind when you purchase this.",3.0
"The blades do the job as intended, and fit your standard Xacto knife.  My only issues is that i feel it was a bit pricey for 5 blades but what is one to do when you need them.",3.0
"I've used the #11 blades for many years, and I can clearly tell that these blades are not as sharp.  The form-factor is nice and good for cutting on a flat surface, but I won't be using them for anything else other than that.",3.0
"The blades are nice and sharp, but they become loose after just a few uses. After using the X-Acto knife a handful of times, the blades started wiggling out of the slot in the top and popping out if I didn't wedge them back in.

This was with very light use  I was not cutting anything hard (like plastic or rubber or anything you'd expect to put pressure on the blades), so they should have been much more durable.

As others have said, the case also sucks. Good luck getting the tools and blades to fit right back in. You have to arrange them precariously after every use, so if that's something you enjoy then you'll love this extra-frustrating case.

I gave this a 3-star review because aside from the negatives, the material quality is good and it does work and cut as intended...just not the best utility design.",3.0
Everything is great but the case sucks. It won't stay closed so be careful you don't dump weighted blades on your feet.,3.0
The do the job,3.0
The handles are fatrer than they look but it works very well,3.0
"I received this item today and I have 2 remarks.  Like a previous reviewer said, the tool support is very bad and as shown in the product photograph, the blades section does not fit inside the lid.  I will have to try and glue it to the lid.  The second problem is that the hinges of box which I received were all broken.  Other than these two issues, everything else were fine.",3.0
the  tool support (plastic) in the box is about as bad as it gets.,3.0
Having some trouble securing the blad on one of the exacto. Have to turn really hard to get it fit right and it keeps getting loose.,3.0
"Excellent blades, but poor case",3.0
"Found the same amount of knives for cheaper in a store. Excess blades are great, but not worth the added price.",3.0
Its ok I have better balsa RC modeling,3.0
"Well equipped with lots of different blades. However, some of the blades are not magnetic, and the magnetic strip is recessed, so it doesn't hold the blades securely. I had to jury-rig a solution to hold them in. Also, the plastic inserts in each side are not secured, so they also fall out. I had to glue them in.",3.0
"Look at that box of blades, see how nice all the blades in the lid look? Well don't expect that from this kit. All the blades for the top come packed in a little bag, together. You must very carefully extract them from this packing and then without the slightest bit of help or documentation, figure out which blade goes where.

A big problem is the magnet in the lid which is supposed to hold the blades in place when the box is closed. The magnet is so weak that half the blades fall off the lid. You can not close the lid gently enough, the magnet is so weak it won't hold the blades in place.

Overall I like the handles and X-Acto knives are very useful in my guitar repair work. I hoped this kit would be better than it is. I don't need this wide of a blade selection normally. I'll probably move the loose fitting blades to a small plastic box for those times I need more choice.

There might be better options than this kit. I would look at them before buying one of these kits. The wood box is very inexpensively made so it's not a huge plus. The trays in the box are just blow molded plastic, it's the very cheapest construction possible.

Good luck and happy projects to all!",3.0
"All in all, performed as expected from Exacto. Strange issue though, not sure if its a one-off problem- 2 of the 3 handles have a slightly sharp ring that is carved out toward the top of each one. Its just above the area that you normally hold, but if I adjust my grip and hold it a little closer to the top where the blade attaches, there is an etched ring that starts to cut my finger. It looks like it may not have been polished correctly after the ring was etched on the handle- again, could just be one off. Regardless, I have had to add tape around it to prevent cutting my finger which shouldnt happen with Exacto products. And yes, the extra blades do fall out of the plastic holders but I solved by putting them in seperare container anyway, as I only wanted the case to hold the 3 handles with blades installed, not to hold extra blades.",3.0
Decent starter kit but a little flimsy.,3.0
"Note, you need an xacto knife to open the package.  I guess manufacturers package this way because they figure you won't return an item if you have to destroy the packaging in the process but this was one of the worst items I've had to open in a long time.  I almost damaged the case getting it out.  Sheesh.  Besides that it's pretty much what you'd expect.  They could have designed the case better to make it easier to close and the knives would be easier to use with non-slip grips but for the price I suppose you can't expect much.",3.0
"Don't think it is worth the money. The plastic tray the parts fit into is very thin and some of the parts fit very tightly. I do not expect it to last too long. I had to re-glue the top tray to the lid as it fell out every time I opened the lid. Also, all the screws in the kit are Philips heads. The screw driver provided was for slotted head screws. I think X-ACTO could have done a better job. It was well packed and protected in the shipping box. It arrived on time.",3.0
blades are nice but they keep falling down and 1 of them won't stick to the magnet so whenever i open it all the blades fall out of place,3.0
Decent but a little flemsy. Not the easiest to change blades,3.0
It literally is what is pictured but for some reason I thought they would be you know small size. No these are huge. Like HUGE,3.0
Every time opened bits fall out of place.,3.0
"First of all, the package only came covered in see thru clear plastic for all to see.  Of course these days they just drop stuff off at the front door without seeing if you are actually home. The short end of the box is warped meaning it is not holding together well.  The upper case inside the top is supposed to be attached.  Well it isn't.  It has a small stripe of glue that is not in the right place to hold onto the flimsy tool holder. Since the top holder is not attached all the tools fell out of their slots.  Speaking of the tool slots, not easy to figure out which one goes where.  Don't take too many out of their slots at once.  Very disappointed.  Have not tried using it yet. Hopefully decent quality.",3.0
"The knife and blades are nice, but the wooden case is dumb.
They've molded the area around the blades to match the shape of the blade, then supplied three blades in the knifes.. so when you swap out the blades you have no where to store the blade and you have to swap back to store the knife again.",3.0
"Awesome set of handles and blades, recommend it based on that.  The downfalls are the cheesy plastic piece holders.  The biggest downfall however is to keep the blades in the place holder.  There is a magnet that attempts poorly to hold the blades.  The bigger one's will fall every time.  I bought magnets with tape on one side, cut them to fit on top of the existing magnet and that holds all the blades really well save the blade on the right.  If you close the lid *very* carefully it will stay in place.  If the company would put a nicer place holder in and use a really good magnetic strip that touches the blade it would be a 100% review",3.0
DULLS VERY FAST.,3.0
"Not really what I expected, plus one of them broke on the first use.",3.0
NO COMMENT,3.0
"It wasn't what i need, they're to small for the work that i have to do.",3.0
"I imagine it a little different, but it is still very good product",3.0
Cheap. Barely cut.,3.0
"Box came as shown, blades are nice and sharp. There is a thin magnetic strip to hold all the blades which has an adhesive on the back side, the strip would not stay adhered to the plastic backing, so I removed the plastic and stuck it directly to the wood. No more blades falling out as it's opened.",3.0
The case is pretty cheap and difficult to close because of the plastic inserts.,3.0
"Everything arrived that was supposed to be in the box. But these are nowhere near the quality of Exacto handles from way back. These have very soft grip heads, which I can see deforming quickly. The old Exacto handles had precision ground grip heads. Quality is not what it used to be. Try to find the old stuff on eBay.",3.0
"The knives are nice and Sharpe and come with a pleasing variety. Hopefully they last me a while. The wooden container is sturdy, but the latch doesn't match up at all. The knives are held in a thin plastic bed that don't quite stay put inside the box. The middle knife is almost to big for the container and is only held in because the knife is stabbing through the plastic holder. To replace back into the container, you have to restab into the plastic. Remember there are no protective coverings delivered with this product.
Overall, I am pleased with the product.",3.0
"The tools work fine, the only problem I encountered was with the case. It doesn't close perfectly, and once you open it, the blades on tof usually fall because the magnet is not well attached to the frame.",3.0
Good selection of stitches but I found the yarn colours made the patterns difficult to see in the pictures.  A good reference book for all knitters.,4.0
Contains some interesting stitches.,4.0
"I love the fact that there are written instructions as well as charts for each of the stitches.  Having a photo of each is really great, too.

Many of the stitch patterns look as nice on the wrong side as they do on the right side; and for those stitches the author puts a symbol to easily identify them.  She also includes photos of both sides of the knitted swatch to show the differences.

For the stitch patterns that have a ""no thinking necessary"" wrong side row (e.g., knit all the way across or purl all the way across on wrong side rows), she uses an ""Easy"" symbol for quick identification.

The one thing that would have made it a 5-star book (in my opinion) would be if there had been some sort of yardage requirement.  Although it's understood that you can use any weight yarn for these stitches, the sample swatches were all knit with Cascade 220 yarn, provided to the author by the Cascade Yarn Company (as acknowledged by the author).  She doesn't state whether it was the superwash version of the Cascade 220 or not (and I think it wasn't), but both are a worsted weight.  So, if she had simply put something like, ""the 4"" x 4"" swatch of this stitch used 20 yards of yarn,"" it would be helpful.  With that information, you can get a good ballpark figure of how much of a DK weight yarn (for example) that you would need for a baby blanket using that particular stitch.  Obviously, this wouldn't be necessary/helpful for all of the stitches (such as the Diamond Openwork Panel) but for the stitches that might be used for the entire body of a baby blanket (such as Sevignac Lace or Graceful Leaves) it would be incredibly helpful.",4.0
Great book but the index is terrible. Had to write and high light my own cross ref info.,4.0
I find the book to be a very helpful guide in trying different stitch patterns. Very exciting to mix and match them.,4.0
"This is a book for those who want more than the basics.  While there are a number of familiar patterns, the focus seems to be on taking us to the next level of creativity.  Included are charts as well as written instructions.  It's a good resource.",4.0
"Great book for looking  pattern. Most are easy to follow and with great explanation. The con for me in these book, is there nothing unexpected from the pattern, i have seen similar patterns in others book, so that was a little dissapointment. If you don't have a pattern book this is great. I recomend this book for begginers.",4.0
"This is an excellent collection of stitch patterns, and as a stitch collector, I can see many are original and imaginative. I expect to knit a lot of these patterns -- it may well become a go-to book for me. I am puzzled it wasn't printed in larger format, 8 1/2 by 11 inches, as many fine knitting books are. These patterns are complex and larger photos of the worked samples would have been better. This paperback is 7 1/4 by 9 inches: not tiny, but not quite big enough. Leapman's work deserves bigger.",4.0
This book is perfect if you want patterns to incorporate into your own designs.  The knits and purls are great!  The only annoying aspect of this book is that you have to flip through every page to see the pattern.  It would be nice to have a photo contents page for faster reference.,4.0
"There are some wonderful patterns in this book, and I've tried probably a half-dozen of them. From what I've tried, I've found the patterns to be easy to read -- I like that the author gives both written and charted directions --- and accurate. There are color photos of the patterns, and they are well represented. When a pattern is reversible, the author gives photos of both sides. The pattern book is broken down into different sections: cable patterns, slip-stitch patterns, lace patterns, etc. Maybe I shouldn't, but I found myself comparing the book to Barbara Walker's stitch pattern books. One of the things I love about Walker's books is that she tells you if the pattern will roll, lay flat, if it's stretchy, if it's good for a sweater, a scarf, etc. If Ms. Leapman had included some of that information with each stitch pattern, I would definitely have given this 5 stars.",4.0
"The Knit Stitch handbook is finally a book to use a a very good reference and teaching tool.

"I bought this because I loved the dragon on the front. The patterns are color and this would normally be a great thing. However, some of the colors are extremely similar and at times can be hard to tell appart. I wish they had used a completely colored symbol guide instead of using some blank colored squares. There is also a minor issue with some of the materials needed. The beads and some of the threads and fabric are special order only. But, with some ingenuity this isn't a problem. Just find comparable items. These patterns are not for someone just starting. They aren't expert level, but they do take some skill. There is also a guide for creating fum items such as diary covers and pillows from the patterns. All in all, a great buy",4.0

"Jodi says if you use her piecing technique you will never have to deal with triangles again.  Her method can be used on any size blocks, but it's
especially good for making mini blocks.  I made blocks that measure 1 1/4 inches.  When they are sewn together, they will be 3/4"".  It would be a nightmare to make them with traditional piecing.

I would give this book a 5 if it had more tips and tricks for joining the blocks into rows and eliminating bulk in the seams.  If you look closely at the quilt photos in the book, you will see that the seams are not uniformly flat and straight.  I checked her website, but didn't find any additional info.

For best results you have to be extremely accurate in the piecing and trimming.  This is why it's a good idea to buy her ruler, even though she does show how to use a conventional quilting ruler.",4.0

"Does not include yardage for the cover sampler.  You will need 4.5 yards of background, which I only know because my quilt shop contacted the publisher.  The author does not include it in the book.

Note that there are more block patterns available online through Fat Quarter Shop.  There are also some free patterns that various quilters have made available - check Craftsy and Pinterest.  The sampler quilt is fun to make because you can customize it in various ways.

For the stars in the corners, she uses a method of making 4 flying geese at a time, but then she never uses the method again in the book.  You might want to use this method to make the red border blocks with less waste than her stitch and flip method.",4.0

I was happy with my book,4.0
I had to return this one because some one had given me one as a gift after I had placed my order.  Think the book is excellent and liked it very much.  Liked many of the patterns,4.0
Adorable patterns,4.0
I bought this after seeing similar ones in stores but since our child doesn't start preschool til next year we held off.  I went ahead b/c I loved the up-to-date look and not so old fashioned.  It seems to be held together very well and has a lot of space for special items from your kids school years.  The only reason I gave it 4 starts and not 5 was b/c I think making it bound like a binder would make it even better for if you wanted to add your own things.  I can't wait to use it.,4.0
Purchased two as gifts for a friend for their girls. Pretty way to keep track of school memories.,4.0
My granddaughter is so excited to have this for her first year of preschool. Just adorable.,4.0
"Very nice designs, few pages per school year but has no stickers to decorate, otherwise is really nice",4.0
I like this book but I am deducting a star for two reasons. I have another similar book that had stickers for the child to apply to photos etc. and this book also says in the kindergarten section 'I can now go potty by myself' which is a little silly for a five or in some case six year olds.,4.0
Super cute! I bought this for my 5 year old niece that just finished preschool. It has pages for preschool all the way through 12th grade. Not a big deal for me but just a FYI - there's definitely more pages and space for the younger years but as they get older there's just 1 page per grade. My niece and her mother love it!,4.0
Good book for storing school memories.  Had plenty of room for journaling and large pockets for schoolwork and keepsakes.  Love that it goes from pre-k to 12th grade.,4.0
"Overall, I do love this memory book for my daughter.  She is finishing up preschool this year and she loved filling out her preschool page (well, telling me what to write!)  It doesn't ask too many questions, like another book I considered, and definitely has plenty of space to glue/tape pictures.  My only issue with the book is a small issue and that's the fact that normal size papers stick out a bit when in the pockets.  That's my only issue and isn't that big of a deal but did prevent that 5th star.",4.0
"This is a good product, Im a very detailed person and like to add as much detial as possible, I find that some of the years don't ask all the questions that I would like to have answered, but I can add to it. I like the pocket for each page so that I can store items that my child made.  over all I think this is a great product and would be great for any mom wanting to record their child's yeas of school.",4.0
"I bought this book for both of my daughters (ages four and two). I love that it starts with preschool and goes through 12th grade. The pocket pages that can be used to store papers and art work seem sturdy, although I haven't officially put them to the test yet. We are just about to start using it for my oldest daughter who is in preschool. It seems to be a nice, quality memory keeper of good size. I had to do a little extra work to get the sticker off of the front cover right-hand corner, but overall I am satisfied and looking forward to using these books to store memories of my daughters' school years.",4.0
needs a plase for class photo but it is ok for the rest frount is nice for pic to later,4.0
"My daughter isn't very girly, so many of the books I have seen just don't fit her style. But this book is really bright and cheerful. The paper is thick and the art work is cute, but not too silly. One of my favorite things about the book is that it is meant to be filled out by your child. For example, each year there is a place for the child to write his or her name. I know my daughter will love looking back to see how she wrote her name in kinder, first, second, etc. This is really something a parent and child can do together throughout the years. There are plenty of places to put pictures and artwork, and while it does expand, I am afraid this book will fill up quickly and be overstuffed because of the many pockets and areas for photos.

One of the features I was looking for was a book that did not include preschool because my daughter did not attend. This book DOES include preschool, although unlike other books there is no place for a photo on the cover. That works well for me because I hate to leave something on the cover blank. I figured I could just remove the preschool pages, but unfortunately they are printed on both sides and the last preschool page has the first kinder page on the other side.

Overall, I am looking forward to filling this out each year with my daughter. The quality of the book means it will last.",4.0
"A wonderful book for any child. Though a little spendy, it was well worth it. Also a wonderful gift to any parent of a new born.",4.0

"Beware that although they mention many Origami artists in the review, this is not Origami. These projects can only me performed on fabric, not paper, because it is a sewing technique. So, if you are looking for an Origami tessellation book, go somewhere else. This one really doesn't have the ""ori"" or the ""kami"".
Now, if you want to sew fabric (and let it fold itself into patterns as a consequence), this is a good book. The pictures are very inspiring.",4.0
beautiful effects - requires some patience though!,4.0
I enjoyed this book and found the instructions easy to follow. I was disappointed that there wasn't more ideas for it's use and patterns.,4.0
i am anxious to try.  I like the approach and it seems simple enough.  Just the techniques to make my items unique!,4.0
"I read the book and saw how to do the folds, but haven't had time to get into it.  I quilt and sew for the family and friends and was looking for a new effect to try.  It is fascinating and a bit of a puzzle, but the timing just isn't right.",4.0
Bought this book for my wife. She has got a lot of use out of this book and has made several quilts from ideas she has gotten from this book,4.0
"There is a rare time when I buy a book for it's cocktail table presence!  This book is  inspirational in it's content..not just about a way to fold fabric in beautiful configurations, but gives the reader the chance to imagine something more...
I am a quilter and artist rolled into one, so I can see many amazing possibilities about to take shape.
Even if you aren't the creative type, you will certainly appreciate the beautiful art form...and there are projects in this book that even the skittish will enjoy..
Well done, well illustrated, and simple,concise instruction make this a wonderful book for your stash..you may consider giving it as a gift to one of your artsy friends!!!
I don't rate anything a 5, but this book is pretty darn close...;)",4.0
"I love the patterns shown but haven't really gotten around to attempting any of these. They would be awesome for complementing/ exaggerating collar, button stands and hem fronts on tailored clothing. It just seemed like way to much effort for the sort of daily wear garments I sew though.. But for someone that likes challenging, intricate work-definitely worth the effort +cost. This sort of stuff will also look fairly awesome on lamps, wall hanging and quilts. I will get around doing some for garments eventually XD",4.0
"This book is truly unique.  I love the history and source of inspiration
for this book.  The two techniques I have tried turned out beautifully.

"I liked this tool but, I am finding that the caps don't fit tight enough.  I took this tool to a quilt retreat and I had to spend time looking for the caps: they'd just drop off.

If the shipping wasn't prohibitive, I'd send this back and ask for another one with better fitting caps.",4.0

I was pleasantly surprised to receive my purchases so soon!! The books were in great shape and above expectations for used books!,4.0
"I like this book because there are many pretty patterns that are not mind boggling.  I have been knitting for over 20 years but just recently began to knit lace patterns as a result of a class I took on Craftsy.  I was always intimidated by lace but now I am enjoying it just like when I first learned to knit cables!  This book also has some very nice small projects that would make nice gifts.  So, give lace a try!",4.0
"This book has a sweater pattern in it that I've been looking for, for a long time.  I bought the book for that.  It was well worth it.  Many of the other patterns are very nice too.",4.0
"This would be a nice lace b ook to begin with. Nothing, or not much, that will make you pull your hair out, and a few nice pieces.",4.0
"Good Book, full of good patterns...Think other knitters would enjoy this if they enjoy lace as I do. Excellent photography.",4.0
I enjoy this book as it has basic patterns for different size afghans. The patterns are easy to read and the yarns are available at your local walmart.,4.0
"This book has a nice variety of fonts that includes holiday and birthday motifs. There are also a few baby-related fonts and a number of florals. The front and back covers and the title page show the letters in color. The patterns themselves are black and white, but give the DMC and ANC color codes. A couple fonts are quite similar, but overall this a solid buy. I'm not sure if I'll ever use the dirt alphabet that has frogs crawling around on it, but you never know!",4.0
"Good selection of alphabet designs.  Near duplicate of the other book I ordered, so I don't advocate buying both.  Reseller accurately described the condition of the book, and sent it in a timely manner.",4.0
Nice addition to pattern collection,4.0
So many options !!  Really am enjoying the variety and have already mixed/matched giving me even more fun projects!!,4.0
"My only complaint is that all of the types don't offer lower case letters as well as upper case.  Most do but not all.  Clear, easy to follow patterns.",4.0
"I was pleasantly surprised with the variety of the alphabets. There are some really cute options here. My only disappointment is that the alphabets do not include numbers or punctuation. It isn't a huge deal, but it would have been nice for some of them. I am making a Christening gift and I wanted to do the baby's full name and birth date. I wouldn't expect numbers for EVERY alphabet, but it would be nice to have a couple - a block, scripty, and basic or something.",4.0
"Please see the Images I uploaded above.  I think it's very helpful to know what's inside a book and the front and back covers and page 2 cover display all 136 alphabets in the book.  As stitchers, we all know that we should be signing and dating our projects, however humble, because they will be heirlooms someday.  I have used the Olde English type script as my signature on a historic sampler and also a cheerful bold one for my son's baby afghan.  The inside front cover holds a b&w key to the 3 pages of alphabets for quick finding of the one you choose.

I love these Leisure Arts Charts For Le$$ and have a bunch of 'em.  They're just always coming in handy.

"Looks like a vintage map on non-glossy paper.  Looks great as a picture on the wall!  Not really for use
for locating 'current' up to date countries, etc.",4.0
"It's a nice map on high quality paper so it could be a great wall piece or something for your collection. However, I'm using this as a travel map to stick pins on places I've been to and I'm finding that this is not really a good use for that. It's too small so a lot of cities aren't named on the map. Also, because it's a vintage ""League of Nations"" map, the places here are outdated so North and South Korea are one country and the contemporary countries in the Levant don't exist yet.",4.0
"I like it, but it's a POSTER, not wrapping paper.",4.0
"Great! Ink is nice quality, but it's kind of ""gloppy"" and it easily gets everywhere. So I wouldn't recommend trying to use these with little kids (like I did). It took me a few tries to get the hang of it, so be sure to do a few test stamps first.",4.0
"The stickers are lovely, but I did think they would be quite a bit bigger.  most of them are only about an inch by and inch.",4.0
the reason why I gave this product 4 stars is that I was expecting the stickers to be slightly bigger but they turn out to be really small. I was a bit disappointed but the quality of the stickers is really good. I like them.,4.0
"I like the stickers and they do remind me of vintage Americana; however, they are printed on flat paper, not shiny paper as a lot of the originals were.  Also, one cannot use them on an adult size vintage suitcase because they are too small.  They are more child size or mini stickers.  Wish they could have had a little bit more variety, too.  All in all, very nice tin, cute stickers!",4.0
This book used creative ideas with a blend of coloful colors to create unique and fun handbags and purses.  It is a great source for those wanting to creat their own unique items.  I recomend it.,4.0
Lots of good patterns for any taste of Handbags and Purses.  Easy sewing instructions and patterns.  You could make one for every lady on your Christmas list and still have plenty more to sew for yourself.  Excellent pattern book.,4.0
"This is a very good inspirational book on making bags and purses for any occasion. Many times when looking through a craft book written by one person, when all the ideas are theirs, there tends to be a sameness about the projects, but not this book. More than just the author's ideas, there are purses made by many contributors which helps give an even larger variety of ideas than one person can accomplish on their own. There are also many different needlecraft types used for the different purses, so whatever your favorite type of needlecraft, you can find a purse to make. There are purses made in leather, cloth appliqus, crocheted, needlepoint, etc. The bags come in every size too, from larger tote style bags to tiny purses that you can use for a necklace. Lots of full color photographs of the projects also.

The only really bad thing I observed in this book is no actual patterns which for some of us that are drawing impaired could be a problem. But all in all a good book that should inspire you as you craft your next purse.

I was surprised to see the many negative reviews here on this book. I will admit that I wouldn't want to make some of the bags in this purse, but then I have seen advertisements for purses that cost over $13,000 that I wouldn't use if you paid me. Everyone has their own tastes. If you are looking for ideas on different types of bags to make, this book will give you plenty of many different types.",4.0
"Many beautiful and interesting patterns.
A few were odd, but the majority were pretty and worthy of knitting",4.0
"If you want to find more reviews on this book, then go to the hardcover version from 2006.  It is easily found with just a search for this title.  There are many, many reviews there.  And this is the SAME book, just in paperback format.  Briefly though, it's worth getting this out of the library to see if it fits your style.  For me, I wouldn't buy the book; seems to be errors and the patterns are a bit on the different side along with ill-fitting designs.  But if you are good at fixing a few pattern errors here and there and really like the styles, then it might be worth it.  Personally, I would definitely have to fill in some of those empty areas across the belly.  :-)",4.0
"This book was sent as a gift to an experienced knitter who is a member of a Saturday knitting club. The recipient was looking for a resource book of fresh styles and ideas which could be modified and expanded upon rather than a book of basic techniques.

I think that for any book about the knitting hobby requires the reader to have experience sufficient to catch any errors which may occur in its text and to modify and expand freely on designs. Membership in a knitting club is also desirable so that other knitters can help sort out problems. I'd not recommend it (or any book at this level) for someone who has less than several years of knitting or who is attempting to use it without peer support.",4.0
"What an amazing book.  I didn't pre-order this as I do most of my knitting books, to be honest, her designs never get stickied when they feature in my favourite knitting mags.  I have admired their technicalities in the past, but usually found them a little shapeless or un-cool.  But after seeing a photo of the funnel sleeved sweater, I had to have this book.  I was a little put off by all the errata comments, but prepared to risk it and wing it.  Anyway, I am pleasantly surprised.  Not only is it the usually beautifully photographed book - fab settings, beautiful models, lovely styling - what one expects from this publisher, basically - but their are a number of items I want to make now.

I removed a star because of the yarns.  No number rating or even a hint of whether a yarn is bulky, worsted, whatever.... in this day and age.  Come on.  This is pure laziness and thoughtlessness.  Furthermore, I don't expect to see a brand new book using Polar - this was discontinued years ago.  Last but not least, many US books now contain m etric measurements - why not here ?  (But this is the least important and I wouldn't have removed a star for it).  I would probably remove another star for the errors but can't reveiew wshat I haven't yet experienced.",4.0
"Great pattern book!  I've learned quite a bit from making the patterns in this book.  This is not a beginner book.  Also, if you are small, like me, you will have to modify the patterns quite a bit.  Most of them are sized for the normal to large range of people.",4.0
"I waited quite some time to buy this book after it was published, and finally purchased it after reading so many positive reviews.  I wasn't disappointed.

Norah Gaughan is one of the most original and creative knitwear designers around, and this book is a great showcase for her patterns.  The inspiration for the patterns come from the shapes found in nature and accordingly the book is divided into sections focusing on Hexagons, Pentagons, Spirals, Phyllotaxis, Fractals, and Waves.

Each chapter begins with an introduction to the geometrical patterns that follow, and this provides a fascinating insight for anyone interested in the mathematics found in nature.  It's refreshing to read a knitting book that is insightful, delving deeper than just a list of patterns.

The patterns in the book are clearly 'inspired by patterns in nature', and the shapes found in the natural world are often merely a jumping off point, as these shapes are then woven in to wearable knitwear designs.  All of the patterns are original and inspiring, and *mostly* very wearable.  Some of the patterns may not suit everyone, such as those with mid-riff bearing shapes, but don't be afraid to check the internet for wonderful versions that other knitters have made.  The best thing about knitting items yourself is the ability to modify patterns to suit yourself.

As other reviewers have said, this book is beautifully presented, and the photography is stunning. Although I haven't knit any of the patterns yet, I often find myself pulling the book off the shelf just to flick through the pages. I'm sure this book will set the standard for knitting books in the future.

I would recommend this book for any intermediate to advanced knitter who is looking for some inspirational ideas.  However, as others have said, be sure to check for the online errata before starting on any of the patterns. It's well worth the purchase price.",4.0
"Very modern designs. These designs are inspiring to more experienced knitters,encouraging to new knitters. Well written book.",4.0
"This is a beautiful book! The photography is stunning, the projects are amazing. The issue is that for a book this beautiful, there are a lot of issues with the patterns. The errata is mind boggling. Now, this may be fixed in later additions, but I expected a lot better pattern checking. If you don't mind trolling in the internet or emailing the publisher for the errata (they sent in within a couple days via email) then buy the book. The projects really are beautiful and it makes a great coffee table book.",4.0
"I'm a bit of a science geek and a hippy, so this book is well suited to my tastes. It has lots of unique designs based on nature's patterns, with interesting construction methods. Fans of textured knits will be happy, but there's very few colourwork patterns.

Drawbacks are a) the lists of errata I've seen online, so check your patterns carefully before you start on them, and b) the photography. The photos themselves are truly beautiful, with stunning scenery, but many don't show the garments' necklines or sides, and it's difficult to tell how they were constructed. It often looked as though the models were too small for the clothes! Given the size of models these days, I'm not really surprised, but it doesn't really show how flattering they are. A quick search online shows pictures of what people have made from the book, and they often look more attractive when shown on a 'real' person.

Because of this, I wouldn't recommend the book to beginner knitters who aren't sure of how to choose a good size. However, intermediate or adventurous knitters looking for something different from the usual sweaters and shawls should definitely check this out.",4.0

"I bought this for my 7 year old for Christmas. She LOVES this. However, copying the patterns require my help. I ended up doing a lot of it for her. Maybe a 9 or 10 year old can do it. I enjoy doing this sort of craft, so I didn't mind. However, all of the jewelry assembly had to be done by me. Much too difficult for her.",4.0
I am pleased with this book. I bought it due to a large stash of sock yarn. I will certainly make some of the projects in this book.,4.0
"I have the second book in the series as well.  There are both written instructions and charts for each of the shawls.  Once blocked, the beautiful lace patterns are very clear and defined.  Why four starts and not five?  Sizing.  When knitting in the gauge, the shawls ran on the small side for the recipients - these shawls knit perfect for someone that wears a solid medium size.  I adjusted the sizing by adding extra row repeats strategically. As for complexity, I am not a good judge for someone else.  I regularly knit ""intermediate"" patterns with no issues.  I recommend if you have a stitch that is new to you, to create a sample and practice the unfamiliar stitch for a few rows.  This way the stitch that is new to you will be even when you knit it within the shawl.  Happy knitting!",4.0
"Nice introductory to lace work and shawl, including short rows, and tab cast on. Pretty patterns, easy to follow instructions! Get this to get your feet wet!",4.0
"Lovely patterns, written & charted. Love the ""Make it bigger"" suggestions.",4.0

Lovely patterns for all levels of experience.,4.0
"These shawls are beautiful, and the best thing about this e-book is that the lace charts are downloadable.  This is a huge advantage with a Kindle Fire since it is almost impossible to knit from a screen before the screen goes dark.  Much better than most of the magazines I've downloaded that have no links for pdf charts.

The illustrations for the tab cast on are also very helpful.  These and the customary stitch abbreviation explanations are toward the back of the book instead of the usual placement at the front.

The only bad thing about this book is deciding which of the patterns to try first!",4.0
I have looked through the book and love every one of the patterns. I am sure I will make several this year. I like knitting shawls with sock yarn because it is strong but light and drapes so nicely. I am afraid this review is not too complete because I have not knitted any of the designs yet. Just bought the book recently.,4.0
Beautiful shawls!  I want to make everyone!  Starting directions were confusing because they are at the back of the book and not referred to.  Also they do not match the beginning stitches listed in each pattern.  Had to really think to figure this out.,4.0
"Knitting intricate patterns with sock yarn is far more user friendly than using lace weight. The patterns are restrained in such fashion, that the wearer would not look as though they had ripped off the family heirloom tablecloth!",4.0
I have a lot of sock yarn I've been trying to find patterns for and now I have the patterns.,4.0
"The pattern instructions are a little confusing since she gives you the lace pattern before the instructions for starting the shawl and carrying on.  Once you get that straight, things are pretty simple.",4.0
"Nice book with some fun ways to use up some of the ""sock yarn stash!""  Most patterns look pretty easy.",4.0

This book really helped me see how to put together the triangles really well.  These were great patterns for a beginner (which I am).,4.0
While lovely to stitch with many colors to complete  several projects they are best suited for the the advanced quilter.,4.0
I like the complexity of the triangles & it appears they are actually simple enough for me to make. I do not have the correct ruler so will have to wait to try it. One thing they suggested using netting to get a shaded effect - I think I will either use slightly darker fabric or try tea dying to get the same effect.,4.0
"Book is great but I don't recommend purchasing the Kindle edition.  There is no way of printing from the Kindle, therefore, you can't print the templates that are supplied in the book.  Spend a bit more and buy the actual book.  Lesson learned :-(",4.0
This book is very detailed with nice illustrations.  I can't wait to actually try one of the projects on my own.,4.0
"This is a very useful tool which I'd love to see just slightly expanded to be even more valuable. I was looking for a way to jump-start the process of explaining saturation/clarity/intensity of color to people and helping them find their best saturation level for wardrobe purposes. This tool gets me most of the way there as it does show about seven saturation levels for each of 24 pure hues.

However, as you look around the hue circle through the 24 hues supplied, there are noticeable jumps or discontinuities. I'd love to see nine cards added: 3.5, 7.5, 10.5; 12.5, 14.5, 18.5; 22.5, 23.5, 24.5/0.5. This would give a more continuous set of hues. While saturation is key, hue is second to it and it would be great to have a more even set of jumps from hue to hue in this collection.

What got me thinking about this in the first place is that I couldn't find a true red, a true blue, or a true yellow in the deck--each blue is either a little on the purple side or a little on the teal side, each red is either a bit to the orange side or a bit to the purple side, and each yellow is a bit to the red side or a bit to the green side, compared to what I'd consider a true red, blue or yellow with no overtones or tilt.

Where this really causes difficulty for some people is this. If you have some yellow or a related tone in your skin, you will be just right with these ""off of true"" shades of blue and red, but if you don't, you need those ""on true"" shades as part of your lineup. It's a shame to have to ask people to extrapolate those colors.

I'm indebted to a thirty-year-old or so copy of a book called Color Wonderful for the saturation emphasis--it was invaluable to me and I still think completely on target. But it's important (and they know this too) to know your best hues as well as your best saturation level.

If this little tool were expanded just a bit it would be a huge help in explaining these concepts and giving the best wardrobe help to others informally.

It would also help to have several gray cards included for wardrobe purposes.",4.0
"The color tool,works as expected.",4.0
Complicated to figure out but the color are nice.,4.0
"I have not had the opportunity to use this yet. It was recommended in an online tutorial on weaving. I work a lot with color. I like the way it's organized for ease of use. My concerns about the differences between printed color and fiber color, are satisfied by the fact it came recommended by a fiber artist.",4.0
It opened up an array of color options to me that I would not have know to try.  I will take this with me whenever I shop for fabric in the future.,4.0
"I haven't had an opportunity to use it extensively, but it is very useful for quilt color design.",4.0
"I am going to use this when I purchase the fabric for making my next quilt.  I want the color combinations to pop,",4.0
Very useful for quilting and any craft project really.  I have learned so much about color combinations by playing with the possibilities this way.,4.0

"I received my first 3-in-1 color tool when Joen Wolfrom's book ""Color Play"" first came out. I loved and used it so much -- for everything from quilting to choosing paint swatches to graphic design -- that it fell apart after about 7 years (not bad for a tool I used at least weekly!). By the time I needed to replace it, this new edition was out. The color swatch pages in the new edition are still neatly organized, and the tool still includes extra items like red & green value finders -- but it doesn't feel nearly as durable as the old model. Thankfully, for this price, I can afford to replace it if it does fall apart.

Even though it feels more flimsy, it's still a very practical tool. My color-selections for quilting have greatly improved now that I can easily sort my fabrics into the appropriate color families. Choosing home-dec accessories to match things around our house is also easier with the handy reminders of what colors make up different color schemes. It's small enough to fit in my purse, making it easy to carry when shopping.",4.0

I don't want to put that much work into a sweater that doesn't fit well and I'm not sure how well I can modify the patterns.  I hope I can because they are spectacular.",4.0
"The sweaters in this book are among the most beautiful I've ever seen and they are worth the price.  Anyone who enjoys colorful knitting would do well to buy this book.  That said, the photos are more about the scenery than the sweaters.  It's difficult to see parts of some sweaters due to positioning of the models or distance to the camera.  Also, the charts are incredibly small and difficult to see.  The book is 12 inches high by 10 inches wide and the Modell Jumfru vest chart is 5 inches high(!) and the largest sweater charts are 8.5 inches high.  Some of the sweaters are knit in dark colors so the graph squares are almost impossible to see.  Many people on ravelry complained that they had to crank up their glasses and photocopy the charts to supersize just to be able to read them properly to knit.  So, if you love stranded knitting and you can tolerate the charts, buy this book.  I'm going to try to deal with them because there are some awesome sweaters in here.",4.0
"It is small and light weight, comes in about three pieces that screw together easily.  The light IS might bright for an LED lamp and the combination of light and magnifier are exactly what i needed for my purposes.  What I like about it is it's easy to move, it's not as tall as the average floor lamp, it's 3/4 height.  The only problem with it is the base could be a little heavier and I would increase the overlap of the base pole and the lamp pole interlocking by about two inches, because unless it is positioned carefully the heavy top does topple the rest of it over...it topples but does not break, and it won't hurt anything or anybody because it's light weight.  Overall, a very good investment for the money, green and I can feel the difference in terms of radiation over the old luminescent/fluorescent lamps i have used in the past.  This is basically a TASK lamp.  For reading, for seeing fine print, for seeing serial numbers and for threading needles, that's what i use it for.

11.28.12 broke after a few months, switch would not work to turn off/on.",4.0
"I just purchased this light, and I too had difficulties with the stand not staying attached to the base. I was able to get the pole to screw into the base however. I took the entire pole assembly, straightened out the magnifier so it was in line with the rest of the pole instead of curved. Then after making sure the cord was out of the way, I pushed down HARD on the entire pole and turned the base. Success!  I was able to get the base to stay attached to the pole and the whole thing seems quite stable. Time will tell if it stays together. Love the height and clarity of the magnifier.",4.0
"I bought this Mighty Bright magnifier for my mother-in-law to use by her chair to read. IT works great except the swivel is unstable and she is constantly getting it off and it either falls or leans against the bed. For someone with greater mobility and dexterity it would work fine. In the description it would have been helpful to know that the bulbs are not replaceable. They are good for 100,000 hours, but then the lamp will go in the trash. 100,000 hours is a long time, but she goes to sleep while reading and the light is on for her naps.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mighty-Bright-12-LED-Lighted-Magnifier-Floor-Lamp/dp/1933622695/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mighty Bright 12 LED Lighted Magnifier Floor Lamp</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mighty-Bright-12-LED-Lighted-Magnifier-Floor-Lamp/dp/1933622695/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mighty Bright 12 LED Lighted Magnifier Floor Lamp</a>",4.0

Pretty good pencils. Sharpen well. My 7th graders like them.,4.0
This is not the Swiss made Faber-Castell colored pencils. They are made in India and are for the value-conscious market. The pencils do have decent color vibrancy and works well on paper. This is very appropriate for little kids who are working themselves up from using crayons to more accurate forms of drawing and coloring. Very good value and appropriate for little kids.,4.0
good quality product and a very comfortable price,4.0
"Excellent quality for a low price. I bought 2 sets of these pencils, one set came in good shape but the other one was all beat up and opened when it arrived. I didn't mind though cause I had planned to give one as a gift and one to keep for myself so I kept the beat up one.",4.0
Great quality colored pencils at a great price. Colors are very vibrant. My only stink is that many of the colors are too close in color to other ones. Sometime i'm confused as to what pencil I used.,4.0
"Good value for decent quality colored pencils. They are triangular in cross section with rounded edges for a very comfortable grip, and they don't have the tendency to ""wax coat"" the paper as cheaper colored pencils do. I wouldn't compare these to professional artist quality colored pencils, but if you're using them for adult coloring books (or kids!), you'll be satisfied. Will definitely order these again once I've used up what I've purchased.",4.0
"Gift for my brother, he says they are almost as good as Venus",4.0
"I wanted soft lead colored pencils to use in adult coloring books. These have a triangular barrel designed to give a wider surface to grip and minimize slippage. I haven't used them enough yet to tell if this design is better or worse than any other; right now they just feel a little awkward in my hand. Haven't had to sharpen one yet; they are supposed to resist breakage & work in standard sharpeners according to the box info. The colors are nice & I am very happy this set includes a metallic looking gold & silver toned pencil. The colors apply smoothly & seem more richly pigmented that some of my others...I can't compare them to high end artist grade pencils however, just to brands frequently seen in many local stores. I'm pleased with these and consider them well worth the money. I think these are great for kids & adults or if you need to buy a larger quantity for a classroom. I do like the softer lead and would buy this exact set again in a heartbeat.",4.0
"For the price these are the best budget pencil you can get your hands on. So if you're tri curious you should definitely get a pack of these or two if you're new to pencil art. They will suffice without breaking the bank, and you'll learn the basics of different applications and shading without losing money on the more expensive Prismacolor Scholors. These are fun grade pencils and while they go down thick and nice, keep in mind they have no light fast qualities so don't expose your work to sun.

I recommend these above all else for beginners and hobbyists who just need a cheap set of pencils to mess with. They are the best student grade on the market for the low price.

Enjoy!!!",4.0

"I have to be honest - I already have quite a collection of Moleskine notebooks and love them all. However, I will say that I found this recipe journal to be the perfect companion. I consider myself a home cook with a penchant for collecting, organizing and categorizing my recipes into favorites folders within Firefox. However, it isn't always safe for my computer on the kitchen counter.

The pages in the recipe journal give you enough room to record a standard recipe if you don't mind keeping your handwriting pretty small. I had to shrink mine a bit after a few of my longer recipes had ingredients squeezed into the margins. I found the space for rating the recipes - 0 to 5 stars - a little unnecessary. If I think a recipe is worth anything BUT 5 stars, I'm not wasting any Moleskine pages on it at all.

Loved the blank tabbed pages in the back and the adjoining stickers - there are LOTS to choose from - that let you create your own sections. However, the actual layout of those pages isn't really conducive to writing more recipes. You get a page split up into smaller sections horizontally and none of the nifty layout from the pre-labeled recipe sections.

I should also mention that the wine pairing space provided didn't get much use. I actually took it upon myself to LOOK UP wine pairings for some of my favorite recipes though, and to that end at least I've been prompted to learn something about wine/food.

All in all, this is a great companion for any foodie who has an appreciation for Moleskine's craftsmanship. If you ask me, sure beats having a tin full of index cards or a box full of clipped recipes.

Assuming I eventually fill up my recipe journal - I've just begun - I would definitely buy another one. Lets me take ownership of recipes and add my own variations.",4.0
I wish the pages lent themselves to multi-page recipes better. Otherwise its awesome.,4.0

If you're looking for something detailed this is what you want.",4.0
"I love journals in general and Moleskine products in particular.  I'm trying to become healthier and more active, and it's always easier to do when you can see the steps you've taken, and the improvements you've made.  The Wellness Journal is a wonderful tool to help you do just that.

There are some pages with content I can't imagine anyone needing:  clothing size conversions from US to UK etc, the growing seasons for various foods in each hemisphere, the calories for certain foods, but then, I'm not using it as a diet journal, so this is a matter of personal preference.  Fortunately, if you need the pages, but not the content, Moleskine has printable templates, and you can just print, cutout, and paste whatever content you'd rather have.

If you do decide to use this for a diet/nutritional wellness journal, you should be warned that despite having over a year's worth of goals and many entry slots for exercises and sports, there are only about 30 days worth of food journal pages in that section, and you'd need to make a jump over to the blank sections in the back to continue.  Thankfully, the pages are numbered, and there's an index in the back of the book that makes jumping around in your journal easy and convenient.

I love the extra organizational boost of having a lot of really useful sections already included in attractive formats, and I've already customized some of the printable templates for my specific needs, making this a fantastic, stylish, personal tool that's really helping me achieve my goals.",4.0

There are sections that are of no use to me (Games-Sports,Inspirations)but because of the stickers that are included,I can change those sections into something I can use.

It's great having a well appointed journal that's so nicely set up and and ready to change into what you need for your daily use.",4.0
Everything I wanted in this type of journal. I find it immensely customizable and it suits my needs perfectly. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a convenient way to track diet & exercise.,4.0

"Could use a larger ""notes"" section and lined pages would be nice.",4.0
good,4.0
I actually was pleasantly surprised with this. After reading reviews I was hesitant but decided to take a chance. It is actually a lot bigger than I expected. And I can write normally in the space of the page. The downside is I don't make cocktails so I find that to be a waste of space. Also there is a space for appetizers and another for first course. Bit confusing but not a big deal as I can easily repurpose as I'd like. In all I believe this will fit my purposes to log my recipes.,4.0
Great recipe book for the recipes I like to cook. Including the ones I have for special occasions. I would like it have to some lined pages so I'm not writing on a blank square. But I can make do without.,4.0

"The quality of the product is Moleskine quality (read excellent). I like the set-up of it, the extras (stickers and blank pages).

Otherwise, an excellent product.",4.0
"At $5 less than Barnes and Noble, this journal is a steal!  Classic Moleskine quality.  I plan on putting this to good use.  I do wish it was a little larger, as I might have trouble fitting more complicated recipes on a page, but other than that I am very pleased with it.",4.0
"I want so badly to give this 5 stars. I love it! I like that it provides designated spaces to write the length of prep time, cook time, and notes. It includes all of the sections I could think to use, but unfortunately, because it includes all of those sections, the space to write in is minimal. If you aren't the most concise person or have large handwriting, this journal will be difficult. I'd be thrilled if each recipe space expanded over two pages-- I've had to use the opposite page more than a couple of times. The notes section is just tiny! I end up writing the ingredients and MAYBE all of the directions on one side, and use the opposite page for notes. Otherwise it just wouldn't work. Kind of disappointing that it takes up space that could be used for other recipes, but, as a beginner cook, I have plenty of spare pages so far. Otherwise, I love the layout, and the Moleskine material is wonderful, as always.",4.0

I do recommend this product.",4.0
"This Moleskine Journal is very high quality book with a band to keep it closed so it doesn't get crumpled in your bag as well as the ribbon book marks. This version is called a Wellness Journal. They picked the sections and gave you a set number of pages for each one. This makes it not as flexible as the generic versions of the book. For some people this might be a great way to get started tracking diet and exercise. For others, it may be too rigid to work for them.

My advice is to thoroughly check out the sections in this version and make sure they will work for you. Note that there are not a lot of pages for tracking your daily diet.",4.0

"I've been using this as my primary recipe journal for a couple of years now and for the most part have no complaints. It has some great information and features that some other journals wouldn't have.

The typical Moleskine strap helps keep miscellaneous notes stored in place inside, and an accordion pocket in the back helps with that as well. It comes with a couple of sticker sheets to allow you to mark off certain recipes with ""love this!"" or ""what if..."" or more. There's also a sticker sheet of categories that you can use for the pages with blank tabs (""My Favorites"" or ""Cooking Courses"" or ""Websites"" or ""Table Setting"" or ""Veggie/Vegan"") but you can always write in whatever other categories you'd like instead (I've written in ""Frosting"" and ""Miscellaneous"" in mine but find the sticker idea clever and they have lots of options).

These blank tabs, however, leave something to be desired. As other reviewers have mentioned, they don't mimic the style of the pre-set categories with spaces for the recipe title, ingredients, preparation, how many it serves, difficulty of the recipe, etc. The extra tabs are just blank spaces with randomly spaced lines to separate ideas (which I just usually ignore anyway). Regardless, I'm glad they have blank space, because some of the pre-set categories (like ""cocktails"" for me) just don't get used, while I require a lot more space for things like types of frosting.

The front of the journal comes with a lot of cool information (though I can't admit I use it all that often) such as a calendar of when certain food products are in season (and there are even separate calendars for the Northern and Southern hemispheres). There are food facts (such as calories, carbs, protein, and fat in common foods) and a conversion chart.

One of the more cool parts that I hadn't even noticed until several months of using this journal is there's a mostly blank index in the back so you can fill in your recipe titles and have an easier way to find what pages things are on later.

Overall, this is a pretty great recipe journal. There are certain things that aren't necessarily perfected and could use improving, but they are all mostly minor and the pros most definitely outweigh the cons.",4.0
Overall the journal itself is great but the cover on mine has something about Avacados from Mexico stamped on it as a decoration and I don't care for it.,4.0
"This is a beautiful moleskine journal. Having said that I do believe it is worth mentioning that it is not a very big journal. It's divided by subjects which is ok for organization but if you have more desserts than meat recipes, well let's just say you can't do anything about it. Also the space to write the recipe by itself is not very big.",4.0
"Great format, just wish there was a way to expand without cutting out templates. I definitely am going to need more recipe pages. Love it for when I alter recipes. Could only be better if integrated with Evernote.",4.0
"It's a great and efficient book to keep all of your recipes handy, although after the main tabs the format for the rest of the book is a different format than the one at the beginning of the book, so you have to print out and paste the format from the other pages in order to have an adequate format. That's the only complaint, otherwise, love it.",4.0
I like how neat this recipe book is. I just had to think about how I wanted to organize everything and it's kind of small to look at when you are cooking.,4.0
"The moleskine Planner is perfect for those small hand me down and internet downloaded recipes. The cover is a black soft leather with glossy imprints fg kitchen utensils. A black back -attached elastic band easily holds the book together.  The beginning pages include useful things like a planning section with events/dates/notes column, a food harvest calender for the chart for the northern and southern hemisphere, A food fact chart charting common foods, amt of one serving, calories/carbs/protein and fat, a measurement and conversion page and a small separate booklet that translates between English, French, German, Italian, Korean (I think) and Spanish. The pages are very detailed, yet sparse. In the 8"" x 5"" journal, you only have about a three by four inch rectangle to right down the preparation instructions. Each page has a separate recipe heading, ingredient and preparation block, on the side there is a column that allows you to rate the difficulty (by coloring in any of the 5 empty circles), servings indicator (again choosing the 2/4/6/8 or ... circle choices), a place to write preparation time, cooking time, cooking process (with a picture and space for a microwave, oven and stove, wine pairings, notes, and rating (where you color in the 5 outline of stars).

The book is clearly divided by tabs - pre-labeled already by subjects such as Appetizers, First Courses, Main Dishes, Side Dishes, Desserts and Cocktails. The next section allows the user to choose 5 additional tabs, from the included sticker sheets or writing in their own. However, this option doesn't have the previous layout of pages, instead has rows of 4 by and inch and a half blocks to write or in my case, print and paste. There is an index in the back where you can print in your entree to the corresponding page number and a 2 part accordion folder to store recipes in.

This is perfect for food and wine lovers.",4.0
"This is a well divided and useful item. It has extras for organizing your work, and
As a serious cook, i need to write down all of my best recipes, and this is a good way to do it for future reference, but probably not just daily use.

I really like it-- the binding is good, the pages are thick enough that inks don't bleed through, and I love the cover design and all the little stickers it comes with. The one issue I have with it is that I dislike the alphabetic tabs they set up. Lets face it, you're probably not going to watch very many movies that start with ""X!"". I think in the future, I would probably just ignore the letters and fill out the pages in order by date. If moleskine has any plans on updating this, I'd suggest that they do away with the letters and maybe just go by month?",4.0
"I love moleskines, and when I saw this, I was really excited and bougth it for myself even though I was Christmas shopping at the time.  It is a little too organized for me, since I would rather record chronologically instead of organized by type of recipe, but I can see the usefulness in that.  I won't use all of the features (stickers, symbols and categories) but it is nice to have them just in case.",4.0
"I love written information, but I guess this journal goes a little overboard when it come to minute detail so that it shorts you on space for the recipes you really want. Isn't there a better place to plan for your dinner parties so these pages can be used for something more likely to be revisited? As far as ink bleeding, what worked best was one of my scrapbooking pens - a Micron. Regular ink pens soaked through. But the purpose for this was to give my reciepes to my college daughter so I didn't get the last minute texts on how to make something while she is in the grocery store and I don't have a cookbook in front of me. It suits in that she will like the style and size, though she will never use the extra details mentioned earlier. It is cool looking.",4.0

I always end up looking up a few particular recipes online over and over again, so I started writing them down in this.

-1 star for the fact that the extra pages in the back don't fit completely in the expandable pocket in the back, so they got smooshed.

 It's a good size (not too big, but much bigger than a typical small moleskine), stays open while you're writing or looking at recipes, and comes with some nifty extras. About half the book is sections of blank, lined pages. Included are 2 pages of decorative stickers and 2 pages of stickers for you to add you own custom sections:

pasta, rice, meat, poultry, fish, cheese, vegetables, salads, sauces, preserves, jams, pickles, cakes and pies, cookies, snacks, finger foods, sandwiches, starters, entrees, dinner, tea time, brunch, BBQ, veggie * vegan, kid-friendly, international, ready in 5!, mom's recipes, religious festivals, celebration foods, birthdays, wines, My favorites, events, cooking courses, tasting events, menu * guests * date, tours, contacts, wine shops, food shops, restaurants, articles, reviews, magazines, guides, websites, communities, facebook groups (what?!), my YouTube (uh ... ok), Online Stores, Online Bookshops, Shopping Online, news sites, review sites, to remember, menus, likes, dislikes, shopping list, allergies, intolerances, leftovers, tips and hints, table setting, glossary, and Watch Out For!

Whew! Some of those are pretty silly. In fact, about half of them don't really have much to do with recipes, at least as far as any sane person would organize their recipe. I certainly wouldn't remember a recipe based on whether it came from an online store or youtube - I'd remember the ingredients, and look it up by ""salads"" or ""pasta"". I guess you could use those labels to keep track of websites or (hahah) Facebook Groups, but there are only FOUR unlabeled sections in this moleskine. So organizing that way wouldn't make much sense, either. I'm thinking someone was just having fun coming up with enough extra labels to fill up a second sheet of labels...

There are also two sheets of labels with stickers that look like little hearts, exclamation marks, sad face and happy face emoticons, stars, ""wow!""s, thumbs ups, and thumbs downs. There are also a few choices for what to put in the flat, rectangular spot on the spine of the journal itself.

Lastly, there's an insert with translations, so you can look up food-related words like ""basil"", ""teaspoon"", or ""personal tabbed pages"". That last one is ""pagine a tacche da parsonalizzare"" in Italiano, if you were curious. :)",4.0
"I just received the Moleskine Recipe Journal for Mother's Day, after admiring it for a couple of weeks.  I am a bonafide foodie and constantly create recipes, jot them down somewhere, then forget where I put them because I neglected to place the piece of paper in my recipe binder. This gives me a single place to both jot down the recipes AND keep them, along with all the other wonderful information in this little book. The pages are plenty roomy enough for me to write in, and as for the blank pages with the smaller sections that some were complaining about, I just used the whole page for my recipes.  I've created several of my own sections with those pages and love the stickers and labels that come with the notebook. The only slight disappointment was that after watching the ad video, I thought I could attach photographs to my recipes.  Such is not the case. There just isn't room. All in all, I love this little gem and anticipate filling a few of them. :-)",4.0
"I would like to start this off by saying do not watch the video associated with this product. it will show you nothing and do nothing but confuse.
As a chef, I am always looking for something to keep my recipes in. The big and sometimes bulky binders are O.K., but lugging them around gets tiring and I have already filled up three of them. This Recipe Journal caught my eye and after receiving it and putting it through an initial inspection, I was very pleased. I thought it was the coolest thing.
The book does lay flat for easy reading. The size is perfect, slim and light. I probably will not use the stickers that came with it but I might utilize the templates that you can find online at [...].
The only riff I have with this is that you cannot add extra pages or take pages out. Choose the recipes that you add wisely.",4.0
"This is a splendid notebook for recording recipes, but I would have liked to have seen sections designed for soups and salads. Otherwise, well done Moleskine.",4.0
Just the journal I was looking for...but it's so compact!  I need more room to write (I don't write small print).  I find a way around this by cut-and-pasting recipes using the PDF form found on the official website.,4.0
"So well designed and great for your own recipes and also customizing sections yourself.
Space is a bit tight for the individual recipe, but you can always write in a smaller handwriting, or type and print out the recipe!",4.0
"Why am I ever surprised that Moleskine products are so amazing? Not only does this recipe journal look nice, but the quality of the paper is astounding. There is tons of room to write in many, many recipes. I love how the book is divided into sections. The only thing I don't like is how there is a pre-created section for cocktails. I understand that there are people out there who are going to love this section, but as I am not a drinker to me it is just a waste of a section that then requires me to either leave it blank (which is about 20 pages worth of the journal) or scratch out and re-write everything (which isn't that difficult, but it is just obnoxious). I do love how there is an index section in the back where you can fill out page-by-page what is in your journal. If you are looking for a nice, attractive, recipe journal this is the book for you. Besides with Amazon offering it at such a great price how can you refuse?",4.0
"I bought this strictly for family classics that don't exactly match the details you find in the published books because they have been adjusted over three generations to meet our tastes and cooking methods. This handy little book is good for that. On the down side the paper is a little thin, so I recommend using pencil, there isn't much room for ingredients and the section for cocktails could have been done without - I can't see most people these days having that many drink recipes.  The stickers for the outer spine don't stick so it isn't worth trying and extra pages in the front sections would be helpful.

You will need some lateral thinking to use the extra section titles provided but they can work. The stickers with things like `love this' and `hate this' I viewed as prompts to remind me which relatives really loved or hated the item, same with the frowning and smiling faces. Considering the options out there this is worth the time but it isn't perfect and can be hard to find in the stores. I have two now and they are invaluable.",4.0
"I recently received my Moleskine Passions Recipe Journal and, overall, I am very pleased with it. The layout is very organized but a little cramped. It's not useful for writing recipes with lots of ingredients or complex preparations if you don't have small handwriting. As a college student, it works rather well for me since I have fairly simple recipes. The one thing I don't like is an entire section devoted to cocktails since it's not something I would use. It could probably be repurposed for smoothies or other drinks but I would rather have more space for food recipes. However, there are plenty of blank pages in the back and even a small file folder (2 pockets) to put recipe cards or other papers. In the end, I'm happy I bought it and, depending on my future needs, I may buy this again especially if the cocktail section is removed in a future edition.",4.0
"As a budding cook, I found this Moleskine Recipe Journal to be the perfect thing to jumpstart my cooking.  It's a smaller, diary-type recipe book (5""x8 1/4"") and comes with a three-pronged bookmark so you can have it mark three different places to reference at once.  It's divided into a few different sections. the first offers up tips and conversions for cooks.  Very handy for those, like me, who are just starting and need the reference.  The second section is the biggest part, since it has six tabbed areas, pre-labeled for your recipes.  The six tabs here are pretty generic:  appetizers, first courses, main dishes, side dishes, desserts, and cocktails.  Each section can store about 16 or so recipes.  I wish there were more pages, though, because some of them will fill up quickly.  The final section has blank tabbed areas followed by simply blank pages.  It also comes with stickers to assign to this last section, for more recipes sections.  It even comes with an indexing system, so you can index your recipes.  Very cool.

Really, the only complaint I can muster about this book is the space size for writing recipes.  I have horrible handwriting, which isn't the journal's fault, but it is exacerbated by the fact that I don't have a lot of room to write.  I sometimes found myself, especially in the ingredient section, struggling to make things fit.  It works better with recipes with fewer steps and ingredients, of course, but even medium-sized recipes were difficult to fit in, I found.  I also found some of the additions to the recipes to be superfluous.  Down the side of each page are little areas where you can mark how many the recipe feeds, wine pairings, a five star system for how good the recipe is, etc.  But I have to ask, if it's a crappy recipe, why would you waste the pages in your journal for it?  In the end though, this is a fantastic journal that's small, compact and durable (which is a must for the way I cook!).  I've already started adding recipes to it and I used it as a guide to make fajitas this week.  All in all, a great journal and it's becoming increasingly indispensible.",4.0
"This is my third moleskine purchase... I love their prouduct. This one could use 2 changes. The tabs are already printed & marked. I would a better rating if this came with Avery labels for printers rather than handwritten labels. They could ditch the drink part as well, more space for food.",4.0
"I'm a pretty big fan of Moleskine journals as it is, but this is the first time I've come into contact with a pre-lined/organized journal that was this well laid out.  The basic idea behind the Moleskine Passions Recipe Journal is to provide a compact, neat/organized way to keep a record of cooking experiences.  I'm the main cook in my household, and I've been looking for a simple way to keep track of my dishes in a nice neat manner.

What I think is truly exceptional about Moleskine's approach was to first, eschew the standard alpha-organizational format, and to instead go with a highly customizable, three-section format.

Section one short and contains some general info for cooks and food lovers (including some common weight and volume conversions, general ingredient seasonality, and some basic nutrition infor for some commonly used ingredients/food products.)

Section two is broken down into five tabbed chapters (pre-labeled for appetizers, 1st courses, main dishes, side dishes, desserts, and cocktails.)  Each chapter consists of 16 pages that are set up with a standard recipe format (including sections on each page to list title, ingredients, instructions, cooking time, prep time, servings, etc.)  Even though these chapters are pre-labeled, the journal comes with two sheets of replacement chapter labels with common descriptions (as well as some blank stickers to make you own headings.)

Section three is broken down into two parts.  Part one is broken into five more tabbed chapters of blank lined paper.  Part two is completely blank pages.

What's sort of ingenious is that the entire journal has numbered pages and there is an included index section that is broken down by page so that you can index your recipes, notes, etc conveniently with no real effort.  There's also some more nice built-in features like an included fold out pocket in the back to store loose notes and collected recipes, three bound cloth bookmarks, and a cloth/elastic band that keeps the notebook closed and the contents securely in place when not in use.

There are some included sections that might be superfluous (like sections to record dish difficulty ratings as well as overall ratings), but I personally think this is a near perfect journal of keeping up with the passion to cook.  I'm positive I'll be picking up more of these as the time goes on...",4.0
"What a great idea this little book is.  A place for every recipe with easily located divisions, some pages with formats to fill in, some blank to write a recipe however  you wish.  This would make a great wedding, birthday, or Mothers Day gift.  When filled in, it will be a treasured keepsake for the family.  All this inside and a very nice and durable cover outside.  The reason I gave only 4 stars is that the printing and the beige pages are somewhat challenging to read.",4.0
"I really love the Moleskine Recipe Journal, I come from a family that loves to cook, but we each have our own twist on the same recipes. This is a great way to collect all those recipes you love in one place and to change them however you want! I would say it's deserving of a 5 star rating except there aren't as many pages of the full recipe layout as I would like - the last half of it is divided into 4 blank sections - a little smaller than the size of a recipe card. These sections are great for small recipes or notes, but I would much rather have more of the in depth pages that sold me on this journal in the first place.",4.0
"How much you like this book will depend on what you want to use this book for. Half the book has the recipe template (you can view this on (...) and 6 tabbed sections labeled Appetizer, First Course, Main Dishes, Side Dishes, Desserts and Cocktails. The other half of the book has 6 tabbed sections with no labels and the page has 6 lines on it making 6 small rectangles. There is also an index in the back so you can quickly look up recipes and stickers to place on the tabs with various other labels such as Jams, Breakfast etc and a few blank ones so you can write your own. The 3 separate book marks also come in handy when cooking more than one dish.

The recipe section works great and I am really satisfied with this section, but I was disappointed to find that half the book does not have the recipe template. I can go online at (...) and print out the template and paste it onto those pages that do not have it, but this adds bulk to the book and extra time. If your trying to ""scrapbook"" your recipes this might work great for you, as you can have your recipe on one page and place photos, notes or memories on another page in the back that won't be damaged by cooking. But I just wanted a recipe book that I could write in new recipes at cooking classes and events, so half the book will need to be ""pasted"" in.

So the book only gets 4 stars from me. The look and feel of the journal is great and perhaps one section for extra notes or event listings would have been great, but not half the book.",4.0

It is alphabetically tabbed so you need only run your thumb down the tabs to find what you're looking for. And I've saved the best for last - it is just lined so you are unconstrained as to how and how much information you put in each entry.
Why only 4 stars? I'd like to see another page or maybe even two in each section. I don't think it would effect the convenience factor.",4.0

The end papers are adorned with Saint-Exupry's illustrations. There is a pocket on the inside back cover. The pages are blank.

REVIEW:
My one complaint --- and this is with all Moleskine journals, so I knew what I was getting into --- is that the pages are too thin. The paper is not adequate for writing or drawing in ink. You will not be able to use both sides of each page.

Paper aside, the design of the book is lovely and the book, as all Moleskine journals, is well-constructed.

Ideally, I would love this notebook with the Moleskine watercolor pages. The Moleskine watercolor notebooks have more substantial weight paper suitable for sketching, drawing, and writing with ink.",4.0

"I ordered these Oct 1st.  I found out later that this item does ship from China. This is the reason why it took so long to get to me (3 weeks). I also not sure that these are Swarovski Crystals or some other name brand spacer beads.  These also maybe 2nds from a China base factory for beads.  Again, there is nothing wrong in this but it should be stated on where this stuff comes from.  They are very inexpensive which caught my ""Beading"" eye.....I found with dealing with products from China, that counting to see how many you really receive is a must.  This seller actually read my note to them that I received the beads but 12 beads were missing.  They mailed me the missing beads plus another 10 to make up for waiting for them.  That was very nice of them.  It's a ""pain"" to count the beads but at least this seller reads your complaints and answers you and tries to make good on their promise in correcting their mistake.  I feel that this seller is trying to be a good on line seller.  Not all bead sellers from China are taking my advice in dealing with USA beaders.....Yes, we can be fussy but if you tell me that am getting ""100"" beads at a certain Price....I better receive ""100 beads"" at that price am paying you.  So I can say...give this store a try.",4.0

"very cool, but a lot harder than i remember this being to create last time i made one a few years ago.  it's almost impossible to get the mixture to the right texture & make a smooth enough surface(as seen in pics & instructions) so the paw print comes out decent looking and if you are lucky enough to do so, to have any remaining room for any writing and/or decorating.  it may have been the air temp tho that affected this, last time i did it was summer & humid outside & so was easier to smooth the pallet & keep the mix from drying out before it was even poured.  i did this time in my kitchen in dead of winter with the window cracked since i was dying from the fumes of the mixture.  i think this made the mix a come out funky.  you need to do this OUTSIDE!!!  it creates soooo much dust when mixing, even when just emptying the powder into a bucket!!! be prepared to throw away whatever u use to make the mixture in, not simply ""rinse it out"" as the directions say.  that stuff is like concrete it clogs any drain, go to dollar store & get a cheap bucket.  overall cute & memorable keepsake, but creates a mess not to mention u need to wash the dog's paws off after really well with soap & hot water so that goop doesn't cake on them so plan also to end up giving ur dog a bath too after fussing with this mix stuff for an hour!!  i'm opting next time for the kit where it's just a paw print made using paint & then framed.",4.0
"I found this on here while looking for an original gift to get for my finance's mother (whose in love with her cat). After seeing the results I put it on my amazon wish list for Christmas.

"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who enjoys gardening and loves his getting older pup. The directions were very clear and the box provided everything that you would need for this project. Follow the mixing instructions!!! We waited for maybe 15 minutes after mixing to let it solidify a little before having his dog step on the wet stone to leave her paw print. She didn't freak out and let us wash her paw after just in case any cement might have been stuck to the bottom of her paw.

My only possible complaint for this stepping stone was that the decorations provided were not that pretty. We ended up breaking some wine bottles and finding little stones outside of his house to use in addition to some of the prettier stones that were provided in the box. But that only added to the the memory I suppose :) So I would recommend splurging on a better mosaic stones kit to enhance this product but otherwise, a great product and fun to do!",4.0
"So far, this product has worked as expected. I'm still waiting for it to set. The only negative I can think of is the ugly stones that come with it. I bought some accessories separately and I think it came out fine. I used shells and blue tiles since my dog loves the beach.

I had no problem mixing it or pouring it, but you should probably just buy a cheap bucket as suggested by another user. You can't really wash out what's left or you'll have concrete all over the ground. I'd just toss the bucket.

Also, my dog has naturally long claws. I promise it is not a bear cub print. It is a dog paw print.",4.0

Removing the backing wasn't too difficult either. It took 3 minutes to iron on the image and let it cool.

Then just print, cut and iron on your item.

I would buy these again because they did what I needed and I have recommended them to friends for other party or ideas.  Its funny to create a NFL logo with your last name across the back.  Iron it on to a colored child's onesie you get at Walmart or someplace cheap and its an instant hit at any sporting event.

"After making 29 shirts for our youth Sunday at church I think I have the hang of it.  Duh- it's all about following the directions.
The process works well but there is little margin for error, even when I though I did it the same way every time there were still minor flaws. That's why I gave a 4 instead of a 5. If you don't iron exactly the right amount of time or with even pressure and placement of the iron there are minor imperfections that happen when the paper sticks while being removed.  So I used a timer, paid attention to the directions and followed them exactly and they did turn out beautifully.
I have used other brands and I prefer this one because the transfer itself ends up being almost entirely clear.  Some other brands left a yellowish or opaque film in the white spaces that was distracting in the finished product.",4.0
"After reading other reviews, I was nervous as this was the first time I've ever done an iron-on.  Since I only had one shirt to do, I only had one shot at getting it right.  I'm happy to say that the whole process was easy and it turned out really well.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and let the transfer cool completely before removing the paper, rather than the 1 minute it says in the directions. The paper came off easily and the color didn't smear or run at all.  The color could have been just a bit more vivid, otherwise I would have given 5 stars.  I would like to add, however, that I have not yet washed the shirt, so I can't comment on the durability of the transfer.",4.0
"I've used both H-P and Office Depot transfers, & been happy with both.  Both went on easily & did not peel off in washing, although there was some fading after a number of months.  This may have been  avoided with more careful laundering.  I liked the Office Depot somewhat better--but both were satisfactory.  I have to say that the Avery dark t-shirt transfers are ones I would never use again because not only did the black ink in my Epson printer bleed with the Avery transfers, but the two times I attempted to used them, my printer stopped printing in black and caused me no end of trouble.  I would be wary of the Avery.  I plan to stick to the two brands I've had luck with.",4.0
"The wood burning pen takes forever to heat up to be able to burn the wood correctly. Also, the pointy tip will not burn a straight line and not sure how to do it so the line doesn't look broken. The pen handle also gets very hot  and you have to hold it further up which makes it hard to control.

However, it's amazingly sturdy (we have it against the wall), and I suspect our daughter could stand on it without breaking it.  The chairs are also very sturdy, evrything is built with really big posts and thick plastic, so it's tough.  We didn't put that sticker on the side, so it looks a little better.

The set is very sturdy-- my husband and I can both sit in the other chair when my dictator son demands it. ;)  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is b/c we needed to buy non-slip pads for the chairs since we're using the set on a wooden floor surface-- the chairs kept slipping out from under my son, but once we stuck the cheap pads on (from Walmart), it's been perfect!",4.0
"I purchased this product for my 16 month old daughter for her play area.

Pros
No stress in putting this together - so easy and uncomplicated unlike so many children's products out there today! Legs just snapped onto the bottom of table top and it was ready to go in five minutes.
My daughter colors, plays and even eats at her little table. For the money - this set is worth every penny!

Cons
The only con is that the chairs are very lightweight, so if you're child is very physical and likes to push and lift things you need to be careful. Chairs are not stable and can wobble when kids are trying to climb on and sit.",4.0
"I bought this table for my son who uses it very often. Color time, reading time, eating time and sometimes he just plays with his cars on it. The table top is a good size for 2 kids even if they are sitting down for a meal. I like the sticker which goes around it. Wipes clean easily.
The best thing I like about this table, my 2 year old loves to drag it around the house. They are pretty light and no scratches on the hardwood floor. That's one of the reasons I didn't buy him a wood table set. They are not ""slippery"" but the table slides here and there when he's eating or playing on it. So I have glued on small patches of ""felt"" under the table legs. That keeps it in place.
Overall it's a good table and even after using it for 4 months, I am pretty satisfied with it.",4.0
We love this table. It is very sturdy. Our daughter fits in the seats well and for the price this is the best table and chairs.,4.0
Table and chair were shipped very quickly.  The price was much better than any of the big name toy stores.  Table is a great size for toddlers and chairs are sturdy.,4.0
I ordered this set for my two year old great grandson and he absolutely loves it.  I couldn't have bought him anything better.  It is the perfect size for him and will be for at least the nest couple of years. It is very durable as all Little Tykes products are.  It was a great choice.,4.0
"This is a great table and chair set. My son 2 year old son loves it and it was relatively cheap in comparison to ones like it but I have found that although they are sturdy, the chairs tip over fairly easily and he's fallen off a few times, but never been hurt because they're are quite low.  Perhaps he just needs a bit more practice sitting on chairs.",4.0
I purchased this table and chairs for my in-home daycare. The kids love it. The only problem I have so far is that the kids sometimes slide of the chairs easily. Other than that it is very durable and should last a long time!,4.0
My toddler uses this table to color and eat on. It is easy to clean and works great for my 18 month old. It was easy to put together. I would have liked two more chairs to come with it but for the price the two work fine. The table and chairs are sturdy as I am able to sit with him in them. I am happy with my purchase.,4.0
"Ok for the price but if you're kid is short, the chairs may be a little to high for their feet to touch the ground.",4.0
"This is very cute table and firm. My 4 years old son loves this table and chairs. But, I think this is so small for two kids. For one kids,everything is perfect!",4.0
"This table and chair set is adorable, and my 16 mos twins (boy/girl) really like sitting at the table like big kids.  With time, they'll learn to sit for longer periods, but for now they sit for 5 minutes at a time and then want to start climbing on the chairs.  for that reason, I wish the chairs were heavier (they're extremely light) so they couldn't turn them over as easily, but the fact that they're  lightweight makes it very easy to move the set from room to room.  Overall, a very nice set and any shortcomings are no fault of the set, I just think my tots need to develop better patience and attention skills!",4.0
"I bought this table for my 2 year old son.  When he first saw it, he LOVED it!  But I guess the ""newness"" wore off and he isn't too excited about it now.  I bought it so that he could eat and not have to sit on his knees.  He rarely eats there.  He would much more prefer to sit at the grown up table.  I will say that it is durable.  On occasion he will ask me to sit there wit him while takes on whatever task.  I was a lot apprehensive to sit on one of those plastic chairs.  But it held up well.  I have sat on it a few time and it didn't cave in.  LOL!!!  All in all, it was a good purchase.  Maybe he will use it more as he gets a little older.",4.0
"I love this tie dye kit.  The dyes are great quality.  The colors are actually the true primaries: cyan, magenta, and yellow.  This allows for the best mixing results.  I bought this kit many, many years ago, and they used to give you larger quantities of dye--actually three little glass jars of powder.  Now they just pour a little powder in the bottom of each squirt bottle.  Still, if it's your first time dying anything on your own, this kit is perfect.",4.0
My Daughter enjoy the product,4.0
"The dye is very good and very bright, but the box was damaged and opened when I received it :/",4.0
"The colors came out much brighter using this kit than the other tie-dyes I've done organized by other people in the past, so that was good! However, the ""up to 5 shirts"" is really for kids items. I was only able to rainbow tie-dye 1 adult small t-shirt and 1 pair of 98% cotton/2% spandex white denim shorts with this kit. The yellow ran out first and I still have a bit of red and blue left, but not enough to dye anything nicely except maybe a pair of socks. I did try to make my items rainbow, though, so I had to overlap areas with two dyes (red over yellow for orange, blue over yellow for green, and red over blue for purple). This might also be why I ran out of dye so quickly, so keep that in mind. -1 star for this.

Overall, I thought this kit was worth the price (I paid ~$9 for it after coupon at Jo-Ann's) because you get to choose what your final product looks like. Also, I've always thought bought tie-dye clothing was kind of lame since it's so easy to do yourself.

Some tips:
- If using old/previously washed clothing that has fabric softener on it, wash before starting the tie-dye because fabric softener can prevent the dye from sticking as well.
- Use warm to hot water to help the soda ash dissolve before soaking your fabric. I usually soak for ~ 1 hour (as opposed to the recommended 20 minutes) because I'm a bit paranoid about the colors coming out bright.
- Rinse by hand in cold tap water after letting the dyed fabric sit for at least 24 hours until the water is mostly clear.
- Wash normally in washing machine (I used cold water because I didn't find any directions online on what temperature is best).",4.0
"Great kit. Easy to use, was a little nerve wrecking mixing the three colors and hoping for the best, but it turned out. I would recommend having an extra pair or two of gloves.  Also an extra squirt bottle to mix in, the kit a level above this one has an extra but this one does not. And that eould have taken a lot of the guessing out! But overall great kit, very bright colors. The picture is after they have been washed.",4.0
"its great, lots of fun, bright colors but it says you can dye 5 shirts but i only got 3.",4.0
"Enough dye for 3-4 shirts, and clearly written instructions. I did four adult shirts and had some of one color left and the shirts ended up with a fair amount of white remaining. If you are an experienced tie-dyer you probably know that you really need to soak into the folds, but this was my first try ever. I'm happy with the outcome, and the kit is a very inexpensive way to give the process a try.",4.0

"One of the best tie dye kits I've ever used.  The colors are vibrant, beautiful and LONG LASTING.  Projects that I've done using this kit last well over a year and look as great as the day I dyed them.  Definitely worth the money!",4.0
"Some friends and I wanted to do a tie dye project for upcoming mud run team t-shirts.  We wanted vibrant colors.  The fact that this kit comes with a package of soda ash to fix the dye is really important.  Unlike some other kits I've seen, the soda ash will ensure bright colors that don't fade to pastel with one wash!  Super easy to understand instructions.  My only complaint...in my opinion the box saying the kit will dye up 5 t-shirts is a stretch.  No way it will do 5 adult t-shirts anyway. Maybe 5 small kid sized.",4.0
"I wil go into to grave detail about the review of this product. it came in the mail about 1 day after i ordered it well im not gonna lie i did click 1 day shipping but at least it came on time. when i got it came in a perfectly fitting box i had actually ordered soda ash along with it so they came in the same box. it was the perfect size for the 2! the outer box was in perfect condition no scratches, no dents.  i rate the delivery 5/5.

the usual opening of a the outer box was a quick snip the tape. no moving on to the actual box you guys care about. the box arrived in wonderful condition no scratches no dents. the opening of the box was extremely easy just pull up the cardboard the usual. when i opened the box it came with a pair of latex gloves, rubber bands, three colors of dye ( primary colors ), soda ash, and an idea booklet. All of these seemed to be in perfect condition. none of the rubber bands broke, gloves had no tears, etc. i rate the opening 5/5.

Silly me bought soda ash separately! i'll start with the gloves they were very sturdy also there was no powder inside the gloves. i really liked that. I despise the powder inside gloves. plus many people are allergic to it. sadly the gloves broke 3/4 into my project. But i don't blame the gloves i had to rub the colors together the make other colors and blend together. i was just made to protect your hands from staining them. i got zero stains on my hands and arms. i rate the gloves 5/5.

now on to the rubber bands. i don't know why im rating them but they're rubber band nothing special not cheap, good quality. there was a lot of them probably 20 of them. it came in a little ziplock bag. i rate the rubber bands 5/5.

* i put a asterisk there because you guys are probably only looking for the tie dye part. so like i said before there are three dye bottles 1 red, 1 blue, and 1 yellow. the primary's. they were the powder type like you fill it up with water. the bottles were a medium size not to big not to small. it says on the box can do like up to 5 t shirts or something the bottles are big enough to do so. i did a really big project so i used all three up i felt that there wasn't enough i started to run out of yellow really fast but thats just how i used it. it was really easy to bleed through i was dying denim so i thought since it was thick fabric i'll have to soak it but that really wasn't the case. the bottle caps were color coded which made it really easy for me to decode which color is which but you could tell by the dye since it was a transparent bottle. going back to the bottle the instructions for the "" dye making"" were right on the bottle which was extremely convenient there was a thick black line very easy to spot and below it said something like fill up to here, then it said the shake well. Very simple, easy instructions to follow. now to the action! when i was dying it the red came right out of the bottle very easily. when it came to the blue it started to splatter a bit, sprinkling little spots of blue every where. the yellow was about the same as the red but a little less came out. the colors were great my favorite is the blue. its very vibrant its not neon but its very crisp and fresh i know not the best word to explain it. the blue was blue not aqua or purplish blue just blue. same with red a very bright red. if your worried it will come out pink stop your worrying. its plain old red! the yellow is yellow. once it was done drying it came out very vibrant and bright not neon. i rate this 4/5.

soda ash is very much need for dying you could tie dye without it but the colors won't stay fresh very long. this soda ash by jacquard was wonder ful i've washed it like 2 times now and the colors stay fresh like the first time! i rate this 5/5

lastly the idea book. its nothing fany just tells you a couple cool ways to tie dye shirts it filled with fun illustartions and such. i rate it 5/5

i'm almost done sorry for the lengthy review. just a couple comments. firstly things i wish i'd known before i bought this product. what it has inside i didn't know it had soda ash inside. oh i almost forgot i think the price is decent you get your money's worth! i give this a total of 34 our of 35.",4.0
"I highly recommend this tie dye kit. It was easy to use, and the dyes are absolutely beautiful, vibrant colors. I was able to die a men's XL t-shirt and a women's cotton maxi dress with one kit. As Amazon seems to consider this a toy, it is worth pointing out that this could be a disaster with younger kids given how potent the dies are and that you are dealing with fabric wet with water and dye that has the potential to drip. I didn't see this mentioned many other places, but you want to plan on dying cotton. Other materials (like cotton/poly blends) will not take the dye as well or in some cases, at all.",4.0
"This is a cool project to do with the kids.
Quick tips...
- cut a cardboard box open & place it on the kitchen floor when doing this.
- wear your old/painting clothing as dye will undoubtedly get on everything.
- pick up extra latex/plastic gloves so everyone can join in...only 1 pair is in the box.
- have old plastic grocery bags ready to place the tye-dye clothing in to sit after dying...must sit for 24 to 48 hours before you wash out extra dye.
The dye gets messy quick!",4.0
"before you judge the quality of these biscuts on my review, keep in mind that they are being kept in less then airtite conditions in a rather damp basement. Most of the pieces which i remove from the bag are, in general, perfectly normal, but there are a few which do take a bit of persuasive action with a rubber mallet to make fit. no huge problems, however. I would recommend.",4.0

"These aren't biscuits for eating - they're for joining wood pieces...  lots of them of a variety of sizes - great deal.

Not sure about all these reviews saying they don't fit. Think they mush have a worn cutter. Just push a little with your thumbs and the tight ones go right in.

"If you keep these in water and humidity proof ziplock bags, they are fine.  About 95% have no problem, but quality control is a bit lacking and some bad ones are inevitable at this price.  All disks are made to absorb water and expand to form a very tight bond when coated with wood glue - that's part of what makes them work.  They come in non-resealable plastic bags and are fine when they arrive but if you use some and don't put the remainder in something water tight, they will expand and become too big to fit.  That's not just these, but ALL wood disks.  It would be great if they came in resealable containers, but they don't, so have some gallon size ziplocks on hand when you open them and don't get them wet.  Great value.",4.0
"I have too have purchased the 1000 biscuit assortment. For the money it's a fairly good buy.  Yes, I have encountered biscuits that are thicker due to moister absorption. Even keeping them in sealed plastic bags will only delay the swelling, and this is a limitation of the material.  There is a solution, purchase a ""Biscuit Press"".  Tom Foster designed and sells a tool for this very purpose. It allows you to squeeze the thicker biscuits back to a thinner dimension before insertion, and they fit just fine.  For more information see Link: [...]

these foam brushes are the best ive come across because the plastic support does not break while in use as many on the market today do . . . my only suggestion is that they fasten the foam to the plastic with a better glue.  this one dissolves when the brushes are washed making them not very economical or environmentally friendly.,4.0

"This is a good multi-purpose tool, but it needs some directions. I burned myself when I first used it looking for an on/off switch, only to find it was already hot! Figuring out how to put the cutting blade on was not easy, either. A directory of the different heads and what they do would also be helpful. As I am learning how to use it, I like it.",4.0
"This is a very useful tool for hobbyists, but be warned, it does get HOT just as described. I've used it to cut through automotive plastic with ease, although I advise wearing a mask or working in a well ventilated area when doing this. It does it's job and I like that it accepts replacement blades that they sell at the local Home Depot. I'm giving it four stars because the bit that holds the blade snapped after the third use. Although I can't really blame it since there was a lot of heat and pressure on it. Hopefully I can replace it easily. My advice when cutting with this is to take your time and let the heat do most of the work, don't rely on pressure too much or the tip might snap.",4.0
"Takes a while to heat up, but works well.",4.0
Great deal and works well.  Directions are obsolete - Make sure to unscrew bits when it's not HOT - and it arrives with the damn razor attached so be careful getting it off.,4.0
Worked really well on my foam pumpkin project.  This gets really hot!,4.0
Great,4.0
"Did not do the job that I purchased it for (too large of a project), but it is still a great product!",4.0
"This is a nice crafting tool for small projects.  I bought it to seal ribbon ends for making bows.  The soldering tip does the job for me.

Whats in the box:
1 - Base (the Dremel 1550 Tool)
1 - Stand
1 - Universal Wood-burning/Leather Crafting Tip
1 - Script Wood-burning/Leather Crafting Tip
1 - Soldering Tip
1 - Knife Tip
1 - Fine Stencil Cutting/Wood-burning/Leather Crafting Tip

There are no directions in the packaging, however for my needs, it was easy to determine which tip fit the bill.  The tips heat up super quickly, and maintain an even heat. It works well and i love that it has a little stand that I can rest the tool on so the tool doesn't roll around when not in use.

Overall if you craft, this is an essential tool you will need for a multitude of little projects!",4.0
"It cuts a 2"" nylon web strap but the blade cools after a couple seconds and the cutting isn't as fast",4.0
"This is a very handy tool kit. I use it to cut EVA foam for cosplay purposes and it cuts really well. I have to screw it in often throughout my time as it becomes loose a lot, but other than that I really like it. I would recommend using a mask as the burning smell is really really strong.",4.0
