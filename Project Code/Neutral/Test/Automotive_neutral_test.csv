"took me three returns to get one that didn't wobble, and it's still not super stable but whatever, im tired of returning so ill just deal with it. Too bad because the product actually looks and functions well",2.0
"While the product is fine the description and picture are wrong. Describing headline states Bamboo and shows a light colored wood. I bought this to match other pieces I have. What I got is much darker. Box was checked ""black"" vs. ""white"" and box states material is plywood (Basswood/Waunut). No packing slip. I will probably give this away to a friend and try to find what I'm looking for elsewhere. I purchased this on 08/08/2015 for $11.99 and I confirmed that I checked the box for ""pattern 1"" which is the light color. Five days later it's now $8.99.",2.0
The suction isn't as powerful as I had hoped. I bought it for my husband to use in his Peterbilt and it takes forever to pick everything up because you have to go over it so many times. The cord is nice and long though so thats nice!,2.0
Not a lot of suction power,2.0
"I don't know if its mine only, but its not really potent but I guess its ok for the price and the convenience its ok",2.0
Trust me... Sucking power is very poor. You'd be better off going to the car wash. BTW... Powerful Suction my @#$%@!!,2.0
I have a 2017 outback and everytime I try to use this I'm blowing fuses .,2.0
"When using as an air pump, the motor overheats very quickly.",2.0
Returned it because it didn't have the suction I was hoping for. Barely sucked up anything from my car.,2.0
"This was a huge disappointment! My bf bought me this for Christmas because my kids like to trash my car. I used it twice.. and on the 3rd time, all suction was lost. I cleaned the filter, took it apart and put it back together.. I can turn it on, but somewhere between the motor and the plastic encasement/filter, it loses suction. There is no blockage that I can find..",2.0
NOT TOO EASY TO USE AND NOT STRONG ENOUGH SUCTION.,2.0
I did not have a positive experience with this vacuum. Its loud and not very effective.,2.0
Its just not as expected. Maby my expectations were too high. It works just not good enough.  I give it 2 stars because it is built well. It just don't cut it.,2.0
Very weak power.  Plug would not stay attached to the cigarette lighter,2.0
Car vacuum canister arrived shattered. I was very disappointed.,2.0
The attachments don't attach easily. A part broke my first use and its a pain to empty and reattach it.,2.0
Not worth the money. Might vacuum up sand but that's about it. I am highly disappointed,2.0
poor suction,2.0
The rubber hose doesn't stay on well and it doesn't vaccum like I thought it would.,2.0
"When I ordered this item I was very excited.  The first time I used it on my car I had a hard time keeping it all together.  The filter and canister part kept wanting to pop off and dump the dirt and debri everywhere in my car.  Also, the plug in overheated and had to be taken out and plugged into a different port just to overheat again after 8-10 minutes of use.  The plug in itself was EXTREMELY hot to the touch when removed from the charging port in the car.  This product does ok, but was not as reliable and well made as I had hoped.  Hope other people have better luck with theirs.",2.0
"Works: very poor performance. Cheap. Dont buy. =spend 70-80 on a good one.

Good thing it was only 30 bucks instead of 40/45

You get what you pay for in life- let that be your guiding motto.",2.0
Wish it would be more powerful.,2.0
This vacuum sucked because it didn't suck. I gave it away within a month. Too time consuming to have to go over a rug section over and over again to pick up dirt. I'll stick to using my Dyson.,2.0
"Poor quality, not powerfull",2.0
Used it twice and after that lost all power,2.0
This vacuum seemed like a good idea because you can plug it in your car adapter and it had all the needed attachments including a bag to carry them in; however looks can be deceiving. This car vac does not have the least bit of power to pick up dirt; from a plant that had spilled in the car.  No power at all the dirt just sat there;  so this item was returned immediately! I only gave it2 stars because it was a good concept they came up with and received a no hassle return.,2.0
This is not portable. It has to be plugged in to work.,2.0
Need improve,2.0
returned it,2.0
This vacuum has very little suction power and the adapter pieces don't fit on well and fall off when using.,2.0
"The biggest problem was there was not enough suction power. I was able to get some very loose debris off the floor mat, but eventually I gave up. It seemed that there was a lot of air escaping around the power Switch, and at the latch where the Clear part meets the Motor assembly. Just to see, I even tried the Iphone pickup, and was unable to lift my Iphone as mentioned in the description. I gave it two stars, because I like the size and there are a good number of attachments, and I appreciate the extra filter. The light might help a little during the evening, but not bright enough to see under my seats.",2.0
very weak...It does not pick up well at all.,2.0
Attachments do not connect properly and easily detach from the device. Not powerful enough to do the job. Wish I had returned it .,2.0
Over priced for the quality,2.0
I was really looking forward to having a vacuum in my car at all times.  I have 2 dogs and it is a pain to drag the huge shop vac out every time I need to clean.  This vacuum had horrible suction.  It left behind a bunch of loose dirt.  I recommend spending the extra money and getting a good vacuum.,2.0
"The unit picks up loose dirt ok, but does a poor job with everything else.  The tire inflation portion is just as bad, I thought the motor was going to overheat. I'm sure it does alright with soccer and footballs.",2.0
"Tire pressure reader works but the vacuum itself has very little power, basically useless as a vacuum.",2.0
Not as powerful as I hoped  it would be.,2.0
Doesn't have great suctioning power.,2.0
"Average suction. Velcro strap is two separate pieces, and poorly designed. Plastic feels a bit cheap but will see how this holds up.",2.0
Tube attachment broke after second use. Suction not that strong.,2.0
Delivered on time. Cute & compact. Not durable. Do not pick up well at all & tire inflator didn't work.,2.0
Gave it a 2 star for the accessories but the sucktion is not good... it's ok it can get the job don't but it will take a minute.,2.0
"The concept of this product is great, but it does not work as well as I would expect. The crevice tool isn't long enough to reach down the sides of my car seats, and the vacuum's suction is not enough to make it worth my time.",2.0
"Great gadget if it had suction power, but it was very disappointing.",2.0
it does not provide a lot of suction,2.0
"Unfortunately the vaccum lacks suction. It can pick up a large piece of crumb but not the dirt. Can't tell much of a difference. Also when you attach the hose it gets even weaker, the suction. So overall eh not content.",2.0
looks great..... but it can't  pickup anything from the car mats,2.0
"My stand would not sit flat. I tried readjusting the rubber feet that you stick on and I tried multiple surfaces. However, HOTOR customer service was kind enough to refund me and let me keep the product.",2.0
"I wanted to like this. I was so excited to order it, especially after reading the reviews. I loved that it came with car specific components to help clean. My car is never really bad (no pets/children). I just needed something to keep the gravel that falls out of the soles of your shoes when you enter the car and the occasional crumb that falls between the seats.  However, my excitement dwindled when I tried vacuuming my car. I made sure the engine was running. I just got back from vacation and wanted my floors clean again. We had a variety of very small gravel bits and broken leaves that made their way onto the car mats. As soon as I tried it, I was disappointed. I couldn't get it to pick up a leaf the size of a quarter. I've tried every attachment. The only one that is worthwhile is the brush that agitates the debris enough to get it airborne enough for it to suck it up. The only thing it did suck up is the dust in the mats. I thought maybe clearing the dirt chamber would help, and the dust got everywhere. I had a few gravel pieces about half the size of a pea and none of the attachments would suck them up, even though they were on flat surfaces. I'm super disappointed.  I gave 2 stars because it did pick up dust and the smallest bits of dirt and I do like the idea of the attachments. It just doesn't do what I expected, and doesn't have very good suction power at all. This will be the first item I return on Amazon.",2.0
Recieved this because I was very unsatisfied with the last product. This one isn't much better. Hose is cheap and very short. Attachment and hose only slide together. Can't be locked so they fall apart during use. Not recommended at all.,2.0
It is weak.  It does not have enough suction power.,2.0
"Doesn't suck up dirt, hair, debris well.  I rather use my portable dry vac.  It makes a lot of suction noise more that it's picking up stuff.  The best thing about it is the long cord that's attached to the vacuum so you can maneuver from the front seats to the passenger seats with ease.",2.0
Had no suction. Definitely not recommend it.,2.0
What a waste of money. Not impressed. This vacuum is very poor at picking up dust or anything else. Youll find better product on cheaper price.,2.0
This vacuum has incredibly weak suction and barely picked up anything in my car. I'm definitely going to be returning this.,2.0
Not enough power to pick up much. Returned item. Don't understand the positive reviews. You'd be better off opening up your car doors and blowing stuff out instead of using this.,2.0
This is okay. Don't work that good at all. I Got it as a gift.,2.0
Definitely not as powerful as a vacuum at a carwash. Not that I expected it to be that powerful but you really have to press down in order for suction,2.0
"Vacuum  perfectly  but I still don't know how to open to empty the garbage,  and their is no instruction how to empty it......if it wasn't for that I wud give a 5 star",2.0
"The moment I saw the words ""amphibious vacuum"" on the box I knew I was in trouble.
So far I have used the vacuum once. The suction is weak. The dirt cup seems glued in - I wasn't  able to empty it out. And the zipper on the storage bag broke the first time I tried to close it. Now that I think about it I should return it.

I gave it 2 stars because despite it's cheapness it did get some crumbs which was better than nothing.",2.0
Suction not as  strong as I hoped.,2.0
Not powerful enough.,2.0
A but too small for my locket,2.0
"Let me start by saying the attachment that goes into the vent works well and is a good idea. I had my previous car mount in my window and I like the idea of my device being hidden from the view of traffic and pedestrians.

Unfortunately this car mount didn't do very well in holding my phone in place. It kept slipping out at the slightest touch. It may or may not have had anything to do with my phone case (though my phone case is thin) but my phone case is on my phone for protection, I shouldn't feel the need to take my phone case off in order to mount my phone to my vent/dash.

I really like that vent attachment though so I disconnected my previous car mount (the one that works well) from my window and disconnected the window attachment from the mount and put the vent attachment in it's place. Best of both worlds.

I received this product at a discount for an honest review.",2.0
I was attempting to rejet and clean the carbs on my 2005 bonny. This manual was not very helpful at all. The illustrations are very low resolution and difficult to see. I would not recommend this manual.,2.0
"These maps are printed on very high quality, waterproof paper and they are as detailed as any road atlas type map that you can buy.  However, as a specialty ""motorcycle"" map they are not worth the paper that they are printed on.  There is nothing that makes these maps special.  You can Google the same information or just as the clerk at a local gas station or tavern and get just as much useful information.  I recommend you don't waste your time or money on the Butler motorcycle map for Wyoming.  The bottom line is that this map is not worth cost.",2.0
"I got this for my keychain that I wear on my belt loop. I've been mourning my original Inka pen (which lasted for 5 years before it broke) and have literally gone through 7 different versions of EDC/keychain pens trying to find one that works. Each one has had a big problem- way too small, falls off, or incredibly flimsy (sat on one of the new Inka pens and it shattered the carabiner end). I had a lot of hope for this one when I saw it had a really strong magnet. For a couple weeks it worked great. It slipped off after that, and I never saw it again.
Finding a really good EDC keychain pen is a major hassle. I'm trying one I found on Kickstarter, which will be hit or miss. If I had known how great the original Inka's were and that they were gonna change them, I would have bought a bunch of them. For wearing a pen like this, I can't give this one much support.",2.0
I didn't even have it two months and it was leaking everywhere and the keyring broke. Wouldn't recommend it based on my experience.,2.0
"Using this manual, I have r&r'd clutch, axles, timing chain, valvetrain, door hinges, oil pan gasket, chain tensioner, oil sending unit, water pump and many other maintenance repairs.  Although the manual was  useful, it was very clumsy to get around.  You cannot reference a single  repair without skipping around to 3 or more different chapters.  Necessary  details were often omitted, and special tools which are required to do the  job are not listed.  All though the manual was of assistance, I much  preferred the Nissan Mfg. service manual.",2.0
It not what I wanted,2.0
"Highly outdated and lots of information about wiring diagrams, general procedures are missing.  For example, missing under hood wiring diagrams.  Or another, no how to or even a mention of the crappy heater hose that runs under the intake.  I get way more info off the internet.",2.0
Rather use youtube after trying to use the book.,2.0
"buy the other brand, not very helpful",2.0
"I bought this hoping it would have some Information about the 7 or 8 Speed Internal Rear Hubs. Like what the Electra Townie 8 has and what the Jamis Hudson #3 has and it has a 7 speed But there Is Nothing. Also there is nothing about fixed gear hubs, Plus on there braking  there is Nothing. At least the Park Tool Big Blue Book Has some Information a Lot better than Nothing!!  The person that said the Haynes manual was better must like the pretty green cover. That's why I bought this cause that person said it was better than the Park Tool but It is Not!! Save your money If you have a Townie or a Jamis Hudson #3 Internal Rear Hub.  This manual is a lot like there car manual's. They take you right up to where you need to be, Then you have to guess the rest.  I have been a Mech for 38 years  It is a pretty Green. But the Blue looks! Better to Me.",2.0
I was looking for more pictures on the repairs.  The details are too general. I guess I got what I paid for it will do for now.,2.0
"Many parts are too generic.  I found some figures there were not even for any Ford Explorer.  After trying using it for twice, I gave up.",2.0
I just sold the car instead because the fix was way to difficult once we got the problem torn apart.,2.0
"I was very, very disappointed with this manual.  I bought it to change out my fule injectors.  Information is way too technical for beginners or intermediates.  Too many sections assume you have a working knowledge already.  Pass this one over for the Chilton's version which has step by step instructions with pictures.",2.0
"this book is geared for repairs, not maintenance. I am a tech. I felt this manual is out dated and incomplete. Did not meet my  expectations. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is looking for maintenance tips, and unless you are a seasoned tech, I couldn't recommend it for repairs either !",2.0
"Arrived on time, but the book is not very helpful for an amateur.",2.0
"Based on other reviews this might be the best Subaru manual but it is a very poor shop manual in general. They need to learn a few things from Bently shop manuals.
I bought a used legacy station wagon and found a peice of weather striping (top of rear window) not properly attached. So I bought the manual hoping it would help me fix it. The manual doesn't cover how to remove the weather stripping. I have since found out how to do this by inspecting the replacement part I purchased. In figuring out what to do, I learned that I need to remove the interior molding in the back of the car. Guess what, the manual doesn't tell you how the remove that either. In the world of car repair this falls somewhere between Simple and Intermediate in complication. Well with the realm of a home mechanic and well with in the scope of this book.
This is a shop manual and therefore should cover everything. In my search to find out how to repair the weather striping. I found that the manual states that it doesn't cover how to repair the 'perminent' windows (i.e. non moving windows) becuase the authors believe that repairing the window is to difficult for us readers. The part I need to repair is related to a 'perminent' window, but not part of the window, and therefore might be omitted for this reason, but I don't really know why.
If something my be very difficult they should have a note saying so but then contiue explaining how to do it. IMO they should not decide for me.
To my above reference to Bently manuals. They are a company that writes shop mauals for VW (my previous cars), Volvo and a few others, unfortunatly not Subaru. They are exellent manuals. They cover everything. Sometimes a little hard to find the info you want but it is there somewhere.
From what I can gather Subaru sells a shop manual. I shall look into getting that one inthe hopes it covers everything.",2.0
It did not have the details for more advanced repairs.,2.0
"This guide did not have the correct step by step instructions for replacing a water pump on a 2002 VW Passat. I ended up buying parts that I didn't need, and I had to search all over the internet for the correct way to do it. The Bentley guide has the correct process.",2.0
"Okay, so this manual is great for the home DYI'er but doesn't contain some information and just says bring it to the dealer.

If a manual says complete disassembly and rebuild then so be it.

If there was only one book to own it would be the Bentley, but being one book isn't enough I'd own this one, and the Bentley since all manual of this type always seem to leave info out.",2.0
"Just as I thought...it tells you how to rebuild the transmission, differential and engine (who is going to do that??) it does not tell you how to do some of the things you are actually going to attempt in your garage.",2.0
"In my ""tinkering"" days I used to buy Chilton's for light maintenance documentation and Haynes for deep mayor jobs.  I have to say that the Haynes books that I used to have were the ones sold in the UK, and they were awesome.  True to form and tradition, when I got my new ""toy"" truck (hey, midlife crisis takes many forms!) I wanted to be able to ""tinker"" with it (in for a penny, in for a pound!) as in my younger years so I bought the Chilton's and this.  To my surprise they are both the same.  I don't mean they are alike, I mean they are the same book, verbatim!.  Not what Haynes used to be, the quality of the phisical book and the quality of the information inside is not what I was expecting.  If you want something that will help you with the maintenance of the car, buy either one, but by all means don't buy both.  Probably you should buy Chilton because they are still consistent with the kind of book they have always been.",2.0
"With great expectation from this book that was all crumbled to pieces. Let me put it to you this way-if you really wanna learn how to fix your car you're better off going to school to be a mechanic. Why? Why do I think this book is not helpful? Because it is far too advanced to understand-unless you already know about cars and how to fix them (but then what would be the point of this book??.) Sure the car has good diagrams and 'good' explanations on some parts but heres the next question...WHAT?? This book pretty much expects for you to know about your car already like what and where a camshaft is, what a distributor looks like and every piece inside of it. For me-pretty much new at this-I have no idea what I'm doing and expected this to help when all this did was confused me even more.
Final thoughts-if you're new at this but wanna learn how to fix your nissan, go to school and become a mechanic. This will totally confuse the heck outta you if you have no experience whatsoever. However, for the intermediates and experts-this may be the book you've been waiting for.",2.0
"I had high hopes for this wanted a good manual for my used jeep 2000 SE (TJ) and couldn't find one just for that.  This manual has very poor photo's lacks a lot of detail a shade tree mechanic needs.  If you are very experienced mechanic this would be a 4 star (maybe).
Hope this helps enjoy the ride and be safe. That's why you bought a jeep",2.0
I have a 2010 Wrangler JK and bought this book thinking it would cover that year in great detail since the details said it covers up to 2011. I was very disappointed.,2.0

"I was very disappointed.  Photos are and illustrations are not clear and sharp, and so many models and years are covered that it's hard to get more than generic instructions for any procedure.  My 2008 Avalon was treated like an afterthought.  For example, I couldn't find a picture that correctly shows the location of the thermostat, which in this car is hidden down near the camshaft pulley.",2.0
"I have used the Haynes manual on several repairs on my 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  That experience taught me to take the steps from the manual, and write out the ""going in, replace, and going out steps"" rather than just trust Haynes ""installation is reverse of removal"".
Having said that, the Haynes A4 2002-2008 manual does have a wealth of information for simpler jobs, such as cabin air filter replacement, spark plugs, etc.
I bought the Audi A4 2002-2008 Haynes Repair Manual for my wifes A4.  Just did the front brake rotors and pads, both bought from Amazon.
BTW: Haynes says all, repeat all, bolts, and the guide pins and + guide pin bushings must be replaced with each caliper and or rotor removal.  Ask the local Audi dealer. They'll look at you like you are strange.  They do not do it unless the bolt or guide pin is broken.  It's $33 for the caliper bolts, about 16 ea. for the caliper springs, etc, etc.  Save your money.  Pads and rotors are all that's needed.
The book completely missed a step that would have made the process much easier.  The caliper comes apart into more pieces than Haynes shows.  The job is still do-able, but much more difficult.  Found a video on YouTube that actually showed how to remove an additional piece that Haynes does not show.  Would have made the job take much, much less time.
I understand that that the same model is made with different parts each year.  And sometimes different parts in same year, different factories, as with my Jeep. Haynes has to take a certain number of short cuts.  Unfortunately, sometimes those short cuts cost the do-it-yourselfer valuable hours.
Unfortunately, Haynes fails to tell the user some extremely useful bits, like ""now turn the wheels all the way to the left (or right) before trying to reach this large bolt that requires a very long socket handle in order to break the (likely) freeze or the (definitely) torqued-down pressure. Also, they did not even take apart the caliper to 4 parts, leaving two bolted together, making the job much more difficult.
Next time, before I even assemble my tools or buy any parts, I'm going to Youtube to QC anything in any of my Haynes manuals (BMW 325, Audi A4, and Jeep Grand Cherokee).",2.0

Like most car repair manuals this one is not very helpful.  This manual is for two very different cars that have the same engine....Talk about cheap.  The steps are not always well documented and the few pictures are never of the part you need to see to finish the job and most of the pictures are not even for my car.  I hope that someone will make an online or CD-rom version of car repairs that is actual usefully.,2.0

"Haynes manuals have gotten to where they cut and paste so much information. Who needs a body work demo taking up pages and page of every manual? Instead, they could have used those extra pages to ensure the manual was complete. There is nothing on replacing the rear tail light assembly. How could that be missed? Also, some of the pictures are of dubious quality, black and white with insufficient lighting when the picture was taken. Pages are basically newsprint paper.

At the beginning of a section they list the illustrations that apply, rather than using them inline when they are referring to a particular task. In the inline section, it will simply state ""(see illustration).""

"Many years ago I used to buy repair manuals from Haynes, but at this time I was disappointed with the book. I was looking for a very simple information on spark plug replacement on my 4 cyl. 2010 Tacoma. The spark plugs are comcealed with a plastic cover, but there was no information on how to remove it. The manual also had pictures of worn spark plugs with eroded tips and instructions on gapping the tips. The spark plugs on most new Toyotas are the new type long life  iridium plugs with fine center wire and not recommended for regapping. Some of the black and white pictures in the book are very low quality with hard to see details.",2.0
"I pre-ordered the Haynes manual for the liquid-cooled BMW twins some weeks ago. Amazon delivered it today.

I've been buying Chilton, Clymer, and Haynes manuals for decades. They bring a DIY perspective to working on one's bike, in contrast to the we-assume-you-already-know-most-of-the-issues-and-gotchas-with-each-service-task-so-we're-not-going-to-mention-them perspective that the official service manuals typically offer.

With that as the backdrop... the production quality of this latest Haynes manual is the worst I've yet seen. Small, low-resolution black and white photos. And the paper stock is that real cheap pulp stuff. Those of you familiar with the numerous Gun Digest tomes will know instantly what I'm talking about.

The most important thing, of course, is the accuracy of the information and whether it effectively leads a DIY owner to perform safe, comprehensive, and accurate service work. I haven't spent enough time with the book to really comment on that. I did look quickly at a couple of service tasks - oil change and adjusting valves - and they seem reasonably complete. And Haynes rates each service task with degree-of-difficulty, so that's a nice touch.

But the whole book is handicapped by the small, low-res pictures, and those are then made even worse by the really awful paper stock.

Other than reference-type data, like torque settings, most of us refer to a manual because we're not entirely sure how to perform a task. Or maybe we just need a reminder because it's been awhile. A good manual will combine good text with great pictures to illuminate exactly what is needed. This one seems to have pretty good text. But the other half, the photos, really suck. The difference between what you squint at here, trying to understand what is going on, and Jim Bade's wethead video ([...]), is profound.

So with that said, yeah, I'm disappointed in the book. I'd probably still have bought it, knowing it was done on the cheap, simply because I'm one of those guys who believes you can't have too many windows shining light on a task. But it's too bad Haynes didn't take the opportunity to make this the really solid effort it could have been. For what it costs they certainly should have.

For those looking to work on liquid-cooled BMW's, my advice is to get Bade's wethead video as your first and primary resource. This would be a distant second.

"First I have NOT bought these exact jumper cables, however there seem to be a lot of these foreign (China) type cables around and most are NOT 100 % copper !! They are copper clad aluminum (CCA). I have ordered many other sets, thinking it was the deal of the century (about $75 each set), only to find out that these cables ""spec listing"" are usually somewhat incorrect. (mostly related to the copper content)...... You should be leery about purchasing any jumper cables (or any wire for that matter), that states the wire is copper clad aluminum, copper coated aluminum or hybrid copper wire.... More and more companies are using these type of cost cutting procedures to fool you into thinking it's the identical product. (companies are doing this due to the soaring price of copper). Unfortunately, the trouble starts when manufactures don't tell you what type of wire they're using, or worse yet they list that their wire is 100% copper and it's NOT !.... (I'm sure some people were not even aware that this ridiculousness was going on)

In case you would like to know more about these types of jumper cables, I have some info on them, due to the fact that I actually had a lot them in my possession for awhile ( I returned them).
The cables are about 9/16 inches thick (outside measurement, includes insulation). The insulation is about 1/8 inch thick. There seems to be a slight air gap between the cable and its insulation. The bare cable does appear to be 1 gauge (0.2893), for the regular person that's a little less than 5/16 of an inch.
The length of the each cable is about 24 feet 4 inches (without the clamps). Some have 2 separate cables in the set... In other words, these cables are not joined together, like most regular jumper cables are. Each cable clamp weights about 10.15 oz (with rubber boots on)..... The cables have an eye lug that's crimped on each end, and these bolt (nut & bolt) or rivet on to each clamp.

The clamps, eye lugs, nuts & bolts are STEEL. They may look copper but a magnet sticks quite well to them (copper is not magnetic), proving that its just a cheap thin copper coating... Which, when the jumper cables are used, this coating can wear right off.... Leaving just the steel to make the connection to the battery...... Steel is NOT the best of electrical conductors.

Now, in case your wondering, I could only find 3 basic ways to tell if a wire is copper clad aluminum or 100% copper.
1) scrape test
2) weight test
3) burn test

I only preformed 2 of the 3 test on these types of jumper cables (because doing the burn test, makes returning them difficult). First the scrape test..... I scrape the cables right near where the cable is crimped to the eye lug, sure enough the silver color aluminum comes right through (just use a knife or razor blade).... (If it was pure copper, it's copper color would go all the way through)

Now the weight test, these cables average weight (without clamps) at about 9 lbs 8 1/2 oz. (however, this does include the cable insulation and the steel eye lugs)....First you should subtract the weight of the insulation and steel eye lugs to get to the BARE wire weight.....no where could I find a weight for this - - - so the only other real option to get that weight figure was to call the manufacturer, but most of those same manufactures are the ones claiming this wire to be 100% copper, so what do you think the chances of getting an honest answer from them would be ?.... So I will subtract off 1 lb 8 1/2 oz (I believe its a conservative guess).... Leaving us a bare wire weight at about 8 lbs........ (Now compare that weight to the equivalent in copper wire)....Take two bare, one gauge 100 % copper wires 24.375 feet long each (same length as these cables)(total combine length 48.75 feet)...that weighs 12.35 lbs....... So, we have their cables at 8 lbs compared to 100 % copper cables at 12 .35 lbs....... That means these types of jumper cables don't pass that test either !

For the burn test (usually done on thin gauge wire) you hold a lighter or torch to the wire in question and if the wire burns off fast or kinda drips off rather quick, its aluminum or if only some of the wire drips off and some wire is left, then its usually some type of mix of copper and aluminum ..... (aluminum melts much faster). (I did not preform this test)

Now you should also be aware that Chinese (plus other foreign countries) wire gauge can be off from ours.... There 1 gauge wire can be about a 3 gauge wire in USA ......... It seems they either don't have a standard or just don't follow any !..........Now, that was NOT the case in the different ones that I tested , but just to make you aware that's its definitely something else to look for !

So do I think these cables are terrible......no not really, (they might be better than some real cheap or even mid range jumper cable sets). Most do come in a plastic case, (which seemed ""OK"") that's better than nothing or those bags that some jumper cables come with .......They're just usually not as advertised (100 % copper wire greatly out preforms cheaper hidden core aluminum wires)...... and it would seem that they're trying to hide this and/or make it confusing and misleading to the average person trying to get a PREMIUM set of jumper cables. No one should support any company that stoops to this kind of business practices ! For those reasons, and some of the unknown, about copper coated aluminum cables durability (the actual bending back and forth of aluminum wire, especially in cold weather). I would prefer not to be the guinea pig in this area !.... So I sent them back for a full refund and will NOT recommend them to you......... I always try to look out for the little guy, and for the most part that's you (and me) !! ........

Oh, in case you were wondering what jumper cables I ended up with, they were ""Bayco SL-3010"" and they sell them right here on amazon. But I got them online from O""Reilly auto parts for 111 bucks, (they passed all the test's) ........... (Bobster's Garage)",2.0

"Although these are US made and have fairly good build quality, the cable itself is aluminum, not solid copper. The cable ends are copper-clad, which could be taken as an attempt to mislead the consumer.

These jumper cables are not very good.  The wire is Aluminum and the battery clamps are poor quality(steel teeth on one side).  You really have move the clamps around on the battery post to get a good connection.  The two times that I have had to use them I had to grab a DC current meter to check for current flow and then had to playwith the clamps to get a good connection.  Best thing that can be done to this cable set is to cut the ends off and solder on a good set of jumper cable clamps from Napa.  By the time you do that you could have just spent $100 on a much better set of jumper cables.,2.0

The Magic Starter set helps kids a lot with learning how to play. The CD is especially helpful because it teaches kids how to play through a number of mini-games. The game is also playable right out of the box for two players. The reason I only gave it two stars in fun was because of one major problem with it. The problem is that the Starter cards are not allowed to be used in the real game! So basically if you have learned how to play already and decide to move on to the real game you can't use the cards from the Starter at all. This makes the starter just a huge waste of money.,2.0
"This was a replacement for another similarly styled oil Pan that lasted since 1996. I dropped that one, and the little cap broke. This looked like a perfect replacement. However, I am disappointed with the quality. The form is warped so it is very frustrating to put the large top back on. Instead of the opening being perfectly round as it should be, it is shaped a like a Pringle's chip and I have to force it flat so it will catch the threads and seal closed for transport. This sounds like it shouldn't be too much of a concern, but after doing an oil change, sitting around wrestling with this jug of nasty oil is a pain. I ended up just popping the little cap off this new one to use on my old jug and have thrown this one aside.",2.0
"This oil pan is a fantastic concept: drain the oil, cap it, and transport it. If done properly, there is no mess, and the lid/cap keeps oil out of reach, with no exposed oily surface, as the oil drained straight into not just a pan, but an oil container. Fantastic! I wonder why there aren't more products like this.

I read the reviews about leaking and debated over this. However, I saw someone who tried windshield washing fluid cap and it worked for him. I thought it was enough for me to bite, as the top lid doesn't have to be tight as long as I transport the thing horizontally to the nearest recycling center. I got it from a local big box retailer as it is a bit cheaper than Amazon, and that I wanted to see it first.

I made a few observations at the store trying to figure out why this thing will leak, and maybe pick out a sample that will have a better chance not. The recycled plastic of this pan is very cheaply molded, and all of them have warped large top openings to various degrees, so that the top lid won't ever go on flat, if it doesn't slip off first. There's no hope that it will create a good seal.

The drain cap is also plastic on plastic. Though at the store it could be fastened tightly--both the included cap and a windshield washer fluid bottle cap. That quickly changed though when there's oil--both caps leaked (yes, even the windshield washer fluid cap which has a paper/fiber insert as seal), and couldn't be fastened as it would just slip off the threads QUITE easily. In the end I had to put my latex glove over the opening *and* the threads to force on the cap to prevent a leak, and only barely.

The smaller drain opening is cut rather unevenly, making it difficult to create a tight seal even with a cap with paper gasket (as in the case of windshield washing fluid. You can forget about the included plastic cap as it'll never be useful). I picked out one with a relatively flat and clean cut, and it still didn't work. Pretty frustrating.

The saving grace--for me, not for this product-- is that the 4 quarts of oil I drained out just barely cleared the drain lip, creating little pressure on the leaky opening. I had to do transmission fluid drain as well, and since the cap didn't pass the leak test, I had to pour the waste oil to another container before doing another drain. Not quite the ""drain, cap and transport"" ease that I was hoping for. In fact, it made everything quite a bit messier than it had to be.

It's a great concept, but the execution is absolutely terrible. There should have been improvements over all these years (I think this particular product has been on the market for nearly a decade now?), but that's not the case. I hope there's some other manufacturer who can do a better version, and I'm willing to pay a little more for this concept well executed. It's a shame.",2.0
"I picked one of these up recently for doing oil and ATF changes on vehicles.
It looks like it would be a really good design but the top cover and side spout both leak like mad! Due to the warping that occurs with bare plastic to plastic, you can't get a good seal.

You'll want to empty it right away after using it.

The top grid is handy for catching the oil plugs so they don't go down into the oil... and setting the oil filter on to drain.

Hard to empty completely and it still leaks oil after it's emptied.

I can't help but think a rubber gasket would have solved most of the issues.

Nice Idea but smaller top opening and the messiness kill its usefulness.

Back to using cheap pans again!",2.0
"Most of these reviews are correct.  I've used this product for over 10 years.  I've owned at least 10 of them.  They ALL leak, but they are very nice for oil filters and catching plugs.  Here are some tips.  Do not over-tighten either caps, the plastic will break.  Do not do more than one oil change before draining pan.  Do not put this in your vehicle, drain it into a 5 gallon gas tank to transport to Autozone.  It's better that way anyway so you don't have to go everytime you change your oil.  When you drain the pan make sure the big lid is facing up the best you can.  You do all this and your floor will stay clean.  Make sure to have a rag to wipe up any small leak you may have.  Another tip too is opening is not huge on this product so if your plug is on the side of your engine's oil pan take into account that the oil will spray out about 8-10 inches.  Use a big flat metal pan or a piece of cardboard if you don't want stains on your floor.  If they would improve the threads on the caps, this product would be perfect.",2.0
"I bought this because it was inexpensive and I thought 6 quarts was large enough. Unfortunately I did not think far enough ahead. My truck has 5qt oil capacity, and this container will hold a maximum of 6qts on a flat surface. The walls are very thin, so when you pick it up full, it will bend. Suffice it to say, not a good combination when you are at the brim with oil.",2.0
"I bought this carrier as a last minute solution to carrying a Jerry Can on an offroad trip a few years back. It is mounted using the 4 dimpled bolt holes to my aftermarket swingout tire carrier on my SUV. It is only used on trips where I need extended range and so far it has been loaded for 4 off-road expeditions. Last weekend after returning from an off-road trip I removed the gas can and noticed the carrier had ripped apart on one side around the top bolt hole where it had been dimpled and cracked around the other top hole. This carrier is flimsy and made from thin metal, not heavy-gauge as stated and not made to stand up to off-road use. I will not be buying another but instead will fabricate my own out of some thicker steel made to last. It did work good for those 4 uses and the red finish still looks good after being outside for about 2 years.",2.0
"Bought these for my 2013 Silverado but they are WAY too small for the stake pocket holes even when the rubber is expanded as far as possible.

"We purchased our Zip Net to secure a load on the interior of our SUV.  First use was a bit difficult - making adjustments wasn't that easy.

It's been about a year since we used it, but today we pulled it out and three of the hooks broke.  We were shocked that the hooks just snapped in half where they connect to the cords.  Fortunately we didn't have the cargo net under a lot of tension when the breaks occurred.",2.0
"These are perfect for what they appear to be except for one important thing: the adhesive on the backing is a gooey mess that doesn't hold well at all.

The keeper peeled completely off by itself in a few days after mounting. Will have to remove all remaining adhesive and attempt to remount with epoxy. Come on folks, let's use some adhesive that sticks!!!",2.0
Well to start with there is very little adhesive on the back so you will have to either screw it on or find some other adhesive. When they package the product they drive the large staples right thru the rubber mats to hold it to the display card.

Further, even when it thinks it is accurate, it is often at odds with what I know to be the accurate direction -- not totally off, but showing W when we are going almost directly NW, for example.

"I did not purchase this rivet tool from Amazon.  I purchased this from Home Depot about two years ago, but I have not popped that many rivets with it.

I had to do some rework on the parts that came back, so when it was time to button up the chassis, I pulled out this rivet tool to fasten a total of 12 rivets.  I for 10 done and the thread on the nose stripped.  I had to buy another rivet tool to finish the job.

So, this rivet tool only popped about 50 rivets, TOTAL.  I'm not having the same problem as everyone else.  The threads in the nose stripped so the mandrels won't stay in place so it never gets to grip the rivet at all.  My old rivet tool had installed at least 1000 rivets before I misplaced it.

I give this tool 2-stars, only because it has a nice hammered finish on it, but that means nothing if it doesn't perform what its supposed to do.  The swivel head is also a nice touch but I've never used it in any position other than the standard forward position.",2.0

"I have had the gauge for about 3 years.  Worked fine for that period.  The ""lifetime"" lithium battery has died, and nobody at the company is returning my emails or calls about how to get it replaced.  Very annoying.  So divide the purchase price by 3 to get annual cost.  Then throw it away.",2.0
The air pressure gauge is hard to seal when pushed onto the valve stem.  It is hard to get a accurate reading with the leak.,2.0
I had a previous non-brand name digital tire gauge and it worked great but eventually died. I bought this one thinking it would be better. The first time I used it I couldn't get a good connection at all and it kept giving me multiple readings.  It also does not seem to keep the number on the display after the reading. It would disappear before i could read it fully.,2.0
"I bought this on sale a few years back and I found it more of a chore to use.  The plastic tip does not create a good seal on the valve stem and It usually takes me 2 sometimes 3 times to get an accurate reading.  I think this could be avoided if the tip was metal.  Also, there is no bleeder valve, so if you're tires are overinflated, you need to do more work.  I personally use the Accutire MS-4021B which I find far superior and it's way cheaper.  Strangely, it's cheaper but more ergonomic and practical as it has a nice thumb rest to help you get a better reading and it also has a rubber grip.  Personally the best gauge from experience is one of those analog ones that have a built in bleeder and have a filler chuck so you can fill the air through the unit and bleed off whatever you don't need.  Trust me it saves you a lot of time.  But if you insist on one of these digital gauges, I recommend the Accutire MS-4021B.  It's cheap, it works, and it's more practical.  I give the MS-4000 2 stars because it wastes my time and there are better products out there for less.",2.0
"This product definitely comes for a low price, but then its too flimsy.

I tried opening the stuff and it came off and I was not able to fix it.",2.0
"Looks cool, a huge pain to use it takes me four to eight tries to get a good reading. I would pass on this.",2.0
"Yes, it does work if you get a good seal.  I still use it for lack of buying anything better yet.  It is poorly made and the tip only formed an easy seal the first month.  Since then you have to wiggle and manipulate it to get a reading.  That is no fun when you're trying to hold the air hose in 1 hand.  Would not buy again.",2.0
"Looks very neat but difficult to use. Getting a good seal is hit and miss. What should be a simple procedure takes too long and frequently ends in loss of air in the tires. When you do get a seal, it works quite well.",2.0
"It only made a good seal for the first week.  Now it is impossible to get an accurate reading because rubber gasket fell right out!  Case and nice finish are definitely advantages, but they don't outweigh the fact that the gauge broke within 10 days of buying it.  A $15 analog tire gauge looks just as cool, and is much more accurate.",2.0
"I purchased this item for my son, as I do not have tinted windows and he graduated from an infant carrier to a regular carseat. I bought 3 of them (one to use on the back window, and 2 for the side windows) and I must say they don't work that well. Sun still manages to hit my son's face, making the car ride uncomfortable for him. Not only that, the suction cups on the sunshades don't stick very well. I'm constantly having to stick them back up every few minutes. Would I buy these again? Definitely not, and I wouldn't recommend them either. Keep looking.",2.0
This is the second purchase of this shade. I really found that it protected my son the first time with no tinted windows but in my new vehicle that has slightly tinted windows it does nothing to protect him now.

"I purchased the Wagner HVLP conversion gun after reading several positive reviews from this site as well as others. In fact, most appear correct. The gun does produce a decent spray pattern and can produce a good finish. Cleaning the gun is also rather easy. Why the low score? Like so many low-priced products coming from overseas targeting the price-obsessed consumer, it suffers from excessive cost cutting.

An always telling clue is the survivability of the product. After a two foot drop onto the carpet, the gun leaked air. Ok. So, try to tighten the connection. Oops. The handle snapped off like I had been holding a twig. Why did it snap? The plastic handle revealed an extremely thin tube inside. Am I surprised it snapped with such a mild force? No. Am I surprised they decided to cut such corners? Yes. The rest of the product is reasonably well made (though heavy and a little large). Why cut use such a thin tube when the rest of the product appears to be one step up. What's the cost? One dollar? If it couldn't withstand a weekend woodworker, then I don't think it could stand up to any usage. I decided to go with the Apollo 5110 and I'm happy with it's build quality and results. It's more expensive, but the gun will outlast me and can be converted for turbine use later.",2.0

"I just got a new Schwinn Volare clone, and on the first day got a flat from a misaligned rim strip (a sharp-edged spoke recess).  I wanted to ride the bike around, to finish adjusting the derailleurs, and used this patch kit.  I followed the instructions EXACTLY.  The patch failed when I inflated the tube to 60 psi (the bike has Kenda 700 x 28 tires, which have a max inflation of 85 psi).

To be sure, the puncture was fairly extreme...it was ragged, with 2 small ""tears"" each about 1/16th of an inch.  Also, this was near a juncture of 2 of those raised ribs that come about during the manufacturing process.  But still, the site was well buffed, and the patch itself seemed to adhere well.

This patch kit may suffice for a small, well-defined puncture on a smooth part of the tube, but otherwise, it's a roll of the dice.  You really can't choose what kind of flat you will get, so I can't recommend carrying this kit.

As an aside, the wrench is no longer included with the kit (it's not listed on the kit package labeling).  The tire levers are EXCELLENT, and they nest together, so I'll be keeping them.  I have a seat bag, and carry an extra tube, and have ordered a patch kit which uses glue.",2.0

"***** Listen Up All You Amateurs *****

What you REALLY need, for hours of service on real-world ""appliances"" is a ""bucket of high-Ah SLA's"" (i.e. high AmpHour SealedLeadAcid batteries) and a separate power inverter (DC to AC power inverter).  This will wind up weighing 200+ pounds, and it is NOT ""portable""...I repeat it is NOT portable unless you have a pet pack mule...

...this Xantrex-on-wheels is for brewing coffee in the morning, not powering useful devices for hours during a blackout...

***** Did You Get That? *****

The original review follows---

Continuous power rating is 1350W, not 1500W.  Most units have 3x17Ah=51Ah, not 3x21Ah=63Ah capacity.  Loads approaching the rating will deplete the batteries in a matter of minutes, not hours--better read up on this one at Xantrex's website before getting soaked for $400 thinking you can, e.g., run a normal fridge for hours during a blackout--you can't, and you'll need a ""noisy generator"" anyway to recharge this unit and run other loads.

UPDATE:  I have added an extra 53Ah+78Ah SLA (SealedLeadAcid) battery so I can run real-world devices for ""many"" hours.  These batteries are HEAVY (100+ pounds total), so forget about a ""portable backup pack"" that lives up to the hype at AMAZON etc...

...btw, the ""karaoake"" guy review is total nonsense--his karaoake must be something he uses in a small bathroom where he only entertains himself while he's in the shower.  Try and locate him and get the details and you'll not find him...buyer beware of paid-off testimonials.

***** Bottom line *****
You'll be out about $3/Ah (you need at least 200Ah = $600) for the external batteries, plus $SeveralHundred for a 2000W inverter, plus a trip to an auto-parts store for the custom-made cables to attach the batteries in parallel to the inverter.",2.0
"I use the power pack as backup in my truck, so I don't have to drain the starting batteries. I thought that 1500 watt inverter would be plenty. First complaint is that the battery is only 51ah. Basically it will run 40 watts for 9 hours , so you can watch t.v for 9 hours it has a dc outlet so you can use that. The inverter has a annoying alarm when the battery gets to low. You can run a microwave for about 10 minutes and then you have to recharge again . Recharge time 8hours using the  car and 12 hours using the house. So as far as back up power I would not want to be caught with this power pack  in a power outage, unless you just plan on watching t.v. or charging you cell phone and no usb either. 2 stars",2.0
"After several bouts with basement flooding because of heavy rains and no power, we bought this because we wanted to be make sure that our sump pump would come on after the power went out--even if we were not home.

But, if I try to start my radio, then turn the lights on, the on-board breaker pops on this inverter. It is really getting annoying.

"I had this inverter installed in my cargo van and just after a year it started giving me problems.  I use it to mainly run an 800 watt microwave, laptop, and GPS.  The inverter worked well then began to experience power loss.  The unit remains on, but does does not give any continuous power output.  Sometimes, the power output cycles on and off while still showing it is on at the switch. It is connected to a seperate high output battery of very good quality. I use it frequently, about 9 months out of the year.  After 2 years now, I am still having problems with it. It is becoming frustrating not knowing if it will work or not.  I haven't figured out any reason for it to act up.  I am now looking for a new inverter.  Maybe I just got a lemon. I expected more from a respectable name such as Tripp Lite.",2.0
Won't charge if the generator isn't very steady.  Clicks off or charges at lower current; in turn the generator sees varying load.  Case has no solid mounting surface.  Doesn't like to pass through AC at higher current than it can invert.  Draws too much with no load (wish it sensed when load is on).  Sounds intermittent when inverting although it works ok (cosmetic issue).  Battery voltage indicator doesn't seem to match my voltmeter.  Not meeting expectations (especially that it doesn't like to charge).,2.0
This is the 2nd inverter(returned 1st one for same reason).  Supposed to put out 110 to 120 volts but output is only 90 volts with 13 volt imput and no load.  This time I ordered a Xantrex pure sine wave inverter.,2.0
"I have mixed feelings about this product.  I bought it to use in a camper in conjunction with a deep cycle battery and a generator.

There are three settings on the face.  The first is inverter mode which provides AC power from the battery to anything plugged in and automatically switches to an AC source when AC current is fed to it (by my generator).  Then switches back to DC inverter when the generator is shut off.  It also charges the battery when the generator is on in this mode.  Nice, right.  This is the mode I thought I would be using most of the time and I liked how it was all automatic.

In truth, the inverter is not efficient enough to leave in this mode.  Even with nothing plugged in, it slowly sucked the life out of my battery.  So I found myself switching to the DC only mode just to shut off the drain. Being that the inverter is on the floor behind a door out of sight, I had to get down and do this.  The remote that they sell for an extra $100 for this should be a standard piece that comes with the inverter.

So now, I'm basically using this as a charger for my battery instead of an inverter as I had originally planned, manually switching to charge mode when I turn on my generator.  It may work better for other applications other than off grid camping such as in emergency power failure situations.  I can also see it working better if I would add a solar panel to feed the battery at the rate of inverter discharge, but that seems like an expensive fix.

I'm not sure if it's possible, but it would be nice to have the inverter kick on whenever an appliance draws 120volts.  Event writing that sentence, I already realize that this is probably not likely.

****  UPDATE  ****  3-7-13

I've had this for almost a year now and at this point, any time it is charging, it never goes above 13.5 volts and only 3 amps.  Even when it should be in absorption mode.  Something is not working right on it.  It has been this way for a while now but since I have added solar panels to my set up, I haven't been using it to charge my battery.  Also, as I had previously stated, the inverter sucks a lot of phantom power so whenever I need AC, I am using my cheap 100W inverter.  In short, it is not serving any purpose and is not working the way it should.  If I had to do it again, I would not purchase this, but would set up several smaller sized inverters and have a separate 3 stage charger, perhaps the Tender Plus for times when I want to charge the battery on shore power.  The main reason I bought it in the first place was the convenience of having inverter and charger in one compact unit.  Lowering stars from 3 to 2 as it still works, just not efficiently.",2.0

"I bought this and just washed my car with it.  It is curved and does not work well on flat surfaces (like a car). I read another review that really states well the issues that I have with this product so I will repeat what it said:
""The rigid,saddle shaped washing surface is not suitable for washing flat surfaces. There is a 1 inch depression in the middle which means only the edges make good contact with the surface that you are washing. Even on a curved surface, the head does not swivel, which means you constantly are trying to adjust the stick angle to get better contact of the mop head with the surface you are washing, and it darn near impossible. This all requires much more effort than using a plain sponge, or my favorite car washing tool, a shaggy mitt with nylon mesh on the other side. I have used the Wash Stick twice on my car and will not use it again. This tool would be much improved if the head were flat instead of concave. """,2.0

Partly my fault because I misread the warranty info on Amazon. The physical club warranty is for parts only. Pretty sure I would had had to pay for shipping to repair it. Since I never received a return call, it's just a thought. The actual warranty promoted in the description is for damage to your vehicle if it is stolen with the Club Lock in place. The registration form which comes with The Club that you have to mail (no online registration) requests all kinds of ancillary information, such as your income, auto insurance company, license plate number, and other otherwise personal info that should be kept confidential until needed, in my opinion.

After several wraps, I contacted manufacturer again, to advise the problem still existed. No response, resent inquiry, again no response. Poor customer service! My previous ""duster"" lasted for years.",2.0
inot as good as advertised.,2.0
when you brush clean slightly dusty vehicle somehow it makes greasy spots on surface.,2.0
The red lent gets all over the car and you dust with it.,2.0
went and used this today and it took the dust off but left a bunch of red balls all over my car,2.0
"it is not that great, it doesn't remove dust as expected and i was kinda disappointed since i live in a desert area and my car gets dust few hours after washing and this thing cant remove most of it. driving probably remove more dust than this.

i own a dodge charge and i will keep looking for a better duster :\",2.0
Still minor trails of dust. Especially around the tail lights,2.0
"Was very ""moist"" upon arrival and took a few weeks in garage to dry to point where I would even attempt to use it.  Clears the surface dust but I find storage an issue after each use. Probably just me.",2.0
"I loved this duster - 5 stars all the way, unfortunately, the wood inside the brush broke after a few short months of use on one car.  I'll say it makes a quick, easy job of dusting the car - so it worked great before it fell apart.  I'm going to try to repair it, but for the price - that was a short lifespan.  When I took the wood out of the brush, I wasn't surprised it fell apart - it had three huge knots in the wood that each had broken around those weakened, thinner areas.  Anyone who has ever built anything with wood, would have thrown that useless piece away - but I guess they were too cheap to let one go to waste.  I was the unlucky one to get that particular duster.  Would I buy another one?  I liked it enough to give it another whirl.",2.0
"I've had these over the years and have loved them. Now they arrive and after airing them out, they streak and shed horribly. Quality has sunk to poor",2.0
"Before I bought this thing I read the reviews and saw all the complaints about the red lint. I ignored them because I've had two of these in the past and never had an issue. Sure enough... this thing is leaving red lint all over my truck. What a shame!

It does take all the dust off and doesn't scratch the finish. But the amount of lint it's leaving behind is really awful! I tried to vacuum it out. I've shaken the crap out of it, blew it out with air... still leaves red lint.",2.0
Red lint on my car after use. My dad has had one for years with no lint complaint. I called and they told me to wrap it in newspaper but it didn't help. I still give it three starts because it does remove dust but certainly can't use it on Dash.,2.0
"1st of all I admit that I did not read thoroughly the page asto what I was buying - it must have been a bad day because I buy a lot on Amazon and always check all details of a product. I bought this in combination with the mini duster which is great - it arrive a week ago, this thing arrived today.

I'll never use this thing so it's basically 20 bucks down the toilet. But I want to warn anyone curious about it - it is heavy.  It reminds me of a baseball bat.  Almost as heavy, about the same size, and the thick handle area is very much like a bat.

I can't imagine any woman using this thing.. It's too heavy and clunky, never to be used with just one hand by a woman.  It also is obviously filled with chemical so be prepared for that.  Right now it's sitting on a table in the other room and the house at the moment smells like a car wash.

I gave it 2 stars not because of my mistake in purchasing the wrong item, but because of it's enormous clunky-ness and weight and obviously strong chemical in it.",2.0
"Picks up dust and lent but no matter how lightly I brush over the car, it leaves tons of red fibers behind with it on the finish.",2.0
"leaves residue, does remove dust well. BUT WHATS WITH THE WAXY RESIDUE!?",2.0
"Fairly disappointed in this purchase, it does not seem to catch much dust even after several repetitive sweeps and leaves behind red lint which looks even worse than the dust I'm trying to brush off.",2.0
"I've had a California Car Duster for many years that I loved  and kept my car looking good between care washes.  It was finally time for another.  I ordered the new California C.D., expecting the same results. Not so much! As soon as I started to dust my car, red flecks of ""dust"" were all over the section I just cleaned.  Not to worry - so I shook it out and rubbed it against my garage to hopefully get rid of the red flecks that might still be left on the duster. Optimistic that that should have solved my problem, I went to another section of my car and the same thing happen!  I went back to the original section with the red flecks and again, more red flecks!  I am so disappointed.  Now, instead of saving money, I have to go to the car wash to take off all the red pieces of ""whatever"".  I guess I'll be looking for a better car duster.  Any suggestions???",2.0
Leaves waxy streaks on finish and just seems to push light dust around.,2.0
"Put pink fuzzy a all over my car, then cracked when I was shaking it out blahhhh",2.0
it leaves Little Pieces behind and they are a pain to get off..,2.0
This brush is made in China and is not the quality of past brushes.  The backing is plastic and tears easily.  The brush leaves fine colored lint.  I have washed the brush several times trying to get rid of the lint to no avail.  Also the wooden handle is flimsy compared to older green brushes.  Buy American made if you can find it.,2.0
"It's ok. Not great. For it to work the car has to be completely cool. If you try to use it when the car has been in the sun, the brush smears wax or something like that and it's hard to get it off the finish. Along with that, it spreads lint all over the car, and you have to get a cloth, to try and wipe it off. I am not a fan of the duster.  If you want to clean your car, get a cloth and some detail spray. It works better and you will be happier with the results. The cal duster is too much effort.",2.0
After letting this sit on newspaper for two weeks it still weeps the wax even though I change the paper daily.  It leaves streaks of the stuff on my clean black car.  Not the same as my 10 year old Duster which does still work.  Needs work.  Go back to the old formula.,2.0
"Gets the ""dust"" off but leaves streaks and residue behind. Rather have dust! Returned after 2 uses.",2.0
"It's pretty useless in Chicago and i find myself using it more as a rag then a brush. What i mean is that you need to apply some force to make proper contact with the car. Also the built is flimsy, it starts falling apart after the first machine wash. Not worth $20",2.0
Leaves lots of red lint on my car.,2.0
Leaves oily resedue,2.0
Would return this but just don't want to go through hassle of boxing and shipping it back. Followed instructions to leave out on newspaper for 48hrs and then some. It leaves very waxy streaks on my car and looks very ugly. I've tried this on different occasions with the same result. So bad that I end up washing my whole car because of the ugly oily waxy streaks. Defeats the purpose of using this then have to wash it off. Idk if in time it will work better. I'm just afraid to even use it again.,2.0
"Upon receiving this duster I let it sit on a brown paper bag for 72 hours prior to its first use to allow any excess wax to dry or be absorbed by the paper bag. Regardless, this duster still leaves a significant amount of wax residue on my car even after more than 20 uses. This may be less noticeable on a light colored car but on my gloss black car it is very apparent and leaves the car looking poor. It does a good job removing dust but the dull wax left on the paint is not a desirable trade-off.",2.0
"I have ordered several of these in that past and this is the only one that leave a layer of red residue on my car after each wipe, there is no static electricity on it at all or even the waxy substance that holds the dust which the others have had.  NOT impressed with this one at all. What happened people - summer help at the factory?  I have to use my old one after I use this one to pick up the red particle bits this one leaves.  I'm not sure if this one is a rare occurrence or if they are all being made this way.  I have been very happy with this type and brand of duster in the past, now I'm leary of ordering it ever again.",2.0
"I followed the instructions and let the duster sit face down on some newspapers for 48 hours. It did leave little stains on the newspaper as expected. I then lightly ""dusted"" my car. The car was cool to the touch. The duster left tiny red flakes of brush all over the car. Despite how much I shook the duster, they were spreading with each use. The duster also left streaks in the finish. I was disappointed and used a soft detail cloth to clean up the mess this duster created. The duster appears and feels well made. Returned.",2.0
doesn't do much,2.0
"expensive, better price at walmart. When dusting leaves red material resedue.",2.0
"I had the original that was 20yrs old or so and it worked really great. Got this one and right away saw it was around 3/4 the size of my old one. To be honest,  the old one was pretty big and heavy and hard on the wrist, so I was not really concerned of the smaller size. I use this on a 1997 F350 truck, so the truck is old now, go to use it for the first time, and I get 10,000 pieces of red fibers that fall off the duster all over the truck, so I figure the truck paint is too far gone for the duster, even though the old one worked really good even after 20yrs. Next I try it on
a 6 month old Jeep Wrangler and I had just cleaned it, and there was very minimal dust. From what I can tell, no dust was removed, just 10,000 pieces of red fiber were scattered all over this Jeep. What a disappointment to say the least.",2.0
"Not the same product you might expect, much lighter Mop than the Original California Car Duster I have been buying for 37 years! Import from Taiwan, not expected... A very light duty product, has the logo but not the Quality!

Locally I can purchase the Full Featured Car Duster for only $5 more...",2.0
Not what I expected. It is very light weight. Not at all like the California dusters I bought 5 - 6 years ago. Also too much lint is left on the car after use. definitely would not buy another one.,2.0
I have had a California Duster before but never one that left lint on my show car.  This thing is terrible.  Do not purchase,2.0
This duster is not near the quality of the original.  I've had one for 15 yaers that still works and has twice the duster material as the one I just received.  I know I will not get the same service from the new one and it costs more.  So what's new?,2.0
"I've had an original for over 10 years. Never a problem, but it was getting a little tired and didn't seem to be efficient. This 'original' has  noticeably less fibers. And, even after following the instructions to air it out for 48 hours before using it, it still leaves evidence of the paraffin on the vehicle after a dozen uses. I hope more time solves this issue but I'm not optimistic. Any one else having this problem?",2.0
I would not buy this product again. It does what it should but If I had to do it again I would just stick with detaling microfiber towels from Viking/Cobra.,2.0
"I bought the duster for my Corvette, noticed the first few times I used it there were paraffin wax streaks. This is normal until the mop matures or is left out so the paraffin will dry. I have had the duster for almost a year and it still leaves streaks. I have used it on my motorcycle and the paraffin that is left behind is just awful. It might be the color of my car/motorcycle intensifies the streaking effect. I am not at all happy with the results. Yes it does remove dust but leaves residue behind.

(Update) Novemember 2016- Well I've got a new Corvette, this one is Red the other was black, thought I'd give it another try, same results. The car duster has been aged now 5+ years  same awful results. The duster is heading to the trash can. The paraffin is harder to take off than dried car wax.",2.0
Used once and got little bits of wax all over car.  Followed instructions but didn't work.  My old one never had this problem.,2.0
. I had one of the original California duster's and it was awesome. Sadly in was lost in a house move. I decided to get a new one  and am so far disappointed. A classic case of they don't make them like they use to.  The new version leaves behind ALOT of red fibers and generally does not do as good of a job of actually cleaning.  What did you change ?,2.0
Left little red fibers all over the interior of a brand new car. It did pick the dust up though however what's the point if it leaves strands of red cotton behind. I have a 15 year old full size duster that doesn't do that and never did. Maybe it was made on a Friday in china.,2.0
"I had bought one of these before with my previous car, but I don't recall it leaving so many little red threads behind after using it. It does clean up the dust, but in its wake it leaves tiny red lint all over the interior of my car. It's very frustrating. Because of this problem, I ordered another different make duster for the interior of my car and will hope it will do the job without making it worse instead of better.",2.0
"Smells HORRIBLE! Can't even touch the handle without your hand smelling, even after washing",2.0
"Looks to be the same material as the larger dusters from this company.  However, after the break in and newspaper prep it tends to leave a lot of lint all over the dashboard, leather seats, and door panels of my car.  I am using it on some outdoor furniture but not getting better results yet.  Right now it is a candidate for the trash can.  Cannot really recommend it.",2.0
"I wanted to like this thing, it does clean dust off your dash but it leaves behind little red particles nearly everywhere in the 3 vehicles I've used it on.  It seems to be worse on textured surfaces but it will also leave red particles behind on your touch screen, gauge panel and just about anywhere else you use it.  Never had this problem with its full size vehicle exterior counterpart. Maybe that gets better with time but for something that is supposed to clean it sure is annoying to have to pick tiny red threads and red dust off your cars interior.",2.0
This duster leaves pink fuzz all over my car when I use it. I'm looking for something else.,2.0
I love the regular car duster for the outside but the mini car duster sheds little bits of red yarn which I find even stuck to the headliner.  The regular model for the outside is great but this little one needs to be improved for inside use.,2.0
"This duster leaves a lot of red dandy on my whatever I use, very disappointed",2.0
"It use to be a good, inexpensive little duster. However,  as many people have noted, it did leave little red fibers all over my car, including many places that I did not use it.  I had one of these 10 years ago and never had this problem, so something has changed. Not sure that I would buy again if this doesn't clear up.",2.0
Much smaller than I expected,2.0
"This leaves red lint all over my black dash. I've shaken the thing lots of times to try and get rid of the ""newness,"" but it still leaves a trail of lint all over.  I'm disappointed.",2.0
"I've really tried to like this.  I followed the directions- which was to place it on a newspaper overnight.  I gave it about 30 hours on some unused newsprint.  This allows the wax inside to wick out.  I've used it about 20 times on 3 cars and it still leaves a wax residue and streaks.  So when I use it, have to end up wiping it down to remove the streaks.  I can just bypass this and wipe it down without any residue.",2.0
was not worth the money,2.0
"These are not like the original dusters, sad to say.....The red threads are to short to be of any real use!!!! Hate that I wasted money on buying two!!!!!",2.0
Not happy with this purchase. The product is not made up of high quality material,2.0
I used just once to remove dust on the interior surface of my car because it left a small red debris on the surface.,2.0
"It's been open and sitting out, like they recommend, to let the wax on the duster dry out, but it still leaves wax streaks. Even using it without applying heavy pressure like they recommend too",2.0
Ive had these before and they have been exelent. This one is garbage. The strings on it are all uneven and VERY lightly put togeather. Meaning that it looks bald. There aren't very many strings on here to do anything. The ones Ive had a couple years ago were like a FULL head of hair and would pick up anything. I don't know if they are getting  cheap or if this one is just a fluke. I'd try and buy from walmart or some place you can look at it and make sure.,2.0
"I've bought these things for years, but I've never bought one from Amazon. Maybe what I'm experiencing would be true wherever it's purchased, but this is smaller than the one I got just over a year ago from Wal-Mart. Also, the fibers are much thinner and fall out more often. The worst thing is that the plastic of the ""apex"" of the triangle has been breached by the handle; it pushed right through it! So my opinion of this is that is it either a knock-off, or just very cheaply made. Such is the fate of nearly every product we buy these days, however...",2.0
"This is a dust producer rather than a duster if you are trying to clean your car interior with this, drops thousands of red lint...",2.0
I don't like this. During dustering it leaves red threds on the surface. I do not recommend this product to any one.,2.0
"I am not impressed, it left a lot of lint on my dashboard. You should not have to clean up after the duster.. it sort of defeats the purpose.",2.0
"I bought my first mini duster about three years ago at a Smart & Final.  It was absolutely WONDERFUL!  I returned recently to buy more--one for myself and several more to use as gifts for family and friends. I was told that they no longer carry them and that I should try an auto supply shop.  I found the ""mini car duster"" at Checker Auto and although it is smaller than the one that I originally purchased, which was labeled just ""mini duster,"" I figured that it was smaller since it was for the interior of a car, but should otherwise be the same.  I bought it anyway since I had not been able to find the ""mini duster."" I was very disappointed that it is not as good as the first one that I had bought.  The strands are thinner and there are fewer of them.  The dusting results are significantly inferior to the results that I got with the first one--it just moves the dust around; it doesn't pick it up like a ""magnet.""  I really loved this thing and am bummed that it just isn't very good.",2.0
"My Superwinch is mounted on my trailer and there is zero room underneath it to get this to fit. So I just did what I could to half-way secure it for the winter months to keep the Superwinch out of the snow. It's a really nice cover, but it doesn't fit correctly. The sides are not correct to make this fit. It looks like it was designed for some other type of winch.",2.0
"Considering the Superwinch S5000 is an amazing powerhorse, I expected a pretty good cover, considering it cost me $35 bucks.  Not really.  Not only the cover doesn't fit the winch properly, but it doesn't cover it entirely and the material rips even with the slightest pull.  The tightening bands don't tighten up unless you tie it up.

Basically, this is a quick solution for people with no time and a little money to spare.  This was my case, though I'm considering having a descent cover made.  I use the winch on my boat to lift stuff, so it's exposed entirely.  This cover won't protect it right from rain and I wonder how long it will last in the sun.  China has been doing a lot of good quality products lately, but this isn't one of them.  If you have the time, make a cover yourself.",2.0
"I got the ashtray and the lid was broken. I guess the quality isn't that good. I was thinking of returning it but it's not worth especially that I can use it as normal ashtray (with out the lid).

"The wipes themselves are fine (though the glass ones could be better), but the lids are terrible and they're almost guaranteed to dry out. Even when you make sure to secure them well, they aren't air-tight.",2.0
The wet wipes dried even though they were sealed and closed tightly.,2.0
"Not helpful, streak marks",2.0
"I really like that these come in a value pack with all three together.
-1 star because the lid on one of these broke right away! I've used this brand for their wipes before and never had a problem with the containers. The plastic securing the lid broke right away.
-2 stars because the Glass wipes are labeled as 'no streak' but they completely smudged all my windows and mirrors. Now every time I've gotten into my car this past week I have to look at streaks all over my windshield and mirrors... drives me crazy. On-top of the streaks, the glass cleaner leaves little white fuzzies everywhere. I'm suppose to be cleaning my car and this just makes it worse.
I really like the cleaning and protector wipes for leather and plastic surfaces though and will be continuing to use those.",2.0
"The cleaning wipes are fine, but the glass wipes leave streaks.  Sad day.  The protectant wipes left my dash looking wet in spots, as well.  It doesn't look very nice.  In the future I would just buy the cleaning wipes.  If it were for those I'd give this one star.",2.0
They are not as wet as they should be!,2.0
"The protectant and cleaning wipes work as expected, and I love the convenience of just grabbing a wipe to keep my vehicles ship-shape at all times.  However, the glass wipes do not perform well and leave streaks and residue.  I had to get some paper towels and glass cleaner to re-clean all the interior windows.  I didn't try out the wipes on the exterior windows.",2.0
"The Protective Wipes are very good.  The Cleaning Wipes are OK (as in, about as good as a wet paper towel). But the Glass Wipes are TERRIBLE.  They leave a thick cloudy film all over your windshield.  You can barely even see out of it.  I mean, are you kidding me?  Using ANYTHING would be better than this.  Doing nothing, and leaving your windshield dirty, would be better than this.  Save yourself some trouble.  Wipe up the dust in your car with a wet rag.  Use the Protective Wipes to keep it shiny and new-looking.  For the windows, get some Windex.",2.0

Got the Koolatron P-20 for a cross country trip. About the best thing I can say is it does fit nice behind the seat and looks cool. I have found that If your food is really cold when you first place it in the cooler it can keep up (barely). When I stop at night I use the adapter to keep it running in the hotel room. The good points are It will hold a bottle of wine upright & is quiet. Just don't expect it to cool your soda from room temperature (or wine).,2.0
"I purchased this to replace the built in cooler in my Land Cruiser. I am very disappointed. It worked okay on our many trips. We also purchased the Koolatron Multi-purpose Adapter to pre-cool it and to keep it cool while over night in a hotel.

"I bought this for work travel.  It's a decent unit for what I need but the fan is extremely LOUD, and it will drain my truck battery too quickly to be the most useful for me.

"For me, it just doesn't get things cool enough unless you're taking long trips or stuck in traffic.  I do not put cool or cold drinks in to maintain their coolness. That may work well. I put room temp medical supplies just to keep them from overheating in the car and it barely keeps them cool for short trips",2.0
"Bought this as a back up fridge while camping and to keep stuff cool in the truck while travelling. It worked fine for 5 months then died on us: just didn't work anymore.

Bringing it back tomorrow and getting another make. I don't trust Koolatron anymore.

"There are a few things you should know about this cooler:

* The tall vertical shape is nice. All coolers of this type have the same amount of raw cooling ability.  The narrow top and small size mean this one stays colder than larger units.
* There is no thermostat.  Only the wimpy performance of this unit keeps the temperature relatively stable.
* The power connector is really easy to get backwards: more than once we've destroyed our food (if you get it backwards the unit heats).
* The unit sucks our car battery dry in about an hour.
* We bought a 3rd party AC adapter for nighttime use: it is smaller, less expensive, and more compact than the Koolatron equivalent.
* The unit is very cheaply made, and while replacement parts are available they are priced far too high.  The fan cover is particularly flimsy.
* The fan vents the ""wrong way"".  Hot air wants to rise, on this model it tries tries to blow hot air down.

For occasional use this unit is OK.  But if you're on the road a lot, consider investing in a well made ""compressor"" based cooler.  It will run longer, get cooler, keep a more steady temperature, and generally be far better.",2.0
"Very soft plastics on the cooling unit which is so fragile you do not want to touch it with any food/beverage inside. The outside plastic wall is made of very thin PVC which bends under your hand when you try to slide the coller in the trunk. When pushed, the wall bends and touches the fins of the fan stopping it. There is no switch for the cool/warm modes! You would have to change the polarity on the plug! - Really cheaply made. I would describe it as if someone in canada making it in his/her own garage using retired plastic meting tools:)
It does cool OK though which means the cooling element is working as expected but I would not buy this cooler again.
Hope this review will help to improve the quality of this unit.",2.0
"My koolatron lasted about 9 months before the fan went out.  I kept it in my office at work to keep my drinks and lunch cold, and it worked very well for that purpose.  Also the slim shape is nice to wedge between your desk and the wall without taking up much room.  Then one day a co-worker was walking by my office and asked if I could smell something burning.  I agreed, then went into my office and immediately checked the koolatron.  As I got my face close to the back of the unit, I could feel some intense heat coming off, and I noticed that the fan had quit working and the smell in the office hallway was the heat exchanger burning some of the surrounding plastic.  I'm just glad that I was present to unplug the unit before it burst into flames.  I used to leave the cooler plugged in when I went home at night so I could have a cold soda in the morning (it takes about 4 hours to cool drinks if you just plug it in first thing in the morning).  If the fan had gone out at night this could have been a big problem for me (and my company).  This product should have an automatic shutoff if the fan is not spinning for safety purposes.
I would not recommend this product for office use as I described above or long periods of un-supervised use.  It would be nice in a car, but make sure that the fan is operating each time and do not block the back of the unit.  This will overheat quickly if venting is not possible.",2.0
"Overall, just not happy with this cooler.  It's fits very perfectly behind the driver's seat of my SUV.  The unit is smaller than the picture presents it.  The picture shows 1/2 gallons of milk/juice in the cooler but neglects to tell you that you can't have anything in front of the fan. Therefore, 2 - 1/2 gallons don't fit.  The unit is also really loud.  I bought this cooler, and car adapter, to transport perishable items for a baby.  Only I don't trust that it keeps milk and milk products cold enough.  Nothing is ever cold.  The temperature feels similar to something sitting in front of a fan.  A regular cooler with ice would be better.  If you're just storing soda, fine.  But I wouldn't use it for longer periods of time with perishable items.  Buy an Igloo cooler and lots of ice.",2.0
Make sure keep car running when you use this vacuum.  It made my battery dead in about 15 minutes.  Not the best suction but it does get the job done I suppose.,3.0
It takes a while to vacuum my car. The suction power is not that good.,3.0
I have absolutely no memory of buying this but I'm going to review it so it goes away from my review stuff page. Looks cool! Probably works. Thumbs up.,3.0
"Its a great vacuum for the car. Easy to use, easy to clean. However, mine broke after a month when the clip that holds the dirt cylinder broke.",3.0
I wish it was pluggable also to use in the RV,3.0
Works ok but the extension on the vacuum tip keeps falling off.,3.0
Is not good for the long run. It lost all of its succion power after a few months.,3.0
Seemed to work fine for just under 6 months. Was used every 2 to 3 weeks to clean cars.,3.0
"I like the vacuum but today the charger got so hot in the 12v plug that it melted! Ive used it multiple times and have noticed it got warm, but for some reason today it got too hot. I used the same plug for my phone charger and it never gets hot. Seems to be the cord? Not sure.

Edit: Hotor sent a a new vacuum, which I very much appreciate and its working well. Luckily I drive a minivan, so I have a second 12v plug, otherwise I wouldnt be able to use the new vacuum without taking the car into the dealer (who has time for that??).  Im sticking with three stars because I still feel nervous every time I use it and am constantly checking the plug to make sure its not over heating (it still gets warm, but hasn't gotten hit the few times Ive used it).",3.0
Doesnt pick up much of anything. Going to car wash vacuum s just like i was before the purchase. I forgot about it or i would have returned the vacuum. Dont waste your money. Updated review. Was contacted by cust service sent me another one tried it im very happy with the results .,3.0
"Pros: Good attachments, nice long cord, can reach whole car from the one power plug. The zip up carrying case is nice to keep everything together. Much easier to use than dragging out the House vaccuum cleaner.
Its a very convenient vaccuum for quick car clean ups.

Cons:  Suction isn't as strong as I had hoped. It works ok, but isn't strong enough to pick up small small stones from shoes, etc. Build quality doesnt seem so great. The plastic seems cheap.",3.0
"Only picks up dusts and small dirt, its not strong enough to pick up cherios or other common small trash found on cars when you have a toddler!!",3.0
"Suction not as great as advertised.  Still better than constantly paying to use the vacuum at the carwash but I bought this product on sale.  I do enjoy the attachments, just wish it actually could pick up more debris.",3.0
"Fells Cheap plastic , good for dust but not for other bigger than that.
It ok for the price.",3.0
not that strong.,3.0
This is fine to use for the car cleaning however its a little bit of hassle to open it up to clean or change filter.  I wish that part could be improved.,3.0
I expected to be stronger.,3.0
Works okay wish it had a better suction and some of the parts are easily broken as well.,3.0
Vacuum is not so sufficient to clean the car deeply. It will take double time to clean the car with this cleaner. It will be useful for lite cleaning.,3.0
"Its OK. Not top notch, but you get what you pay for. Its decent. ",3.0
"it's ok, the suction is not great but its great for emergencies and light cleaning",3.0
"Works well for dirt and dry mud kind of stuff, but I got it to clean up dog hair, and it does not pick it up at all.",3.0
"It broke after the second use but seller issued a new one free of charge which works.  It is a nice vacuum to have in the car, lots of attachments and a long wire.  Kind of hard to switch on and suction is not that strong but picks up most things.",3.0
Great to have on hand when needed; however the suction is very low.,3.0
It is good but not strong enought,3.0
Not strong enough at all! But nice packaging.,3.0
"it is a really nice vacuum car cleaner, I order the first one and it was working great it just suddenly stop working, but their costumer service was great and send me another one.",3.0
"If you're expecting a powerful machine, this is not the one. You get what you pay for. Now it looks great and it appears to be well made, but its just not very powerful. The attachments are not so great.",3.0
the vacuum by itself is great !!,3.0
Has very limited suction but it's okay for dog hair.,3.0
This vaccuum is so dissappointing. It has to be plugged in the whole time and theres nothing to keep whats vacuumed inside it just falls out.,3.0
Not bad.,3.0
It is a cute accent. but the magnet is not strong enough. i have to place my keys carefully in certain way; otherwise key would drop.,3.0
not too powerful.,3.0
"Nifty little vac/pump, I absolutely love the form factor. The hose is really flimsy but I guess that's what you get for that price. The pump works efficiently while (surprisingly)  the vacuum leaves a little to be desired. But for the price, I'd say it is a good buy",3.0
Not as strong as I hoped but it's portable.,3.0
Just wasn't impressed with it. I didn't feel like the suction was as good as I have had with other vacuums similar to this,3.0
"This is going to be a totally honest review because there is some good and some bad with this product.  The good: The vacuum, when used according to direction, works great.  The brush attachment does an outstanding job with dog hair.  I have not yet used it to clean liquid so I cannot vouch for it's ""wet"" performance.  The bad:  The vacuum is not solidly made, and the switch  broke in two uses making it impossible to turn on.  Not a huge problem though if you are handy, the vacuum was very easy to take apart and in a couple minutes with some hot glue I was able to make all the components a lot more solid, the toughest part was finding a Phillips head screwdriver skinny enough to fit in the deep screw holes. But I understand most people don't want to buy products they need to fix.",3.0
It works ok I thought I would have more suction .,3.0
Works ok. Def not as strong as advertised,3.0
has a lot of power but not the highest quality. have to handle with kids glove,3.0
Easy to use. Long enough to reach the very back. Suction power is not too great though but good enough for general cleaning. Would be better if it has a car outlet instead of the car plug in my opinion.,3.0
"The suction is quite weak. Does not pick pet hair readily. The attachments tend to fall off when you use it. And it's really annoying when you shut off the vacuum and it makes a weird scary sound, wtf!

The cord is long. I like that the filter is washable. Otherwise, it just meh.",3.0
"I don't love this vacuum, but I think it's what I'm trying to vacuum up that is the problem. I'm trying to get dog hair off car seat cushings and the hair is sticking like velcro! The vacuum does pick up large pieces of soil, etc. - guess I""ll stick to masking tape for the car seats.",3.0
Doesn't do the job. Not powerful.,3.0
Not very powerful.,3.0
"The vacuum is great. Works better than most I have tried and the accessories for it fit well. The main downside is the inflation/tire pressure feature. Does not work. I tried bike tires and car tires. The seal isn't tight enough, so it just let's out what little air you had left.",3.0
Not a bad device for quick clean ups.,3.0
Didn't work well the first week. Definitely not as great as I thought it'd be doesn't do a complete job but at least it gets half.,3.0
"Bought this to clean up after my toddler in my truck. The vacuum is well designed and looks good, but I was unable to use the hose attachment due to a missing piece. The hose is supposed to have two flat ends and only one was in the box. The one that came with it would not fit into the vacuum end, making the hose useless. The suctions didn't seem very powerful either as it took several tries to pull up cereal crumbs off a flat surface. I would not recommend this.

UPDATE: The seller reached out after my review to try and rectify the problem. They offered a refund on the original purchase and even sent two additional vacuums (opened but otherwise unused) as a mea culpa. I upped the star rating primarily for the customer service in this matter.",3.0
Ok for small jobs otherwise it is slow,3.0
"Good cleaner, but not enough suction power.",3.0
"Not as powerful as expected, but ok",3.0
Decent product for the price.  It could use a little more suction but it does the job in my car.,3.0
"The cord is plenty long for my SUV and the attachments offer plenty of versatility. The one thing that's disappointing with this vacuum is the lack of suction. I suppose it can only be so powerful using the car's 12-volt plug but it fails to pick up small pebbles that my past vacuums could easily catch. It does the job for the most part but if you want a thorough, deep clean, then I recommend getting a vacuum that plugs into a standard wall socket or, if you have the cash, a full shop vac. 3 stars for being okay.",3.0
"Good enough vacuum, but it can't handle car tires. I needed to pump about 5 psi into each tire. It started smoking at the second tire. I quickly turned it off. Vacuum still works, but I won't be using it for air anymore.",3.0
"I does a good job, but not fantastic. It's not nearly as powerful as claimed. First use, I thought I'd breeze through vacuuming the loose grass/dirt from the my golf shoes off of the car floor, but I actually have to move the nozzle back and forth, and often I'm required to use one of the brush attachments to get to those grass clippings. Maybe the auto manufacturers are using a more ""sticky"" material in new car floors that clings to loose things like grass clips, but I thought I'd be using a lot less effort to clean the floor.",3.0
I purchased it mainly for sucking dirt and old french fries from under the car seats but it won't even lift feathers if its life depended on it. I got it based on the 5-star reviews of others (probably HOTOR employees) and was utterly let down. My daughter toy blower has more power than this. Planning on returning it.,3.0
Vacuum suction is not great but not terrible. The inflation functions works pretty well but the psi gauge is not accurate.,3.0
"Love the vaccum.  Gets the job done, and accomodates so much more.",3.0
ok its good,3.0
Suction is not too strong.  Haven't decide whether to keep it or not yet.,3.0
"It works, but the suction isn't great.",3.0
Works okay. Doesn't work as good as the ones the car wash but good for in between deep cleanings. Worth it for the price!,3.0
I LIKE IT,3.0
Apparently it functions as advertised.,3.0
Idk how to clean this vacuum.,3.0
"With the 3 kids in a Corolla, we really needed something to keep in the car. This seems to get the biggest part of the job done, but it isn't what you'd need for fine cleaning.

Accessories: 3/5
The accessories are cheaply made, but work decently with proper use. The hose extension broke when I let my 4 year old try to vacuum the car though. The brush attachment is nice and necessary if you'd like to get any bit of hair out of the car, but it only goes so far when the motor on the vacuum doesn't suck very much.

Function: 3/5
The design of this has 2 major flaws.
  1. The motor is NOT very powerful. It provides light suction but will not pick up small leaves, small twigs or anything other than light dirty and  maybe some cracker crumbs.
  2. The dirt canister has no way to keep the debris INSIDE. There's no flap or suction mechanism, it's just open and the idea is that the dirt will settle around the sides. This doesn't work once there's any amount of stuff inside of it and you have to empty is very frequently in order to keep from making a mess as you're cleaning one. HOWEVER, this does not overheat like other vacuums, it didn't even get warm.

Value: 2/5
Right now it's listed at $35.00. For that price, you can easily pick up a Black and Decker. We got a Shark petperfect II refurbished for that price and it lasted for 2 years before the battery quit charging on us.

Honorable Mentions:
- Bag: The carrying bag really is convenient and keeps all the attachments from getting lost. I think more brands should adopt a similar accessory.
- 12v power option. It would be nice if more handheld vacuums had this or included it as an option because it's very inconvenient to run an extension cord out to the car or to be using a cordless vac and have it die before you're finished.

Overall:
I wouldn't purchase this again. I know there's a lot of brands of the exact same vacuum floating around and their brand stamped on the front of it, but the design of it lets you know they're the same vacuum. For us, we need something with a better design and more power to get our car clean, not just slightly less dirty.",3.0
Not as powerful as thought but still good,3.0
Love the idea and design but it broke the first time i wore it.,3.0
Looks a little cheap.,3.0
TIPS OVER,3.0
I purchased this necklace because I liked the design and it had decent reviews. The necklace also came with three different color disks to change out in order to match different outfits. It came in the mail rather quickly and I was excited to receive it. As soon as it arrived I added my favorite essential oils to the black disk. I had a very difficult time opening the pendant in order to insert the disk. It is a pretty necklace with an antique and not shiny silver which I love. I put it in and within an hour the chain came loose from the pendant and the pendant fell to the floor. I was able to fix the chain but it eventually came loose again. I was very disappointed in the quality of this otherwise beautiful diffuser necklace.,3.0
"I took pictures of this product but will have to upload them later.

When I received the product, it looked like it would work well enough but I did think the chain and overall construction of the product was very poor. I did have problems with my pendants look (which I e-mailed the seller about) and whom were very responsive.

The concept is brilliant, though. The felt pads worked really well at retaining the essential oils and the pendant did hold the pad well without the clasp coming undone. The pendant had a really beautiful design on it and allowed for breathability of the oils.",3.0
"It's just a wood stand. Great quality, but I was not aware that it doesn't actually charge. I like the design but I feel it's a bit overpriced for just being an organizational supplement.",3.0
"My first difusser, a little disappointed it didn't come with a wall charger as described, had to go out and purchase a wall charger to use the produc . However, I really like the result .
I sleep much better with the lavender oil and breath much better work the peppermint.",3.0
Doesn't really put out the scent that I was expecting. Nice colored LED's and container.,3.0
"It's my fault for not thinking it through before buying, but if you have a thick case on your phone, or maybe any case, this holder is not a good buy. My phone will not fit in the space designed to hold the phone, and if I try at all to get it in there, when taking the phone out the case will start to come off. The ""hands"" aren't flexible at all. Just putting my phone between the hands is nearly useless because it's pretty springy and the phone just pops out.",3.0
"I have had a cold air humidifier in the past, but never a diffuser, so I am writing this review from that perspective.  This product is smaller than I expected, even with the pictures.  The one with the person holding it with hands to scale is most appropriate if you are trying to determine its size.  It is easy to set up, although it was disappointing that it only has a USB charger and not a regular electrical plug as that was not clear from the product description.  The place to insert the charger is under the unit with a small lip for the wire, which was sort of awkward at first because it has to be pushed hard to fit or else it sticks up and makes the bottom uneven, resulting in a wobbly unit.

I used water and essential oils in this and spent a few minutes examining it and then took a nap with it on.  It does a good job of diffusing the scent of the essential oils; you can smell them almost immediately after turning them on.  However, I would definitely say that this is more of a diffuser than a humidifier.  Due to its small size, it does not really put out much steam, so its impact on the humidity in the air is negligible compared to an actual humidifier.  It is almost soundless, but it makes a gentle blowing sound and you can hear a bit of water bubbling, which I found to be relaxing.  The light is a nice color, but it is a bit more than would be ideal for a nightlight and a bit less than would be ideal to function as a lamp.

All in all, this is a reasonable product as a diffuser.  However, it is not a great humidifier or light.  Given the retail price point, I would not buy this again or recommend it to someone who was in the market for a similar product.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",3.0
"The box it came in was sort of beat up but the product itself was fine. I got this as a gift for my aunt and the first thing she wanted asked after opening it was how does it go. There were no instructions in the box. It has three legs so there are a few different ways to use it, no wrong or right.",3.0
"Very, very small. Would be good for a work cubicle. Somewhat temperamental - I have to rinse and dry it before each use. Must use a small amount of salt to get it going. Does not work with plain water.",3.0
I have been waiting to find a really great diffuser/ humidifier and I really like this. It has separate  controls for the light and then the mist feature comes with a few different time settings with automatic shut off. If you try to turn ir on and the water level is too low it shuts off ans beeps to let you know. I love using this at night with some lavender oils.,3.0
"This key holder is adorable!  I love the design and I think it would look just as cute in a modern home as it does in our vintage-y house.  It was a breeze to hang it out, just peel and stick, and it seems to be up there pretty firmly.  I honestly would use it just as a cute wall decoration!  As a key holder, I love the idea of it but the magnet inside isn't quite strong enough to hold more than one small keyring, at least with the ones we've tried.  For a single person or two people without many keys, this is great.",3.0
I give it 3 stars because it works well....Its incredibly small for the price and my discount code didn't apply and I need my credit,3.0
Holds 1-3 keys great but hard to get one set of keys down without knocking the rest off the magnets.,3.0
"Though Chilton and Haynes seem to be the only aftermarket auto service manuals available these days, they don't have the complete detailed information of the old ""Motor"" manuals (The big, blue books) of the past.

Too much is left un-addressed by this and other Chilton manuals. If the topic you're looking for is covered adequately, great. If not - too bad. You're left with no reference at all or an abbreviated ""procedure"" that says to perform steps A, B,and C - but fails to tell you how to perform ""B"" and often that some pretty important steps happen between A and B.

Better than nothing - but that's often not enough.

If you have an older vehicle or one you prefer to service yourself as opposed to taking to a mechanic, I would suggest you pick up a copy (typically a set) of the original factory service manuals. Unfortunately, these are pretty pricey unless you can find a cast-off one.",3.0
"Far too generalized to be much use for specific model year solutions. I get better information from the Moss motors catalog, but useful reference to have. I don't regret the purchase but I don't rely on it.",3.0

"Photos are hard to see, verbiage not always complete in reference to pictures, exploded parts diagrams would have helped (still looking for purpose of an ""extra"" unknown wire/snap connector in throttle, will find out when I fire it up).

Its a nice little pen to have especially when you use one or always looking for one. Only problem is after about 2 weeks the pen wouldnt wouldnt magnetize anymore. I discovered the small little tiny ring had come loose so the magnet piece no longer stayed in cap. I super glued it and so far its working again.,3.0
"I really liked this pen. It was convenient to always have in my pocket, solidly constructed, and wrote well. But the pen slipped out of the magnetic cap too easily and today I didn't notice soon enough and have lost the pen.",3.0
"Lost it in under two weeks, came loose from magnetic cap and is gone.",3.0
"Portable and dependable.  I carry it on my EDC ring.  The pen body has never inadvertently detached from its magnetic end-cap in the 1.5 years I've carried it.

The pen's tail cap however, which is threaded into the body of the pen, unilaterally spun off and was lost days after I began carrying the pen in my EDC ring.  I recommend applying some non-hardening Loctite to the threads to keep the end cap from falling off in your pocket.",3.0
"I'm mechanically challenged and bought this to figure things out, and try to save some money. It really didn't help, my suggestion is unless someone is going to go over it with you and teach you out of the book, just take your car in for regular service and you'll be fine.",3.0
It has helped my work on my 1993 Sentra many times. Very helpful although I feel they left out a lot of important information.,3.0
Part of the pages seem to be missing.  Not fault of seller pages gone from publisher.,3.0
"While this was significant in helping me fix my car door, it took me 3 hours to do a half hour job. The redirection scheme of the chapters are designed so that it would take a computer programmers to follow the goto instructions from one section to the next. If I was a computer programmer, I'd have enough money to pay someone else to fix my car.  There were no diagrams of what exactly was supposed to be in my door. It just gave directions so I could get in and discover it. Even then I had to consult two Youtube videos. Maybe these are made for mechanics, not for the general public? I'm wondering if other manual publishers do a better job. 3 stars because I eventually accomplished my goal and can now field strip my car door in a half hour, haha.",3.0
of course the one thing I need it for doesnt help me with the Saturn security system had alotta reseach on the internet to do better off going to the Saturn forum,3.0
"From past experience with other cars, and one Chilton's manual for a previous car, I'd rather have a Factory Manual - but since Saturn went belly-up, that just wasn't possible.

I've only done one significant disassembly / reassembly so far, so can only judge by that one - but this manual pretty much coverd it okay.

At the same time I ordered the Haynes Manual I also order a Chilton's Manual ...because one reeviewer recommended ""getting both"" to get the benefit of the best coverage.
After looking at both, there are only several small differences I could find so far:
1)  Chilton's type seems to be in one font size larger, which makes it easier for my eyes to read.
2)  There are differences between the two in terms of where many of the specifications - like Bolt Torques for different sizes, for example - are located.

Not having done more ""procedures"" I can't say for sure, but I can't see a difference between them.

As a metter of fact, BOTH Haynes and Chilton Manuals have a photo in the very front showing ""Photographer, author and mechanic with a 1991 Saturn""  ...and it's the IDENTICAL Photograph - same guys, same car!!",3.0

"This book is a good overview ot the welding processes, however it needs to be updated. The MIG welder section does not feature many of the newer models available from Miller and Lincoln. In the stick welding section the author leaves the impression that DC stick welding machines are out of the price range of most hobby welders. This is really not the case as an AC/DC welder from Lincoln can be purchased for and additional $200 above the Lincoln AC welder. The book has a very good section on brazing however, all things considered it is worth the purchase price.",3.0

"There are all sorts of books on the same subject that do not sell for much. Buy all you can aford. It is always good to have several books on hand on the same subject.

"Guess I am cynical.  I just got through writing a review of Finch's welding manual and I still don't have anything great to say about the Haynes Manual.
The Haynes manual is probably better than the Finch book.  It gets into a little more detail with the processes and provides useful insight into thing.  Shows defective welds etc.
Again, I'd recommend going to one of the welder manufacturer sites like Hobart, Miller or Lincoln and buying a learning set on the process you want to master.",3.0
"The book was helpful for a novice like me. I got fed up giving my hard earned money to incompetent ""technicians"" telling me it needs recharging every so often. FYI...if it's got a leak, find and fix it, don't ""charge it every so often""

What can you say about a car manual - it does it's job. Helped with some difficult repairs when I needed it.,3.0
"This manual has guided me through a number of repairs over the past few years, however it is certainly _not_ a replacement for a factory service manual.  The underlying problem with this manual is that it tries to cover too many different vehicles, and while it attempts to address the nuances of each model, it invariably leaves quite a bit to be desired.
I have a 1991 Isuzu Rodeo 3.1L V6, a model which is not covered too well. The pictures in the manual don't usually help, since they are irrelevant to my vehicle.  Especially with regard to the engine.  My particular year's engine might as well not exist according to this manual.  Just recently my water pump went out on me, and replacing it was entirely different from that described in this manual.  The picture of the 3.1L engine in the Haynes Manual was not mine!  (this is just one example of when i've been let down).
Though an experienced DIYer or mechanic will know how to fix most things in his car, this manual was little help aside of general auto repair information.  Indeed, I learned a lot simply by ""flying blind"" into much of my auto repair, making the manual irrelevant.
The conclusion: Call Isuzu (Helm publications, I think) and order their service manual, which I haven't done yet, but I plan on doing.  I'm pretty sure that will be vehicle specific and should be much more detailed/helpful for your particular vehicle.  When you call, they might ask you for 2 different versions UCR or UCR/S.  I *think* the standard ROdeo is the UCR version, UCR/S I believe is for the Rodeo Sport (amigo?)].",3.0

"You don't want to spend eighty to two hundred dollars on bicycle upkeep for your high speed Schwinn?  You hate the fact that the slightest bump in the road puts your Specialized mountain bike on the rack at the local mechanic?  If you have the capability to turn a wrench and have a stand to work on your bicycle in your garage, pay attention to the information in this manual, it will help save you both road time aggravation and save some of those dollars for your Starbucks latte later.  Haynes manuals, in my experience with my cars, is not quite a Chiltons but can be very good for the do it yourself kind of person who does not want to read all of the text and can get what they need from the pictures alone.  One caveat, some of the photos will not give you the most perfect view and you will have had to have some experience with bicycle repairs previously to really appreciate this book.  The big thing is to take your time with your repair or rebuild or upgrade, keep the manual nearby for reference, and don't let the occasional side blurb about the dynamics of a process throw you. This is a manual for a better experienced cyclist who can change out their tire as fast as the riders and crews at the Giro d' Italia but really would rather tweak a few things and hit the trails.",3.0

"Very nice guide, I was able to do brake jobs, spark plugs, and other moderate-level maintenance tasks with confidence using the step-by-step instructions. But then, I sort of knew what I was doing before hand.

The pictures, unfortunately, are not very clear. They show no context as to where in the engine you're looking most of the time, and the parts they mention by name are often not defined or labeled in the diagrams. Especially for torque specifications, this can be problematic. I had a bolt fall out a couple times because I wasn't clear on the difference between a ""mounting bolt"" and a ""bracket mounting bolt"" or something like that, and the correct choice was on a separate page so I didn't even notice it at first. A simple diagram labeling the parts they were referring to would have fixed that problem.

Chilton manuals have a nice section at the beginning of every chapter explaining how the component works, usually with explanatory diagrams. This is missing from this Haynes manual, and would have helped a beginner like me out immensely.

Still, I had several dog-eared and oil-stained sections by the time I sold my vehicle and stuffed the book in the glovebox. I saved tons of money from the confidence of having a manual to help me through repairs instead of shelling out $300 for a mechanic to do the same job I did for less than $100 for parts.",3.0

"On a '01 Rav4 I'm seeing a P0750 code (Transmission solenoid A) which is consistent with the '01-'03 Rav4 ECU / Transmission problem that was the subject of a Toyota recall.

"I'm the original owner of a 1997 RAV4 which has been a fabulous car.  Understandably, at this age, the RAV has recently needed some TLC.  I took my dad's advice of saving a lot of $$$ by attempting to do some maintenance myself instead of a shop.  This is the first time I have worked on a car so I bought some tools (tool shopping is totally addicting, btw) and this book.

At first we debated between the Chilton book and the OEM Toyota shop manual which was twice the $$$.  I was a bit skeptical that the Chilton book could thoroughly cover model years 1996-2002 which is essentially TWO different body styles and THREE different engines (96-97' had the orginal engine, 98-00' was a revised engine and 01-02 was the new body style).  But what the heck, I wanted to save money so I went with the Chilton.

In the past few months I've done a bunch repairs: idle air control valve, cleaning the throttle body, replaced valve cover gasket, plugs, wires, distributor cap and rotors, tested a few sensors, etc....

My initial gut feeling was right.  Though the book did a great job guiding me on some repairs, I found some instructions and illustrations lacking thoughtfulness.  For example, their illustration states that the coolant hoses attached to the throttle body are the same for years 96-97' and 98-00' but in fact they are slightly different.  This was just one of MANY slight mistakes throughout the book, and it was extremely frustrating especially for a beginner like me.  And many of the instructions were very vague and bordering on incomplete (like the seemingly simple task of removing the valve cover which required me removing way more parts than the instructions stated).  I found myself constantly seeking help from online
forums (RAV4world.com is great).

I really wished I would've forked up the extra $$$ for the OEM Toyota manual.  My dad has one for his Previa and it is way more complete with better instructions and more illustrations.

This book might be fine for a seasoned mechanic, but for beginners like me, I would definitely suggest investing in the OEM Toyota manual.",3.0

Since it is supposed to be for the home mechanic, it might be nice to rate some of the jobs between easy and difficult, but I won't rate it down for that. What this manual did for me was convince me that I should have a pro do the job, and that saved me the frustration of starting a job I couldn't finish.",3.0
As with this type of manual it is hit and miss. It points you in the right direction but tries to generalize some things which makes you have to guess sometimes. It's worth the price as the OEM repair manuals can cost upwards of $100. So all in all this will get you going but be prepared to figure some stuff out on your own. For instance the brake pictures that are shown do not match what I have on my tuck.,3.0
"I bought this book to help me diagnose and change the alternator. I expected to see many more steps in taking things apart, but was disappointed when I started working in the car.

There are numerous steps missing and several key pictures missing. Some of the pics are completely clueless on which part you are looking at. It should be great for an experienced person but then, it's pointless: if one is savvy enough he don't need the book.

Anyways, it's a great source of consult for a first timer. It'll save you serious bucks if you are the kinda of handyman.

All systems of the car are there, but don't expect great details.

Suggestions are made on many procedures, but there are lots of gaps on this topic too: one could use many alternatives instead of ""take the pulley of the alterator off"" (it's not needed : a new one comes with the pulley..)

The wiring diagrams are great. They helped me to clearly understand  how the car ir wired and how the components interact.

However, there is no mention of the MM in this manual.  Second, changing the rear differential fluid is part of the ongoing maintenance schedule for 4WD CR-Vs.  This is definitely a DIY project.

The drain plugs are removed with the square end of a 3/8"" ratchet, but no mention of this.  Finally, Honda recommends new crush washers (oil changes too), but again, no mention of this.

"I have owned many Haynes repair manuals and they are usually very helpful.  I did not find this manual helpful.  I own a 2002 CR-V, this manual favors civics in it's repair instructions and pictures.  I would like to see a CR-V specific repair manual made by Haynes. I will use an example.  I wanted to replace the starter, or at least take it out to test it.  The repair manual stated that all I needed to do was remove four bolts and viola, I would have my starter out.  What the manual failed to mention was that the exhaust manifold had to be first taken out (I found this out from online forums;) no where in this manual did that important fact be mentioned.  In all honesty this product is much better than nothing at all, but it would be far superior if it was model specific.

Basic layout of how to fix your car

Cons:
Needs to be model specific",3.0

Some of the procedures and photos are not as detailed as the Haynes manuals I have for other vehicles I had.,3.0
"So, here's the issue with the Haynes manual.  It's written for more than one model vehicle.  While these vehicles (CRV and Civic) are similar enough to maintain, the narrative of repairs still tries to maintain a commonality between the vehicles.  For those who have good general knowledge of cars, this is probably good enough.  However, for a newbie like myself, I've had to supplement with the internet and friends who've done these things before.

Pros:
- Major Chapter Subjects are divided pretty well
- Good description of tools and hardware
- Good recommendations for maintenance schedule

Cons:
- Pages have a ton of information in small font, so it's easy to lose your place
- Skimming chapters is not simple - the flow of the chapters are not always coherent
- Images are poor quality and hard to make out if you're a beginner
- Hard to use the book while you're actually working on the car (not sure if there's a real solution to this, though)

This manual is much better for the more experienced DIYer.  If you're a beginner look for the Honda Factory Service Manual instead.  The CD version will be about twice as much as this manual, but well worth it.",3.0
"I've used Haynes' and Chilton's books for years, but this isn't their best effort.  I have a few big complaints.

1) A very, very great deal of information is generic automotive data that's probably copied and pasted between all their books, and in a couple of instances, I found some of this generic information that wasn't particularly correct in the case of Civics.

2) The book spreads itself across multiple *generations* of Civics and Civic body styles AND tries to tackle CRVs at the same time.  It's just spread too thin.  It's sometimes difficult to hone in on the data that's appropriate for your vehicle.  It doesn't seem to cover Si's at all.

3) I hate to disagree with most of the other reviews, but the book doesn't dig very deep.  Too many systems explanations give only a cursory overview, 101 level troubleshooting (check the fuses, check the seals), then we're admonished to take the car to a dealer if we still have issues.  This is the treatment given for systems as simple as the power locks and emissions.

If you're only doing simple tune-up work, and you're maybe after an easy-difficulty repair or two, this book might work.  If really want to learn about your car in depth, or you want to make sure you don't get caught short in the middle of a job with insufficient or incomplete information, or if you're going to take on more difficult jobs, you'll want a better book.

For about 20 bucks more, you can have the complete factory shop manuals right here on Amazon, and they're on CD so you can search the contents and print what you want before attempting a job.

Bishko reprints the Honda official manuals on CD, and you'll have the exact information for your particular car.  All of it.  Enough to tear down the engine and transmission and build it back up to factory specs.  And anything else you can imagine.

Granted, factory service manuals sometimes assume you have access to tools and equipment you either don't have or can't get at all, but I'd rather read, know, and understand than be told ""this is over your head, take it to the dealer"".  Often times, specialized tools can be improvised, or Internet forum wisdom can help you work around your lack of factory test equipment.

Again, the book isn't terrible, I just expect considerable depth in a repair manual, and felt like I got something that was basically a little better than the owner's manual.  If that's all you're after, perhaps this book is fine.  If not, you have other affordable options.",3.0

So you are left trying to figure out where to find instructions for something is only part of what you wanted to accomplish.  I hope there are other manuals out there that show more detail.",3.0

"If you're going to do any serious engine, drivetrain, or suspension repairs I would recommend a factory repair manual if you can afford the $200.00 price tag. I have compared a factory repair manual to Haynes on Chevy Astros and I found serious incorrect information  on front suspension disassembly procedure that not only doesn't work but damaging the front coil springs. The authors of these books seem to presume one size fits all ( or in this case all front coil spring suspensions are the same) As far as this repair manual for the HHR they have left out views of the engine compartment with the sheet metal body parts removed or drawings depicting areas that can't be photographed easily. They use to include this in their older manuals. Also in flipping through this book I noticed several Toyota pickup photos standing in for the HHR regarding cleaning the engine. Once again This is probably due to that pesky sheet  metal that with the large air filter housing  completely covers the engine.",3.0
"I'm a professional mechanic and I know the value of having a good shop manual when you're getting ""down and dirty"" with a car or motorcycle. Normally, whenever I buy a new car, truck or motorcycle for myself, I buy the OEM service manual to have BEFORE I need it. But when I bought my 2011 Mazda3, I found that the OEM manual costs hundreds of dollars! That is just nuts. So I caved and bought the Haynes manual instead. It wastes too much space with generic mechanical information which applies to every vehicle on the road, as opposed being specific to the Mazda3. That info may be helpful to a total ""newby"", but it's a waste of paper and ink to an experienced wrench and it occupies too much of this book, leaving too little real, in depth, model specific information to rate more than a few stars. But it is better than nothing and a LOT cheaper than the OEM service manual.",3.0

"Adequate coverage of major and minor repair jobs but photographs are murky and in some cases very difficult to interpret.

The recommended maintenance schedules often are many multiples of manufacturer's recommendations and for even the most conservative owner 3,000 mile oil changes (using the recommended synthetic oil) is way, way too often -- wastes money and resources.

The book has pages of non-VW unique information that seems to be common to most of Haynes's manuals -- good basic information but for most buyers of manuals like this, too basic.

But there is very little on the market -- short of the expensive official VW manuals -- for these cars so this manual is about as good as it gets.",3.0

"Very disappointed in this Haynes manual for the Mini.  My first exposure to a Haynes manual was as a teen when I had my old PoS Triumph Spitfire.  That manual was my bible.  EVERY part of that car was taken apart and rebuilt, with copious images to guide you.

I got this manual hoping to do some basic service (not a rebuild) on the CVT transmission on my son's PoS Mini.  The section for the CVT is less than a page, vaguely worded, and has not one single image.  The entire auto trans section, mostly on the 6-speed, is a whole three pages.  It was completely useless for my immediate needs.  I would imagine the other parts of the manual are ok, but they sure wanted nothing to do with the automatics in this one.  You buy a manual to fix things yourself, and I ended up having to take it somewhere.  In hindsight, there is better information on this on internet forums.

My next project was to try to adjust the headlights since they seemed to be pointing right at the ground in front of the car, and that section outright said to take it to a Mini dealer.  A dealer...for headlight adjustments...  So I went outside and had a look, and within about 60 seconds had located two large, very obvious, plastic adjusting screws on each headlight pod.  One was marked L-R and the other U-D on each pod.  I guess Haynes writers couldn't decipher what those letters meant.  You could even adjust them with your bare hands.  It just required a lot of lowering and raising the hood to check the adjustments, but even a monkey could have figured that out.",3.0

"This manual is useful and inexpensive, but NOT the best, more detailed or most complete.  In places, it is pretty generic.

I strongly recommend the manual from Bentley (publisher), as it is considerably more complete.  Yea, the Bentley manual costs more, but if you are doing something more complex than a brake job (which you could probably do without the manual), the additional detail is very helpful.

"Bought this since my car is over 120,000 miles and I want to start doing more of my own stuff.  120,000 mile service was going to be a pretty penney at the dealer, and although I have done my own oil changes on this car, and more involved work on other cars, I hadn't really done anything serious on this car.  And when I did work on other cars, I always bought the factory service manual to help me a long as I am not a mechanic; but with proper instructions, I can do pretty much any of it.  On the Prius however, the factory service manual was silly expensive and three volums.
This book really lacks in detail, and occassionally seems to miss steps completedly.  And it is clear that a substantial part of the book is simply cut and pasted from their other car manuals.  I hate when they say ""tighten to torgue listed at the front of this chapter/book"" why not just put it here on the page I am looking at?  Except to save money by makig the books faster and cheaper to write.  Just annoying.  Would it really cost you that much more to do it properly and put the spec in both places?
I think more and better/larger pictures would help.  Sometimes they show where the part is located by taking a pic and pointing an arrow at the part, which is great, except the pic is so small you can't tell where in the engine bay it was taken.  Especially since none of the pics are in color.  Also, and this might seem like nit-picking but the paper used int he book is the cheapest thinest paper you can buy.  Sure it saves money, but it makes it harder to read in anything but direct light, which isn't always what you have when you are working on a car.  It also makes it much more likely that you will tear or otherwise damage the pages when your hands are the least bit oily or dirty -- obviously a common scenario when reading a car repair manual.
I just got the Bentley publishing one, and although a little more than twice as much $$, it has a lot more info, it is presented clearer and it has better pictures.  It isn't perfect, but a lot better than this one -- a lot.",3.0
"What can I say?  It's a Haynes manual.  But it's far better than Chilton manuals.  It has torque specs, pictures, etc.  but like any Haynes manual is overly general and vague at times.

The game comes in a yellow barrel that is filled with monkeys. The monkeys go back into the barrel when the game is over for easy storage.

This game is easy for the younger children to understand (but not necessarily to play) and promotes hand-eye coordination and patience. It's recommended for children 2-5. It's made of durable hard plastic and is almost impossible to break. It's also an inexpensive game and easy to clean up.

"For a Makita product this one is definitely under par for them.  Probably average for the overall market. The material is VERY skimpy, especially on the edges where is needs to be full.  The thickness is barely 1/2"" which is thin for a supposed quality polishing bonnet.  Maybe I got a dud, I sure hope so as I hate to see Makita loosing quality.  Instead, I just went with my old trustworthy 3M.

"Yeah, I have issues with mis-represented products. The picture shows 4 bags, mine has 3. So, what's the difference? I don't believe the air flow is affected as another reviewer states. Not by much anyway.
The material would have more to do with how much air can pass through in any given time period.
My observation was the size of the bags. They appear to be the same size as the original. So, the original filter had 25% more surface area. The more surface area, the longer the filter will last as it will be able to hold more dust.
So, 5 stars for fitting my JDS and working well.
-1 star for having less surface area than the original.
-1 star for showing a 4 bagger and sellng a 3 bagger.

Oh yeah, spend a few more bucks and buy the pre-filter. Just use masking tape to affix it to the front of the unit. When it gets dirty, use your shop vac to back vac it without even removing it. The electrostatic filter will go longer between cleanings and the 3 bagger will last longer between replacements. Or go to a big box store and buy the 3 pack of spun wool filters for 5 bucks. They work about half as well as the pre-filter made for the unit.",3.0

"Despite the gauge of the wire being listed as 4ga. It really wasn't. I'm not sure but it seems as if modern wire gauging is done differently than it used to be. The actual metal core of the wire wasn't as thick as other 4 gauge I have. Despite this, I'm sure these will work. Actual length was correct, they seem pretty well made.",3.0
They are depicted as Orange in the picture when purchasing but when they pulled a fast one and when they arrived they are actually bright red!!,3.0
"I have two other pair for other vehicles that I had purchased years ago.  I figured I'd purchase another set thru Amazon.  Based on a lot of positive reviews I thought I'd buy these.  After receiving them I was surprised to find that of my three sets, this is the lowest quality of the three.  The fist thing I noticed is that the insulation on the wire is much thinner than my other sets.  However, the copper wire seems about the same so I'm find with that.  However, my real beef with these cables is the clamps themselves.  When I squeeze these handles, they open but they also twist as they open.  The clamp metal is much thinner than my other two.  I also see that clamps do not contain much for battery clamping material.

Bottom line, these will work for the (hopefully) few times I ever need to use them but I certainly would not consider them to be heavy duty.",3.0
"I read this review, ignored it, bought these anyways, and hate them! I rather use my cheapy alligator Target specials than these. That is saying something from someone who used to jump start cars/trucks/semis for a living (worked close to a freeway offramp). The clamps are absolutely horrid and the uneven jaws cause these to move a bit sideways from their ""spinning"" to a stop, if you will, on a short post. These do not place well on both my Optima batteries' posts. When a car won't jump, we can't help but wonder if it is the battery (Mustangs and their dead batteries, you know...) or these cables, so we keep trying to reseat them on the post better, until we can attain a jump. So after the umpteenth time of frustration with these, I am back here at Amazon searching for something better. Slim pickings too. Just basically Colemans. I guess I will try the 2 gauge parrots, but I am wondering if their jaws are too big for shorter posts sitting in the back of a crowded hood.",3.0
"The clamps on these are the week point. The connection between the clamp and the cable is not the best, just some metal tabs bent over the wire. The clamps themselves will not fit on the terminals on my battery. The notch on the clamps for side terminals also doesn't really work all that well. I keep them in my truck for emergency use and they work good at jumping cars, but look elsewhere if you need to jump start a diesel or tractor.",3.0
I am not really impressed with these cables. I expected 4 gauge cables to be a little more heavy-duty. I guess you get what you pay for.,3.0
"For the price and in the right situations these are good cables.  Good length, good ga. wire and copper connectors. But for me where they fall short is at the clamps and this type of clamp seems to be on MANY cables available today. I could not see it in the photos but the clamps are uneven at the ends because of the extra notch the manufacturer adds on one side to make it easier to connect to side terminal batteries. Also there are NO teeth on the end of the jaws so you HAVE to make your connection using the teeth on the sides of the jaws.  This does not sound like a big deal until you are in a tight situation and have to clamp onto a top post battery straight down, then you have an uneven clamp end and no teeth to grip the post.  I happen to also have a car (a domestic) with a remote mounted battery, not a HOT ROD or modified car, just a stock factory production car where the manufacturer could not fit the battery under the hood for space saving and design reasons and put it elsewhere in the car.  Remote batteries used to be a rare thing on mostly European cars but it is fairly common now on all makes of cars.  With the battery not under the hood or in the trunk I have a Pos. and Neg. lug under the hood at the end of battery cables to jump the car with.  The Pos. lug is surrounded by plastic in a depression to prevent anything from accidentally hitting it and shorting.  Because of this there is little room and I can not get the side of these jumper cable clamps to grab the lug, I need teeth on the end of the jaws to grip the Pos. lug. I'm returning these cables and for $15 more (on sale) than the price of these cables I got the same length, the same 4 ga. wire, clamps with teeth on all 3 sides, even jaw ends, a side terminal connection in the jaws, and they came with a hard plastic storage case, safety glasses and gloves. After shopping around for a week I found this is a great deal.  I shopped all over the Net and in my local stores comparing prices wire length, size, and end clamps.  There are many great items for great prices at Amazon but if you need what I need in a jumper cable go to your local SEARS.",3.0
"I just received these cables, and they look fine, except there is no strain-relief for the copper cable at each clamp.  The copper wire appears soldered to the clamps, but further back the insulation passes through some eyelets, but the eyelets are not crimped down to provide strain relief.  What this means is, strain (bending) of the copper cable will cause fatigue and the copper wire strands will break.

For example, take a paper clip or other metal and keep bending it - it will eventually fatigue and break.

I considered using pliers to crimp the eyelets, but I'm not sure that wouldn't void any warranty for the product.

But, considering how often jumper cables are used for most people, it should be ok.  Just be aware, if these get frequent use, they could fail when most needed.",3.0

"Won't know this product's worth for a couple of years until the bearings seize or the thermal overload protector pops and the motor quits operating.  My luck so far with these motors has not been good - they only last for a couple of years in the hot attic environment.  They should be built/made with sealed ball bearings rather than sleeve bearings which dry out and cause the motor to seize.  They also are very simple motors and should cost a lot less than the $49 price that is charged.

"Shipped and received promptly.  I would have wanted to know it doesn't do a real good job of holding the tubing during flaring.  I would have wanted to know the interior of the flare wasn't nice and smooth and that the very ends of the flared tubing are too rough.  It makes a ""usable"" flare not a good usable flare.",3.0
"This is a good tool if you only have a couple of flares to do. If you have more or are not mechanically inclined you will find this tool challenging. It MUST be adjusted for each size of tubing you are working with, so be prepared for a challenge. I bought this tool because I only had one flare to make and the cheapest one I could find around here was in the $70.00 range. So for me it worked out ok but I can't recommend it.",3.0
"This tool is a usable option if you do occasional work and need something inexpensive.  I would not use it if I were doing brakes all day. The tool is a nice concept - hand held, compact, etc - but it has some engineering flaws.

First off, read the instructions.  The tool will probably not work out of the box.  There is an eccentric on the moving handle pivot that allow you to set die spacing and crimp pressure.  If you have it set too high, two things will happen:  1. the dies will cam over, i.e. toggle, and your flare will be off center (see my pic) 2. your tube will get crushed.  The stationary turrent die has a weak detent to hold it in place, and high pressure will cause it to move.  You don't need a ton of pressure to hold soft tubing, especially something like copper tube, or copper-nickel brake line.  Second, you'll probably want a RoFlare DF style adapter if you do double flares. You can't easily fit a standard button style flare adapter next to your tube to measure the initial stickout.

You can turn the tall hex shaped towers with a wrench to fine tune the initial die alignment, however this is mostly cosmetic. This tool relies on the tube to align the die blocks. Light pressure on the die faces is required to align them right before you close the handle. Turrets need to be checked to make sure they don't toggle.  If you do all that, it makes good centered flares without deforming the tube.  It does leave light marks in softer tube, but it does not affect function.  You'll want to grease the threads on the clamp, and make sure you use the correct lube (brake fluid for brakes, etc) when making your flares.

If you switch sizes - like going from 3/16 to 1/4 - you may have to adjust the cam again.  You'll also have to adjust it if you switch tube types.  This is why it's ok for home use, but not for high volume use.... too much adjusting.  The whole tool flexes when the clamp is tightened, and since it puts pressure on the edge of the die blocks, they do ""splay"" out. This results in a somewhat pinched tube neck just under the edge of the flare.  Again, not pretty but functional.  If I had known all this, I probably would not have bought it, but since I have it I'll use it.",3.0
The head doesn't pivot,3.0
OK tool,3.0
It really didn't help that no one might of token their time to post any pix of this item. The only reason I'm giving it a 3 star rating is because it wasn't what I expected and the measurement that this tool had for flaring wasn't accurate. It ended up being a little bigger than I expected and the picture looks way more different than what I received. I'm sure this tool still does it's job but I needed it for work and the size I needed it for wasn't on it like it described it was. I really hope that these pictures I posted help out future buyers.,3.0

"I had my own small engine repair business for many years. I can see the need for this type of plug in a car, but cannot think of one single reason to put a platinum plug in a small engine.

I bought two of these for my Vanguard used in my propane generator. This product probably works great in a gasoline engine but propane uses a very tight gap of .20 inch instead of .30 in a gasoline engine and the plug is made for a larger gap.

However, the epoxy around the base of the spout either arrived cracked or cracked the first time I used it. It leaks slowly, but enough to make a mess when you leave it sit for a while. If I bought it again I would get the fixed spout.",3.0
"While being a good little pumper, It leaked as much as went into the machine, as did not. Wasted good Tellus 32  way oil. Over time this will mount up....not sure if this is a good oiler , especially if you have oil you don't want to see on the clean-up rag .",3.0
"Good size and it works for its intended purpose.  But it does leak from the crimp at the bottom.  Other than the fresh oil ring this thing leaves on any surface it gets set on, it's a great can.

But read any reviews on these types of cans, and a large portion will complain about leaks at the crimp at the bottom.  Come on, guys.  It's 2015.  We makes cars that run for decades, machines that build machines, and we routinely put human beings into space - yet companies that special specialize in oil cans can't seem to design one that doesn't leak its contents all over.  This is beyond disappointing...  This is ludicrous!",3.0
"I've got 2 of these, and one works perfectly.  The other leaks from the folded seal at the bottom, so it has to be stored on something which can catch a little oil.  Not bad for the price I suppose.",3.0
"Works fine, but you can get the same thing at any of those ubiquitous stores that sell tools made in China for a third the price. Two weeks after I got this, I saw it in one of those shops; same thing, different label glued on.",3.0
"I really was excited about getting this toy for my son and as soon as he opened it, we started putting it together.  It was relatively easy to put together but the problems started almost immediately thereafter.
1)  One of the slots had lots of dead spots and the car just wouldn't run more than a few feet at a time.
2)  The other slot seemed OK, but it still took several attempts before the car would go all the way around the track.
3)  The wires for the controllers are very short and we had some issues tripping over them and having them interfere with the cars.
4)  After playing with it for an hour, we were both fed up - it just was too difficult to make it work right.
I have put it back in the box and am frustrated!",3.0
"I just received this and tested it on a few 1/8 inch steel rivets.  It seems to work well, it required a bit more force than I had anticipated, but the on-board storage for the tips and wrench are a nice touch.  The Amazon listing shows this for 3/32 to 3/16 inch rivets, however, on the back of the package, in small print, it states ""NOT recommended for use with 3/16 inch (5mm) diameter all-steel rivets""

Also, the package does not warn you that the nail-like mandrel shoots out of the top of the tool with some force when it snaps as the rivet is fully installed, so keep clear of the discharge.",3.0
"This tool accepts four sizes of blind rivets and secures them effectively and straightforwardly.  There is no need to access the other side of the pieces you are riveting together, provided you can drill them and compress them together from one side.  To use the riveter, simply insert the flanged end of a rivet into the opening in the nose, press the unflanged end of the rivet into a hole of the proper diameter, and squeeze the handles.  The rivet will expand against the sides of the hole, holding the pieces together with a compression fit, like a nail.
Be aware that this tool does blind riveting, not through riveting.  The effectiveness of the connection depends on close tolerances and hard materials.  The rivets are fundamentally hollow cylinders of metal with small flanges on one end.  A bit of wire much like a finishing nail passes through the rivet and out the flanged end.  The tool grips the wire and pulls it through the rivet so that the ""nailhead"" on the unflanged side of the rivet causes it to mushroom slightly.
If you need a more secure connection like that provided by a through bolt, nut, and washers, and have access to the opposite side of the pieces to be connected, a through riveter would be a better choice.",3.0
It is as described but if you want the extra long rivets for Scotty attachments for your kayak you need to get the ones specific for Scotty extra long rivets.,3.0
"Great little rivet gun, it does takes some effort to get a rivet to pop but then... it's a manual gun. Hind site, spend the money and go with the air operated gun, so easy and so much quicker.",3.0
works okay doesn't have much leverage for tough rivets IE: stainless rivets. I'm sure the swivel will come in handy at some point but makes it tougher to get that extra squeeze in some instances; as it rotates on you when you don't want it to.,3.0

Easy to replace. It is too early to comment about the service this one has provided. It is performing as expected. Ask me about it again in a couple of years and I'm likely to give it more stars. When I install I mark the date when put into service. The one I replaced was over five years old.,3.0
I received the APC replacement battery today.  The internal package had been resealed. The battery label is loose and the plastic case shows scratches and abrasions as if had been used. I'm not sure if it is worth the trouble to test it in the UPS.,3.0
The APC battery is an exact replacement though sadly its made in Vietnam of all places! Personally if Amazon put the country of origin in its product description I would have looked elsewhere bu then maybe thats why they DONT put it in the description!,3.0
"I am writing as a word to those like me who have to replace their APC UPS batteries.  I have a BACKUPS-XS1500 LCD uninteruptable power supply and recently needed to replace the batteries.  I didn't realize until I pulled out the APC batteries and realized there was a brand name below the white APC label that APC had slapped over the sides of the batteries, in essence putting their name on someone else's battery products.  Mine was a company named Vision.  Based on research, I discovered that APC utilizes a variety of battery manufacturers and slapped their labels on them and charges a premium.  With that being said, it is not necessary to buy an APC labeled battery for your UPS.  Find a name brand that you are comfortable with that fits the specifications of your battery.  You can, like I did, pull the label off and see who the true manufacturer is and the specifications.  In my case, I have a dual battery, meaning I have to buy two individual 12 Volt batteries and put them together into my UPS.

So it is not necessary to pay a premium for a APC labeled battery, just go with a reasonably priced option that has a name brand and good reviews and you will be fine.",3.0
"APC RBC2 Replacement Battery , I actually received a knockoff of this battery. That was not what I thought I was purchasing. This is not a company that I would do business with anytime again.",3.0
"The picture and description clearly say APC branded. What arrives is not APC branded. I'll have to see how long it lasts, but my experience with non-APC brands is not good.",3.0
"I've purchased at least ten of these in the past from Amazon.com and they were all original APC batteries with free shipping to dispose the old battery. But I had sent the link to my office administrator to order the item and the item that comes up is the cheapest one out of the whole list, which in this case ends up being the ABC battery not the OEM one from APC. I haven't installed the battery yet so I hope it works ok. The other issue is now I need to either pay for shipping the old battery for disposal or find someplace to take the old battery locally which is not worth the $3 savings. I recommend to buy from Amazon even though it's $3 more, saves in the long run.
I gave it 3 stars for now because I need to either pay to ship the old battery for disposal or find some place and drop it off to get it disposed properly which is time consuming. I think if they are not going to send you what is shown in the photos, it should be in a separate listing.",3.0
"Like Alan in yesterday's review I was also sent an ABC, American Battery Company, battery and NOT an APC, American Power Conversion, Battery. Not only that but the interior package, which had been opened and resealed, was from Ingram Micro to Amazon.  This is a misleading description and photo.

You cannot return batteries but Amazon is sending me a replacement battery, hopefully an APC battery, at no extra charge. Because of the holiday it will be a week. They are letting me keep the knockoff.

I cannot figure out how to rate this since it is the wrong item. I would give 1 star because two of use have gotten the wrong part but 4 stars for fixing the problem. So will give it a 3 for now.",3.0
"Even though the picture, and all of the descriptions refer to a genuine APC battery, I was sent an ""ABC"" battery instead. While it is fully compatible with the Back UPS, it is very misleading. In addition, you don't get a pre-paid return label to ship the used one back for recycling. Instead, you get a note telling you where you can send it, and that there is a charge for UPS to ship it back. The price is about $6.00 less than a genuine one directly from APC's website. And for the extra $6.00 bucks, you get the pre-paid return label. So the overall cost is about the same. I guess the real test is in how long this ""knock off"" battery will actually last. The real ""APC"" one lasted around 3 years. Only time will tell. But knowing this one isn't the real thing, I would NOT have bought it. But it may turn out to be fine in the long run. Who knows??? I guess it all depends on how you feel about purchasing ""knock off's"" with an unknown quality.",3.0
"I ordered a American Power Conversion (APC) replacement battery and received an American Battery Company (ABC) battery. This is not the battery that is being advertised and is not what originally came with my UPS. The dimensions are the same as my original battery so it will fit inside my UPS. I have 4 UPS's in my home and until now all have used original APC batterys, and each replacement battery has lasted 4 years. I will see if this ABC battery lasts as long! [...] should change the picture in their advertisement to show the ABC label and not refer to this as an APC battery.",3.0
"Built a new garage last year with a super smooth concrete floor but the creeper I've been trying to use kept getting hung-up on even the smallest of pebbles or gravel that may be on the floor. I usually ended up using cardboard cause the creeper was more trouble than what is was worth and I ended up on the floor anyway.  I'm very happy with the smooth operation of ""The Bone"" it goes in the direction you want to go and is quite comfortable to work off of.  The ad claimed you could roll over cords, tools and parts, I tried this but was unsuccessful it got hung-up, so you probably want to stick with a smooth obsticle free surface.  The creeper is somewhat hard to get on and off of because of its odd shape, but I understand that to mount a five inch wheel at each corner it would have to be shaped as is.  For what I need this creeper for it will serve me nicely but don't plan on using it on gravel floors or on dirt, you'll probably be disappointed plus the price is about double what it should be.",3.0
it's fine. I just would like the stickers to be a little more secure as I'm not sure I trust the gluing power of it. But for the moment it holds my keys.,4.0
"After I wrote the below review, the manufacturer contacted me and explained how to use this.  Instead of the (current) picture on Amazon where the phone is placed vertically, you actually use the stand with the phone placed horizontally.  Then the charge / sync cable goes through the hole and you can charge from the side.  When used in landscape position this stand does make more sense so I'm upgrading this review from 2 stars to 4 stars (which I rarely do, but in this case user error) with a star off for lack of documentation.  Manufacturer has said he will include directions and I would also encourage him to update the photos on Amazon with more examples of how this can be used.  The wood quality is indeed good and it's a sturdy little stand.  I'm trying to think of when I'd actually use this stand... perhaps for Facetime chats.  I also think it would be useful for someone in an open office environment if they want to keep their phone on their desk and see alerts / notifications easily.  Hope this updated review helps.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I am throwing this stand in the garbage.  While it's crafted of a nice wood, it is not functional as near as I can tell.  It does not come with instructions and as you can see from the product description, even that is confusing since the English is poorly translated Chinese.  The iPhone sits on the stand just fine, but when it's on the stand, there is no way the plug on the bottom  will plug in -- the stand blocks it.  If you turn the iPhone over, the plug is on the top, which just looks strange.  And I'm not at all sure what the hole in the back of the stand is supposed to do.  Also included are four plastic feet, again no instructions, so I affixed them to the bottom of the stand and it began to wobble.

Perhaps someone else will figure out how to work this thing and post a review, but as far as I'm concerned, the out of the box experience was terrible.

Sorry, I cannot recommend.

This product definitely has enough power to clean the car (as long as you keep the car running when you plug in). It is good quality. It gets the job done. I have a clean car in general.

I loved the heavy duty materials but was really disappointed at how much suction it lacked. Im a freak about my car and was looking for something to spot clean the carpets from time to time and was a little disappointed at how long it took me to just spot clean.

The only thing i found bad was that the plug when plugged in got hot and that was only after just a few minutes of use.

And the ""skinny tool"" is nice for those hard-to-reach places. My only complaint and the reason why I didn't give it four stars is because as I was vacuuming the cupholders and some of the areas of the car with the skinny tool I noticed the vacuum was scratching the car but that could also be the cheap material of my car.

I bought my car used and when I was looking in the nooks and crannies found some pet hair that did not get picked by the vacuum, so if you have a pet this might not be for you. It is good for regular maintence but if you have let your carpet go for awhile better go to the car wash, it could take a while. The carrying case and extra filter are nice, it recommends cleaning the filter after each use so one can dry while you use the other. The cord is extra long which makes it easy to reach everywhere from one port. overall I like it.",4.0

"An ideal and recommendable product for those that like me have busy lives, which prevent proper car maintenance. Albeit bought March 13, the product arrived on time as scheduled [prime].

I used it yesterday April 8, and I managed to removed a lot of dust. So far I like it, it is small, convenient and the pieces enable me to clean accordingly.

It definitely seemed to have a more powerful motor than the original one I ordered and I'm intrigued to try out the tire inflation option! It would be really great it that worked well!
The sucking power of this car vacuum cleaner was lacking. I don't know if it's just my car (not enough power coming out of the adapter??) or if it just doesn't have a very strong motor. I had to run it over the same spot many times to get it to pick up the dirt. The convenience of not having to find quarters and go to the self vacuum place was what motivated me, but I'm not sure I will have to patience to used this on my car much, because it takes so dang long and doesn't get very clean.",4.0

Vacuum works great
Three adapters

Bag needs improvement",4.0
Used it a couple of times and it does an adequate job although it could be a little more powerful.

EDIT TO ADD: Mine did NOT come with the extra filter as promised, so I did take away a star for misleading advertising.",4.0
I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't because mine came without the extra filter.  This vacuum is great: I did not want a battery operated vacuum because they usually are less powerful and must be constantly recharged. This plugs into the cigarette lighter. You must have the car running to get it to its full speed. The chord is very long so it will reach everywhere in your vehicle.  The attachments are great and provide a variety of different configurations. I just like the brush on the tip. Cleaning it is very easy too. One recommendation is to use an air compressor every once in a while to clean the HEPA filter.,4.0

"* Great design
* Light weight
* Easy to store, both in car and at home
* Easy to clean after use
* Really like the reusable filter - NO need to purchase more
* Brush tip is very sturdy, which makes me feels like I am really cleaning the interior.

* My only concern is that the suction power is not strong enough.  While vacuuming inside pockets on back of front seats, I had to grab a plastic piece by hand.  Also, while accessories are handy, it is still hard to get into some places, such as between front seats and middle consul.

This vacuum was the one with the strongest Wattage on Amazon.  Perhaps I could have ended with a weaker one.",4.0
"This is a well made iPhone stand that holds my 6S at just the right angle.  It's described as being made of bamboo, but the box states the stand is actually  Basswood/Walnut plywood, and that appears to be correct.  The stand I received had a flat walnut finish and is very stiff and strong.  Although the turned up lip is not very high, it actually does an excellent job of holding the phone.  The packaging included (4) thin, clear [possibly silicone] rubber pads which should be installed to prevent the otherwise slippery wood stand from slipping.

The walnut finish is attractive, and the current photos seen pretty accurate in showing the correct color and finish of the stand.

The anti-radiation claim is obviously based on simply moving the phone away from one's head.  The wood stand does not appear to have any electromagnetic or electrostatic shielding of any type, and if it did would likely affect the phone operation in a negative way anyway.",4.0

"I have a fairly new car and unlike my old heavily used mini-van, this one can continue to look new as long as I take good care of it. I like to use the car wash vacuums because they have such good suction. But in between visits, this is fairly good for quick touch ups. I really like the crevice tool because it gets in between the seats especially on the sides of the driver and passenger seats where all kinds of things fall down.

The suction is moderate and it has a harder time getting things like dry grass out of the carpet. It is no comparison to a car wash vacuum but it does what you would think for a smaller hand-held. It runs off your car battery (convenient) and has a couple of attachments, an easy to clean collection area and a carry bag for all the parts. Sample provided for review.",4.0
"Well, I am surprised.  Completely and totally and pleasantly surprised.  Yes, I am yet another reviewer who received this car vac for free from the seller because they needed folks to test this out and review it.  I agreed to test it but I was very skeptical.

Here's the thing.  My car is a dog car.  Make no mistake about it, it is filled with dog hair because they ride in the car and come to work with me more often than not.  They aren't per se huge shedders but the car almost always looks like it's wearing a fur coat.  When I bring it to some of the most sophisticated hand car washes around here they always tell me that they doubt if they can get all the dog hair out.  So, with this little thirty five dollar mini vac I just was not optimistic.

It did a GOOD job.  The suction doesn't feel very strong and in fact it isn't.  But when I was done, the car looked a good seventy or eighty percent better.  This picked up the dog hair that was loose, no problem.  It struggled a bit to wrest the dog hair away from the carpeted mats but it really did good.  I used the attachments to try to free the trapped fur from the carpeting and also to get into much tighter spots.  By the time I was done my car looked significantly cleaner.  I am impressed.  It could stand to have a bit more suction but honestly it did fine with what suction it did have.  And the cylinder that holds whatever particles  you vacuumed up is very easy to open and clean.  I am so tired of these bagless vac that are so difficult you clean that you end up with everything you vacuumed up right back on the floor.  You won't have that problem with this vacuum

BOTTOM LINE:  Is this the best vacuum I've ever used?  No, but it certainly is one of the most practical and easy to use  And it really does a very good job cleaning.  So small and packable that it's easy to just keep in your car and pull out when you need it.  It comes with a little carry bag which fits the vac perfectly and you can even fit the accessories in there.",4.0

This vacuum is a ""dust buster"" for those who are familiar with it. Therefore, it does not have the same powerful suction as an actual vacuum cleaner. That being said, it can clean up your vehicle well. The power cord is long enough to easily reach every inch of my Dodge Grand Caravan minivan. If you do have difficulty reaching there is an extension hose you can connect. The vacuum comes with two different adapter tips to help clean in hard to reach areas. My favorite adapter is the brush, because it can pick up more than the suction alone. When you are finished using the vacuum you can press the button on top that releases the large end piece with the filter. Pull the filter out and you are able to discard the contents. Since this comes with a carrying case you can keep everything together and in your vehicle.

Overall, it performs as advertised and I am pleased with it's cleaning ability. I do wish there was more suction to clean more quickly and to remove pet hair easier. The suction alone hasn't been able to remove my dog's hair in the upholstery. When I add the brush attachment the brush pulls the hair out of the upholstery, but it remains in the bristles. Thanks for watching!

"I like this mini vacuum. It's not a replacement for a full size vacuum, but it also isn't huge and doesn't need a long extension cord to get to your car.

I find this is good for minor clean up, but insufficient for a thorough deep cleaning. It has a decent amount of suction to it that doesn't struggle at all with small stones and other road grit that ends up in my floor mats. It pulls all the loose debris like that right up without batting an eyelash. It's the ground in dirt and debris this vacuum struggles with. It's not a lack of suction, it's a lack of a rotating brush head that you get on a Dirt Devil hand vac that digs into the carpet and knocks the dirt loose so it can be sucked up.

The brush attachment does a decent job of knocking some of that ground in grit loose with a little bit of elbow grease, but it's not like using a vac with a rotating brush head.

That said, this is great for getting up the loose dirt on the floor and cleaning out cup holders and the dirt and chunks of things that end up between and under your seats. So while it's not a deep cleaner, it's a good cleaner for in between the deep cleans.

Everything fits in the bag, not just the vacuum.

Initially I did think the filter was permanently affixed, which would have basically made this a one use machine. But it's just really stuck in the front cone that captures the dirt. I found that the extension attachment worked perfectly to loosen the filter. Just stick the extension attachment it in the front of the vacuum backwards so it slides all the way in and touches the filter cone and give it a tap. The filter pops right out the back of the clear cone piece. (Obviously, take the cone off the motor first). After that it goes back in hand tight and comes in and out easily.

Ultimately I like this thing. It's small enough to store in the trunk and powerful enough to clean up anything that's not ground into the floor mats and carpets. If you're looking to thoroughly clean your car, you'll be disappointed. If you have kids that leave crumbs and other debris all over your back seat, this is great for quickly and easily solving that problem.

"I purchase this locket as a gift for a friend that doesn't like to wear perfume because she doesn't care for the chemicals on her skin.  The necklace comes in the box pictured, and which I used to gift it to her.  I opened it up to inspect it, and it is a bit larger than I expected, but it is accurate with the measurements in the description.  It was easy to find all the pieces, and I immediately put drops on one of the provided pads to see what I thought of it.  I mixed a few different scents on to other pads as gifts, too.  I really thought it did a good job of subtly scenting without being overbearing.

I gave it to her a few weeks ago, and I just recently asked her what she thought of it.  She is a very big fan of it, and especially liked the chain length and that she could adjust the scent and strength.  She did say she was having a bit of an issue with the clasp sticking, but she said she thought it was worth it for the benefits she gets out of it.

Overall, very happy with my purchase for a smile, surprise gift for my friend.

"I actually really love this diffuser. This is the first one I have ever had. I put a few drops of lavender on the felt and it is just amazing to have it so close to my nose but not be over powering. The colors are nice because you could either have each color felt go to a certain oil or it could match what you are wearing. The two different diffusers is nice too. They came in a cute little black box, in tact, with no issues. My only concern is that the clasp was a little difficult to open and it seems to be build some what cheaply. But, I still think for the price, this is really a great buy and I would still get it again even if that clasp broke.",4.0
"Overall this is a nice diffuser necklace set.  I like the options for silver or bronze as well as the many colors of felt pads.  Also it's nice that it is very lightweight compared to the stainless steel ones.  I don't know what kind of metal it is exactly, but they look nice and are supposed to be some kind of surgical grade metal, so I'm hoping they will not corrode or tarnish easily.  I have really enjoyed my own personal aromatherapy while on the go, and there's always a color to match my outfit.

The clasp on the chain is easy to open and latch, and the locket is also easy to open and close but has never opened up accidentally.  The back side of the locket is smooth so it is comfortable laying against my chest.

I do have a couple suggestions for improving it.  The first would be to make the chain adjustable (starting with a shorter length).  I rarely wear a necklace with a pendant hanging that low, and so I actually used a safety pin to secure it at a shorter length when I have worn it.  The second thing would be to make the pads thicker or include a spacer to go behind them so that they show up through the latticework better.  The locket is deeper than the thickness of the pads.  The pads aren't too thin in general, but the way they sit in the locket with the extra space makes it so that the color of the felt doesnt show up much at all.  I just put a small piece of tissue paper folded up behind mine which is a little inconvenient, but it pushes the pad forward enough that it looks better to me.",4.0
"Lately I've been getting into aromatherapy, so this necklace is a beautiful and easy way to have it with me at all times. Upon receiving the necklace nestled in an elegant black box, I immediately inserted the red disk.

After doing some very light research, I came to the realization that sunflower oil really doesn't have a smell. I received this at a discounted rate, and I like it.",4.0
"I purchased this HOTOR Essential Sunflower Oil Diffuser Necklace Elegant Surgical Grade Stainless Steel Locket Pendant Jewelry with 8 Washable Pads in Gift Box for personal use.  I love using essential oils, but sometimes when out for a long day, the scent wears off when applied topically.  So I purchased this necklace with the hopes that the scent will last a long time when I am out and about.  The necklace came nicely packaged in a black gift box.  It comes with the pendant, a chain, and 8 thick reusable pads for the oils.  The pendant is a bit heavy but I have gotten used to it with more wear.  The pendant opens easily and the pad fits nicely inside.  I used about 4 drops of my favorite essential oil on the pad.  My one complaint about the necklace is the chain.  It is a very thick chain.  I would prefer something thinner.  Also, it is a rough material so it keeps catching on my hair in the back.  I will probably move the pendant to another chain though and it will be just fine!",4.0
"As a lover of aromatherapy, I was excited to find this necklace so that I could take the scent of my favorite essential oils with me discretely wherever I go. The necklace arrived in a black box with the company name on it, the necklace and felt scent pads placed inside nicely - packaged like it could be given as a gift. The pendant itself is made out of a good quality, surgical grade stainless steel which will not discolor and looks bright and shiny. It seems to be very durable and well-made. The cutout pattern itself is quite lovely. I'm not so much a fan of the chain; it has a tendency to kink and pinch my neck and doesn't have a larger sized link on the end for ease of clasping. I will most likely replace the chain, but don't necessarily see it as a deterrent to purchasing the necklace itself.
I received eight different colored felt discs to apply essential oil to and insert into the necklace. I personally use the different colors as a color coding system: purple is for my lavender oil, pink for rose, green for lemongrass and so on. These felt discs are thick and hand washable, so if you put too much oil on or want to change it you can. The way this necklace seems to work is that the locket heats up via your own body heat with the skin contact that it makes and that diffuses the scent of the felt pad inside.
I received this necklace at a discount in return for my fair and honest review. I would gladly purchase this at full price as a gift and would recommend it to anybody who is interested in their own mobile aromatherapy.",4.0
"I love this little oil diffuser.  One of the best things about it is that you can choose to have it rotate colors, stay on one color or no colors at all.  I have several different oil diffusers and I like how easy it is to fill the one and to empty.  It is clearly marked for water level and where to dump the water.  None of my others ones are like that.  The wood grain is a little cheap looking but not bad.  The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is it does not have a timer feature.  I would prefer to be able to turn it on and have it run for about 4 hours and then turn off that way i does not run dry.  Other than that this is a great choice it put out a good amount of vapor and is easy to use. I received this at a discount for a honest review.

"I enjoy the Hotor Diffuser Necklace designs.  I am not a fan of gold, but the antique bronze look is appealing to me.  i think it's because my taste leans to the 70's flower power side. And the designs blend in effortlessly with my choice of clothing.

What's good:  The design is interesting.  It's not a design I see used everywhere.  It looks like a starburst with a little steam-punk influence.  There are 8 changing pads.  One for every mood or blend I could think up.  I am sometimes nerdy enough to match the pads with my outfit since you can see a bit of the color peeking out of the pendant.

What's bad: It's delicate.  The chain being thing and the findings being small, you have to be really careful so you do not break it.  I am not a delicate girl.  It needed a thicker chain for me.

Overall, I enjoy this necklace.  It allows fragrance to flow freely to my nasal cavities.  Works as expected.  I purchased this product with a discount or received it complimentary in exchange for my use and evaluation.",4.0

The space is large enough to hold a phone without a case. My phone has an Otterbox case on it.  It did hold my phone by pressure. However, if your phone case is larger, you will likely run into issues. There is always the option to place your phone on top of the hands and view your phone at an angle.

"I've recently started using essential oils and liked the idea of being able to use them on the go. This necklace works well and while it at first feels heavy, I don't feel it within a few minutes of it being on my neck. So far, I haven't needed more than three pads, but I plan to order more.

We don't have an Apple watch yet but I like that this has a built in stand and port to hold the charging cord in place. I like that you can put the iPhone/iPad in either portrait or landscape orientation, but I do wish that there were little slots for charging those devices as well.

"This is a highly effective method of keeping the air around you fresh and having aromatherapy constantly available to your olfactory system. I wore mine to work as a massage therapist. I put 8 drops of frankincense oil on the pink pad, which I believe was too much. Should have used only 4 or 5. The scent was quite strong. But I wore the necklace inside my shirt so it stayed with me all day and certainly could have been worse. I love the idea of a diffuser necklace. Without it I put a few drops of essential oil on a tissue and tuck it in my bra for the day. But this was a more attractive and effective method of delivery. I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 because the necklace itself is very heavy. Maybe some people like that, but I feel like its a lot of weight on my neck muscles and shoulders. Adding to the metaphorical weight of the world ... I just wish it was a bit lighter. It is a very beautiful piece of jewelry and I will wear it sometimes.

"I got this product because I recently started using a fish fertilizer mixed with water on my indoor herb garden and it smells AWFUL. I was looking for something that would help cover some of that smell when I use the fertilizer because it really is doing wonders for the plants. This product is doing it!! It is very easy to set up (although the instructions were not very straightforward), all you have to do is plug the adapter into the bottom of the atomizer and then into an outlet. After that you turn the lid and lift it off, fill the inside jar up to the max line with regular water and add a few drops of water essential oil you'd like. Pop the top back on, press the MIST button and start sniffing away! I have used an orange scented essential oil and a lavender scented one so far and depending on how many drops you place in the water, the weaker or stronger the scent is. The first time I put 3 drops in and I thought it was the perfect amount. I left the atomizer on for 2 hours and it then shut off by itself, and left my dining room smelling fantastic! The second time I used 5 drops of the lavender, but the scent was really strong. I moved the atomizer into my living room which is about 2.5x the size of my dining room and the scent was much more manageable and not so overpowering. So I would definitely recommend playing around with the amount of essential oil you use depending on the size of the room. I am really happy with this product and would recommend it to others.

"First, this is the second essential oils diffuser locket I've bought from Hotor. I was really excited to get a silver one.
Pros:
Received right on time.  I had been anxiously awaiting this as my other is not silver it's more bronze and I wear it daily.
I am a huge essential oils fan and I base alot of my health around different oils.
It comes in a nice box with 3 insert pads.
I'm a bit more ahead of that.  I have purchased separate refills as I rotate my oils often and if I'm not feeling well I have a certain blend I use.  ect.
You really can't use oils on your body directly so these newer products that help us holistic believers out are great.
The necklace looks and wears manufactured well.
You do not want to shower with this on as it is plated not real silver.
I only gave it 4 stars because the design didn't wow me.  However,  it is a conversation starter.
I look forward to some lavender and tyme for my Thursday!
I recommend this product to anyone who's getting in to essential oils.  For those who suffer migraine and are looking for alternative medicine  (no I'm not a dr, it's what works for me and others I've spoke to ) Or just enjoy oils and would like a new piece of jewelry.

"While looking for a more natural solution to the common cold and headaches, I decided to add essential oils into my life. There are so many ways to use essential oils, one of which is through a diffuser, so of course I had to get one! This is the 2nd type of diffuser I am trying out, and there are some notable differences.

1. This diffuser has a timer on it!! FANTASTIC! These smaller ones will only go for so long on one fill, and if you aren't paying attention and the well dries up, that's not good for the diffuser. This one has a built in timer function for 30/60/120/180 minutes. Perfect for the bedside option.

2. There is only 1 LED option, and it's clear. No color changes like some of the others out there. With this one you have 2 options, on and off. Not a big deal, just takes some of the esthetic appeal away.

3. While I can see the diffused mist drifting out the top, it is not a very powerful stream like the other one I have. I'm still not sure if this means it is less powerful or not, time will tell. But I liked being able to see the steady stream of mist, and this one is very light.

4. This one isn't very pretty. There's really no ""design"" to it, just your basic plastic and with a white light. Again, not a big deal, it doesn't effect how the diffuser works, just not as nice to look at as others. This one will most likely become our bedroom diffuser so no one but us sees it.

All in all, I'm happy with it for the base purpose of diffusing whatever oil I want to use at the time. I think there could be some basic changes to the design to make it more appealing, but if you are just looking for your basic diffuser with a timer function, this is perfect.

"The diffuser was a lot smaller than I expected.  It does change color nicely and creates a nice fine mist.  Winter air is really drying out sinuses in my household and I was hoping to use this as an alternative to a larger humidifier, however since it is so much smaller it won't do what I need it to do.  I think I might be able to use it on my desk in my office as a small area humidifier.  Created a nice scent throw area, and I like that it will automatically shut off.  I just wish for the price it was a little bigger.

With three drops of eucalyptus oil in the water you can tell it works as advertised. The nightlight has a bright and dim setting which is nice. There is also a timer so it's not on all night long after the water has run out. I am a fan of this product but if you need a humidifier for a large room look elsewhere. This is only for small rooms but it's worth it.,4.0
The product itself is wonderful. It doesn't put out an overwhelming amount of EO and it is quiet an a great addition to our home. The only thing that I wish it had was it's own plug for the wall. That is really annoying. I have to take my wall piece and plug it into my cell phone charger! It would be worth it to pay more for the plug!,4.0
"I love how compact and easy to move rooms this diffuser is! I have a larger one, that I sent way too much on (a mlm diffuser), thinking I would move it room to room. Nope, It's too much of a pain to get it set up in each room. This one is not small, but lightweight and petite enough where I easily take it back in forth from my office to my bedroom. It easily works filling up the whole room with the diffused oil. I know some diffusers have negative reviews for not working on enough square footage, this one is mighty. I love that it is USB charged. I plug it into my laptop and just face the oil to blow away from my computer. I also use it on my bedside table. I have an iHome docking station for my phone, which has a usb port where this plugs into. I love having all my essentials right at arms reach! If I get an upset tummy, I immediately diffuse without getting out of bed! Be sure to read the directions on how to remove old water. Then your diffuser will last forever!",4.0
"I was looking for a gift for my father in law and was hoping to find a decent aromatherapy diffuser. However, when this diffuser arrived I was a bit disappointed in the size for 120ml and the price that I paid. It's much smaller than on the pictures but it does work. If your looking for a small, cute aromatherapy then this is the one for you. For me personally it was too tiny for the amount I paid and what it appeared in the pictures.",4.0
Great idea!,4.0
"This diffuser was really easy to use. I really liked that it has a USB plug in, that way I could have it connected to my computer without having to find another outlit. The light has two options, which I haven't really used a lot but it's not a bad feature, and will automatically turn off when the timers are up as well. Puts out a nice amount of mist.

My one complaint is that the plugin is on the bottom of the diffuser, which made it difficult to plug in when I'd already filled it with water without tipping. Other than that, great way to diffuse my favorite essential oils and I'll probably be using this in my office all the time.
I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",4.0

"The idea for this product is really cute! The shape is darling and the size is small (although I expected that from the product description and other reviews). The magnet isn't too strong, but it does hold up my house key, car key, and id holder (which has a metal chain attached to it). The sticky back is very study and covers the whole surface. Although I feel comfortable using this sticker back in my home, I would recommend the 3M removable hook stickers for those who rent or do not feel comfortable with it.

I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review, but I would probably buy this again at the full price for some other uses, like to hold pins or paper clips.",4.0

"This is a great pen for EDC or your bugout bag, combined with waterproof notebook.

The cap is held in place by a magnet, but only at the writing end, so it doesn't hold the cap while writing.

The product was ordered on April 27, and delivered on May 11. That's two weeks. That's the bad part of this review.
The good part is they send a more recent addition then the one I thought I ordered. That was very nice.
The verbiage for the shipping says it will arrive between 3e and 14 days. That's deceptive. I expected it in 3 or 4 days, it took all 14 days.
I wasn't happy with the shipping, and I won't do that again.

"Divided into sections the book gives the reader an over veiw of the principals and aplication each of the welding methods including arc, mig, tig, oxy-acealyne, and plasma giving the advantages and draw backs of each as well as history of the method. Also included is the basic requirements of the shop reguarding electrical and price range as well as some basic metal composition and practical application of metals to projects. I think the author should have gone into more detail of the how to aspects. Over veiw is great however and I definetly recomend it for a beginner ready to buy a home or farm welder.",4.0
Good start for learning basics about different types of welding. Beginners just starting out will find a lot of useful info in this book. It is well laid out and easy to read and understand some of the basic fundamental techniques about various welding and metal cutting methods.,4.0

Bottom line is I still have a broken A/C and have to take it in to get it fixed.",4.0
"Great manual.  Helped me rebuild the AC system in my truck when I did not really know what I was doing.  This manual is not fully comprehensive.  It assumes you have some knowledge of how to work on AC systems, so I had to go looking for other sources to make sure I understood what the book was talking about.  If you are a complete noob, be brepared you might need to hit the internet or other resources to get all the info you need.",4.0
"The manual taught me a great deal about auto a/c basics and a/c basics in general. It's not the only manual you will need, get one that is specific to your car as well. I would suggest that you read it completely so you have a good understanding of what's going on.

This manual gave me the confidence to do a major repair on my a/c system and I am very happy with the results.",4.0
"I'm just getting started learning auto ac after the ac quit in my pickup. The book really helped me out learning the air conditioning as it explained the basics of how ac systems work.

"If you're new to bicycle repair and maintenance, then this is a pretty handy book. Especially if you're like me and have never dealt with a multi-speed bicycle before. The only problem I saw with it, is that they keep advising you to use WD-40 for a lot of the lube points on a bicycle.

While WD-40 is a fantastic product for other applications, everything I've read in regard to bicycle maintenance tells you to avoid using lubricants, like WD-40, to lubricate your bicycle. From what I gather they have solvents in them that help flush out dirt, but it also cuts and removes oil that is much better at protecting your parts from wear and tear, especially the chain and sprocket.

But other than that, I found the Haynes Bicycle Book to be a handy book to have in your garage.",4.0
Product was as described and met my expectations. On the other hand the delivery time was not acceptable (6 weeks) considering the cost of postage. I regular receive and send parcels to Europe and I would have expected the book to arrive in a shorter time frame considering the postage fee that I was charged.

"This is a great book for beginners and there are plenty of photos to assist the reader together with step by step instructions. On the downside, as noted in other reviews, the technologies covered seem a little bit dated and seem to have a bias toward the 1990s or earlier, for example my headset/stem are not covered. Some of the page layouts are a bit jumbled in places, but on the whole it is easy follow.",4.0
"This is a great bike maintenace book for beginners.  The photos and directions are very easy to follow.  The techniques they describe are not fancy and do not require expensive tools.  For more complex jobs, they tell you to visit your bike shop, which is probably what a beginner should be doing.  Intermediate-to-advanced home mechanics should look at the Zinn or Park books instead.",4.0
"Better than Chilton manuals by a long shot. I just wish some of the pictures were lit better with stratigic lighting.  In this day and age, some well placed pen working lights would make these pictures much more 'ledgible'.  I really do appreaciate the fact that there are detailed wiring diagrams and schematics; worth the price alone when doiong electrical troubleshooting.",4.0
"Everything was great! book was used but in ""like new"" condition like stated in description.  I gave 4 stars because it took forever and a day to get to me.

"The Haynes manuals are good for the DIY'er who enjoys servicing their own vehicles. These manuals will cover about 90% of most peoples needs.

The instructions can be a bit short though, and they tend to lack some details.  Navigating the book can be really annoying.  Some instructions stop mid-way, and direct you to a different part of the book.  When looking for something specific, I have ended up flipping through the whole book looking for the directions.

With that said, I don't think their is a better book out there.  It is a good reference books to troubleshoot issues.",4.0

"I started working on cars as a college student using Chilton's and Haynes manuals.  As I got older, I brought the OEM shop manuals and I find that the Chilton's are much better illustrated and easier to use.  Us weekend mechanics should just stick with these and save our money.

"Like all the other haynes manuals i have purchased this one did a decent job of giving recommendations for maintenance and repair work.  However i always seem to find it lacking details where i need it most (basic repair tasks that seem to be identical between manuals), and having way more details for jobs that i don't care about (totaly engine overhauls, etc. ).

Pros:
- Affordable Help for repair work
- covers most repair topics you might care about
- I have purchased several manuals for cars i have owned and found them all to be helpfull.

Cons:
- Says it covers multiple varients of the same model, but often has diagrams for only one of them.
- Many of the more common repair tasks (brakes, oil change, body work, etc.. ) are heavily coppied between the vairous Haynes manuals for different models, so often lack spesific details that would be helpfull.  You can usually overcome this with some common sense, but i have found several times wishing i new exactly where something was rather then them assuming i know where it is.
- Lacks discussion on common problems encountered during repairs.  Ie, would be nice to have advice on what to try if your break rotors are rusted on, etc. .",4.0

Amazon should display the 2004 edition of this book which will have additional information for the newer 2002 Accords. I prefer this Haynes manual over the Chilton's for 98-02 Accords since the Haynes' has more and specific information than the Chilton's which also tried to cover 96-02 models. Most information are more than adquate for standard maintenace and repairs. Body and panels diagrams are helpful for owners who are interested in adding alarm or stereo. Inexpensive book for owners who are interested in knowing specific operations and tuning of their cars.,4.0

This manual was needed urgently for guidance on performing a front and rear brake pad replacement.

"This manual does pale in comparison to a Bently, but so do all other manuals. I have found that the manual is an excellent guide for anyone with some mechanical know-how, and it provides the most comprehensive information available. There are things that are a little inacurate that I have found, or have seen other sources that contradict how things work... But even the Subaru factory repair manuals have this problem. My major criticism of this manual is it does not get into describing what are 'common' failures; other Haynes manuals that I have picked up ocasionally hinted at what kinds of failures the owner can 'expect' to experience. In my opinion, there should be an section devoted to the whens, whys and hows of headgasket failure, oil seal leaks, and valve cover leaks. My second criticism is that it doesn't explain part numbers, nor does it describe some repair materials well enough; like saying 'anerobic sealant' or 'gasket maker' where Subaru technical manuals very clearly describe what materials should be used.

Combine this with all the documentation that is out there from the major Subaru message boards, and I doubt there is any repair you can't accomplish. Me? I'm replacing my headgaskets, timing belt and a whole lot of seals this weekend.",4.0

They read the trouble code from the computer, saw that it was related to the cooling system, and immediately recommended that I replace the water pump. And since I was replacing the water pump, I might as well replace the timing belt too. Total cost $2000! The book offers several no-cost/low-cost fixes to try first. This book also suggested replacing the valve core, to resolve a slow leak in a tire. I took the tire to two tire repair shops, and neither one suggested that. It might be because the valve cores cost 50 cents, whereas they could sell me another tire for a lot more. I no longer have any faith in the auto repair industry.

Along with this repair manual, I bought the Roadi RDT55 Diagnostic Trouble Code Reader for Volkswagen and Audi Vehicles with OBDII Vehicle Live Data. I'm very happy with that product too.",4.0
"Really useful, i always kept this copy in my car other than manuals provided by Audi..Its good when u visit any workshop other than Audi Repair Center..this book will guide the repairmen to diagnose your car, understand the brackets and the positions of certain hidden parts and to understand the complete wiring system for my Audi A4 B5.5 1.8T year 2001 model..

Must Have!",4.0
"I bought this manual so that I could do routine maintenance on my 2002 Passat GLS.  I've used other Haynes manuals in the past, so I knew what to expect.  Step-by-step instructions for most tasks, with pictures for the more difficult to understand steps.  Also of note is the recommended maintenance schedule in the front.  If you plan on doing any Passat maintenance on your own, buy this manual!",4.0
"I usually do all the maintenance and repairs on my vehicles.  I have purchased one of these manuals for eash of my vehicles at one point of ownership or the other.  This one is just as expected from a Haynes manual.  Very informative, book is based on a complete tear-down and rebuild.  I trust Haynes books, and they have never let me down.",4.0
"I bought this book with the intent of replacing the timing belt on my 2003 Passat. The book has clear step by step instructions with pictures, but it doesn't seem to have as many pictures from different angles and detailed instructions as the bentley manual. So a -ve point for that. But for the price it sure is a good deal.
  Just a word of caution that you might ruin the engine trying to replace the timing belt if you are not careful with it. I highly recommend you take help of someone who has already done it at least once (on any car). Even though the book explains everything there is always a chance that you might just not do it right and it could be a $5000 mistake!! Good luck!!",4.0
This book arrived in the estimated time it was supposed to but the seller did not respond to my message. I feel that it should have arrived sooner but it did not. The book was new and in great condition will use it well but would not purchase from the same person again.,4.0
This was exactly what I was looking for. Has all the information I need to make the repairs on my 2004 Honda Accord.,4.0
"Bought this and the comparable Chilton manual, both use a similar layout and use the exact same pictures however the Chilton's photos are clearer and printed on higher quality paper.",4.0
just a go to reference for easy repairs,4.0
"I had to ordered this book because the car never came with it, an I needed to learn how to repair, replace and to adjust and many items on the car.",4.0
"The manual is good for maintenance, like oil change, air filter change, tire rotation, It is useful to keep one.",4.0
"There is really no substitute for the factory service manual.  I did get a copy of the factory manual - it runs about 15$ more than this if you get the electronic version (probably preferable to the paper copy actually - easier to search).  The haynes manual is a few hundred pages - factory manual is over 2000 pages!  So, this manual just won't be as complete.  That said - the haynes manual will probably do fine for most repairs.

The factory manual has diagrams, not pictures, so it's easier to see what the instructions want you to do, and where things are.  However, the pictures really aren't that bad in the Haynes manual.  To those that complain about it - get some reading glasses?  They seem perfectly good to me.

I've seen lots of complaints about the paper being too thin in other reviews.  Sure, it's a bit thinner than perhaps the average book (maybe similar to a newspaper), but still perfectly usable.  If you are ripping the pages or pulling them out of the manual - my question to those that say this sort of thing - have you used a book before?

I've done 3 recent services on our hondas

1) Engine mount replacement
2) radiator flush
3) EGR valve replacement

I used the factory manual instructions to do the mount replacement, but I checked the Haynes manual to see if it was what the factory would recommend.  Engine mount replacement details looked spot-on, it is just how I did it (and actually made the suggestion the factory manual did not - which was instead of using a lift, to support the engine with a floor jack under the oil pan - this worked perfectly for me).  The only thing that was a bit annoying is that you only seem to get the general bolt torque guidance in the front of the manual.  Factory manual specifies an exact desired value per-bolt on their diagrams.

Radiator flush is just the same really as factory manual.

EGR valve replacement was a snap - hardly worth mentioning.

So, from the recent work I've done, the Haynes manual is actually quite good, and lines up pretty well with what I see in the factory manual.  Seems to me that you should be able to perform most services to your car with this manual.  But, if you want the best of the best - you may want to go with the factory service manual (available on amazon).

I give this 4/5 stars, as the factory manual isn't that much more, and is simply more complete.  Solid manual from what I can see though.",4.0
This book gives the person with an average mechanical ability the chance to do his/her own repairs.  I recommend it fully.,4.0
"I hate my local Honda dealer, so I'm happy to go to any length to not go there.  When I had them diagnose a $1200 repair bill I immediately went for this book and got started.  I replaced the front and back brakes and rotors, the starter and power steering pump.  They were all fairly easy with the directions given, except that this book does NOT have a diagram for the serpentine belt, so if you take the belt off to replace anything powered by the drive shaft you had better remember where it goes.  Or search google for it.
I also found it funny that when I looked up replacing the motor mount it basically said if you're not an expert mechanic, go pay one to fix it, 'cause this isn't easy.  Needless to say, the car is still shaking a little but I won't be sending it to the dealer.",4.0
"we own a 2003 honda accord and reciently put 1,000 in work on it, things that i could have taken care of if i knew how, that is why i got this book so i can see how to do some of the rapairs myself and take care of the car myself.",4.0
I needed to replace a window motor in my Accord. This manual provided the information and steps I needed.,4.0
"Like all the other haynes manuals i have purchased this one did a decent job of giving recommendations for maintenance and repair work.  However i always seem to find it lacking details where i need it most (basic repair tasks that seem to be identical between manuals), and having way more details for jobs that i don't care about (totaly engine overhauls, etc. ).

Pros:
- Affordable Help for repair work
- covers most repair topics you might care about
- I have purchased several manuals for cars i have owned and found them all to be helpfull.

Cons:
- Says it covers multiple varients of the same model, but often has diagrams for only one of them.
- Many of the more common repair tasks (brakes, oil change, body work, etc.. ) are heavily coppied between the vairous Haynes manuals for different models, so often lack spesific details that would be helpfull.  You can usually overcome this with some common sense, but i have found several times wishing i new exactly where something was rather then them assuming i know where it is.
- Lacks discussion on common problems encountered during repairs.  Ie, would be nice to have advice on what to try if your break rotors are rusted on, etc. .",4.0
"I couldn't decide which manual to buy so I ordered both Haynes and Chiltons.  They are exactly the same word-for-word.  Same Photos.  Layout is slightly different. Apparently Haynes has purchased Chiltons.  Other that that, technically the manual is fine. Everything I expected.",4.0
We just bought a 1992 Jeep Wrangler to use as a 'toad' behind our motor home and this book will be invaluable while we are out on the road.  It covers EVERYTHING that you would need to know about fixing our Jeep and many with pictures.  It arrived before the time Amazon said it would get here.  I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase! I would definitely go to Amazon again for any type of book I need!,4.0
its ok,4.0
Does what it says on the box.,4.0
A little short on detail for some operations.,4.0
It's a very helpful book when you don't have the Factory Service Manual,4.0
"I have found that most repair manuals are sometimes short on details and this one is no exception,  However, this repair manual was written for those who have some mechanical savvy and can read between the lines.  So far this manual has described each repair needed.  I was looking at a $300.00 dealer invoice to replace a non-working power window master switch.  I found a new aftermarket switch on Ebay and with this manual was able to within 30 minutes get the windows working again.  Add the cost of the manual and I have saved over $250.

Depending on the skill and knowledge of the user of this manual it should more than pay for itself in most cases.  I recommend this manual to those who do not wish to be soaked by a garage.",4.0
THis was exactly what I wanted. It was so much cheaper on Amazon I couldn't believe it! I used it and am going to keep it as long as I own this auto. I also got it really quickly! Thanks!,4.0

"Certainly compared with past Haynes Manuals (also for Camrys) this one is by far more useful.  Not only does it have much clearer photos but also more comprehensive descriptions to go with them.  And too, it gives far more information about V6 engines than in earlier manuals.  Can sure recommend it!",4.0

"Typical quality from the Haynes manual. Pictures, step by step instructions, etc. No concerns noted... However, I'm not really a car guy, so take that for what its worth.",4.0
"Never as good as a factory manual, but decent supplemental book to cover most issues you might come across.
Worth the price.",4.0
"This manual is complete, image rich and logically editted. A true professional might benefit from these guides for specific problems on specific makes. That said, it is way over the head (and hands) of the casual service needs of this AUDI owner. I (like many other AUDI owners) love my car and am vexxed by its service needs. I have no problem handing off the real work to a real mechanic. My desire is to perform simple, regular maintenance and repairs (more like replacements). The Haynes manual has that information . . . and about 98% more. The language, picture quantity and layout are fine. The print quality is marginal and some photos are muddy. I'll likely only use a small fraction of the information contained herein, but what little I use will be used with confidence.",4.0

"Haynes manuals help with the basics plus some moderate maintenance and repair - nothing more.  This guide allows me to save money on those chores I could do myself with a little time and effort, and for that it's easily worth the money spent to purchase.

Are there enough diagrams and/or photos of every operation?  No way.  Could they add tips/tricks to avoid the hidden hassles that arise when taking apart something kind of complex?  Definitely.  Should they have their own online forum for follow up questions by manual users?  Absolutely.  But there are other forums that pick up where the knowledge contained in this guides isn't adequate, so I'm not going to expect this rather affordable guide be everything I need.

For what it is and costs, it's just fine...",4.0
I am not a mechanic but I have made basic car repairs beyond routine maintenance.  I found the pictures to be helpful for identifying the parts named in the text.  Using this book is an excellent start for preparing to do a repair yourself and it will pay for itself the first time you use it.  I would still recommend that you search blogs on the internet and Youtube videos for handy tips on trouble spots.,4.0

Decent price. Decent quality. Shipped in timely fashioned. Well written and was helpful in using it to install shocks/struts. It is a honda so nothing else is really broken.

Haynes manuals are always a good choice for car enthusiasts and the DIY crowd.  For this particular edition I wish Haynes would stop combining the CRV and the civic into one book. It is highly unlikely to provide any savings to a customer and it lends itself to less helpful generic work description and potential confusion.  I also use the Chilton guide and find them often comparable or more detailed.,4.0

"A Haynes manual is the bare minimum reference material for anyone who owns a car and a wrench. This is the *ONLY* consumer-level manual I'll recommend; Chilton is just pure garbage. I think I have an old Chilton manual around from my first Honda when I was a kid; I use it to get an extra half-inch of clearance under my floor jack - set it on the ground, put the jack on it, and up she goes! :)

The Haynes manual, on the other hand, is very detailed, second only to the Factory Service Manual that is used by the dealerships and technicians at Mazda. Armed with this manual and the FSM, I'm prepared to tackle nearly any job on my 3. I've already had the dashboard out, the seats, inner panels, carpet, etc., because I was installing a new sound system.",4.0

"Covering large ranges of models (In this case two main models and three separate model generations for each) is complex, and shortcuts have to be taken. Haynes always makes a good manual, and this one is no exception. But don't expect hand-holding of a 'youtube video' level. You'll have to be able to think your way through the repairs. But it gives technical details that are hard to find in an authoritative way elsewhere. A good value.

"Haynes manuals are great. I get one for every car I buy that isn't under warranty. The actual size of the manual is great. Very easy to read. Throw a wrench on the pages to keep the book open, and your good to go. As far as the manual specifically for Coopers, it's a bit too general. I specifically would have liked to seen a manual for Clubman specifically. There are enough differences from the Clubman from other Coopers that a separate book would have been preferred. As far as the Haynes brand generally, I do like them. If there was a couple of changes, this would make this manual go from a very good to a great.  critical of anything, that would be two things:
1) I would like to see more color pictures, generally more overall pictures, a with a bit better lighting. The description is great, but sometimes it would be nice to see a pic from a different angle, or a shot from far away for reference and a closer one for specifics.
2) If there was an option to get a version of the book with smudge proof pages for when your out in the garage. I have gotten my share of grease or general dirt on there. Being able to protect that from happening would be great. Overall I still think Haynes covers most cars better than any other single source. I would just like a few changes.",4.0

I have to update my review (6/17/14). This is a basic book. I would not recommend this book if you are going to do any in dept repairs. Basic repairs maybe. The pictures are of poor quality. The electrical diagrams have dead links. I am an ASE Master Tech. I purchased the larger repair manual with better diagrams and clearer photos. Remember your time is money, so the added cost of a more detailed manual is worth it, if you are going to do anything other than basic repairs.",4.0

"Bought this for a firend, but his truck is still broken. Guess he still needs a good Mechanic?",4.0
"It's a good overall repair manual for the do-it-yourself-er.  Things you didn't know are revealed.  However, when refering to some of the pictures, they tend to be a bit dark.  Sometimes, when refering to a particular park within a picture, it's difficult to make out that specific part.",4.0
Pictures are informative and instructions are straight forward. Helps me keep my vehicle in good maintenance. Would recommend.,4.0
ok,4.0
This is a must-have for a vehicle owner and at-home mechanic.  The Black and White pictures are tough to depict sometimes though.,4.0
I needed this book to do some minor repairs to my wife's vehicle. I have found everything I needed so far.,4.0
Bought this for my son-in-law who has a 4Runner.  From what I can tell he really liked it as he does a lot work done on his 4Runner himself.,4.0
"Shows nearly everything you'd want to know about a Toyota 4Runner.  Easy to follow diagrams and instructions.  One complaint is that the index uses ""proper"" auto terms and not ""common"" terms.  Example is oil is called engine lubricant.  Good book never the less.",4.0
Had to do some minor repair work on my truck so I picked this book up.  I have used these books for several different vehicles and they are always a great resource.  I highly recommend them.,4.0

WHAT I NEEDED,4.0
"As usual, the Haynes manual is pretty indispensable. Lots of good information here, and as always:  ""Installation is the reverse of removal"", haha.",4.0
The repair manual arrived about 3 days later than promised. I think it was the Post Office that delayed it. The shipper said it was sent on time. The manual is what i expected. I have always bought a Haynes for every vehicle i have owned. I would recomend it to a friend,4.0
A must have for the do it yourselfers,4.0
Great for any weekend warrior. It would be nice if the pictures were in color but its pretty detailed.,4.0

"I know others have complained about this manual (on other websites mostly) but it meets my needs.  I'm not a ""gear head"" but like to do as much maintenance as I can and this manual is way better for that than trying to use the manual the car came with.  So if you need/want something to point out how to do routine maintenance, this is the manual for you.  If you want/need something to do some serious repair/rebuild work that you probably won't be happy with this manual.  And for the record: I've purchased Haynes manuals for my other 2 cars and were happy with them too.  I have not tried any of the other brands.",4.0
"I purchased this manual for a friend. I found that; was informative, but lacked in important info.  Overall a good manual.",4.0

"Giving four stars because I would like to see a manual that does not try to cover nearly an entire decade of Subaru. After spending an inordinate amount of time searching the Index, the Table of Contents and general thumbing through the book looking at several years of cars that simply don't apply to my individual need looking for a simultaneously flashing check engine light/cruise control indicator.... I simply googled it, found a blog that fully explained cause and treatment.",4.0
"No issues with the seller (they sent ASAP), but repair manuals are seldom if ever spot-on.

"I loved this repair manual, it was really quite helpful. I wish there was a little more detail in some steps, but overall was plenty enough for the job. I will be buying a second one because I had the unfortunate timing of starting a brake pad and rotor replacement as a thunderstorm was setting in, and my manual got soaked by the rain.",4.0
Very helpful,4.0
"It's good for engine torque specs/patterns and wiring diagrams. It Covers 4 genrations of Imprezas (Bug eye, blob eye, hawk eye, and 08-11) so it's not good for in-depth breakdown of one particular car. If you aren't familiar with working on cars you may still need to look up step by step instructions else-wear. I would recommend it because it is a good reference manual.",4.0
It's a good manual but no comparison with the Subaru factory manual...,4.0
its just what I expected.,4.0
Full of useful information.  Could be better.  Too many generic photos of other cars and parts besides what are found on the Subaru for me to rate it a 5,4.0
Used this manual to change the head gaskets on my Legacy Outback. This is for the Impreza but it is virtually the same procedure.,4.0
"Haynes for some reason didn't use photos of an Impreza in certain parts.  Got them mixed up with a Toyota truck, and some V-8 on an engine stand. Ok otherwise...",4.0
This manual included the information(along with photos) I required to install new brake pads & rotors-on all 4 corners.,4.0
"I started buying these books back in the 90's. I've had one for ever car I've ever had. They basically are the same formate they were back then. Very abbreviated, you have to read them closely. This book is not intended to replace the factory repair manuals. It can however be a great help for the shade tree guys out there. It would be nice if Haynes would step up there game with color photos and a version for kindle.

Contains most everything I have needed to maintain my 2010 Town and Country. What it hasn't been clear about I have been able to find searching the internet. I have had Haynes manuals for all of my vehicles for at least the last 20 years and have always found them to contain the information I have needed.,4.0
"Haynes manuals are always pretty good.  Yeah, there are a few things missing, and sometimes the descriptions/pictures area  little vague.  But I generally don't start a project on any of my cars without one of these manuals on hand.  Lots of videos online nowadays, but it's good to cross reference those against a good source like this before starting on anything complicated.",4.0
"I have a 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan and I had a problem with my drivers side air conditioner not working. I purchased the repair manual to help me troubleshoot the problem but the manual was not as detailed in that area as what I was hoping. I have used Haynes manuals in the past for other vehicles and they are typically very detailed, but for the air conditioner problem, it was of no help. I was able to track my problem to a failed actuator on the drivers side, but even after identifying the problem, I was unable to find the actuator in the manual.

I have however used this repair manual to identify problems with my automatic side door and this manual was able to help me fix that right away. Overall pleased with the product, but it could have been more detailed for my specific vehicle.",4.0
"Too much superfluous info such as how to use a wrench and test meter safely, not enough detail on the van which I own... too generic.",4.0

"I feel like they're really good manuals, I guess I'm just more of a picture guy. Don't get me wrong, they have plenty of pictures, but I want picture, commentary, picture, commentary. Step by step. This manual has a lot of text, all the steps one after the other, then pictures on the top and bottom of the page. Paired with youtube, everything make sense, and I feel like this manual puts together all the missing pieces, and even tells you what fluids are needed based on the manual. Which is good because I bought my car without one.",4.0

"I had previously only purchased Chilton Manuals but found the Haynes has more detail.  Wish some of the pictures were in color, especially the wiring diagrams but have used the book the way it is.

If I could only find out how to remove or repair my windshield wiper sprayer.  I could not locate the sprayer in the book.
 Luckily, the sprayer mysteriously started working once I took out this book within view of the car!!",4.0

"Typical, well done Haynes manual",4.0
"I have always liked Haynes manuals. I gave it four stars right now because I have not used it for any repairs yet. Going from past experience, it is hard to go wrong with their manuals. They even give ways to make special tools when needed, rather than purchasing an expensive ""factory"" tool, which one may rarely use.",4.0
"Seems to be well written - have used several times and instructions have been accurate and helpful.  Paper quality is poor (similar to a phone book) since it uses recycled fibers.  Would not hold up well in a shop but probably fine for home use.  Photograph quality is limited by the paper quality, but are good enough to be useful.",4.0
Very informative manual.  Quality of paper could be a little better.  Provides valuable information for most any maintenance project desired.,4.0
"The Haynes book is great for photos of how things are assembled, and, based on what little I've used it for maintenance, seems written well for that. All capacities, weights, power, etc. are in metric values, which is annoying, in some cases.",4.0
"The book is full of information, but alittle behind the times. Like everything fuel systems get modern. This book is a great starter book for those who are learning the basic's on older motorcycles.",4.0
"For students and technicians, this book very good resource, when your looking a very good explanation about fuel systems.",4.0
Great detailed information. Good repair manual. Always good to have a copy in the shop.  Clear technical drawings and charts.,4.0
"Haynes manuals are generally well thought out and illustrated based on a complete tear-down and expert rebuild.  Haynes has been doing this for many diverse vehicles from cars motos and tractors for many years and have developed an excellent formula for presenting this information so it is useful to all owners from never get your hands dirty to expert mechanics.  For me it is presented in a more intelligible format than other manuals eg. Chilton and even factory shop manuals, for this amateur mechanic.",4.0
I purchased this book for my husband. He believes this is a great book for anyone that owns a BMW Twin Motorcycle to add to your collection for any work you might want to do on your own bike.,4.0

"Nice photos, easy to see how to get the beast back together. Beware; I have heard some specifications are a little off,in some versions, so I always double check things, like torque and clearance, on Google try looking for Snowbum's tech pages. They go great with the book.",4.0
"I'm restoring a '76 R90/6, purchased with the original owners manual and a vintage 1955-1975 Clymer shop manual from the original owner. So purchased the Haynes. Very helpful, but I ended up buying a new Clymer manual as well for additional detail.",4.0
"Loved it! First time I have had a rain suit for the Shovel Head. Rained for 400 miles and the only parts that got wet were my face, hands and boots. There was no rain blown up my sleeves or down the neck. Several commented on how well they could see me.",4.0
"This rain suit is just what I needed.  The material is breathable and has a mesh inner lining to help airflow.  The pants fit just right and have a reinforced rear end for wear and tear and reinforced inner legs for engine heat.

Here's what I was looking for and this suit had it:
A full velcro flap on the front of the jacket.
A velcro collar with a corduroy liner and a concealed hood
Velcro cuffs
A drawstring waist and jacket bottom
Highly visible during reduced visibility rain storms
The pants come with bootstraps to keep them down and zippers by the cuffs to allow ease in putting on and taking off.
3M reflective striping throughout the top and bottom
Suspenders to keep the pant waistband up and under the coat.

If you get a one-piece suit you'll be most protected since there's no break in material.  If you have a two-piece suit you don't want rain coming in between the pants and the coat.  So it was important to me to find a set that had suspenders or a bib on the pants to keep them tucked up under the coat.  These do just that.

As for fit, I'm 5'11"" 185lbs.  I wear a medium in most clothing.  I wanted a suit that would fit over my clothes.  So I ordered a large.  A large on my frame fits over my jeans perfectly.  The rain coat fits perfectly over my leather jacket.  If I were to just wear the rain coat over my shirt, I would want a medium.  But because I always use my leather coat when riding, I needed a large size suit to go over my leather jacket.  The collar is the only snug part of the jacket.  It probably should be the only snug part anyway to keep rain from running down your neck.

Mobility is fine in the suit.  I can twist my torso and look over my shoulders with very mild resistance from the material.

Bottom line: This 2-piece suit is a good buy.  It has suspenders to keep the pants up.  It's high-visibility green.  It fits great over clothes and a leather jacket.  The inner mesh liner provides adequate breathability.  The price is reasonable compared to other competitors.  I have NOT rain tested this material.  But I'm familiar with the material in general and believe it will provide acceptable coverage.  The product claims to be seam-sealed so that no water will leak in.  If it ends up leaking one could easily buy some seam sealing glue from your local Camping store.",4.0
luckily I haven't had to try them out,4.0
"Bought one for my wife and me for a bike trip in June.  On the return we had 250 miles of on and off rain with one 50 mile downpour.  They worked very well.  Temps were around 75-80 so they were not too hot, but I can imagine in high temps and humidity they would get a bit warm.  We will look be adding more vecro around rhe entire cuff so you can close around your wrist completely. Other than that they work as advertised. Lots of pockets which is nice.  I'm 6'2"" 250 and I ordered the xxl.  The xl jacket fit well but pants where to tight in the knee area, sent them back and the xxl pants are good, jacket slightly on the large size but doable.",4.0
