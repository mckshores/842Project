"You sign in, go to kindle, create a gift card, put in your amount
and the trouble begins. You put in your visa card number (doesn't
matter if it is already on file), you go through more ""continues"",
then ""purchase"", and Amazon tells you that your gift card is ready
to print. Try to print it; Amazon asks you for your credit card number
AGAIN. Press the ""print gift card"" button and you get an ""html"" file
which is the Amazon sign-in panel. This is what Amazon downloads.
YOU GET NO GIFT CARD! Customer service was very cooperative
and gave me a refund; said they would fix the problem.",2.0
"love amazon and their gift cards.  the only thing i HATE is that they automatically take first payment from your gift card balance.  when i get one as a gift from someone, but then i run out of say, baby wipes, i don't want to use MY gift balance on baby wipes.  I would rather like to keep the balance aside to use on something i WANT as opposed to something I need.  SURELY you guys can figure out how to do this?  It would make amazon gift cards nearly perfect!",2.0
"I wanted to send electronically and didn't like the 24 hour delay to get it mailed. Birthday wishes were therefore a day late. Also, gift amounts should be my choice. I would have sent a different denomination than $25.",2.0
"Love the idea of an Amazon gift card but hated the difficulties I experiences trying to print a certificate that I can wrap.  It's has been a huge hassle.  I want one that I can instantly print because - duh - I waited too long. So I most certainly did NOT want to spend more time and more hassle trying to print an ""instant"" one!
Next time, I'll give myself enough time to order one that will be delivered.",2.0
"Not as Amazon promised, I didn't get additional reward for purchase the card. Amazon promoted for 5% back. But it didn't happen.",2.0
"In the age of computer tech.......
Why bother with a ""card"" - just email the recipient! Much faster and more efficient and cost effective.",2.0
"I was expecting this gift card to be plastic (like a normal gift card).  Instead, it is just a piece of thick paper.",2.0
"I am only disappointed in the check-out process not the card. I clicked on an IKEA card and was a little disapointed that I couldn't buy 2 $50 cards.... they just offered $25 cards, not the end of the world so I thought I would just buy 4. When I got to the checkout screen it showed other denominations so I chose the $50 one. It MAY have been clear to someone else that they were now buying an Amozon card rather than an Ikea card but I didn't notice. SO I got the wrong cards and because I procrastinate on everything I had no time to return so I just gave those cards. It could have been totaly my fault.",2.0
Here is my problem... the reason that I had to get these gift cards is because Kindle has not figured out how to gift books. I mean come on Amazon is a great company but the can't figure out how to gift books!,2.0
"When I purchased the iPod touch on Thanksgiving day, there was SUPPOSED to be a promotion that would include the gift card at no charge.  When I received my credit card bill, there was a charge of $30 for the card.  Although I used the gift card to purchase another gift for Christmas, I feel that this should not have been charged to my account!!!",2.0
I'm going to have to get with customer service about being charged $50 for this $50 gift card.  It was supposed to be free for purchasing a Wii plus the Fit Plus balance board bundle.  I'm not too happy about finding a charge to my credit card.  I hope dealing with CS will not turn out to be an unpleasant experience...,2.0
"If you've never had a problem shopping from Amazon.com, then you really are not experienced enough to be giving the ""gift"" of Amazon to someone else.  Wait until you've experienced your first screw up, and then evaluate.

I received a gift certificate, but have had trouble using it, because Amazon.com's outsourced customer service does not handle issues well.  They are apparently scripted to say that an appropriate person will contact you within 48 hours, but in my experience, follow up contact is not timely.  When contact is made, it has been to tell me that the issue was not well documented by the prior agents and to start over explaining my concern once again.  After that, I was told, once more, to wait 48 hours for follow-up that did not come.  Rinse and repeat.

The problem is that Amazon.com has apparently fire-walled these folks in Bangalore (or some other asian town) from the rest of the company.  Therefore, there can be no quick responses to customer concerns.  For me, after five contacts, I spoke with a ""team lead"" who indicated that prior agents had not documented the subject matter of my prior calls (even though I was promised a pompt resolution by those agents).

Add to all this the fact that during the recent holiday season, Amazon.com raised the price of the item I wished to purchase more than once, at the same time that the item's manufacturer was offering it for considerably less.  This makes having my ""gift"" money tied up in an Amazon.com account less than ideal.

Do not expect that the person to whom you intend to give a gift will not have to deal with the customer service department.  Try to be forward-thinking enough to consider that a problem might occur.  If it does, the recipient will likely have a very negative experience, regardless of the variety of products offered by Amazon.com.

When I asked an Amazon.com customer service agent why Amazon.com was charging 150% of what the manufacturer was selling the product for directly, I was told that the additional expense should be considered to cover the expert customer service available at Amazon.com.  This is terribly amusing, considering that the only thing that the agents tend to do is instruct the customer to wait 48 hours for someone else to address the problem (which, in my experience, does not happen).

If you are set on letting someone choose their own gift, you should consider a pre-paid Visa or Mastercard.  That way, the recipient could use the funds at Amazon.com if he or she so chooses, and is still free to purchase something locally from a person who could not avoid responding to a customer's concerns.",2.0
"ordered this for my wedding in march as a card holder and it broke as i was pulling out of the package. cheap stuff. instead, we ended up using a small memento wooden box/chest and left it propped open and i bought special pearl opaque paper from Michael's and printed our names and wedding date and then used adhesive spray glue to put on the inner portion of the lid. it worked great as a cardholder. as for this product, i ended up returning with no hassles. love amazon for easy returns and quick shipping.",2.0
"Not what I expected!
upsetting...
it is VERY cheap looking.

Better photo options. Theyre cheap looking.,2.0
Used as a gift card for my first gift purpose.,2.0
I usually have no problems getting the gift card the same day/almost instantly.  This time i was very disappointed.  I ordered the gift card and didn't get it until the next day!  Had to tell the person i was giving it to what i got them and email them the code after their birthday.,2.0
"I wanted to buy a regular gift card to wrap up and give as a gift.  When I searched on-line, Amazaon said 'free one day shipping', but when I tried to purchase it, they were going to charge me MORE than the gift card was worth!?!!  Finally I had to just print out the gift certificate from a black & white printer, which looked very cheesy.  If I want to give another gift card next year, I figured that I'll need to order it at least a month in advance or find a nice color printer!  Still love Amazon and so do my friends!",2.0
"I have never had a problem with Amazon, both when I'm ordering and selling stuff. What I do sometimes have a problem with is my own lack of thoughtfulness. Fret not, I am not going to bore you all by turning this into my own personal therapy session. But word to the wise, if you are buying an Amazon gift card for someone who lives in a foreign country, as is the case with my family member who lives in Canada, know that Amazon has sites in other countries.
  After inquiring, I'm still not sure if a card purchased at the American website can be used in a country like Canada, or any other country for that matter.
  If my gift turns out to be a dud, I'll be bummed. That's why I'm writing this, to let others know that Amazon operates in other countries, that have their own individual websites, and that hopefully, with a little awareness( which unfortunately I sometimes lack), you won't be left feeling bummed out by your Christmas shopping experience.",2.0
Not all of the numerals printed on the gift page. I did not notice it and had to go back and get all the correct digits,2.0
"I ordered this for my daughter's birthday.  She doesn't have an Amazon.com account, and I thought that it would come in a print out version with a code number that would enable her to order some music for her MP3 player.  How wrong I was!  She needed my Amazon account password, and she is in a group home where I would have to give this password to the staff.
  She was very disappointed, and I will have to order something for her and send it to her.",2.0
"I was not happy with the Amazon Gift card.  I didn't realize I needed to print it off and send it.  I thought an actual card would be sent , so it was not received on time, and I had to enclose the gift card(since it was only printed off on paper) within another card",2.0
"I faced two challenge things when I purchased the Amazon Gift Card.

1. It took a almost day to approve the credit card transaction. I checked the status 5-6 times during that day.
2. I also faced an issue to print the Amazon Gift Card.

Root cause analysis:
1. A bug in the payment system (could be a design miss or a bug the team didn't catch it before reaching production)
2. A bug in the print area

Hope Amazon can improve the customer experience.

Thanks

"I sent this gift card to my friend in England, and he had a lot of trouble trying to access the site to redeem it.  In fact, he sent me one from the U.K.  which I tried to redeem to no avail. I followed the correct steps, which he relayed to me, implicitly but it refused to accept the card number.  I eventually had to send it back to him to cash in.  Not very user friendly I'm afraid.",2.0
"I tried out the new e-card and didn't like it. I sent it to my dad via email and he could not get it to work. I went back and tried it myself, and it would not work. I read that it was supposed to have a 14-15 number/letters and it only had 13. I called Amazon and was told that my number was missing a ""5.""  He was super nice, though. I called my dad and he tried it, and it worked. It was a pain!

A gift card is just a gift card . But trying to get this to print was an absolute nightmare,2.0
"I'm disappointed because I wanted to send my nephew a physical gift card for his birthday not an e-card.  I'm an older person and not very technologically savvy.  Somehow I must have gotten confused while going through the ordering process.  Also, unfortunately, my printer is broken and I cannot even print the stupid e-card out, so I feel like I have charged $50 on my Discover card for absolutely nothing.",2.0
"I was buying it for my father who lives in Switzerland, but the gift card can be applied only on Amazon.com not Amazon.de. He wanted to buy a Kindle on Amazon.de, but could not use the card there.",2.0

"Purchasing of this gift voucher was confusing and difficult to specify the amount.  I had a specific amount in my AU currency that I wanted to spend but the link that I thought would alter my choice sent me through to the ""purchase confirmed"" site.  I ended up having my preferenced amount submitted in USD (with the current exchange rate was quite significant). Will be more careful with purchases in future.",2.0

"I wanted to purchase a gift card as a wedding present.  After reading about the gift card gaffes, I thought I would try the ""print at home"" version.  I have successfully done this a year ago for a baby shower gift.  When Amazon sent the email to ""print at home,"" it said I needed to download Adobe Acrobat.  I have had trouble with Adobe since its inception.  However, I tried.  My computer would not allow the download because of issues with McAfee Security.  I called (on the phone) Amazon, told them the problems I was having, and they have credited my account and hopefully resolved the issue.  They could not have been nicer.  This is my first problem with Amazon.  I shall continue to be a loyal Amazon shopper, but will stay away from gift card purchases on-line.",2.0
"The product didn't present very well when printed, as the design would format for printing. This made the gift look tacky",2.0
"i usually order your cards & have them shipped out in your cute boxes. trying something different this time, & also thought it was better for the environment....didnt like the quality & overall design of the card when i printed it out.  will go back to my standard way again next time.",2.0
There was a glitch in sending the card and gift card and it had to be deleted.  I sent a card and check through the postal service instead.  I did receive an email of apology.  One glitch will not keep me from trying the service again.,2.0
"I bought few gift cards and one time  it was cancelled without informing me and money has not returned to me. My fried tried
to use it and he is getting message has cancelled. He called me back on this and i need to call Amazon and find the stuff
Finally Amazon didn't have any answer why it got cancelled.....Of course they refund the Money but I got to explain to my friend",2.0
"The card did not have the confirmation code on it when it was printed. This may have been a problem with my printer and not the gift card itself. However, I will probably never print a gift card ever again. It would have been easier to pick up a card at the grocery store.",2.0
"I have given this gift card to my friend and neighbor, for her 70th birthday, but anything she tries to order, using this gift card, is reported as `'unable to deliver to this adress"" (in Europe) ....... is it ONLY for shoppers in the USA???

Therefore I ""don't like it""

"I folded the sheet on the lines, but it came out crooked and shifted to a side, so I refolded it in half, and the picture on the front wasn't centered.  I'm a perfectionist, especially when I'm giving something to someone else, but in the end it's a paper card and it is just a way to make the gift code look nice.",2.0
"Hi,

Just a word of warning on the purchasing of Kindle Gift cards .. I recently bought two kindles for my daughters and bought a couple of gift cards to help introduce them .. Problem .. I am in Australia .. Amazon has just set up here with it's own Kindle site .. when you register Kindles it wants to register your account there .. You can only buy gift cards however from the US site .. which can't be redeemed on the Australian site .. all in all pretty messy and required a fair bit of working out how to transfer accounts etc .. it should have been a very simple process so hopefully will be addressed soon.

Cheers",2.0
"This was purchased for older people as xmas present.  Whilst the gift card itself was fine, the nature of their situation and lack of w/less internet convenient to them meant that we had to activate it for them using our phone's bluetooth w/less.  This meant even the example download of a couple of books to show them what to do cost us in excess of $150 for  $50 gift card.  Cheaper to buy them  a real book.  Prob not relly Kindle/amazon fault but trap for young players won't go down this road again.",2.0
"I'm not very proficient with my computer, but this is the third time that I have had occasion to purchase gift cards from Amazon and every time seems to get harder each time.  Besides taking hours to complete, I was on the verge of a breakdown - not literally, but you get the idea.",2.0
"I bought my 12 year old daughter a Kindle Fire as a gift.  She could not download any Apps, not even free Apps without a credit card.  I purchased this gift card so that she could buy Apps.  However, that was not good enough.  For some reason, Amazon can't allow you to purchase Apps with a gift card without having a credit card on file.  Since I am not turning over my credit card to a 12 year old, I found this to be a poor process.

Apple products allow you to download free Apps without a credit card.  Also, you can buy Itunes cards and make purchases.  Not sure why Amazon can develop software that allows you to get free Apps without a credit card and that knows whether or not you have enough money ofn your gift card to make a purchase.

I do like the ability to buy the card and print it out or Email it.  But it didn't work out for me.",2.0
I loved the way it printed and how easy it was to purchase but I have just one complaint. I lost my job months ago and have had trouble finding work. I spent the 2 months prior selling books and other items to Amazon just so I could build a credit to purchase this gift card for my husband's bday but when the day came I was not allowed to use my credits for the purchase. :-( What a major let down that broke my heart. I could only afford to purchase him a gift card worth HALF the amount I had worked so hard to earn in credits.,2.0
"When I printed them out they all had the same picture on them and a couple of people thought it was too difficult to purchase an item. They had never gotten an Amazon Gift Card, so they sent their gift back to me.  So sad.

The one amazon $50 card was returned to me because the person receiving it said she didn't understand the instructions of how to use it. I read it.  I don't understand either.",2.0
I was not able to print the gift card. So I made one up myself. Partly my fault for not ordering in enough time. However the recipient of the card had no problem redeeming it. So it all worked out.,2.0
"When I printed the card, it cut off the last number, so the person who received the card could not use it.  Finally we figured out what happened, and he was able to use it, but it was annoying.",2.0
"This was the best of the lot, in my opinion, but the Amazon gift cards are not at all aesthetically pleasing, and some are...ugly.  I suggest getting  better designers and producing some cards one would like to receive with a nice gift.",2.0
"I have used this product/ feature before with no problems.  However, this last time was HORRIBLE.  The whole point of these printable gift cards are that they are fast and easy.  That was not the case this time.
I logged in to Amazon, chose my card, put in all my info, etc. and clicked to purchase the product.  It told me an email would appear in my box shortly.  It did.  It said something to the effect of ""This is a confirmation of your order.  Another e-mail should arrive shortly with instructions for printing your card.""  Previously, the second email has appeared nearly simultaneously with the first.  Not so this time.  I waited and waited.  After 15 minutes, when it still had not arrived, I went back to the Amazon site to check the status of my order.  It told me that it was still trying to confirm/ verify my credit card.  Mind you this is the same card I've been using on Amazon for *years* and it isn't close to expiry, nor is it close to the credit limit, so I didn't see what the problem was, but I waited some more.  When another 30 minutes passed and the email still had not appeared I called customer service.  (We had reached the point where it was time to leave for the party we'd bought the card for.)
The customer service person was not very helpful, and apparently not very bright.  I explained that I'd been waiting for 45 minutes, and he said ""Yes, I think we can help you within the next 45 minutes.""  I tried again, saying that I had *already* been waiting 45 minutes, and it was time for me to leave the house, and could he please see what the problem was quickly.  He came back and told me that they were verifying my credit card.  Again, I explained that I *knew* that from my status check, but I wanted to know *why* they were still verifying.  He put me on hold to check on it.  About 5 minutes later he came back on the line and told me that the problem was taken care of, and that I would be getting the email with instructions to print the gift card within the next 24 hours.  At this point I had pretty much lost my patience.  I told him that I didn't need it in 24 hours, I needed it NOW, which was the whole point of the stupid thing.  I told him that he'd better put a manager on the phone right away, and that if my problem wasn't fixed they would loose me and my family as customers.
Luckily the manager seemed to be a smart person.  I was on hold for another 5 minutes before the manager got on the phone.  When she did get on, she told me that she'd taken care of the problem, and would I please check my email one more time.  Thank goodness the email was there, and I was able to immediately print the gift card, and we were only about 15 minutes late for our party.

I do think these printable gift cards are a great idea, and have been happy with them in the past.  I don't know what happened that made my ""instant"" order take over an hour this time, but it will definitely make me think twice before using this product next time.  My recommendation to anyone who uses it in the future will be ""Don't wait until the last minute.""  I find this sad, because that is supposed to be the beauty of the thing.  Oh well.  I hope it was just a one-time fluke.  Good luck.",2.0
"after I placed this order, discovered a problem with my old computer.  even though I've printed gift cards in the past, my computer would not print this.  I contacted amazon and requested a card be sent to me.  they told me I should receive in a couple of days,  needless to say, I never received it.  I ended up having to see a friends computer to print this.",2.0
I don't like trying to keep up with that peace of paper.  I prefer to have a card.  Not sue if I can add money to the card.,2.0
The gift card was easy to print but it didn't have the necessary information on the card to actually use it.  I had to go my receipt to find the usable information.  It was very frustrating for both my Mom and me.,2.0
The reason i am rating it so low as i am in the bahamas and i order all the time through amazon. Bought my cousins and friend a kindle and bought the card for them and i can't purchase anything here. which is crazy. If im paying i don't see why there should be a problem. So pretty much since they did not notify me about this before i have wasted a ton of money on the kindle's and also the gift card's.,2.0

"Purchasing the ""Callaway"" card was difficult.  In fact, the card was purchased TWICE.  It took many tries to get the card processed.  I did it MANY times, only one time did it show it was attached to the e-card, but it was purchased AND sent twice.  It kept coming up saying it was only a demo, but in fact 2 of those times it wasn't!

I probably will not purchase a gift card attached to an e-card in the future.

"Since the gift was unable to reach the intended recipient I would have like a way to cancel the order. I purchased the gift card for my grandson, who'd just received a Kindle for his birthday. But the gift card could not be delivered to my daughter-in-law's email address. I made three tries. I know I got the address right. Still, the gift could not be delivered.
I looked everywhere for a way to cancel the order, but there was none. Now, I'm stuck with a bill and no merchandise to show for it. This sucks.
I also looked for a way to contact Amazon to register a complaint, but there wasn't one.
Double sucks.
Maybe I'm just stupid and don't know where to look, or maybe Amazon could make these options a little more VISIBLE.",2.0
"I have maintained gift cards as the primary way to take care of birthdays in the family.  I am a full time RVer and it is easier to send a gift card electronically than to wrap and mail a gift.  Also, the kids and others I send them too really like get them, it kind of extends thier birthday a bit as they get to search and choose gifts from Amazon.  The most recent two sends I made to my niece in L.A. had problems.  She could not get the system to accept the code that came with the card.  She now has to contact Amazon and spend far more time than she has trying to get the problem corrected.  On another occasion, I tried to send one to my daughter back in the May '12 timeframe, and she never recieved it.  I'm not clear on what her problem is/was but the incoming email may have been picked up by both her addresses as spam.  I have resent the card several times and it is still just sitting there in a ""sent"" mode.  I found out I could not back it out and cannot use the funds to acquire other products so I'm basically out that $100.00.  I beleive the prudent thing to do at this point is to not use the Amazon Gift Card any longer and opt for some other strategy.  I hope this helps someone out there because not only is it frustrating, but I am also out those funds with no way to get them back.",2.0

I purchased many gift cards from many different places. I like the gift card from Amazon that comes in a beautiful box. Amazon would ship the gift card in a very classy box. Unfortunately not enough selection. The e-mail one is not that good especially to a person that does not have a good color printer or have a printer that does not always work. Also it could easily get lost in the jungle of junk e-mail. Some of the new young generation does not usually send thank you notes or inform the sender that they receive the gift card. Many times I just wonder if they ever receive the e-mail gift card I send them. I always tell my children to send a thank you card for every gift they receive or they might not receive another one.,2.0
"The gift card was for a relative in South Africa and before sending it I checked the price of the two kindle books I had recommended to her on both Amazon.uk (in s) and Amazon.com (in $), and the gift card should have more than covered the price.

In this case, I was able to speak with my daughter about the gift card that was intended for her husband's birthday.  This is how I found out that it wasn't received.

I brought the card for my sister and it was weeks before she was able to locate it.  Don't know what went wrong with it.,2.0
"its a gift card, its plastic... it holds money... and to clear out this list since Im OCD I have to review it.",2.0
Took 2 tries for the gift card to be sent and then after the second try it took almost 2 weeks before it was sent.  This meant the gift was not received for almost exactly 1 month.,2.0
"I have ordered gift cards in the past and they were fine.  This one wasn't delivered, which made my mother think that I forgot her on Mother's Day.  Not a good experience.",2.0
I send a lot of Amazon Cards. But I thought I'd go the e-card route this time to save a tree. Bad idea. It never got there. Actually this is the second time I've tried to send an Amazon Card as an e-card. And both times it didn't go through. I know the email is a good one because that is how I communicated with birthday boy and girl to see if they got it. Amazon gets props for walking me through cancelling the e-card and sending a traditional one. But I won't rely on their e-card method again. Sorry guys.,2.0
"Account got suspended for buying a gift card. It doesn't make sense, amazon.",2.0

"The gift card was for my wife, and she has used part of it successfully. Its origingal intent was to purchase apps for her Kindle, but has yet been unable to do so. What we have looked into - books/games - require a creditcard number, and the numbers on the giftcard don't seem to work.",2.0
"The recipient claims never to have gotten it(email address was correct etc) and I was never notified. It was rectified, but I will be hesitant to go this route again.",2.0
It should be known and pointed out or made very obvious in the description before purchasing that you can not buy kindle books in Australia with this gift card. This was the intended purpose of the purchase.,2.0
"I like the product HOWEVER I had to have it sent twice in order for the recipient to receive it.
This is the second time this has happened.
While I like the convenience of Amazon gift cards the delivery of them leaves much to be desired.",2.0
Sent this to my older father...it ended up in his spam mail and he didn't get it until I told him to check his spam mail.  Not sure I will do this again.,2.0
"Got lost or was not delivered on the requested date. Troubleshooting was a huge pain. I was finally able to figure out how to resend it to the recipient, but it was a difficult process.",2.0
"The gift card got to the person OK but really what I wanted was to gift a book - rather than send a gift card, and then tell the person which book I wanted them to get with it.",2.0
The fee for the gift card was very high. Bought a $20 gift card and paid $26 for it!,2.0
"I sent the card to arrive on my daughter-in-laws birthday.....good thing I checked with her to see if it arrived....it did not!
I re-sent it and still she did not get it (yet, she was getting my personal emails at the same email address).! Finally I sent it to my sons email and he was able to retrieve it.
BE SURE IF YOU SEND A GIFT CARD VIA EMAIL YOU CHECK WITH THE RECIPIENT - don't assume they are just not acknowledging your gift.",2.0

Never got it through to the recipient. Credit back to my card.  Printed ones received without a problem.,2.0

I didn't like that when you add the gift card It's a pre set amount. Guests should be able to dictate the amount of a gift card,2.0
"i sent two Amazon gift cards, one for a birthday & one as a wedding present.  Neither one of the recipiants noticed it.  I had to humble myself by asking, ""did you get my present"", and both said no.  I had to tell them what it was, and when (i was not informed what time their notifying email would be delivered) i thought it may have arrived.  Both went back and found it, and then said the same thing, ""i get LOTS of emails from Amazon, and sometimes just don't get them all opened.  I'm lucky i didn't delete it.""  Obviously, Amazon needs to make these more recongnizable as GIFTS, to differentiate from your standard marketing email onslaught.  This sucked the fun right out of giving...",2.0

I don't like that recipient thought gift was junk mail and had trashed the gift card notification. Fortunately, the error was discovered before it was permanently deleted.

"I sent the gift card for my daughter-in-laws birthday, received notification that the card was sent, but apparently it wasn't. Finally asked her whether she received the gift and she had not.  I went back to the website and there was an option ""re-send"" but that didn't work either! Finally had to call customer service and they sent the card somehow. Makes me nervous to order another gift card!  Judy Gaines",2.0
"Bought this gift card as a Mother's Day present.  Did not get a receipt in my inbox from Amazon until a month later.  Can't understand why it takes Amazon so long to get a receipt to a customer.  Have had this issue happen several times in the past.  With the lateness of my receipt, when I did get it, my first thought was that someone used my account illegally.  Then I saw what it was for and the transaction date, and realized that Amazon was late again!",2.0
excelent--,2.0
I bought this Kindle book card for my mom last year and she said it was never received in her email.  I bought her another one this year and again she says she has not received it yet.  If the item was delivered then I would give it five stars.,2.0
"I had to resend it, gift card, 3 times and then she had to get on and try again.  I've done this before and it was fine, what happened this time.?  Finally she got her birthday gift.",2.0
Was a NIGHTMARE to deal with when 2 day shipping turned into about a week and when the gift card showed up it wasn't working! Then I had to contact amazon on Instagram in the comments section to get what I originally ordered after 3 disappointing phone calls (all about 40 minutes each).,2.0
"Asked for it to be emailed on to my wife on Valentines Day. Unfortunately I live in Australia so Valentines Day comes 16 hours before it does in the United States so my wife didn't get her present until 4 in the Afternoon

"I was disappointed in the quality of the paint , it had roller marks on all pieces. I don't have time to send them back. I didn't expect to much but still some quality would have been good. I
put them together and got through the project.",2.0
The person I sent to didn't receive or recognize as gift card. After they called then I called and we got straight but way to much hassle. Something not right here for us. So won't be doing again.,2.0
"I was disappointed that the voucher I purchased was not able to be used on the Australian Amazon website.
When I paid for the voucher, it was converted to Australian dollars but the voucher holder was not able to use it on the Australian website.
I did not see anything on the website to inform me of this before or during the purchase process.

The receiver of the voucher emailed Amazon support who confirmed that this was the case. He then had to transfer the voucher to an American account so that he could use it.

I think Amazon need to make vouchers usable no matter what country they are in.",2.0
"The gift card was great.
The only problem was I was promised a $10 gift card for myself by purchasing a $50 gift card. This card was supposed to be delivered to my email inbox by August 15. I still have not received it and have been waiting for it to place an order.",2.0
Very complicated prices for my son in law to spend hours on phone with Amazon to finally be able to use it in Canada.,2.0
"This doesn't deserve two stars, but I don't like that one star said ""I hate it"", so I went with two.
I sent this gift card via email to my sister, so it could be used for my niece's birthday, but she says she never received it. She swears she never received any email that said it was from me, so I don't know if it was just from Amazon and went to spam or what. I emailed her the confirmation information that I received, and she was told that wasn't enough information to issue a new one.
Now my money is lost in limbo somewhere. Not happy!",2.0
"The fact that you cannot use an e-mail gift card for the purchase of a Kindle download is ludicrous.
I felt that the ease of giving the card with an internet purchase worked well when I was on the road, and not home, however was extremely upset that this ""gift"" could not be used for Kindle downloads - the reason I purchased the gift card!",2.0
I purschased a gift card online and thought it would get sent to their fb message and not on their wall.,2.0
"Never got these cards! Can't give a review, maybe one of my daughters order this.  Sorry but it looks like a nice card.",2.0
I had a really bad experience getting this set up and printed! Not sure I want to try this again.,2.0
I was very excited to use this feature so my sister could get her Birthday gift early. However it did not happen. I kept on getting an error message telling me user unable to receive gift card through facebook. I had to resend three times. After the third time I received another message from amazon. The third message advised me to send by email. is was quick and easy. sorry I am unable to comment on facebook but it did not work for me. I gave this review 2 stars on account of not being able to download gift card to facebook.,2.0
"People love getting these cards, usually, but we could REALLY use a bigger, better selection of the basic card formats.  The major complaint however is that often they are not 'delivered'.  We have to wait to see if the recipient is just late in thanking us, then remember after a few weeks to go check and see if the card was picked up, and if not, ask for it to be resent.  Usually this second attempt works but not always.  I think it would be very helpful if we were notified if the card is not picked within a few days of being sent.

Other than that, a gift card from a site like Amazon is a very useful gift.",2.0
"I purchased an Amazon gift card from our local Giant Eagle in order to collect fuel reward points. I then entered the gift card into my Amazon account. At that point I tried purchasing a Amazon online gift card for my sister for her birthday. Due to the fact that she lives out of town it is much easier to do it via the Internet then to purchase one and mail it to her. It would not let me purchase the gift card with the money I had, in my Amazon account, which was more than enough to cover the cost of the online gift card. This is definitely gonna make me think twice before purchasing a gift card for someone online through Amazon. I hope that there is an easy solution to this situation. And if you know what it is, I would like to know",2.0
gift card purchase items doesn't have warranty as credit card purchase covered.,2.0
I have given these as gifts.  This particular one I gave my sister and she told me.  Other times I never know if they got it or not.  Can you find a way to let me know when someone has gotten a gift card I have sent them so I know it hasn't been wasted?,2.0
There is no mechanism to determine if your gift was redeemed if you don't receive a thank you note.  The buyer should get a redemption acknowledgement.,2.0
"The gift cards are great, but when it takes three weeks to get it sent to person, it loses its luster.",2.0
Gave this gift card to my niece in Germany and she had to open an american account to use it... so now I get the shipment and carry it back to Germany. How global is Amazon? Not - would be my reply.,2.0
"Be warned this gift card only works for US Amazon site.  The gift recipient had to buy from US Amazon website even though they lived in Spain.  There is an Amazon Spain site - however standard gift cards cannot be used on it.  About 1/2 the gift card value ended up being used as freight.  I though Amazon was ""one company"" - be sure to read the fine print.",2.0
I ordered the gift card to be sent on 2-19-13.  She did not receive it.  I had to call to get it sent.  The person I talked to did not seem upset that the card was not sent at the time requested. It was not sent until 2-21-13.,2.0
"I ordered the egift card on 12/20.  It was not delivered that day.
I only found out when I checked with the recipient.  I had to go back into my order and resend on 1/14.
Very disappointing that an e-gift card was not sent on time.",2.0
If I wanted an e-card I would have requested it.  The gift card was for my daughter who is too young to have her own email account.  It's not very fun to show the gift on a computer.  Kids want to be able to touch and feel their gifts.,2.0
"The supporting software for buying this guift card was not friendly.  I couldn't tell if I had the card ordered and paid for so ended up circling around.  I sent this to my son via his email personal email.  BUT when I went back in several hours to check on the gift card, I got a message saying ""resend"".  SO being totally trusting of Amazon, I resent the gift card to my son's military email address.  To top it all off, my son received two valid gift cards but when he tried to use the first one, it defaulted.  He waited a couple days and the gift card at the military address did finally work.  I don't want to repeat this experience again.",2.0
The problem is that I live in Germany and you cant file your US gift card onto the german Amazon account. I don't undestand were the problem is to file in a gift card at Amazon Germany and get the exchangerate of the date. I have the sme loginns in US Amazon as in german Amazon. Shame.....,2.0
Dont know if it was ever used or opened. The person I purchased it for as a bday gift could not access account and hadnt been able to use said card,2.0
It took two email requests and over a week for the card to arrive in the recipient's inbox. Not impressed.,2.0
"LOW QUALITY, NOT GOOD, INFERIOR, LOW QUALITY.  Regret purchasing this item.
AMAZON also accepted payment for an item on sale which was not provided.",2.0
"For some reason, my nephew's email would not get this gift card. I resent it a couple times, and then I eventually just had to copy the code and forward in a text. That was pretty disappointing.",2.0
Immediate delivery and very convenient way to purchase and give as gifts to family and friends and to your foes too!,2.0
"My daughter was forced, during the payment process on Amazon, to use it to pay for an item that was not for herself, instead of using a credit card.  Why buy it as a gift if it can't be used as the recipient chooses.",2.0
There were dificulties in using the card initially which were sorted out. Even with a gift card it was necessary to have an account with a credit card attached. This should not have been mandatory.,2.0
"It was OK but as I could nt get it in
Australia I had to send it to a friend in u
So then she sent it to me...most inconvenient ...why are't these products available outside US???",2.0
Among several other items I purchased two lenses one Canon and one Irix neither was working. Newer again buying such items from Amazon.,2.0
"It was shockingly complicated to complete the purchase. There was some kind of issue with my credit card, and even after approved the purchase was cancelled and I was not notified.",2.0
"Was none too happy when recepient did not receive gift card.  Once discoved, all was fixed, but still it was enough to give poor rating.",2.0
"Although we checked and double checked the recipient's email address to ensure it was indeed correct, this gift card never did arrive in his inbox. After  having him scour his junk mail, trash can and spam folders, there was still no sign after 2 weeks. It seems odd that there was no delay in deducting the $50 from our checking account, however. It took a bit of digging, but we did figure out how to re-send the Gift Certificate, and it arrived with no problem the second time around, to exactly the same address...go figure.",2.0
"I had to e-mail several time on this purchase.  Ordered on the 12th of June as an e-card.  Waited several weeks to see if the person receiving the e-card had received it.  He had not.  So I had to e-mail the company to see why it was not received.  I than reordered the e-card.  Was told in an e-mail the card would be sent in 2 hours.  Never received.  I than called the company, had the e-card changed to a mailed, gift card.  That was received.  I have sent the same person an e-card in the past without any problems, don't know why this time was so difficult.  But in any case the item was received.",2.0
"The product itself has nothing special. It would be good to have an email confirmation once the gift card is delivered electronically. My friend was traveling and can't check email very often. I had to call her to make sure that she received this gift which partially ruined my surprise (without calling her, I had no info at all to show if the email was delivered or not).",2.0
Needlessly complicated and error prone procedure for gift giving internationally.,2.0
"I love the idea of giving Amazon Gift Cards as my family and I share a Prime Account and we all do a lot of shopping through Amazon.  So, I purchased an Amazon gift card for my Granddaughter with the intent to reload in from time to time so she too could purchase things she wanted through Amazon within the limit I established.  Well, I had no idea the trouble we'd encounter with Amazon's policy of making the gift card the default for Quick Click purchasing and the trouble of having to ensure that the gift card isn't applied to every purchase we make.  Sadly, this didn't work for us.  As soon as the amount on the gift card has been redeemed, we'll let it go and in the future I'll purchase gift cards for some other merchant for my Granddaughters.  I'll never purchase another gift card from Amazon again.",2.0
"Good morning! yesterday i bought a gift card for $150. when I check my bank account, I could tell that debited me $ 10 more plus and at the time of purchase no further increase occurs. help me",2.0
I bought 3 Kindle Fire devices and they all 3 have the same issues. The screens will lock up or completely shut down and will not come back on without having to hold down the power button for 30 seconds and then clicking it again. This is a nuisance and I can foresee it becoming a worse problem later.,2.0
"A very Christian and ""proper"" romance. I downloaded it because I love Skye. Both the writing and the romance was a bit dull.",2.0
It was easy to order the gift card but nearly impossible for the recipient to retrieve it despite a valid email address.  The intended recipient spent 2 days on the Phone with Amazon customer service before actually receiving the card.  I won't do this again.,2.0
this particular process seemed to take 2 weeks to reach recipient-tried to get a printable view to get validation code/number off card so I could at least e-mail that-unsuccessful,2.0
I didn't realize that the gift card would be unusable because the recipients have an account set up with amazon.ca for kindle. They are able to use it for other things but not for books which was the purpose.,2.0
"It was an ok movie, very confusing though. It was in the style of pulp fiction and I had a hard time keeping up with it. It wasn't worth buying to me.",2.0
Not bad,2.0
There is no way to buy without your gift card and that's annoying. Make customers able to buy from other distributors with these cards,2.0
"Never do this again, I used a bank credit card & my daughter didn't get it until AFTER HER BIRTHDAY! So disappointing :(",2.0
"The gift card really did not work well.  I wanted to use this for instant purchase for my son on his kindle, but each time he went to make a purchase of a movie, it would not apply the gift card, it wanted credit card information entered.",2.0
"Recently, I purchased the gift card at $50 with the expectation to get $10 credit on amazon's promotional offer.  I made a few purchases of kindle ebooks after I got the promotion code.  However, I could not apply the promotion code on the orders (electronic delivery):
1) I have nowhere to seek help to find out whether the orders I wanted to place are qualified for promotional credit; 2) Each time I placed order there was nowhere for me to input the promotion code to get the $10 credit; and 3) Your amazon email informed me that the promotional offer would be expired sometime in October 2013; 4) the generic online search for helps from amazon website would not solve the problem at all.
Due to the problems of not getting the promotional offer, I did not plan to buy the gift card; even I enjoyed reading on Kindle. I wish your customer support would help and explain to me to how to get my $10 credit.  My phone number is (626) 417-3610.  Thanks.",2.0
when purchased i did not know it could not be used for my Aunt to purchase her prime membership.  she also could not activate the card because one of the symbols was unreadable.  even the help line could not get it to work.,2.0
One worked the other didnt,2.0
This was bought as a gift - the email arrived over a week after I bought it! I expected it to arrive at least the day after if not the same day. Not impressed.,2.0
"I thought it was a great idea, but it does not work.",2.0
Amazon offers only TWO animated gift cards for the celebration of a wedding anniversary and neither are very creative.  Says a lot...time to go back to sending cash to our kids.,2.0
"I'm not American people,so I don't have a ""social security number"" to Fill in the information. It's not convenient....",2.0
"I am having difficulty with my Kindle. The first difficulty I have is that the pages are unmarked. The second difficulty I have is when using the Kindle and tapping the screen to turn the page the Kindle will sometimes turn a number of pages instead of one.

When I try to find my place I have difficulty because the Kindle will only allow a limited number of backward movements through the book.
Using this product is a frustrating and at times nauseating experience.
Thank you
Pat Priebe",2.0
"Very hard to purchase using a mobile and trying to upload a custom picture for the card. Tried many times and transaction either timed out when waiting for page to refresh or was cancelled by amazon after it was submitted and accepted. Finally worked by doing it on home computer using a stock amazon photo and the same credit card. Very annoying, not the easy gift it was meant to be.",2.0
Did not get the $15 credit as promised in the e-mail. Not happy.,2.0
"I loved the gift card, but when I went to rate it , I am FORCED to leave a comment with a 40 word minimum. So this is my only review for Amazon, great products, 5 stars should be enough, but this made me give it 2 stars",2.0
"Gift cards are nice; but after calling Amazon a couple times before ordering one to ask questions, I was still disappointed.  My recipient was overseas and could not find anything they would deliver there.  They did give me my money back however.",2.0
Dont know how to use it,2.0
"I purchased a gift card partly because of a mother's day promotion. Amazon said they'd give me a $10 gift card for buying this one. It never happened, so that was pretty disappointing.",2.0
"I bought the gift card for my mom for Mother's Day.  She's 87 and pretty much a shut in.  But she loves to read on her Kindle.  My issue is, the card was automaticly applied to an order that she had with Amazon.  Now, this was not an overdue bill, she pays on time.  I wanted her to have fun with the card and buy herself something special, not pay a bill.  I won't buy another Gift Card.",2.0
Design poor,2.0
"It doesn't pick up well at all, and is actually hard to use. Have to push down on it to pick up at all!  Disappointed in this product.",2.0
"The vest was labeled as medium, was at best a size 6 small. Suggest that the manufacturer correctly mark the product.",2.0
Wife is a kindle fanatic and loves these gifts. Makes gifting very easy and her response makes it a no brainier. Problem is I've purchased these gift cards twice this year and they never sent the email to the recipient. Both times I had to go back and send the gift card to myself and forward them to my wife.,2.0
"I was supposed to get a 15$ credit with this purchase but it never worked. The add said click here and the code would be added to my account but it never gave me the credit, 18PRIMEGC Dont believe it.",2.0
"Really, Amazon, is THAT the best you could do for an EASTER GREETING to accompany an Easter gift card? Tacky art and Amazon logo advertising? Disappointed. Love sending gift cards but wish you'd show some spunk in designing something APPROPRIATE for the holiest holiday for most Americans.",2.0
"Whats the point of Amazon credit if I cant use it to purchase a gift card? Honestly, thought it was good as money",2.0
I bought amazon gift cards a lot. However I was getting cancel for no reason. I tried several times to get this. Sad!,2.0
"I purchased 2 Amazon gift cards, one for $300 was redeemed immediately by the recepiant. The second gift card for $200 was not accepted and it has been over a month now! I cant get in touch with the person I sent it to and I haven't been able to get the money back?  So Im out $200. I wouldnt use this gift card again!!",2.0
Had to resend to recipient at least 4 times before she received it.  If I hadn't asked if it was received I would never have known she didn't get it,2.0
I uploaded a painting done by the friend for whom the gift card was purchased.  He received a simple gift card - no photo uploaded.,2.0
I was supposed to get a $15 bonus for purchasing but that never became evident as to where it would appear or how to obtain it.  I was a bit miffed,2.0
"My friend who I gave this gift card to had a very difficult time trying to use this gift card, Amazon really needs to fix that issue and make it much easier to use these. I won't buy an Amazon gift card again after all this trouble, a gift should be stress free and enjoyable not a nightmare to use.",2.0
"A great gift for anyone who has rudimentary computer skills.  Not so much for one's 91 year old mother-in-law who asked, ""how the hell do I work this?""  Thank you Amazon for making the exchange so I could get her a Visa Gift Card which she could figure out how to use.",2.0
"at least make it red colour .. maybe for the background or the object, because this model not describe a chinese new year. Fyi tha chinese new year identical with red colour.. thanks",2.0
"I did not receive an acknowledgement of my gift from the receiver.  I wonder if she actually received the gift card I paid for?""",2.0
My daughter had a heck of a time trying to collect this but there was no problem to charge me quickly. That was to be for our grandchildren's Christmas gifts and everything got thrown out of whack. I would definitely think twice before buying another gift card.,2.0
"Process is simple,  but....three strikes your out! Before I clicked on the purchase button,  i read the reviews,  and there were too many negatives so.... No thanks,  Amazon.... love you,  but not ordering a gift card from you!",2.0
Nice gift card,2.0
"Although I chose Pink Candles, the generic Amazon logo was the only thing that would print.",2.0
"the information about the gift came before the card itself spoiling the beauty o the greeting and the surprise of the gift. I won't use egift card again.
ann",2.0
I bought a gift card for amazon.com instead of amazon.ca. Amazon should automatically redirect to the Canadian site.,2.0
Message was not included on the card so the recieptient had no idea who it was from.,2.0
"I bought this card as a wedding gift and am sure the one I ordered said something about ""Love"" on it.  The one that got here said it was for Kindle and said ""Happy Reading"" on it.  Not really suitable for newly weds.",2.0
"Got the package on time, but the whole card is bent. Rather disappointing since it's a birthday present.",2.0
"card was okay, but company forgot to put message and who it was from.",2.0
The envelopes containing the gift cards arrived sealed so I had to rip them open to include a message on the card.  Unless I plan to send a ripped and taped envelope I'll need to purchase new envelopes when I send the cards to the recipients.,2.0
Card wasn't delivered. Had to reorder. Missed the needed date. Shame!,2.0
"I was very disappointed that I had completed the ""it's a gift"" form and had all my gift cards personalized to my nieces and nephews, but when they arrived, there was not a note included.  I never received a call from them thanking me because they had NO CLUE who it was from.",2.0
"The gift card is great!  But, it didn't include the message I wrote the sender. They had no idea who it was from!",2.0
"Only reason I gave this two stars is because its packing was so poor. I ordered toilet paper in a separate order, and the gift card came with this huge package that contained the toilet box. The worst part was the gift card was under the toilet paper. Because I wasn't expecting the gift card would come with this toilet paper, I almost threw the box away. I ordered this gift card for a holiday present, but I don't think I will give this crumpled card as a gift.",2.0
"Ok looking card (not great). But I would have liked it to come in a tin. As one of the ones I ordered, the card was bent in half. And couldn't have been done by post office as they were in a box.",2.0

"This gift card was a birthday gift for my granddaughter.  It did arrive on time, but the problem I have with it is that they neglected to include my gift message!  The card was absolute blank, even though I typed a message - which DOES show on my order details.  My granddaughter had no idea who the gift was from.  I find that to be unacceptable!",2.0
The package arrived on time and looked great. Just one problem. No message was sent with the gift card. The gift card and greeting card were present. There was supposed to be printed inside the card but no message was there. Disappointed,2.0

Good thing I only needed the gift card since the greeting card itself was bent and crinkled.,2.0

"Not happy with my order.
I have ordered an Amazon gift card with $60 value. And I also requested a gift option and a gift message addressed to a recipient of this order.
The order itself has been delivered on time. However, delivered envelope contained 2 (!) gift cards, and $60 value has been indicated on each card. There were also no gift message at all anywhere of the envelope (inside or outside).
That was supposed to be a ""surprise"" birthday gift, so obviously I didn't tell the recipient, what exactly was in the package.
As a result, the recipient assumed that there were 2 cards of $60. And he contacted me later to ask, if there was something wrong with the order, because one of the card showed zero balance on it, when he tried to redeem it on the website.
Honestly, that was a very awkward situation, and I've felt really embarrassed while explaining, that it was actually only one card of $60.",2.0
"I have faith that the money is good but the Birthday Cards were both crimped in the mailing envelope and both look ""shop worn"" and not fresh.  I can apply the money to print out my own Birthday Card whcih will look less tacky.",2.0

"Could not send directly to recipient. Three cards sent to me then
I had to remain.",2.0
The card I filled out for this wedding gift was not included when it was delivered in Dec. I just found out and the couple had a card they didn't know who had sent and probably wondered why I had not sent a gift when I traveled from AZ to MN to attend the wedding. Very disappointed and I will probably NOT order an Amazon gift card again.,2.0
The Gift Card was delivered to my niece with no mention of who sent it to her.  She had no idea who had sent the gift card.,2.0
"I am giving the gift cards a 3 star rating for one reason only.  I ordered the cards as a gift to be sent to my Daughter, Son in Law, my Grandson, his girlfriend and her son.  In doing so, I was asked what I wanted the cards to say.  I entered in a little holiday greeting for each of the cards and to my surprise, they had a 1 day delivery option, which I thought was great.

The cards arrived the next day as promised.  However the cards were blank and the envelops had no names on them.  Why ask if I wanted a message inside for a gift if your going to ignore it and ship a blank cards without identifying which one was for who.  A good thing they were for all the same denomination, however I had to ask my grandson to do what Amazon was supposed to do before sending them out...

I won't be using this option again for a gift being sent directly to someone again.  Very disappointing execution of a gift delivery.",2.0
I wanted a plain Amazon Gift Card - NOT Kindle!!  It was for my 14 year old Great grandson and he has NO kindle products!  Just what do I do now??  I can't return it!!,2.0
Like the idea of a real card. Last time I ordered a card it came a day later. So I ordered another. This time it took a week and birthday was passed. I'll print at home from now on.,2.0

"My mom got the gift card, but the Mother's Day card was not in the envelope, and the note I wrote to her was not included.  It wasn't put together as a gift, just in parts.  The only reason she knew it was from me was because I told her to expect something in the mail.",2.0
Good thing we had it shipped to our home so we could personalize the card. The card looked as if it had been run over then put in the wash. Sure it's the card that comes with the gift card but I still expected better packaging for shipping.,2.0

Late delivery was bad. No notice was worse. Otherwise good,2.0
The card arrived to my sister unsigned so she had no idea who sent it.  Amazon should have at least included the name of who sent the gift card.  I called her several days later and she had no idea who had sent this card.,2.0
"WARNING!  If you request a note to be added for a Birthday Wish, it is NOT written on the card, it is printed on the packaging slip.  This was delivered to my sister-in-law and she had no idea who it was from.

She went back through the package and found a small sheet that was like a packing slip with my birthday wish written in small print.",2.0

"I ordered 7 gift cards (which arrived 2 days later than scheduled) with 7 different, personalized greetings for each one.  They just arrived (2 hours before our Christmas Eve family get-together) and there are, indeed, 7 gift cards in sealed envelopes which I had to unseal to see who the recipient is for each, and they are all blank!  No name, no message, sealed envelope, all with different barcodes.  Of course, I am very disappointed that they are not personalized as they were supposed to be but, do I need to worry about who gets which one?  There is a bar code on the packing slip for each one but I can't find that particular bar code on the gift card.  So very disappointed because I thought this would be such an easy gift to drop in the stockings.  Now I will spend an hour trying to figure out what goes where!",2.0
Obviously the gift card rocks but the holiday card arrived all bent in the corners and I'm not quite sure if I even want to give the actual greeting card or not because it is so bent. :( Not Amazon's fault but I'm still fairly disappointed.,2.0
Card came on time but was completely blank inside.  No message or sender information in card so recipient did not know who it was from.  A big disappointment in my eyes!,2.0

I don't appreciate how the card was rolled up / bent and damaged.  Presentation is everything and this was a gift.  now i have to find another card to put the gift card in.  The mail carrier rolled it up to put it thru my letter slot.  Now the card is damaged.  Perhaps there needs to be cardboard or a hard backing in the bubble envelope to prevent the mail carriers from damaging the card.,2.0
"The gift card was enclosed in a card & both arrived on time, which I appreciate!  However, the message I had typed out to be printed in the birthday card did not get printed, therefore the card was blank on the inside and the recipient didn't know who purchased the gift.  That was disappointing.",2.0
What's the point of purchasing a Greeting Card if the ink gets completely smeared and illegible? I just spoke with the gift-card recipient.

"I sent a greeting card with a gift card enclosed to a relative. The carrier left the envelope by her front door on a very windy day; it was not secured in any way nor did the carrier ring her doorbell (she was home all morning).  When she went out to her car to run errands she picked up what she thought was a piece of garbage blowing around her lawn; it was the gift card.  Anyone (or no one) could have picked it up.  It's not clear from the tracking info which carrier was used to deliver the envelope, but I won't be ordering a gift card by mail ever again.",2.0
This was  gift for my sister and they neglected to include the message I wrote -- so she got a gift card from anonymous....  :(,2.0
"VERY DISAPPOINTED !!
I ordered two (2) cards for my grandkids and filled in the Gift Card Comments on each.  When they arrived I opened the large envelop with the two cards inside, I had hoped that the Gift Comment would be on the outside of the envelopes, but there was no way to determine whose card was whose !!  So I opened the gift card outer envelope, again hoping that my Comments submitted would be there, but NOPE, no Gift Comment.  I opened each card, flipping each one in search of My Gift Comment, still No Gift Comment.  Very confused, I went to my Order Confirmation to be sure each card had my Gift Comments and they were.  I'm glad that I didn't have them sent to the grandkids because there would be no way they would know who each card was for and who they were from. I suggest that Amazon remove the Gift Comment Option or at the very least, have better Quality Control in their Shipping Department.",2.0
"Everybody  love and find this a helpful gift, delivery  time was really fast, but the main complain  I  have is that the card (both of them) where completely  bended,  so the cute card was ruined it and the card itself too, so I  know is going to  still work, but is terrible giving someone a bended  card as a gift",2.0

I love amazon but the quality of the card was bad! It was scratched up and dull like it had been reused a few times. The person I gave this to as a gift even mentioned the condition of the card and made a joke about it.,2.0
"The card had been deactivated when the gift recipient attempted to purchase an item.  So I would say I did not like it at all.  Not sure what happened with the card other than when I first ordered it I received another item instead of the gift card.

"This gift card arrived with absolutely nothing to tell the recipients who it was from.

I got a text message asking, ""Did you, by any chance, send me an Amazon gift card?"" Both my husband and I have been sick for about a month, and unable to get out to shop, so we sent a lot of gift cards. Now, I'm thinking, no one will know who sent them.

If no one tramples it you will be good to go, otherwise, like me you will be giving out a very beat-up wavy card this year.

The gift card is fine. It's the packaging and card that is not so great. I included a note with the card but the note was included on the packing slip and not on the actual card so the person that received the gift had to search to figure out who the gift card came from. Lame.,2.0
"Sunday delivery was excellent BUT the birthday greeting I wrote was non-existent nor was there any indication to the recipient that it was I who sent it.  Not good.  Recipient after checking with a few people finally called me long distance to ask if I had sent it.  Amazon, you need to do a better job at this.  Again, I applaud the free one-day delivery but that benefit was negated by the sloppy handling of the greeting I had written for the recipient.",2.0

This is embarrassing for me, and the people I gave them too originally were not going to tell me.  They thought I just gave them a blank card.  Amazon has been helpful, but I have had to spend 2 hours on the phone to get this straightened out.

signed the card by the first name of the name on the Amazon account (and I happened to be on my sister's account

I was stunned that it didn't arrive in time, of all the items that I ordered this year from Amazon, I thought I wouldn't have a problem at all with your gift card. It leaves a big question mark in my thinking, now I'm not sure that one of your gift cards will be a good option in the future.

The $50 gift card came in less than 2 days on December 20th in keeping with the one day Amazon delivery promise. The $100 gift card came 7 days late to my door by UPS on December 27, with the tracking info showing the package bouncing between two local SF Bay Area UPS Distribution Centers for a week, even though the distribution center received the package in less than two days. There was no reason, since the address was correct. Delivery of these Gift Cards, which is nice to physically give to family in hardcopy, through UPS cannot be trusted.

"UPDATED 12/26/13: Comments 'Revised' due to UPS holiday shipping problems broadcast in National News ... rating increased to 2 stars.

PROS:
- Can be shipped to address of person receiving gift
- Limited capability to send personalized message.

CONS:
- Likely due to UPS issues ... Not Delivered on Expected Date (projected to be 2-3 days late)
- Likely due to UPS issues ... Confusing delivery status info.
- Inconsistent experience to personalize messages
- Inflexible ... Message can  (& can not) be printed on Card

ACI Gift Cards, Inc. ... Ordered Amazon & Starbucks gift cards.  A Holiday Card comes with the Amazon gift card, but a personalized message can not be printed on it (only on the invoice).  However, for the Starbucks gift card, you can pay extra to add a Holiday Card with a personalized message.  Expected Delivery for both cards is now 2-3 days beyond the 'original' expected delivery date (likely due to UPS issues reported in National News for Holidays).  SUMMARY: This service allows you to select a gift card and ship it to the address of the person receiving the gift.  However, it is inconsistent in allowing a personal message to be added to a Holiday Card.  Problematic delivery may be due to UPS problems BUT to be sure read product & seller reviews to confirm delivery performance.  If you want to personalize a Holiday or Birthday card to be sent with your gift card, you may be better served buying a gift card and Holiday Card locally and using an expedited shipping method.",2.0

I like many others who have reviewed this service over the years have had this same issue. If you intend to order any gift cards from ACI I would not rely on them to print the greeting card for you.",2.0

Received the very next day which was nice but the packaging was sliced and torn open. It came in an oversize bubble manila envelope. It appears that UPS sliced the envelope then torn it a bit to check to see if the product was damaged.

I am sad that the deliverer did not report this damaged and have it replaced.,2.0

It finally did arrive on December 7th (three days late) in a large envelope that could have been used to ship a book.  Does Amazon really need to use a giant envelope to ship a little gift card?  That is just a waste of paper.  Also, I wrote a message for the card that was not included in the card.  Instead, I received the gift card inside a blank card.  Don't give the option to write a personal message if it's not going to be used.

The card arrived bent and dirty but with no sign on the outside of the package indicating a problem in the mail.

I had also written a message for the inside of the card.  I must have misunderstood, but I expected the message to be printed on the card.  It wasn't.

Unfortunately, the message appeared to have gone missing. When I ordered the gift card, the order details included the message, but between then and now, the message disappeared from the card.

"I could have picked up an amazon gift card at any local retailer but ordered this specifically because I wanted the cute matching birthday card (unavailable at the same local retailers) for a little girl.

They're easy enough to get anywhere and always a hit.",2.0

Thank you for considering adding this convenience.",2.0
"I was excited to send a birthday card with an amazon card for purchase of whatever, and the fact that I got next day delivery for free did it for me.  However, Amazon had some mess up on their end and instead of taking one day to deliver it was 4 days.  Also, the personal message I wrote to have added somehow never got added.  So, he got a blank birthday card with a gift card in it, four days later.",2.0

Refund was supposed to be to my cc (never happened).  I was told to reorder which I did (again with free overnight shipping).  They did arrive as promised (which is why I didn't rate it one star).  On Christmas, I found out that my original gift card order was refunded as a gift card (one for the total amount of the two) and mailed to the shipping recipient (my Mom) instead of to me.  Thank goodness she was confused by the gift card and brought it to me to look at.  What a screw up!",2.0

When I called they said they would send out three more. When the new cards came, they were identical. I called back and then was told that the cards don't come with a message , that I was to cut out the message on the plain piece of paper they sent me and then stuck in the card. Why would I do that when I could personally right it on the card myself!! VERY DISAPOINTING!!!",2.0
"The card would be fine if delivered. Ordered 9 days before Christmas, shipped 7 days before Christmas, still ""out for delivery"" 2 days after Christmas. Next time I'll use email.

You really need to clean up your act - this is annoying for both the giver and the receiver!",2.0

Transferred my info over to the ""gift card dept"" and they will get back to me in 24 hours.
Not really sure how a gift card would be inactive when I purchased it directly from the Amazon site.  But one positive is the fast shipping.  It came in less than 24 hours.",2.0

I personally find the Happy Holiday greeting very disrespectful since it takes away the true meaning of Christmas.",2.0

I ordered four gift cards.  This one was missing from my original order.  Amazon sent me a replacement for the missing card.  This one arrived in a bent/folded envelope and it was missing any personalized notes that I ordered from the original.  The original order had three gift cards come delivered but none included the personalized notes.  Sloppy work all the way around.,2.0
The gift card in a holiday is a great idea but the envelope that was sent with the card was sealed so to it could not be used to put the card in. Had to find alternative envelope to fit the card to it could be given as a gift.,2.0

I ordered 13 cards for my nieces and nephews who live all over the country and I wanted to add a hand written note to each card before mailing them out. Next year I'll just give them cash or gift cards that I don't have to order online. This is so wrong especially since I did 95% of my holiday shopping this year (almost $2000!) on Amazon and I've got a Prime membership on top of that. This is the first problem I've had with Amazon ever, but it just might cause me to shop elsewhere for gifts from now on!",2.0

"First of all, its a gift card, so obviously it is going to work and the recipient will be able to buy wonderful things with it.

"I ordered two Christmas gift cards from the website purposely because they are supposed to come inside a card with a matching design on the gift card itself. I felt that by doing this it would show the recipient that I had put some thought into this gift rather than picking up a plain Amazon card at the grocery store on a whim. However, what I received inside the greeting cards were NOT gift cards with cute pictures to match the card design, they were instead the plain ugly black ones I could've bought at Kroger after all. I am very disappointed; I feel like it's false advertising or bait-and-switch.",2.0
Ordered a HOLIDAY Gift card and was very disappointed that it was just the black A card instead of Snowboarding Snowman.,2.0

"I called twice this morning and finally did reach Alberto. He was very nice in trying to help me unitl i got hung up on again. My PERSONALIZED gift cards came sealed with no name on the outside envelope and NO reference number on the enclosed on the enclosed receipt. I was told that i did NOT personalize my cards until i read him the inscription that came included
 printed on the paper receipt with my package,.

I will now have to rip open the envelopes to ensure the correct card gets to the correct person. I would recommend that in the future if there are multiple personalized cards that you do not, in fact, seal the envelopes beforehand.
Can you please just send me three new envelopes.

I'm supposed to cut these out and stick them in the envelope?  I'm awarding someone...I want them to receive a nice presentation not a kindergarten cut out option.  Second, the printing of the gift note has a long blank streak running through the text on all 3 notes- again really unprofessional that absolutely looks like it was printed off a warehouse workers device.  If you are going to offer a note option, the note should have been printed ON the folding card either on the front interior or below the gift card itself.

I can walk to a store and buy a gift card in less time then the transaction took online. Eventually the transaction completed the next day.

"Amazon duplicated my order but then reversed what I thought was the duplicate order.  Instead they reversed the original order, which is the gift card I gave as a gift.  Recently when the recipient tried to use it they were told the card had been cancelled.  I gave the original cards I received as the gifts because I thought the duplicates would be the ones that would have been cancelled, and I did not check them before gifting due to a label that had to be removed.  This has been a great inconvenience me and I will probably not order Amazon gift cards in the future.  I love shopping on Amazon and the deals available there.  However, in the future I think cash is the better choice for a gift so as the person receiving the gift is not inconvenienced. I do have the other cards but have not had a chance to give them to the recipients to see if those ones work.  I will definitely let you know if they do not work, as I did pay for two gift cards.",2.0

"For some reason I don't understand, this boxed gift card took many days to be delivered, and when the recipient tried to use it, one of the numbers was lost when the activation tape was removed.  They tried to get help over the phone, but the customer service rep was much less than helpful.  He was non communicative, not quite, but nearly rude, and took a very long time, with voiceless poises, not explaining what he was doing.  On more than one occasion, my recipient was unsure if the call had been cut off.  Finally, after nearly half an hour, they were able, by trial and error, to guess what the missing digit was and activate the money.  Is this from a third party selling Amazon cards?  We are Prime members, so I was amazed that something as simple as a boxed gift card would take many days to arrive.  This is very unsatisfactory.",2.0

Have always been pleased with Amazon, but this has been very disappointing.  It is very embarrassing to give a gift card that does not work and then still have not credit on the account.

That feeling was soon taken away as my sons card was cancelled.  I then called again and they told me they would give me a credit on it.....still waiting.

"I received a gift card from my daughter for Christmas.  Later, with certain items in mind I placed an order which became complicated, because I wanted to combine two items together for economy in shipping.  The result was that each item was separately assigned for shipping, so I could not take advantage of free shipping with orders totaling more than $50.  Furthermore, I was informed that, if I failed to use my gift amount at that moment, the gift amount would be reduced by $10.

I was frustrated to the extent that I contacted Amazon to cancel both orders, but one arrived anyway.  I was told to return it unopened, which I did, and eventually I find that my original gift from my daughter has been credited to my account, and I am now awaiting to use it.

The entire episode was fraught with confusion, but ultimately I still have the gift amount awaiting my use.  The problem was trying to combine two orders into one delivery.

Gift Cards are the truly personal gift.  My only problem is after I received it and could have given it away as a gift I got an email from Amazon - whoops we forgot to activate your card.  Be sure your card is good before giving as a gift.  Amazon is very good about notifying and doing refunds but this could leave a procrastinator in the lurch with a bad gift which really will be good when Amazon knows the problem.

"I normally order the e-mail Amazon gift codes, which I've never had a problem with, but when my wife and I wanted to give an end of the school year gift to my sons' teachers, I ordered two $100 gift cards so she could give them to the teachers on the last day of school.  They were surprised and thrilled to receive them.

Well, fast forward to the first week of the new school year.  The teachers from last year, embarassed to have to approach my wife about it, told her that the gift cards were EMPTY and didn't work.  Humiliating for us as parents after having thought we did a good deed.

We were worried about getting a refund or replacement because of three months that had passed while school was out for the summer.  I used Amazon chat support, and was pleasantly surprised that they offered to refund the amounts with no hassles.  We didn't even have to recite back the codes or send the cards back (we had asked for them back from the teachers for this purpose)

Conclusion:  Think twice about ordering these, and consider the Amazon E-Codes as a better option.  1 star for complete product failure, and 5 stars for great customer support, averaged out and rounded up gives this transaction three stars.",3.0

"I intended giving my son a Kindle Fire for his birthday. I bought the Fire and created a seperate account for his Fire (I don't want him charging my credit card directly). I attached a gift card to the account and then registered the Kindle to that account. I verified that everything worked. I was able to get free books, and free music. Then I tried to get the daily free app and recieved an error message saying I needed to have a credit card attached to account to buy apps.

Thinking that couldn't be true I contacted Amazon customer support. After 45 minutes on the phone they confirmed that you can not purchase Kindle Fire Apps (even free ones) using a gift card. You must have credit card attached to the account to purchase apps.

In other words, gift cards can't be used like credit cards or cash. There are things you can't buy with them on Amazon.

Other than this issue, I'm happy with the Kindle Fire. However, since apps are one of the key kid features on the Fire, I can't help but wonder if it makes sense to gift it to anyone who doesn't have a credit card.",3.0

Well only thing I would like to mention is that, when I buy a gift card, it would be great if in the order the gift card number is available and the shipping is made optional.

"Two years ago I bought a $50 gift certificate to give my sister.  I figured on Amazon she could find something that she'd like and I would not make a bad purchase thus disappointing her.  My sister didn't have an Amazon account so had to open one before she tried to purchase something.  At that time everything that she added to her cart could not be purchased because it was either not offered directly through Amazon or it was not qualified for another reason.  My sister told me of her problems and I told her to not worry to just give me the code and I would give her $50 to use on whatever she wanted.  When I tried to apply the code to my account, I discovered it was already used.  I ended up having to use my sister's account to make a purchase for myself with the $50 gift certificate.  When you apply a gift certificate (even if you don't even use it because your order was not successful!) the gift certificate amount is *fixed* to your account.  Therefore, you cannot remove it and give it to someone else.  It created a big hassle for me.  Make sure that the person you are giving it to will be able to buy something s/he wants.

We fully accept that the initial mistake was ours but could not figure out why after phone calls explaining our dilemma someone at Amazon could not have advised us that they would take the necessary steps to right our wrong.
Sincerely yours

"OK, this is great and convenient if you are only doing a few.  I was trying to help my recently widowed mom do ones for eight people - two days before Christmas.  When we tried to do more than three, it cut us off, saying the rest would be held.  So instead we had to run out to the store and get some of the (yawn) black gift cards.

I believe a roll-over javascript type notice, or some other notification of delivery options, early on in the ordering process would be helpful.  As it was, I had to print out the card and hand it to her, which of course delayed the delivery of her gift beyond Mother's Day.

"Words alone can only approach the beautiful perfection represented in this untouchable work of art, which you can also customize to tell jokes about farts. Giving it as a gift to another exposes your very soul; it is proof of affection, of trust and love, and a reminder to buy printer ink later because the colors are clearly off in the bottom half. Giving it to yourself is the fulfillment of a promise, the ultimate expression of self worth, a roundabout means of buying new headphones and a paperback novel. Nothing can surpass this gift, except possibly another gift card for more money. If only all the world could have this last-minute gift that you print before the party because you forgot to buy something; if only every child could wake up on Christmas to a single sheet of paper that shows, in dollars, how much their parents love them. We don't yet live in that world, but the existence of this divine gift card may yet be the herald of its coming.",3.0

"This was a present for.a friend's daughter, age 13. Since she's a minor who didn't have an amazon acct or a credit card getting everything set up so she could actually buy something took us a while.

"The sending of the gift card was fine. Once connected to Amazon.com (ie USA) it was easy to send. Hence 3 stars.
However getting to Amazon.com was not easy and getting back was extremely difficult. And whilst in Amazon.com I could not access any of my downloaded books. There is no option to choose Amazon.com.au (ie AUS) in the USA return choices. The chat session to assist took 2+ hours, seven contact people and each required me to verify myself again. Hence an overall ranking of one star.
My opinion is that Amazon.com.au offer a second rate service to Australians as they only offer a subset of what Amazon USA offers. Time to improve the AUS site.

I will not send an Amazon gift voucher again until it is available in AUS.

"It's a gift card. What else could be said? I have two reward credit cards. Both send out a gift card after spending a certain amount. I mention this as the only way I have found to use these gift cards at Amazon is to purchase Amazon gift cards using the gift cards sent by the credit card companies for rewards. Confusing isn't it. The first time I went to use these reward gift cards to purchase an item here I was told the reward gift cards weren't recognized. The second time I tried I got the same result. No other explanation. A quick call to customer service and the explanation that you can't use a rewards card to purchase anything other than a Amazon gift card. This it seems is also the case when someone gives you a Visa, Master Card and American Express gift card. With the size of Amazon's computer systems you would think they could figure a way to accept gift cards for anything other than another gift card. Next time little Timmy or Suzi gives you a major credit card remember that if you want to use it at Amazon, you have no choice other than buying a Amazon gift card. For you folks who are purchasing a gift card from one of the major credit card companies, just purchase a Amazon gift card. Could that be the method for this madness?",3.0

Hank is your stand-up all-around good guy and a district attorney.  Delilah is the woman he falls in love with and of course, a bank robber.  That doesnt stop the intense attraction the two feel.
I really loved the back stories on the characters and how it impacts them throughout their lives.  Their love story is adorable and complicated.  They manage to work through it to be together, but not without interference's from family, friends, the devil and of course, some poisoned root beer.
I really enjoyed the story, but I have two issues with it. One, the title  it almost seems off-putting.  Once you find out why the title is what it is, it makes sense, but its not a typical contemporary romance title, but then again, this isn't your typical contemporary romance.  The second thing that made me more confused than anything, were the multiple names the characters had, along with the voluminous amount of characters in general.  Again, it made sense for the story, but that definitely did not help me get less confused at certain points in the book!  Overall, the book is funny and sweet and well worth your time.

The gift card thing is a great idea - however you need to find a way to make sure that they are sent to the recipient and not delivered  in their spam or junk mail- I sent 3 out for valentines day and had to resend because all of the recipients said they never got them - after the second time I sent - they all found them in their spam . This was supposed to be a surprise- and I had to tell them all to check spam - they all do business with amazon but the email sender does not say amazon - therefore winding up in spam-,3.0

"These are always usable and make great gifts.  In fact, it is because my son gave me some Amazon gift cards that I started using Amazon.  The only drawback is that If I have a gift card (from someone else) and I decide to purchase a gift for someone, the item I purchase is automatically applied to the gift card that I received.  NOT GOOD. I consider gifts to me as gifts.  I do not want my gifts applied to a purchase I make for someone else.

"The gift card is a great idea because it's easy and fast plus my daughter specifically requested it as a birthday gift.  When ordering the card, there is an option to link to Facebook and have a birthday greeting appear on the recipient's home page.  In my case, it never worked so I abandoned that idea after multiple tries.  I then proceeded to order the card and have Amazon send an email message.  That failed too.  I received a reply stating the email was sent to my daughter so I thought all was well until my daughter let me know she never received the email.  I then called Amazon and had them resend the email and it went through right away. I'm really pleased with the ease of getting this resolved but this was special so it was kind of a let down when it didn't work properly.",3.0

This is NOT one of Amazon's better deals.  It isn't about money: I have an account with Amazon.  It isn't about the Email, she has one E-dress and hasn't changed it in years.
What it IS about is Amazon dropped the ball on this one; what should be a simple all computer transfer of $$ turned into a series of questions and address checks and finally a re-sending of the
card.

She got the card.  Next time I'll order the card a MONTH in advance so Amazon can get it to the recipient only a day late instead of two.

I got one from my mom also and I thought it was a duplicate."" I had to resend.

I didn't like asking, but good thing I did!

I should have been alerted to this glich when my daughter-in-law asked if I received one she sent me.

She lives in Hungary and would have to purchase from either Amazon, UK or Amazon, Germany. This presented a problem because there are a lot of items that neither will ship to Hungary even though they're all supposed to play nice as all 3 are in the EU.

Please adjust to the worlds time zones - you have three in your own country, so shouldn't be too hard.

"The card is a great way of giving money for someone to use in their Amazon site but as I have a Amazon UK acct and the recipient was Greek and used the US Amazon site for Greeks, it fell victim to the stupid region rules that make being global impossible for those who wish to purchase goods legally but hit walls everywhere.
What I really wanted to do was buy a book for a friend but because the book was available on the UK site, I wasn't allowed to give it as a gift. I had to buy a gift card only. This seems stupid to me.
Also, because I sent it to an email account that wasn't the one they used for Amazon, they had to create a new Amazon account for the new email address to use the gift card. Crazy.
Here's an idea. Allow customers to buy a book in their region and give it to anyone they choose in any region on the planet. How could anyone say this is not fair to the authors, publishers, Amazon, me and the gift recipient?",3.0

If you use it to purchase an item or items that cost more than $25, then you have to provide an additional funding source - I don't think that they take bitcoin or Icelandic Krona though (can someone research that for us?)
If you lose the card, like some do, then you are out $25. I think that it is easier to lose this card than to lose cash.
Also, sometimes your Amazon purchases are taxed so the Govt gets some of your gift card. I wonder what the Govt does with that tax?  Hopefully they are buying more weapons.",3.0

The good news:  In addition to being practical gifts, the transaction was very easy.  I ordered the physical gift cards online, and although the website indicated free shipping with 24-hour delivery, I was skeptical.  Yet even placing the order at 3:00 in the afternoon, the cards arrived in the mail the following day.
The bad news: The website allows you to enter text for the greeting card, and even reminds you to enter the names of the recipient and sender.  I entered the text, but omitted the names of the recipients and my name because I was ordering them in bulk, and wanted to personally sign the card.  First surprise was that when the cards arrived, they were in individual SEALED envelopes, so I couldn't sign the card.  I later found out from the recipients that the text I submitted to be included in the greeting card was completely omitted.

However, the gift card came with a very nice card and envelope for you if you don't have one for this gift.  Also, the thin cardboard packaging was very discrete.

In spite of this, I would recommend this product.",4.0
"Wilton always makes a good product, that's why I felt comfortable purchasing the wedding card holder.

"I had ordered over $200.00 of Regal movie cards to use for my nieces and nephews towards their Christmas gifts.  I had ordered in enough time, that I should have received them at least the week of Christmas.

I received the cards the week after Christmas....which with the ""ease"" of ordering on line.... I still had to park in a paid parking lot, stand on the movie theater line and purchase movie cards that I needed for the holiday gifts BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

Very disappointing service with Amazon.

The Regal cards themselves I have always used in the past, normally purchasing directly from the theaters..... seems like the way to go!",4.0

"The printable gift cards are fantastic.  They've saved me many times when I've had no idea what to purchase for the person.  The only reason I gave it a four star instead of five star rating was because often when printing the colors are VERY different than shown.  I've checked my printer and know the problem isn't there.  Most of the time it isn't an issue, but my friend Scott did give me a funny look when his card was all pinks, knowing I care very little for the color.  So print on.  It will be appreciated by all.",4.0
Great way to create a gift quickly.,4.0
"Short of time and short on ideas  I remembered my son in law was reading more and more on the iPad Kindle  App and logged on to Amazon for ideas.

"It's never as personal a gift to receive a gift certificate except that if you are one who prefers to buy your own presents. That's precisely why I purchased a $100 gift certificate for a close friend who has an specific interests in specific hobby areas. As a woodturner, no one would know precisely what tool I would want to purchase and interestingly enough I can find almost everything in that area on Amazon.com and usually at a reduced rate. So in this case, I found that purchasing a gift certificate from Amazon would be the ideal gift for this friend who has so many interests that for me to arbitrarily make a decision as to what to purchase for her could only cause her (and me indirectly) head aches. Needless to say, she was extremely happy to receive this gift certificate and she used it to purchase something that I would never had guessed that she would like. She found the item right away on Amazon. I personally have found that if I search Amazon for a particular item, that they rarely don't carry, they do provide alternate locations to look for that particular item. Now that's nice!

"Printed this on heavier cardstock that we happened to have in the office and made a nice card in minutes. Wish the item page would have shown a template so I'd know what to expect before purchase though. I was actually expecting the card to just take one fold so it would look more like a standard card versus the four fold in the final product that creates a small card.

Also it would be great if the template had an option to not show the $ amount and just the code for gift considerations.",4.0

After finally getting it linked to her account all her purchases will be deducted from the gift card until the total is exhausted.  It should be more intuitive to link the card to the account.",4.0

My only comment is that I am from Canada so I purchased a Canadian gift card only to find out later the person I was buying it for to buy books, who also lives in Canada, has a US account and it was not transferable to the US account since it was a Canadian gift card.  Too bad.  Had to subsequently buy a US gift card.  Couldn't an exchange rate just be applied to the Canadian gift card and then credit the US account.",4.0

I really liked it - the colors were great along with the picture.  The only thing that I would change is to have an option of printing and folding a 8.5 x 11 paper into the four sides or what I would like is have it print front to back so that it could be printed more on cardstock.  This way it would look more professional.,4.0

"Great gift card options. Very flexible and you can email, post on Facebook, print it out - however you like it, which is great.

However, it would be nice if I could know when the gift card has been redeemed. There is no way to know short of asking the person you gave it to, which is not always appropriate.

I don't shop much on-line and I found it to be very easy and did not take much time and I felt safe.,4.0

"The card looked great and was so much more personal than buying one at the grocery store!  One issue I've had with the printable gift cards is my printer leaves off the last couple numbers needed to redeem it.

Worked fine,4.0
It was what i needed,4.0

Easy to print but flimsy on regular paper.  Try printing on card stock for a more durable product.  Instructions good.,4.0
"Gift cards make life easy.  That said, i wish Amazon would consider allowing people to choose whether to use a gift card or pay via another method - we bought these for our children as gifts, and they automatically applied to MY purchases on amazon ( :(  ).  I don't want my kids to have their own accounts, and the gift card balance is automatically applied once it's loaded in the account.  I suppose the workaround is to just not load it until you're ready to use it, but......",4.0

Delivery was within the time frame mentioned - I was just surprised it took as long as it did given I usually do email delivery and it is almost immediate but this time I needed it to be a surprise. In a time crunch in the future I would just do the email delivery to myself and print a confirmation to put in the card or make sure that I order the print card a day in advance. Still always happy with Amazon US!,4.0
They worked and were included in graduation cards.,4.0
"I had no  problem buying the card, but afterwords I was told I would get an e-mail with all the information on it to download and print the card. I waited three days and never received the e-mail.

To this day I have never received the e-mail telling me how to get my gift card. I am fairly computer literate so it was not much of a problem for me to find out how to download, but to someone with lesser skills it could be a problem. So let the consumer beware.",4.0

"The Amazon gift card is a great idea.  The recipient can get just about anything they would like.  It is especially great for Kindle users.  My complaint was with the ordering process.  I had ordered the printable version.  After ordering, my gift card wouldn't download.  Had to talk with customer service, and he couldn't download it either.  His suggestion was to have the gift card mailed.  The next day, I received an e-mail stating that the gift card couldn't be converted from the printable version to the mailed version.  So I had to delete the printable version and reorder except it wouldn't let me delete.  Again I had to talk to customer service for them to delete and reorder.  I eventually got a gift card mailed but something I thought would be fast and easy, took hours!!!",4.0

The fact that you had a choice of printing the card with your message or emailing -[or both if you wish] was a big plus for me. It WAS last minute, believe me. A tad disappointing was the limited choice of images for the front of the card, not too much of a prob that it would deter me recommending to family and friends. Hence the 4 star, it would have been 4 and a half but you can't do that.",4.0

"A quick and easy and inexpensive way to send a gift to someone living in another country.  It is also easy for them to use, to buy the things they want on line, that are not available in the country they are in.",4.0

I like to give Amazon gift cards but having the recipient notified by email isn't always practical or appropriate.  Being able to print them out and give them to people was very convenient.,4.0
"The print at home gift card is easy and convenient to use. You just buy it and print it to your computer. It even shows you how to fold it, so you get a nice looking card. It's perfect forgiving to people who don't have or don't check email.

As with all the online amazon gift cards, you can add a special message to whomever you're giving it to and choose your design. My one disappointment was the lack of design choices in the print out gift cards. More designs would be nicer, however they have something for just about every occasion.",4.0
Made a nice gift card.,4.0
"Great way to give or get a gift, however I would caution people to save their card receipt.  I loaded a $30.00 gift card (or should I say, thought I did) and did not keep the card.  Then when I went to use it, it kept saying it was a negative balance and pulled from my credit card.  I tried every trick in the book.  But because I no longer had the gift card I was out a $30.00 gift.",4.0
"Could not think of a better gift for a book lover.  Allows the recipient to enjoy, firstly browsing a most comprehensive list of books and authors, and then the second joy of reading much coveted titles.

Wish the cover of the gift card did not come out with kindle on it though.  I thought I clicked on an alternative but it still came out saying amazon kindle gift card.

Personally I am a kindle fan, but our daughter is not.

This is a great gift.  Just watch for the cover though.",4.0

"It allowed me to write a message to the person I was giving it to, so even if it got separated from the card at a large celebration, she knew who it was from and what I was recommending for her to try next.",4.0
"I like the Amazon gift cards because I don't have to go running around looking for gifts at my age also, the people I gave them to enjoy them for their kindles, I pads, or gifts they can buy from Amazon. Easy, convenient and the people I buy them for love them.",4.0
love this set.  ONLY complaint is markings are not easy to read without my . glasses. However  the two other people I gave this to as gifts do not have this problem.  Perhaps the blue set offers a contrast of colors between markings and background......the white set is white on white ma r kings.  Otherwise this is a perfect set .  LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS.,4.0

"Amazon Gift Cards are a great gift for a lot of different occasions.  Since most people use Amazon for something, and you can use the gift cards on almost everything, they are useful for a lot of people.  It's extremely easy to buy a gift card.  You get a few different ways to deliver your gift including printing a physical card and emailing it to the recipient.  The reason I only gave them 4 stars is that when emailing a gift card you can specify the date you would like it to be delivered, but you cannot specify the time on that day.  This made me have to print the gift card instead of emailing it because I didn't want it delivered too early.  Printing the gift card was extremely easy and makes a decent looking card.  Overall these are a great gift choice.",4.0
