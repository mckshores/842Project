"I bought two of these 8.5 fl oz hand cream, and neither of the dispensers work.  The hand cream is wonderful, but very thick, so I don't see I can get much out by shaking it out, since the dispensers seem to be non-operable.",2.0
So sorry that they changed the formula.  This was a 5-star item before they changed the ingredients.  It's just an okay product now...not worth the extra money it costs.  It's expensive.,2.0
Tiny tube for the money. Thought it was a larager tube.,2.0
I had hope given the rave reviews but this didn't do anything for me. I have used the whole tube and my hands are still in really bad shape.,2.0
Very average.,2.0
"Bought it during prime day because the price was great. But it smells like men's shaving cream, not good for women's hands. If you're a guy and want to smell like a strong shaving cream go for this scent.",2.0
I usually love this stuff but something is a little off about the scent of this bottle.  Pretty expensive to be disappointed!,2.0
Not crazy about this. My hands actually feel drier after using this. Very disappointed.,2.0
"I love this hand cream; but, when I received the package I thought it was a sample!!!!  From the picture it looks like the full size tube; but, it is not close.  You might get 2 or 3 used from a tube.  Not worth the money.",2.0
"horrible smell for me, at least.",2.0
"Purchased this as a gift and the bottle came with 1 very large dent, and 5 smaller dents.  Unfortunately I had to keep it myself for it was not fit to give as a gift.  Just ok lotion.  Very strong smelling.",2.0
"The cream was as expected but the can came with a dent in it, presumably from shipping, but it was disappointing since it was a gift.",2.0
"I did not like the condition of this product that was sent to me
It was wet and badly damaged by the spills from the liquid mouthrinse.
It smelt very bad and the box appeared very old and used, not new at all.",2.0
The powder is good if you feel like stirring. In this case the powder was old and chunky.,2.0
"I used this for two months, with and without the accelerator.  The toothpaste was effective at removing mild stains but was no more effective than other ""whitening"" toothpastes I have tried that can be purchased at discount stores for 1/4 to 1/10 the cost. It did not ""whiten"" my teeth to any significant degree and did not seem to impact significant stains. The accelerator had no  added benefit. This stuff is just way too expensive to be delivering results on par with much less expensive toothpastes.",2.0
"From reading previous reviews, I thought this toothpaste would actually make my teeth white.  It didn't.  It made them a little bit cleaner and they do look a little better, but now I'm also considering to use whitening strips because I KNOW those make a difference to your teeth.",2.0
"Not impressed, in my opinion this is just average whitening toothpaste. Over the counter whitening  toothpaste does the same job for a lot less money.",2.0
"Love the product but hate the price. You can get 8 ounce Supersmile toothpaste and accelerator for less than half the price of 4 ounce sizes on Amazon. Sorry for the 2 stars, but you need to see this before spending so much here.",2.0
I'm a smoker and this toothpaste did not whiten my teeth...my mouth feels clean and fresh but the whitening power fails.,2.0
May work for you - did not work for me. Way over-priced. My said dentist said it is a bad value.,2.0
Not much different than toothpaste after a month of use.,2.0
Have used almost one full tube.  I just don't see any demonstrable results (whitening).  Could buy 5 tubes of Colgate whitening toothpasr for the same money.,2.0
"The problem here is the packaging.  The product works and I like it (no you do not get neon white, but you do get whiter teeth) but unfortunately the tubes split open at the bottom, I have tried some of the clips available but I still always ending up wasting quite a bit.  I was on my second tube with no problems and ordered a third, when I was ready to use it, it was more than 30 days old.  Amazon normally does not help after 30 days, but in this case they did, but said it was the last time.  Consequently I tested it for a couple of days to be sure it would not split open then went back to finish my last tube.  Then I went back to the tube that tested, within a couple of days the bottom split open.  This tube seems to be a softer consistency which should help, but it does not, it still splits open.  The paste tends to harden and I end up wasting too much to make it worth it.  I did call the manufacturer and they said they could do nothing I had to go back to where I purchased the product.  I hope they solve this problem, but until then, it is not worth it.",2.0
"Warning, after a few seconds of nice apple flavor there comes a sharp ""spice"", is the best way to describe it.  Maybe it's a chemical reaction for the whitening, but it is strong and unexpected.
Toothpaste also leaves quite a thick pasty coating on tongue.",2.0
Does not work well,2.0
Doesn't work,2.0
It does not whiten teeth as described on a TV Infomercial.  I will never purchase it again!!,2.0
"For the price you are MUCH better off buying Crest 3D White or other drugstore whitening products. This didn't work for me at all. It did leave my teeth feeling very slippery and clean, but didn't do much for the whiteness. If anything my teeth dulled after a month because it was a month without using my Crest 3D white toothpaste!",2.0
Doesn't work used whole tub as instructed.,2.0
Meh... Didn't notice any results.,2.0
"This is a big waste of money.  just like other products out there, it does not work AT ALL.  Save your money.  Or try Himalayan brand whitening, it did more than any other kind i've tried.",2.0
Another enhance my good looks scam.  The quantity in the tube is small and ordering add'l. supplies expensive.  Being encouraged to have this automatically purchased and sent at intervals is a sure way to waste money.,2.0
"The flavor is great, and as far as toothpaste goes I think it does a fine job. That said, it does not whiten. It may help maintain a professional whitening longer. Not a product I would buy again. A few off-the-shelf toothpastes do just as good a job less expensively.",2.0
"After I purchased this product, I realized it contained parabens.  I do not use any products that do.  I also read an article about toothpaste that is too abrasive.  This one isn't too bad, but I wish they would remove the parabens.",2.0
"My husband has been using this twice a day, for several weeks.  We see no improvement on his beige teeth.  He doesn't smoke, or drink alochol, yet his teeth are beige.  I was really hoping this toothpaste would work, based on all the reviews.  We're not impressed so far, but he will continue to use it until the tube is gone.",2.0
"This was an expensive experiment, that turned into a failure.  I am a wine/tea/coffee drinker and chronic blueberry smoothie consumer, so my teeth could use some lightening and brightening.  I used this toothpaste exclusively for the past 6 months (with a sonicare) and exactly as directed (with a dry toothbrush) and noticed no change whatsoever.  It functions as toothpaste, in that it cleaned my teeth, but they are definitely not any whiter than when I started.",2.0
"This product seemed to work... but only if you DON'T drink wine or coffee or smoke again EVER!.

My teeth looked whiter, literally... but then seemed more susceptible to staining... and got worse and worse...

It was totally weird. I will never buy this product again.

I'll stick with my Neways/Modere more natural stuff.",2.0
"I'm not sure why this didn't work for me.  With all the positive reviews I was hopeful, but unfortunately it wasn't what I expected.",2.0
"I didn't notice an appreciable difference in my teeth.  They were not brighter and the stains are still there.  But again, maybe it is because I have years and years of stains.",2.0
"I brushed with Supersmile for 2 weeks and saw no difference in the brightness of my teeth.  By comparison, I recently purchased Sensodyne Pro-Enamel with Whitening.  It shows a difference with a much lower price.  I will not purchase Supersmile again.",2.0
"Finished using a whole tube and hence writing this review now. I've used it just as the manual mentioned. Use a dime size and brush twice a day. Haven't noticed a huge difference in spite of using it regularly for 3 months.

I do not smoke or have coffee so I assume it should've worked well.

Since it did not make any difference for me I would refrain from recommending this product to users here. Not worth the money.",2.0
"I don't believe this toothpaste is better than other commercial toothpaste product. It cost quite a bit more as well.

I tried it because of the hype I was hearing. Even with the ""accelerator"", I haven't noticed any difference.

The green apple flavor is just plain nasty in my opinion.",2.0
"I hate to say this but I found no difference in the effects of this toothpaste than other paste I've used. Yes, it did help whiten my natural and bonded teeth ""a bit"", but not significantly enough for me to say that it was a good investment. I will not be purchasing this product again. Sorry",2.0
"Two stars because it is lotion and also my fault for not checking the ingredients list before purchasing. If you want this level of moisture, aka water, jojoba, and silicones to make you temporarily feel like your skin has been done right, save yourself some cash and go to the dollar store or Target for some Suave. The top scent in this is from mandarin essential oil which, in case you didn't know, is not a mint. I'm baffled that people are saying they've found this at high-end department stores, it doesn't provide decent moisture, doesn't deliver on the advertised fragrance, and contains 0 nutrients/vitamins for skin health in any relevant capacity. Boo, this lotion.",2.0
The bottle is a lot smaller than the one l bought in 1999 but same price. It doesn't seem to smell as good or last as long.,2.0
"Smells great. For the price, I am disappointed. The cologne does not hang around long. The less expensive Cool Water last for hours.",2.0
initial smell is good but doesnt last more than couple hours,2.0
too pricey  !!!,2.0
"Thought I'd try this because of the product hype; purity, unity, fresh, clean and contemporary and can be used lavishly.  Smelled nice at first then over the day it got cloying. Glad I didn't pile it on.

For over 53 years I have been using Aqua de Silva because it was the only cologne that does not make me nauseous after a few hours.  Off and on I have tried different colognes but stuck with Aqua de Silva.  I do get a lot of compliments on it so I guess it's mine forever.  One other cologne passed the test: Imperiale by Guerlain but I prefer the smell of Aqua de Silva.",2.0
Was okay. Nothing special. Would not purchase again.,2.0
"As other reviewers have noted, there's no antiperspirant here. The scent is fantastic, but it doesn't last all day and it won't stop you from sweating. So it's not really worth it.",2.0
This deodorant has a very good smell and also looks real nice.  I just wish it would work as an antiperspirant!,2.0
"Tried this recently at Macy's. It had great smell for a small amount sprayed. The one bought from amazon is very diluted so you can hardly smell the fragrance, even if you spray a lot of it on. Amazon delivered the item as expected and on time but I  too was disappointed with the product. I suggest you buy this  item off the shelf at a department store such as Macy's, JC Penney, etc.",2.0
too sticky easy sweat not smell good. I and my husband used the DKNA the smell very good and last longer then this one,2.0
"I like the product but, it will not work after 2-3 hours. Is it original ????? I guess no
I will not recommend this because it costs more for nothig",2.0
"Don't but this product..... unless you're desperate like I was lol
There are so many things wrong with this straightener!
First of all... in the beginning it's okay BUT your hairs will get caught and pulled by the corners and sides of the flat iron. Second, when you use it and close the iron to straighten your hair it doesn't close flat plate against plate. It is uneven and badly made. And lastly, it breaks in literally after 5 uses.
It just starts to get looser and looser and eventually it snaps in half. The screws literally come out.
Don't waste your money on this I've bought better off brand straighteners from Ross and TJ Max!
WORST PRODUCT EVER",2.0
Ordered at the end of March and it burnt out just yesterday (7/14/2014). It didn't even last 6 months and I can't return it or have it replaced.,2.0
"I had the Chi Flatiron from 2005 until earlier this year when it finally died.  Having used the Hot Tools product at a local gym, I liked how it straightened my hair (the temperature settings are great) so I purchased it instead of laying out the $100+ for the authentic Chi.  Well, yesterday before an important meeting, my poor Hot Tools flatiron decided to stop working.  Luckily my hair was almost done (and this thing gets really hot, so I was able to use the plates to sort of finish the front), but I am disappointed in the value of this product.  For me, my money was better spent on the more expensive iron that lasted 8+ years than the less expensive product that lasted just about 6 months.  Sad story, but lesson learned.  Spend the money on the better flatiron (Chi, for me).",2.0
"I ordered this flat iron with high hopes.  I have a Hot Tools curling iron that I LOVE, so I figured this was a no brainer when my old flat iron kicked the bucket.  Unfortunately, I was not impressed.  It arrived from Amazon in the box - but the box was covered with a thick layer of dust, like it had been sitting on a shelf for 15 years.  I tried to ignore that trivial fact & continued to test out my new flat iron.  Here are my observations:

1) It is big & clunky.  I wanted a 1.5 or 2"" flat iron, so I wanted big - but because this is an older model, it is just too big & awkward to use.  It reminded me of my old crimper from 1989.

2)  It feels cheap & like it could fall apart very easily.  I don't know about you, but my flat iron is something that is often an unfortunate victim to being dropped on the bathroom floor.  I am not too sure this Hot Tools flat iron would make it.

3)  It must not be good for thinner hair.  I read almost every review on here & most of them are glowing reviews.  I noticed a trend that most of the good reviews mentioned they have thick hair.  So, in conclusion, I have figured out my unhappiness with it must have something to do with my not-thick hair.  It really just didn't work well.  My hair did not look nearly as smooth as expected.  In fact, it almost looked as if I didn't even use a flat iron.

4)  It made a peculiar buzzing sound when turned on.  I don't know if they all do that, or if I was just blessed with a special one.  But it sounded like it may just unexpectedly blow up.

So, after faithfully trying out this flat iron for a week, I ended up falling back on my old one that perished.  I drove myself to Target & bought the Remington Wet to Dry, & I love it.",2.0
"This is a terrible straightener. It causes extreme breakage, it burns your hair off, your hair lacks movement(frozen) even the wind can't blow out your hair ,  and your hair becomes frizzy in a matter of minutes. I don't recommend  this product for African Americans with virgin hair.",2.0
"I gave it a shot for a while until the small bottle was completely empty, and it just didn't seem to make a difference for me.  The cream feels cool on the skin, which is nice, but overall I didn't notice a change.",2.0
Not great for me. Not a huge fan of the roll on but this had several great reviews so I tried it. It didn't work as well as other antiperspirants I have used in the past. I wanted to try something new because I was having a reaction to other deodorants. I won't purchase again.,2.0
"It didn't help me much, still had sweat issues, stopped using it, too mild I guess,",2.0
"I was hoping this deodorant would fade some of my armpit darkness somewhat, but it didn't. It also took a few minutes to dry after applying and this formula left my armpits super moist in the summer.",2.0
"it didn't work as i expected it to. my underarms are still dark. the bottle says to wait 6 months to see a difference and i used it for 1.5years just to see if i would see a least bit of a difference. i used it correctly, everyday after my shower, and nothing changed. oh and it does NOT work as antiperspirant or deodorant so you might want to use your normal antiperspirant over this if you do decide to purchase it",2.0
My son used it for a month and we have seen no change.,2.0
"I've used this for at least two and I'm not seeing the results I want, maybe it's 10 percent change, that's all.",2.0
"KP Duty works great. But my doctor recommend Ammonium Lactate Lotion 12%, which is over the counter. It works the same for me, at a fraction of the price and twice the size. It's a better deal.",2.0
"I have purchased two large tubes of KP Duty lotion and one large container of scrub. I've used the products as suggested on my toddler girls for over 6 months. Sadly, we did not experience any improvements. The bumps on their arms, thighs and buttocks became inflamed and red after using the scrub and I did not notice a reduction in the bumpy patches. I did however, get soft hands from applying the products to my girls.

We visited the dermatologist last week. He was unfamiliar with this product, but prescribed a compound of 1% hydrocortisone in an acid mantel base with 10% urea. We've used this compound for only a week and we're already seeing a great reduction in bumps.

I would suggest not paying the ridiculous price for this product. The marketing is way better than the product.",2.0
"It helped, it smoothed some areas on my arm, but it does not 100% remove the problem as claimed on the box.",2.0
"This product certainly sells itself on the box, but did not help with my KP at all. It worked great on my feet, but then again, I didn't spend $36 for foot creme. Basically, for me, it was a waste of money which I wish I could get back.",2.0
"This product seemed to have worked for other readers, but I used it for month and about 3/4 of the content and it did not take care of my arm bumps.  I think its still worth a try, but buy it at Sephora since they have a customer satisfaction guarantee (even pass 30 days).",2.0
Did not clean my curling Irons was not pleased with it at all. I gave it my best shoot trying to make it work,2.0
Didn't work well at all.,2.0
I was very happy with this curling iron until it started falling apart. I don't travel so it goes from my counter to the cabinet below and somehow the part on the handle cracked. I've tried all different glues but nothing holds. I'm very disappointed .,2.0
"I bought this curling iron after my other Hot Tools stopped working.  I thought I'd give it another try because I actually liked the way this iron worked.  I use my iron maybe 3 times a week.  I bought this back in 2015.  Well this one broke too, I'm very disappointed.  I won't be buying another one.",2.0
The hardest most difficult curling iron I've ever used,2.0
The handle kept coming unlocked. It was very annoying being burnt that much. I gave it my best shot,2.0
"Unfortunately I couldn't quite get the hang of the marcel iron.  I've been curling my hair for years with the standard spring barrel Hot Tools irons and thought I'd give the fancy marcel iron a try, but unfortunately I burnt myself quite badly on two different occasions so I admitted defeat and sent back this product.  My skin takes a long time to heal from burns and scars easily, so this just wasn't a good fit for clumsy ol' me :(  However, the curling iron gave great results and the curls held in all day, even on my fine hair.",2.0
"I love this iron. My mom and I have used the same iron for over a decade now. However, I've started buying my 1"" iron on Amazon about 3 years ago and do not use the iron all too often. The iron always come perfect, real hot very fast and creates beautiful curls. However I've purchased this same iron at least 3x/year recently because after every few months it doesn't work anymore--doesn't turn on. Very displeased since it's not eligible for return anymore but I don't feel I've gotten to use it enough for it to be worth. Would surely appreciate a replacement.",2.0
"I'm a long (long) time user of curling irons, dryers, hot rollers the whole shabang!  I'm just not coordinated enough for this one.  No spring, no ""cool"" end to hold on to... I'm not talented enough to work this one.  I need easy and quick.",2.0
Don't waste your money,2.0
"It seems very awkward to use, probably my fault as I am not good with hair.  It certainly gets very hot, ad a friend of mine swears by it.",2.0
"If you want accidental burns and subsequent scars from the iron slipping and hitting your arms and shoulders, okay. But this is a professional tool, best left for hair stylists and not someone curling their own hair at home. The handle is awkward and there is no holding spring, so when it slips, it burns your skin.",2.0
"It didn't work for me it was to complicated with the handle turning so, I gave it to my daughter",2.0
"I was disappointed. I have never tried this type of curling iron (the ""Marcel"") and didn't know what it would be like. It is just not easy or comfortable to handle at all. Apart from the awkwardness of that handle, it does curl well.",2.0
Caution to all...this is not an ordinary curling iron. It is extremely hard to use and has no cool tip. Burned my fingers badly the first time I tried to use it.  Just could not get the hang of it without it having the 'spring handle'. I even asked my hairdresser about them and she said she had tried them in the past and never could get the hang of it. Ended up giving it away because I had already thrown out the packaging.,2.0
"It curls, the heat settings are great BUT......it is the MOST awkward reverse clamp to use despite tutorials. I have tendinitis in my hand which makes grasping this handle which opens WAY out of the range a thumb or other digit can grasp it other than the way it is shown in the tutorials and strains my wrist. I have burnt myself numerous times. I wish it simply had a clamp like other curling irons, why the user unfriendly handles??? I wish I didn't buy this. I will purchase something else with a selection of heat settings.",2.0
"I hate writing negative reviews especially on a product of a company I believe in...HOWEVER...I thought this product was going to be my foundational Holy Grail.  After re-reading several times the claims of what it is supposed to do and re-applying exactly as instructed, I saw absolutely no visible difference.  Granted, my pore-problem is arrogantly non-severe and maybe I expected soap opera star skin but this did absolutely nothing for me--but the fragrance? did!  It made me nauseous.  Sorry to rant but to me it smells something like a mix between coppertone sunscreen and cheap deodorant.  I rant yet again:  the packaging:  Pretty lavender metal cannister top but if it pulls away from the actual ribbed plastic liner---forgetaboutit...anyone who's pull the handle off of a nail polish applicator brush will completely relate.  And finally...god forbid your dispenser valve clogs up--prepare to play dodge the spray when it sometimes decides to spurt.  My personal best was a good three feet on the wall behind my vanity.  I really really wanted to like this product but...not for me.  Try it if you must, but I'll stick to Laura Mercier primer.",2.0
This is more of a pink then nude...,2.0
The pictures I saw on Pinterest of Its A Girl were very different. This color on it a bubble gum pink. I was hoping for something a little more nude almost like a pink gel color.,2.0
"I purchased this color because it came up in the transparent polishes. However it is not transparent, but very opaque and not really an attractive color for me.",2.0
Lasts only 3 days after applying two layers. It chips off real fast and gives a damp result. Will not be buying from this brand again.,2.0
yellow color is veryyy pretty and nice tho the bitch smothers and takes hella long to dry like clay on ur nails real heavy,2.0
"Not the usual OPI Nail Lacquer. Usually I buy this because it doesnt chip. But for some reason, the past few times I bought this polish, it is A LOT thinner than normal. It chips in less than a day. But the color is rich. And spreads nicely in a single coat.",2.0
i hate the color just not want i expected at all.,2.0
"I guess I should have realized this would be yellow by having ""chick"" in the polish name. It didn't look that yellow on my phone. It's definitely yellow, not the neutral color I was expecting.",2.0
"I liked the color,very neutral. The polish didn't seem very new because the color separated quickly.",2.0
Not the same logo as all of my other ones. The label at the bottom is a different font and color. Yeah could be a different production lot but it also smells different from the other ones I have. Acetone smell. Two stars because the color is not too bad. A little more red than black (midnight in Moscow) but a good copycat. I wouldnt pay 10.50 for a counterfeit again though.,2.0
I have really fair skin so this color looked weird on me,2.0
I bought OPI Red. The polish was old and thick. Disappointed. Old polish just doesn't go on well. It's thickness indicates the  age and or conditions it's kept. Opi Red is a gorgeous color red.,2.0
"Love the color but thats the only good thing. It took 3 coats to even see the color on my nails but you can still see through it. Takes forever to dry, which sucks since you have to do so many coats. I won't buy OPI again",2.0
"I bought several colors from this seller and they had been wonderful. ""Stop it I'm Blushing!"" however was a bust. The color is much paler in person than in the photo. The finish is also very tacky and peels quickly even when using a base and top polish.",2.0
Used it over a bright polish I bought. You would need 5 coats to cover and not still see your toe nails.,2.0
It wasn't the color I expected. I plugged the item number in even.,2.0
This isn't real opi but a knock off. Color is good but quality is seriously lacking.,2.0
Looks purple,2.0
So disappointed this is obviously a fake. In the picture on the left is the real thing. The color doesn't match. This is my favorite color nail polish so I know what the bottle and color looks like. Def sending back if I'm paying $10 for nail polish,2.0
"This came with what appears to be spilled nail polish all over the outside of the bottle, makes me wonder how old this is and how it is being stored.",2.0
It's too dry. Seems not New.,2.0
"Beautiful color for summer BUT is thick and does not cover well.

Color is actually a more red orange.

It does not hold up.",2.0
not enough sparkle,2.0
not a genuine opi polish.,2.0
Pictured to have purple and blue. Only purple.,2.0
"Color was to pink for my wife, she wanted a more muted color. color was much more pink than in the picture.",2.0
"I normally don't leave reviews but the polish I received was too thick, difficult to apply and most definitely not the color advertised. Color is more of a peachy yellow than nude. I  love Opi polish but not satisfied with this one.",2.0
Not a white white shade,2.0
bottle was not full - won't order from this vendor again.,2.0
Didn't like the color. It seems it's water down and doesn't last more than a day,2.0
"This isn't a comment about the color--that is fine.  But it sort of seemed like I was sent a used bottle of polish.  It was about half way full and seemed thick, like old nail polish.  Bummed.",2.0
Opi is normally my go to polish. Color was great but I must have gotten a bad batch because the polish never hardened or set.  Was disappointed.,2.0
The color is beautiful but it seems like it's old/expired. It's very thick and sticky hence creates a bumpy finish.,2.0
Color is not as expected. Looks like a faded brown. It just looks to faded/ muted.,2.0
Liked the colored....but it dose not hold up well......after 3 days it will chip off,2.0
This polish streaks. I have it away,2.0
"I get pedicures often and this is the color I always pick at the salon.  I decided to buy my own bottle for touch-ups and the occasional at-home mani.  To my dismay, the nail polish I received was not the same color, and it was super thick.  I did a touch up and the color was not a match.  Tossed in the trash.",2.0
"Good color, the product was clumpy and appeared old.  Won't buy again",2.0
"I am very familiar with nail polish brands and am a bit of a nail polish junkie to the point where I paint my nails every other day. I received this OPI bottle in the color ""Tickle My France-y"" and I noticed right off the bat that I had never seen an OPI bottle that was styled the way it was. It did not have the signature two lines between ""Nail Lacquer"" and was missing some of the writing that is included on every single OPI polish that I own. This one stands out right away and looks like a ""ugly cousin"" of all my other OPIs when placed on a rack. On top of that, the sticker on the bottom is very crookedly placed. In my conclusion, the polish looks alright and true to color. I have not tried it yet to see the formula and see if it matches therefore I won't state it is indeed 100% a fake but I will do an update as soon as the fall rolls around and I can use this polish. All I will say is, this is NOT the same bottle every other OPI comes in and that's a huge red flag for me. I believe this product may be fake.",2.0
It did not go on smoothly at all. I put on a base coat and two coats of this and it was still not covering well or smoothly. really suprised since I have always used OPI polish.,2.0
"The texture for each polish is inconsistent. The Gargantuan Green Grape polish is extremely watery and too transparent. It takes multiple layers to get the desired color. Alpine Snow, on the other hand, is VERY thick. It is difficult to spread and has a nasty tendency to cause streaks. Each polish varies wildly in consistency. Order at your own risk.",2.0
"It's a pretty color, but it took 4 coats for it to completely cover.",2.0
Pretty color polish however the hairs on the  brush are bent making application of the polish impossible and messy. so I'm unable to apply it until I find another brush at this point. I am not sure if this is just a quality issue or was it previously used and sold that way.,2.0
This was very thin and did not give any color to my nails. I actually think this product damaged my nails as they all started splitting a few days after.,2.0
I'm not sure this is the real deal. I've never had OPI polish that wore off so quickly. The color is pretty but I won't buy it again.,2.0
"I love this color (don't bossa nova me around), but the package is clearly not original OPI. not sure where this off brand nail polish is coming from.",2.0
"Bought Mod About You here (right side, pink) and the bottle seems to be completely different from the coral one I bought from an OPI store. What am I supposed to think?",2.0
The Princesses Rule color I have been using for years is a sparkly light pink.  What I got this time is a bright hot pink.  The numbers on the bottle are the same.  It can't be returned so be careful.,2.0
wasn't what I expected ...,2.0
I love the color.  I love O.P.I. products - but this one came broken - nail polish was all over the inside of the mailing package.  As much as I love it - I wouldn't spend another $10 to have it come broken again.,2.0
"Unfortunately this is not authentic OPI product. I have purchased this color many times and it is visibly different in the bottle and on my nails. We will see how this product holds up, but I am disappointed that it isn't truly what was advertised.",2.0
"Not the same color.  This used to be a pale pink/beige, now it is almost a pale coral color.  Disappointed that they use the same name, but have totally changed the formula.",2.0
"I have used this color many times at the local nail salon. The polish I received in my Amazon order was thick and had a deeper color, which I believe are signs that the product I received was really old.",2.0
"Opi used to be my go to nail polish, but my last couple of bottles have gone on like molasses even when they were new.  I added thinner -- like you do for old and almost used up bottles -- but still it was thick and uneven.  I wouldn't recommend it or buy it again.

Two stars for a great polish that used to be.",2.0
"Don't get the hype surrounding this brand of nail polish. I put it on my toes and it didn't last three days before showing signs of wear and chips. I usually use a drugstore brand that is a 3rd of the price (cheaper), and that stuff stays put. This is just overpriced and not very durable.",2.0
"OPI Nail Polish was recommended to me, so when I saw that it appeared in a color I wanted, what looked to be a pale lilac-pink, I did not hesitate to purchase it.  Unfortunately, the polish in the bottle I received is poor consistency and goes on clumpy, impossible to get a good finish. It is too thick for more than one coat, and stays tacky for a long time, easily scrapes off. Also the color is not as it looks in the picture. I wanted a blue toned pink; instead the closest accurate name for this color would be ""Calamine Lotion.""

I have seen OPI look very cool in another color on a friend, so I'd guess the brand may make nail polish worth the price, but the bottle I received surely is not. If this particular color were at a six dollar price, I'd chalk it up to a loss. But the few dollars more charged puts in the bracket of ""I'd return it, if that were an option.""",2.0
More like Orange. Was hoping for a softer coral color.,2.0
I actually love the color... but it stained my nails terribly.  It's over a month since I've taken it off and my nails are still green.  I've never had a nail polish do this - with or without a base coat!,2.0
Goes on thick and leave ridges.  Brighter pink than the picture indicates.,2.0
"This was a complete let down.  The polish quality is not bad, but it is one of OPI's more sheer formulas.  My real issue with this polish is that it is actually pink.  Not an obnoxious shade, but definitely leaning towards magenta.  If you are looking for a bright purple for spring and summer this is not the polish for you.",2.0
"Getting increasingly disturbed by the ""quality"" or lack thereof of the OPI line of Nail Polish.  The only thing I have to say about this latest lacquer is:  bubbles.  Doesn't matter if it is resting, doesn't matter how you apply it, you will always get bubbles, even if you wait an hour in between coats.... disappointed but at least this last less than quality product of theirs has given me the push I need to shop elsewhere for polish.  The picture below is using OP Base and Top coats with 2 coats of ""It's a girl"" polish in between.  15 minutes wait after base coat, 45 in between coats and top coat and still....bubble.",2.0
not a genuine product and the colour and application was like a cheap poor formulation,2.0
Does not go on evenly,2.0
Not the same one I bought one from the local store,2.0
"Super transparent and thin, needed to do 3-4 layers before you couldn't see my nail bed through it",2.0
"""You are so Outa Lime"" color OK, poor coverage versus other OPI products, took extra coats and does not go on as even, way more work and polish to get reasonable results",2.0
"It was thick and streaky, which was odd because I bought it at rite aid and it wasn't like that.",2.0
"Eh it's an okay color - pastel yellow, was hoping it would be brighter. I also don't like the fact that I had to paint three coats on my nails to get a solid color. I expect more from OPI.",2.0
The reason I purchased this color in Hawaiian orchid is because I love the color when I had my nails done at the nail salon. I am very upset that the Hawaiian orchid shade is a lot pinker than what it should be.  My toe nails are still in the shade when I had it done at the salon so I can compare the 2 colors.  This one I got through amazon is so much pinker!!!! The one from the salon is like a nude pink color which I love!  Why is the shade so different???,2.0
"OPI polish is the absolute best quality, so when I saw it on Amazon I was super excited. I tried using the see it on feature and thought I found a perfect lavender, however this color is much more pink than it looked in any of the pictures and I'm not a fan. I was expecting a light lavender and I got a weird overly pink color. With two coats, you can see it for yourself in the pictures. I really don't care for it with my skin color, but it can't be returned....  I'll stick to buying it from a store.",2.0
Don't like it.  Just gives slight shiny tint. Almost no color.,2.0
the color is a bit lighter than expected and blends a little too much with a fair skin tone. makes it look like i have weirdly long fingers with no nails.,2.0
Too stiff,2.0
"I have the opposite problem as everyone else with the color.
I have been using this color at my local nail salon for over a year and was used to it being mint.
I saw people buying it from here had received a mint color.
Mine is actually the light green seen in the product photos.
I included a photo of both colors I have seen this color turn out as.
It'd be nice if I could purchase this color and have it be consistently either light green or mint.",2.0
"I had never seen this product in person before buying. I searched online for as a many on-nail swatches I could find. The, 'on the nail' color that is shown by the seller looks nothing like it does when applied on an actual nail. I thought I would be getting a medium smoky rose brown neutral color. In reality this polish color is a medium yellow-based brown sand. There are not any pink hues. You know when you visit a friend's house and their florescent lights shine roughly against a wall color they so adorably call 'warm mocha', but all you can see is a harsh yellow brown? That's exactly what this nail polish color is.. It's pretty icky and should be left in the 70's. Try in person before you buy online.. I've taken a gamble on many nail polishes in the past, some were great some were not. This is the first time I've actually been bothered enough to write a review because this color has been so inaccurately represented. The seller did provide excellent service and quick shipping which is why I rated 2 stars.",2.0
"I've been using Paul Mitchell Extra-Body Sculpting Gel for years and now I think they've changed the formula by adding more water to it. I tried using the two tubes I bought here and my hair flopped and curled as if I had next to nothing on it. I had to go out and buy something else. This was not the fault of the supplier I bought it from, of course, but of the Paul Mitchell Company.",2.0
"This review is for the product itself, not the seller as I purchased mine in the store. It gives my hair good volume and shine but left lots of little white flakes in my hair. For $13, I was really disappointed. My $4 Pantene body building gel doesn't even do that.",2.0
Put It In Neutral is a pink not a neutral or nude. Just a head's up for anyone needing a true beige or nude color.,2.0
Ordered the same color that my manicurist uses but the color had much more purple iridescence. They must have changed the color formula. Was not able to return it as it's considered a hazardous material...be aware when urdering nail polishes.,2.0
was too sheer for me.,2.0
"Disappointed. Color is dull bubblegum pink not shocking florescent, bright pink like the image looked on the Amazon screen.
Note to self: need to buy these colors in retail rather...",2.0
Beautiful color. Sparkles and shines. BUT polish chips way to easily.... same day....for the price.,2.0
Not the color that expected it looks darker in the pictures than it actually is,2.0
its more orange than pink,2.0
"The color is amazing, but it takes much longer than a normal polish to dry and is streaky. Maybe I got a defective one.",2.0
Chips within 2 days,2.0
You have to apply several coats for it to be close to the brightness but then there is drying issues.,2.0
Not as expected,2.0
Did not like as much don't aplly thick and take to long to dry,2.0
Not my favorite,2.0
"The color is nice. But the quality is poor. The nail polish won't  last a day on the nail , chips and cracks all the time.",2.0
too thick,2.0
"It just blends into my skin. It's OK, but I really don't like it.",2.0
"When trying this color at the nail salon, I decided to buy the product on amazon. It was a beautiful dark purple color. The product I bought on amazon was more black. The label on the bottom was also different then the original I saw at the nail salon.",2.0
"very PURPLE, not coral",2.0
So disappointed in this polish.  It says apply two thin coats.  I have applied three and I still have brush marks and spotty coverage. It definitely doesn't look like a gel polish.  I went out and bought a cheap drug store variety and it has much better coverage.  I am not sure this is really OPI.  Beware!!,2.0
it was way too light and didn't have good coverage.,2.0
"Color that came is a green color, not the burnt orange color shown. Color itself isn't bad, BUT that isn't what I wanted.",2.0
it is too orangy ... not like the picture....I thought it was a light red....,2.0
"Nice color, but it takes MANY thin coats (for me it took 5) to get an even finish. If you apply an entire glob at once like you usually do then it WILL show the brush strokes and dents and unevenness because of the ""shine"" formula. It's not as opaque as you would think. Takes quite a while to dry as well.

I don't recommend, I'd rather just stick to their regular polishes, which only take 2 coats at most to achieve full opaqueness.",2.0
Too pale.,2.0
"Important: This item cant be returned since it requires special transportation and handling which we cant provide. Use the Contact us button for help addressing your issue.

The color is like those pink plastic nails, it doesn't dry completely, so you be disappointed thinking that you are getting the same gel system used by the nail places and it is NOT.  Don't buy it, also note that it is not returnable.  Mine went to the garbage.",2.0
"I used this polish with a professional manicure and within hours it started wearing off of the tops of my nails and the SHINE was rather DULL. After two days I added another coat of polish and it appeared darker than the original color...strange. So maybe a top coat is needed for the shine.

So, for the money, I must say that I'm disappointed. I'll keep it, but very disappointed in the product.",2.0
"This is my first OPI purchase.  The color is great.  However, the nail polish starts to chip off within just a couple of days.",2.0
The colour is nice and glossy. I got lots of compliments. But it started to peel after 7 days. Can't believe I spent this much on nail polish -_-,2.0
"It is ok, has sparkels in it. I prefer to wear a flat nail color.",2.0
Not crazy about the color.,2.0
Very hard to apply.  Left a gel mess.,2.0
Drying fast but color is not same as in the picture,2.0
Much more pale than pictured,2.0
"This colors formula changed. I'm heart broken now. Oh well, it's a coral pink color.",2.0
Chips,2.0
Very pasty looking! difficult to make the color look even on nails.,2.0
"Great quality but a little too ""medium"" color for my tastes. I would like a lighter color for more contrast.",2.0
Nothing like the photo. I thought this would be a nice rose gold/dark pink. Instead it's literally just lavender. And kind of a dull lavender at that.,2.0
Love the color but it doesn't last on me more than 2 days.,2.0
"This is the first OPI product I tried and it looks nice on, but you have to put on several coats to make a glossy finish. My nails have high vertical ridges and I wanted to smooth them out. If too many coats of filler are on, the filler chips early on. OPI is supposed to last longer than other polishes, but not the case.",2.0
"Really disappointed with this polish, still has streaks after 3 coats! Really frustrating for a product so expensive.",2.0
"I love OPI but not a huge fan of this color - I Eat Mainly Lobster. An odd orange color, it looks both dull with a a flourescent undertone. Will not buy again",2.0
I love this OPI brand Infinite Shine. I bought the primer and top coat from Walmart and had been hunting for the right color. I chose the wrong one. This looks like Pepto Bismol on your fingers. It is thick and not natural looking at all. The Beige Is the Reason is a MUCH more natural look.,2.0
I have used this opi color 'mod about you' many times before & wanted to touch up my nails but could not get it at the store so I ordered it on line  - the one I received is a darker shade of pink. I'm disappointed.,2.0
"Very disappointed - Ive been giving this a very good shot and am so sad. Ive done my nails 6 times with this and they consistently have marks on them from my sheets! I use a thin layer of base coat, 2 thin layers of color, and then a thin layer of this topcoat. So ridiculous. Bought the Sally Hansen Insta-Dri line with their instant dry topcoat yesterday and its 10000% better. My nails look good for the first time without using gel polish! This is a waste of money do not recommend. (For the record, I have never tried the matte top coat nor the quick dry from OPI).",2.0
Even with bottom and top coats it didnts stay on. Save your money.,2.0
"Wasn't  what I expected, wanted a clear with just a little color.",2.0
"I like O.P.I. nail products, but did not like this color.  It is shimmery and has a pink look when I was expecting a neutral cream.",2.0
Polish chips within a day or two.,2.0
"It's really watery, and there isn't much color. I've had this same problem with another opi that I got on amazon and I'm wondering if their quality isn't as good as in store.",2.0
only lasted a week,2.0
I know it says eternally turquoise but the bottle looks baby blue. I don't know why it dries to be a way darker color than the bottle.. But don't do what I did and hope to get a baby blue. They don't allow you to return it but you can get a refund. Just have to eat what you paid for shipping :/,2.0
"For the price, this isn't good. It wasn't smooth and the matte effect was lacking.",2.0
"I chose the shade ""Bubble Bath"" because I heard it was a good French manicure pink, but it's just way too translucent, and not in a good way. You need two or three coats for even coverage, and even then you can see every random brush stroke. It also bubbles a lot -- fitting because of its name? -- and layers badly. I doubt I'll ever use it again.",2.0
Sadly this is not the right color.  The Opi color called Kiss Me on My tulips is a beautiful clear red at the place where I get my nails done.  Apparently Opi re-uses names without regard to prior labels.  I traded it for the color I want at the nail salon,2.0
"I buy this color all the time, they haven't had it in the stores the last couple of times I went so I tired of online. This product is not the same quality nor shade I get in the stores.",2.0
Yellowy color not as pictured,2.0
The color is not that pink as in the picture. It's more brownish,2.0
Not the color I was looking for.,2.0
Too sheer and needs 3-4 coats to cover nail.,2.0
"I only use OPI and so I know what they are like.  This bottle must have been bad or very old, as I could not get it to go on smoothy.  I always use  a base coat, followed by 2 coats of nail polish, then 1 coat of top coat.  With this bottle, I could never get it to go on smoothly and evenly after 3 coats!  Very disappointed.",2.0
"I had such great hope for this product, since it is OPI and I was hoping for a true chip free polish for at least five days. I have never had anything negative to say about an OPI product before but this is expensive and doesn't do the job promised. I have had better luck with conventional polish and a top coat. I wouldn't have spent the time writing this review if I didn't feel like there were better options out there for long wear nail polish.  The only reason I give it two stars is due to the fact it is extremely shiny and pretty colors.",2.0
"Love OPI nail polish. This color did not work out for me. I was hoping for a sheer peachy pink.  I have tried applying it several times, with lots of shaking to blend.  Every time I got a streaky look unless I applied enough coats to create an opaque look, which was then a bit too white and bright to flatter my pale skin tone.",2.0
Not the color I saw at the local store.,2.0
"Found that the nail polish in the bottle I received was very thin.  I went to use today and it took 4 coats to cover completely.  The bottle I received was chipped, but intact otherwise.",2.0
"I don't know if it is just this bottle, but the polish was thick and gloppy - very hard to apply.",2.0
"When I opened the bottle the first time, the black top came off the bottle but the brush was stuck on the container and would not come off. Very poor quality lid. Can't use the polish, so I wasted $10. Very disappointed.",2.0
This product did not live up to my expectations.  I had significant chipping on my nails the same day I applied the product.,2.0
"Sadly, was disappointed with this OPI product.  The lacquer did not go on smoothly, and even after two coats, was streaky.  I have always loved the regular line, so hope this was a glitch.",2.0
"OPI color lasts a long time and I enjoy the variety and colors along with the names.  I thought their top coat it would be the same quality, but was surprised at the poor quality.  For me, I tried it about three different times and where other brands leave a high quality finish, this OPI product does not.",2.0
I've seen no difference between this product and Revlon's top coat. Plus Revlon is half the cost.,2.0
Does not cover well - 2 coats is not enough.  My old Opi covers much better.,2.0
Not as good as the gel you use with a light but last longer then regular polish. Cool colors,2.0
I usually love opi nail polish but this one didn't go on well.,2.0
"Dries streaky, though matte. Have tried several times. Nails looks like trash.  Would not recommend.",2.0
This nail polish is a deep dark purple not navy at all.,2.0
"Perfect navy shade. It matches my navy Kate Spade. One of my favorite shades. Unfortunately, it was very thick and gooey as if it had been dried out. I will not be able to get a number of uses out this bottle which is disappointing. I will go buy the shade at Ulta next time.",2.0
"I had such high hopes for OPI's Infinite Shine, but it is just not a good product. I ordered the primer and top coat, plus two colors--You Can Count on It and Can't Be Beet!. The consistency of the pink, You Can Count on It, was awful--streaky and gloppy; it left brush marks that refused to smooth out after application. I let the first coat dry very well before applying the second coat, but it, too, left brush marks. Can't Be Beet, a dark, rich red, was better, but not great. The pink (primer, 2 ccolor coats, and a top coat, began chipping the very next day. What a disappointment! I will stick to OPI Gelcolor.",2.0
not shiny at all.,2.0
Gets gummy after awhile,2.0
"The color does not match the picture (I compared on two different screens). I expected it to be a pearl with pink tint but instead it is a dull light beige that  looks like dirty white when dried on my nails. The item is not eligible for returns, so it goes  right into the trash can.",2.0
Color was lighter than usual. The product is fine it's just that the batch was much much lighter than the previous batches.,2.0
"I ordered OPI red, I gave it 2 stars because it did come within the time range it said it would however it's not red, it's more of a dark pink.",2.0
"I wanted to love this but I just don't. I love OPI but this makes your freshly painted nails peel off. It does dry super fast which is great but it's not always an even application & within 24 hrs my color peels off. This doesn't seem to happen with my toenails but it always happens with my finger nails. I've tried different polishes, no polish, waiting longer before applying this & nothing has changed the outcome.",2.0
Smells odd. Not the normal nail polish smell. Mine seemed to go bad faster than normal also.,2.0
"Love the color, but chipped within 1 day.  Quite disappointed",2.0
Looks more pink than most of the OPI bubble bath I have used in the past.,2.0
This nail polish honestly doesn't dry fast. I love OPI but the top coat takes more than 10 minutes to completely dry and it gets in the way of moving on with my daily activities. I wouldn't recommend this as a top coat.,2.0
"I wait until my polish is dry to apply this top coat and it still somehow pulls the nail design?? How? I can tap my nails and there's no denting but as soon as I swipe this top coat on, my polish gets streaky. It's like they put nail polish remover in this or something. NOT HAPPY.",2.0
came broken...,2.0
I thought this was be a good change of pace beside my boring pale polish. However that was not the case. This polish is totally not cute. It is more purple than I wanted it to be. Won't be wearing this out of the house.,2.0
"I don't know if the bottle I bought was old. I put on two layers and a topcoat, the next day they peeled right off!!!! So I thought maybe I would try it without the top coat and it still peeled off! I am really bummed because I always use OPI polish and I have never had this problem. I am going to return this polish.....or attempt. Hopefully the people won't think I am crazy for returning it.",2.0
Gets sticky after a few uses,2.0
It seems to be an old bottle as it does not go on smoothly and looks like it has bumps or air bubbles in it. Disappointing b/c it is a pretty shade.,2.0
Too thin and doesn't last. Smells like polish remover. ,2.0
It's more like dark rose color than red.,2.0
"The color is so pale, even after applying two coats, it was barely noticeable.  I own approximately 23 OPI nail colors and up until the purchase of Samoan Sand, I have found each of them to be exactly what I expected.  I purchase OPI as it wears extremely well, but not in this case.",2.0
"Did not really like this top coat, it took a while to dry and messed up my manicure. It also makes it difficult for me to remove my nail polish",2.0
Not the color I expected. I was hoping to match the gel polish I use which is the same shade.,2.0
"I switched to this from Essie top coat and that was a mistake. I got sheet smudges with this even after using the Rapidry spray; with Essie and Rapidry spray, no sheet smudges.",2.0
Shipped fast but the bottle did not come with a dripper so no way to put on nails so disappointed with this purchase.,2.0
Doesn't last very long.,2.0
I didn't notice a difference. The nail polish chips before its time to reapply it. I wish it was thinner like an oil treatment that can soak in your nails instead of keep changing it,2.0
Did not cover my nails. I put 2 coats on and it left streaks too. I gave it away.,2.0
"Ugly color, sort of a mix between a boring beige and a dead corpse. I did not like it, threw it away after one use",2.0
Alpine snow is just a bright white. It has no grayish blue  hue to it like in the picture,2.0
"i thought it was navy blue, it is purple.",2.0
"this isn't the classy color i was looking for. it's extremely pink for my liking... i'm probably gonna mix some of this color in a white nail polish to get the color i want. i really like the consistency of it, as it gives me nice even coats.. but it's just way too pink.",2.0
I love OPI but this color streaks when you put it on no matter how much I tried to mix it up.,2.0
"Very sheer, streaky. Was wanting a more opaque color! So hard to find a good white shade.",2.0
"Different colour than shown in image. I got frustrated when I got it. Its metallic like, not milky white.",2.0
"it says about 5 mins, but i have been waiting for like 10 mins or more just for my nails to dry...",2.0
"product seems to work as advertised, however, if I had not had a dropper for something else I would not have been able to use it since it did not come WITH a dropper AS STATED",2.0
"THIS PRODUCT DID NOT PERFORM AS I HOPED. IT DRIED POLISH TO TOUCH QUICKLY, BUT IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR POLISH TO DRY ALL THE WAY ! POLISH WOULD SMUDGE EVEN AFTER AN HOUR ! POLISH DRYS QUICKER WITHOUT THE DRIP DRY ! I'VE STOPPED USING IT AND I'M STUCK WITH 2 BOTTLES !",2.0
The color is great. But the polish started chopping literally within a few hours of putting it on. I though maybe I just had smuged 1 nail but I noticed several nails were chipping away. Such a disappointment!,2.0
This was a beautiful color but not worth the price. I bought this in teal the cows come home. 2 applications is enough and color is not opaque. It is a beautiful color for my peacock obsession. The problem lies in the price. I've heard good stuff about this brand but for the price I expect it to last. I painted my nails at night and they dried completely. The next morning I had 4 chipped nails! Not acceptable when I have used $2 nail polish that doesn't chip for 4 days. Simply not worth the price.,2.0
It doesn't give my nails a brought shine whats so ever it's horrible! I gave two stars because item was on time,2.0
Takes multiple (4) coats for solid coverage,2.0
I really liked the color.. But from opi I expected much better. I expected the Polish stays at least a week but it chipped in just 3 days. Looked very nice when applied. Applied on Tuesday and Friday looks like  in the pic.,2.0
"I usually love OPI products. OPI top coat is  a very shiny top coat.
 I am not sure if this one  is old or something was added to it. It is dull and does not dry.  I was very disappointed.",2.0
"I was really excited to try this top coat, but it was incredibly disappointing.  I used it a few times and then got rid of it.  It does not leave a glossy or shiny finish on my nails, but rather makes the polish look dull.  I also found that it chipped really easily, and so I would have to redo my nails rather quickly, like the next day.  Even if this top coat was cheap (which is wasn't) I still would not recommend it.  In my opinion, Seche Vite is much more effective and longer lasting.  Even the drug store brand top coats are better than OPI.",2.0
"I've used Seche-vite, Jordana and Out the door top coats and this one is the worst of all.
Slow drying and no shine at all. No point of using this for top coat!
Will never buy this one.",2.0
color is much more green than photo shows.,2.0
"According to my wife: ""The coverage isn't as good as the other OPI nail polishes I have.. doesn't go on as smoothly.  Not a product that I would recommend, but is a pretty color!""",2.0
"...but takes about 20-30 min to dry..compared with sally's fast dri that dries in within 30 seconds, just not worth it to me..but it does leave a nice shine..",2.0
I'm a hairstylist and my hands are constantly in water so I bought this top coat thinking it would last but it doesn't. If I paint my nails at night the next day they are already starting to chip. I heard that the sally hansen top coat was really good so I might just try that.,2.0
I had this top coat for two to three months top until it started getting all gloopy and sticky. It came to the point where putting it on could ruin my whole manicure and I just had to get a new top coat.,2.0
I bought this product because I own other OPI nail polishes that are of very good quality but this clear coat sucks!!! Very disappointed you have to apply like 3 or 4 layers for it to look glossy .,2.0
"Girls! make sure you are buying a real OPI nail product! I can't find the number on the bottle. There should be two serial numbers on the bottle but I can't find neither of them. The return policy is quite harsh so i'm not planning for a return. However next buyer, think before you buy!",2.0
"This stuff works great and makes your nails look beautiful while you're using it, but right after I took it off my nails became incredibly brittle and were destroyed from formaldehyde.  If you plan to use this indefinitely it is fine, but that is not reasonable for most people.",2.0
"I have combination skin, I have been using KVD Lock it foundation for a couple years but I wanted to try something new. Unfortunately, even with primer this really made my skin look blotchy and feel really tight and dry and just overall looked really unnatural and chalky on me. If you have dry skin and are looking for a good full coverage foundation I strongly recommend Kat Von D's foundation. This dermablend foundation is definitely best suited for people with normal skin.",2.0
"I've been pleased with Dermablend products all in all, but for some reason I found this one looks un-natural.

It gave my skin a mask like look. It just didn't suit me at all. I'm not sure if it's just a reaction with my own skin chemistry or if other people also find this product looking very artificial after application.

Again, I am usually satisfied with Dermablend makeup, this was my one exception.",2.0
It doesnt give good coverage unless you build it and build it... overall disappointed,2.0
"Do not like this at all, not smooth as it advertises, dry & cakes on my face. I do not recommend this & wish I hadn't spent $40 bucks for crap",2.0
Too dark and too thick,2.0
The consistency and feeling of this make up is horrible. I could only give it one try/wear. Gave it the second star in case you are into wearing clown make-up.,2.0
I bought it to cover my sunspots but sadly it does not work.,2.0
Very hard. Overly dry,2.0
"Doesn't cover as much as I hoped, I would have to apply a lot to get coverage and I ordered two shades lighter than my usual color to get the closest shade for me.",2.0

it used to be a good brand years ago does not cover,2.0
"I'm a fan of Dermablend--great concealers and powders, but this foundation wasn't my favorite. For one, it's a lot cooler (pink) than I was expecting (I got the shade 30w Yellow Beige).  It doesn't feel heavy on the skin, but it looked very mask-like. It did last on me all day and it was very full coverage, but it didn't look good.",2.0
"Does not provide good coverage for bruises, and it cakes.  I much prefer ""it"" brand's CC+.",2.0
"The Sand Beige shade of this Dermablend Cover Cream is listed as a light shade. And if you look at the swatches for the Light category, you will see that this is the lightest of the four available. That describes my skin tone exactly: light but with a tendency toward the fair end of the spectrum.

It was to my great dismay then to receive this product and realize that the color was totally off. Everything looked promising when the package arrived. The swatch on the outside of the box was a pretty close match to my skin tone. Then I opened it and was shocked to see just how much darker the real product was.

I wanted this product to cover a thyroid surgery scar on my neck. All I got was something that will draw even more attention to the imperfection with its fake tan orange glow. Ive attached photos so you can see for yourself.

Recommendation: Go much, much lighter than you think you need to with this Dermablend Cover Cream.",2.0
I love this product but the color was way off.,2.0
"not a pictured. I'm a winter complexion MAC color NC45 and a summer complexion Becca color Mink. this is much lighter than NC45, from my experience. Sadly returned. However, the I could see a better pigmented color might work well.",2.0
Didn't cover tattoos as it said it could. picked what I thought would be the best color for my skin. didn't match,2.0
"This powder left my face looking grey.  I really have a warm, reddish undertone so needless to say, I did not like the results.  I imagine it could be that I chose the wrong shade, but with the name ""chocolate brown"", I expected something different in the final result.",2.0
"I really wanted to love this. Unfortunately, I don't. Not at all. First, the colors are much darker than other brands and darker than they look in the pictures. Second, this is not a good makeup for an elderly face. This makeup, for me, seems to show every wrinkle and flaw I have. It cakes and looks and feels dry on my skin. It is way too thick, in my opinion. I didn't like the finished look at all.",2.0
"Darker than I expected, goes on smoothly. I used it to cover heart surgery scar but it almost seems to call more attention to it. Pleasant scent",2.0
Extremely dry and thick.,2.0
"A little goes a long way, but how it ends up is the issue. The feeling is Very greasy and heavy, and my pores looked and felt very clogged with this. It cannot be used alone without looking rather strange. It covers pretty well, which means that you have to add back shading to look like a real person instead of a plastic toy. When you add powder (I used this same brand to try and follow suggested use), it gets rather muddy and cakey, looking very thick.

I took it off after a very short while because of how yucky it felt. I didn't care for this product, but in good news, it does help block sun.",2.0

"I'm not going to bash dermablend as this review is my own personal opinion. I did not like how it felt on my face. I felt as though I was wearing a mask not makeup. It does cover well but if you have wrinkles be warned they will show up even more. As I said this is my own opinion, try it yourself and see your own results. I am adding the review today because it wasn't what I expected.",2.0
"While I do have lots of things on my skin I'd like to cover well, there is too much work involved in getting this product on in the morning - I don't have endless minutes to baby sit a product to get it on my face. It's not a liquid, so there's this little applicator to get product on, then 'warming' it on my skin. First trial, I used to much and I couldn't get it to blend in and had to wash it off. Second try with less went a bit better, but having to blend it in with tiny spots of application was a pain, and I still didn't feel like I had a smooth look. And note, the portion of the product I put into my palm to warm up didn't wash off easily with soap and water. More work and time spent I don't have in the morning. This was also much darker than I expected, I believe it was called warm beige, and it's more a rusty color and too dark for beige. At least my idea of beige...

Your mileage may vary, depending on getting a good-for-you color and with lots of time to pamper in the morning.",2.0
"This warm beige is darker than I expected and will look better on a person with olive skin or a deep tan. It is too dark for my complexion. In addition, this make-up does not spread well. When I apply a foundation, I expect a smooth flow with my sponge and this did not provide that.",2.0
Doesn't cover well.  Too thick even when you put some in your hand and swirl it around.  Too hard to deal with.,2.0
Way to light for me and way cakey for my dry skin.  The search is still on for a new foundation.,2.0
"""Never cakey or masky"" - not true.  This is very cakey and shows every line and wrinkle.  It does cover dark spots well but it looks like you are wearing stage makeup.  I like the high spf to protect from UV rays but otherwise it is not for me.",2.0
"Clings to dry areas, looks cakey/patchy even when applied in a thin layer, and coverage fades after only a few hours even with a setting powder and spray. I honestly get better, smoother, longer lasting coverage by spot concealing with my Maybelline Fit Me concealer before applying foundation. And it's way cheaper.",2.0
I read an article stating that this is the number one foundation if you want to cover up blemishes.  Kat Von D's Lock It was number 2 so I bought both.  This foundation is like a mask.  It is so thick that you need to stir it on the back of your hand before applying it. It feels heavy and left my face cakey despite the fact that I exfoliated first and applied moisturizer.  It did not cover my brown spot but instead made it look like a weird color.  I also found it difficult to blend my highlighter over this foundation.  The Kat Von D's product is much better.,2.0
Great coverage but extremely oily and gets all over clothes. I will not purchase again.,2.0
Not impressed and really does absolutely nothing and no difference.,2.0
"I previously used Dermablend Smooth Indulgence Foundation which I loved.  When that product was discontinued, I tried this.  It seems much heavier, doesn't blend easily and the color isn't quite the same even though it has the same name.  I find it works better if I mix it with a little bit of moisturizer prior to application.  I will not purchase this again.  Before Dermablend I used MAC, and most likely I will go back to that.  It's so frustrating when a company stops making a great product - I know a lot of other people where unhappy when Smooth Indulgence went away.",2.0
It covers dark spot somewhat.,2.0
"I love make up and consider it my one splurge. The only reason u gave it two stars instead of one is because the color matched very well. Since I have very fair skin I have a hard time finding makeup that doesn't look orange. BUT I am 25 years old and I never knew how many fine line I had until I tried this makeup! It settles right into any flaw you didn't know you had. I have normal skin, not oily and not really dry and within 2 or so hours it became splotchy and smeared even with finishing powder. I have to do everything I can not to touch my face or it comes completely off. After I went back and looked into dermablend I realized its made by Loreal. So you're buying a cheap grade make up that's been marketed to seem worthy of not being sold in a pharmacy. Please don't waste your money.",2.0
Greasy and didn't stay put.,2.0
"I had heard wonderful things about dermablend creme for lupus rashes and oily skin. I have extremely oily skin, some makeups work ok, others not so much.

I usually fit the bill for fairest makeup, but this was FAR lighter than expected I used their websites color match but it just didn't line up. Thats ok, because its hard to color match online. I did not minus my rating for this, but be aware that you may need to go 1-2 shades darker than expected.

The awful rating is due to it not holding up on my skin. In a very short period of time it congealed and ran down my face. It just looked awful. It doesnt hold up to oily skin at all - even with primer and sealing it in with powder. I was very disappointed. Coverage was pretty good.",2.0
too thick looks like a mask didn't like,2.0
"Not what I expected.  I wanted the smooth indulge ance foundation cream
This was more of a thick powder

Disappointed with this brand.  Expected more of a full coverage from this creme but it is only a bit better coverage than their liquid foundation.  Not worth the price at all.,2.0
I bought this because of all the positive reviews about how well it covers up. I have some pigmentation changes on my cheek bones post pregnancy. This stuff would not even cover those up fully. Not very impressed.,2.0
Not very happy with this product. Quickly creases.,2.0
"Oily texture, not long lasting, not good for under the eyes (creases), there are much better things out there.",2.0
"I like that this products serves to help people with blemishes and hyperpigmentation. I bought it because I was hoping it would help cover up my acne scarring better than other foundations I was previously using. It was easy to apply and covered my face well. Perhaps I was putting on too much though because it felt heavy. My face did not feel matte enough and so it felt ""cakey"" afterwards even with the translucent setting powder.",2.0
"This product was way too light and could not be used.  I did not return as it would cost way, way too much to do so.  Better photo of colour of product is needed.",2.0
that cover effect was so so......,2.0
I didn't use it at all. It was completely the wrong color. Very hard to but this product without trying it first. Can't match it to my skin from a computer screen. So now I'm out $40 dollars with a product I can't use.,2.0
"It would have taken several applications over at least an hour to apply it.  They had to be such thin applications, then dry, then apply another one.  I didn't have time to wait so it didn't cover that well.  I would have started well earlier and this might have worked better...",2.0
I don't really like this product. It does last long however like someone else said it does bring more attention to scars. Its SO shiny so even though you can't see the scar you know something is there from all of the shine still bringing attention to what you're trying not have attention on,2.0
"Received my Dermablend today. I was disappointed with the shade (wrong choice - too dark), should have gotten an Ivory shade. This shade, while in the same family was VERY dark for me. In addition, it's not as moisturizing as indicated. Granted, I'm a mature woman of 56, with very good skin, hydrated. I do have some under eye darkness which I though this would help. I had to slather on additional cream with this product to lighten the color AND add more moisture. I will not purchase again. Quite disappointed. Even if I did have the correct color.",2.0

If coverage of a birthmark or other dark area is what you want then save your money.  This product is thick and dry and does not give coverage.  I barely use it but I give it 2 stars because it does make the dark mark a little lighter.,2.0

"It really covers all the dark spots and discolor area, does it's job, however, I've used twice and found my pores are blocked, and seems developing into blemish/acne... gosh.

"I went to the Macy's to find my shade, and unfortunately had to beg to try a sample, which is not Dermablend policy as far as I am aware.  I bought the face makeup, the body makeup, and the setting powder.  I tried it out at work today, and was very disappointed because after 5 hours it completely rubbed off and was gone, just like Revlon ColorStay for half the price.  I did not rub it, only patted my oily face gently throughout the day as the oil emerged, but still, for the price I might as well have bought a 10$ long wearing makeup.  I am hoping to try the leg and body makeup tomorrow and hope that it performs better.  I truly wish there were a makeup available for oily faces that doesn't just  melt off in a few hours.  Suggestions are welcome!",2.0
"The coverup is okay. Initially, it works for me if applying 1-2 coats. However, I used it for a black inked back tattoo that required 3-4 coats to completely coverup the area. The coverup takes a long time to dry. I do not think it was very ""water-friendly"" either because i went swimming and it washed off completely. I had to use several coats that were very messy and stained my clothes I was wearing.",2.0
I saw a girl RubyGolani use this in a YouTube video tutorial to cover her acne and it looks flawless on camera but for everyday wear? Didn't meet the mark. It smudges off of you put it on before foundation/after foundation so I'm not sure how I'm supposed to use it. Also it is slightly shiny....I prefer a matte effect.,2.0
"This was a big disappointment to me. It is the same stuff as the cheap sticks you can buy anywhere- the greasy stuff. If you put on a little, it is okay for awhile in certain lighting. If you put it on using the spatula and rubbing it on thick like they say, it cakes and sets into the creases of your eyes. Don't waste your money.",2.0

"I bought it because I read in the website that it's a good brand to cover my scar.
I have (a little raised) scars. The products just can't make it look natural.
The scars also have discoloration and Dermablend don't cover it that well.
In addition, the color shades in website are not identical to the real shades after I tried it on my skin at all.
Waste of money.
I also have a birthmark, the product can't totally cover the discoloration like it says in the website.
It cakes up and become more noticeable.",2.0
"I'm sure this product is great for people who have discolored, SMOOTH skin.  It is a great cover for that.  BUT it is not good for people who have acne scarring.  It makes my face look cakey, and it just brings more attention to the scarring on my face.",2.0

Especially need a light color with a little pink in it for my fair skin with rosy undertones.  This had a little less color than I needed but it may work for some people. You would probably need a moisturizer under it in the Winter. (maybe Clinique Moisture Surge) I also like to spray a little Eve Hansen Rose Water under the Clinique Almost Powder, year round.

I opened up the package, opened the box the foundation it came in, popped off the lid and went to use the makeup (by tapping the powder into the lid) and thIe entire inner sifter lid just came off, as it was about 2 sizes too small. This made ALL of the foundation powder go everywhere. It's definitely defective, I've never had that happen with any of my jane products and if anything that inner lid is always so tight you can't even get it off! Pretty disappointed. I wasted $40.",2.0
"Although I actually really like the Jane Iredale loose mineral powder, I hate the container! It has to be the only company left that provides no way to close off the shaker top.

You will end up with most of the powder in the top and have a huge mess on your hands.

I found this powder really didn't offer very good coverage at all. I have fairly clear skin with only slight unevenness. I had to layer and layer to get that flawless look that I can get with other mineral powders that I have used in past. It made my face look a bit chalky and caked.

I wouldn't recommend this for people looking for a really flawless look but if you just want to take shine away and cover lightly, you might like it.

Too dry for me,2.0

I was very disappointed because their products are pretty light and not as harsh as others and I don't really have sensitive skin. I'm your normal T-zone girl here with a minor oily issue here and there.

Not a good idea to buy make up online unless you have seen the color and tried it in person,2.0

This did NOTHING for me and to spend several minutes and get zero curl is a major fail in my book.  I'll stick with my Tweezerman manual curler that takes 20 seconds and gets the job done.  It's not so much the wasted money, it's that Blinc let me down with this in a big way.  The new primer that came out makes up for this great- in- theory, bad- in- execution,  product.  Buy the primer, pass on this curler.  Take it back to the drawing board, Blinc.",2.0

I tried 3 different batteries and it just does not heat up, it only gets slightly warm (because the heating element has the gap in it I previously mentioned.)

If I had to find something nice to say about 911, it is odorless and slightly cooling. It's also probable that my baggy eyes are beyond any kind of help; but if I ever find something that does work, I'll update this post. For now, I'll go back to cucumbers.",2.0
I saw this mentioned on a blog and bought it. I think it smells bad and is much less pleasant than just about any other lotion of tried. Not sure what I'm missing.,2.0
"I think that the medicinal properties of this moisturizer makes it better than alot of other moisturizers out there, and as much as I wanted to love this product because I'd rather have healthier and more supple skin I just couldn't for the life of me get over the smell. I'm not sensitive to smells at all, but the smell was alittle too off putting to continue using it. I do have to say I used it for a week on my face and hands and noticed how hydrated my skin felt. I would have given it 5 stars had it not been for that aweful smell. Sorry Yu-Be, please make one that's not scented.",2.0
"Loved this cream, however, it has parabens, thus the 2 star. I will not use anyting with parabens. So sad because I would've loved to purchase a large bottle of this.",2.0
Not worth what I paid for it.,2.0
"I bought this based on its cult following but I have to say I'm not a fan. It goes on greasy, takes a long time to absorb, and smells like mothballs. Yes, the smell dissipates, but why bother when there are so many other pleasant smelling and/or fragrance-free options? The color and texture are similar to nasal mucus. It's just a big fat no all-around. I'll stick with Aquaphor.",2.0
Bottle was crushed upon arrival. But smelled really good so i gave it an extra star.,2.0
"I was hoping to get better results with this skin cleanser since it contains glycolic acid, but it barely removed make up, let alone dirt and oil. I realize it is a men's line of facial care but I rarely wear make up. It left my skin still oily and I hated that I needed to have the bottle balanced upside down to make it easier to dispense.",2.0
I bought this stuff to get other Baxter products out of my hair. Not a fan of either. Won't order again.,2.0
"The minty fragrance is weird. Why would a shampoo smell like toothpaste?

The fragrant botanical extracts are really high up on the ingredients list. I think this shampoo is causing me irritation and dryness on the back of my neck.

Leaves hair feeling course and stripped. Cost is too high for mediocre shampoo. The only thing I can say is good about this shampoo is the scent.,2.0
dries my hair out too much,2.0
"Disappointed.  It smells good, but that's about it.  Save your money and buy Paul Mitchell instead.",2.0
Poor product for the price,2.0
Makes my hair feel dry,2.0
"This is pretty decent stuff, however, it's expensive and it's only a 10oz bottle. I thought I might like a nicer shampoo, but $16 for a 10oz bottle hardly seems worth it. I literally can't tell the difference between this and the $2 bottle of Suave Mens that I usually get.",2.0
"Nothing great, didn't really meet my expectations for the price point. Plenty of other mens shampoo you could buy. I'll buy anthony's logistics for men before i buy this stuff.",2.0
"I requested this shampoo from the Vine list because it sounded like an interesting alternative to some of the more floral smelling affairs I usually wind up with.  If we're looking simply at the shampoo itself . . . it's not too bad.  The mixture is a bit on the watery side, admittedly, but the smell is more mint or herbal in nature than floral or some kind of fake fruit smell.  It lathers up fairly well, though I wind up having to use more of it to wash my long hair fully.  While it washes out well enough, my hair doesn't feel particularly soft afterwards, and I certainly couldn't get by without a decent conditioner. Overall, I think individuals looking for a no-nonsense shampoo that caters to their particular tastes will like the shampoo itself

My bigger issue is the packaging.  The blue cylindrical bottle  with the press down dispenser looks like a generic soap bottle.  There's nothing particularly appealing about the shape or label, and it's not going to attract customers with its clinical appearance.  But the appearance is hardly my full issue.  The black dispenser top DID NOT WORK.  Perhaps I simply never got it loosened correctly so that it could pump, but I fumbled with it for over ten minutes  the first time (in the shower) and the second time out of the shower to see what was wrong.  I still couldn't make it work.  So I've had to unscrew the lid and sort of dump the shampoo into my hands which is awkward and inefficient to say the least.  I don't know if this is a symptomatic problem with these dispensers, or if I happened to have a bad one, but I tend to think it might work better with a more traditional shampoo lid.

Overall, this did not wow me.  It's a fine shampoo, but I'd like to see an improvement in the packaging.",2.0
"I have baby fine hair but lots of it and it's about waist length. I am not on city water and have a well with water that is not softened. I mention this because I've found that with some shampoo, the water does matter. I've had my stylist use a shampoo on me that I loved in the salon (which is on city water) but didn't like as well once I used it at home.

I used this shampoo 4 times and unfortunately every time it made my hair very ""flyaway"".....not frizzy exactly because I don't have enough curl in my hair for it to frizz but I found if I wanted to pull it up in a bun/ponytail, I had lots and lots of individual hairs that were unruly and wouldn't stay in the ponytail but sort of floated around my head and normally I don't have this problem with my other shampoos.

Although I loved the scent - it was sort of a minty/botanical kind of smell, I would have had to use hairspray to keep it from floating/flyaways and I hate hairspray and only use it if I absolutely have to. I also tried using other styling products to reduce the flyaways but since my hair is fine, it doesn't take much before my hair seems weighed down.

If you have hair that's not fine and have softer water then this might be a shampoo you'd like but it just wasn't for me.",2.0
There have been studies that indicate that parabens can cause cancer. It smells minty. The bottle looks different then they have in the photo. It uses a pump.,2.0
"I don't know what's with the rave reviews, perhaps brand loyalists?  Well, I bought this because this company used to make a self-tanner that was the best self-tanner I've ever seen, although a bit pricey.  It gave you a nice orangey glow, and unlike other tanners, it didn't make you break out in any way or discolor/exaggerate blemishes on the face, etc.  Okay, so the tanner appears to be no more, yet this crap product lives on.  So I get it, and it actually smells and feels like the tanner did, like heavy orange Vitamin C smell.  For a moment, I was excited, hoping they had screwed up and sent me the tanner, but sadly no.  Also, after exclusive use for four days in a row, I began to break out with acne, which I killed with Witch Hazel here in the winter and now my face is peeling.  Great.  However, I can't say for sure that this was due to this product, yet by association and all the other things I dislike about it, why not assume so.  So when it goes on your face it isn't that moist; it feels thick and dry, almost grainy.  I can't really judge whether it 'moisturized' me or not because the smell and texture were so annoying, so for that reason and the fact their discontinued self-tanner was cool, I'll give it 2 stars rather than 1.",2.0
I didn't really see any difference in complexion.,2.0
Too harsh for his sensitive skin,2.0
Love the line of product. Here's the problem- The pump was broken when it arrived. Requested a new pump and was ignored.,2.0
The bottle is so rigid that I cannot squeeze out a portion. Had to transfer it to a different bottle. Cleanser was also a different consistency than that from previous purchases. Will not purchase online again.,2.0
"This is my first time using this product. I've always been a big fan of Anthony products but this one falls short. I would like to say it's effective but I'm sure. It doesn't lather, so you're never sure it's working or not or if you've used enough.",2.0
"I wanted to try this because it was a Glycolic Cleanser, but it doesn't sud up at all and requires you to use a lot more to cover the whole face than most other products. Will not buy again.",2.0
Nothing really special about this product.  It's really gentle on your skin; so gentle that I question whether it's even doing anything.  It doesn't even create suds/bubble.  It smells nice though and I don't see a difference in the quality of my facial skin.  I wouldn't recommend this as a daily face wash/cleanser but give it 2 stars because I support the fight against prostate cancer and I feel it would better suited someone who is Glycolic-ly informed.,2.0
"Too thin, you need too much to feel as though you've done the job properly. The end result feels okay, just not very user friendly. Would definitely recommend the Anthony Algae Cleanser over this one.",2.0
"Not a fan! The gel feels light, but it left my hair super crunchy feeling. If you like the wet look all day long and don't mind a stiff curl, then this gel is for you, but it was a bit much for me since I prefer a softer look. You don't have frizz when you use it, but that's because there is a hard shell around every strand of hair.",2.0
"The Ouidad products used to be amazing, but now they seem no better than what I can get at any drugstore.  This gel leaves part of my hair crunchy and wet looking and the rest frizzy.",2.0
I was recommended this product by a friend so I had high hopes. The first few hours it seemed to be working well. It held my curl and didn't het hard. However by mid day my hair started to frizz and I had white flakes all over my clothes. It was awful. I will not use this product again.,2.0
"I was very disappointed. I hoped getting a product by a company that makes things for curly hair, that they'd understand the needs. This product, even if I used only a bit of it, made my hair stiff, crunchy and stuck together like shellac. I tried to squeeze and decrunch the hardness out of it, but I lost my curls. It took care of flyaways, but only because it made everything glued together. I'm going back to Crew forming cream. It is the only thing that totally works to make my waves and curls get more shaped and not frizzy.",2.0
I don't know what's different about this product compared to any other hair gel you could buy at a drugstore.  What is different is the smell...not so nice...not a pleasant fragrance...hard to describe.  I went back to using my Nexxus Mousse Plus -- much better for volume and curls (I have fine dense hair).,2.0
"I bought this as a clarifying shampoo to use once per week for my super oily hair. It smells awful, like spoiled grapefruit. It doesn't lather at all; I had to use three times the amount of shampoo that I usually use just to cover my scalp. I let it sit for 5 minutes like the directions say, and washed it out really, really well. I styled my hair like usual and it was awful. My hair was static-y and still looked greasy! Since then I have purchased Ion clarifying shampoo, and it works much, much better.",2.0
I recently moved into a house with very hard water.  This shampoo was recommended via several beauty websites as a good alternative for hard water.  I found that my hair felt stripped and was a completely tangled mess after following the directions.  I tried it a second time and used less shampoo and still had the same results.  I know one of my friends uses this product and has no issues.  I have fine curly hair.  I had much better success with the Kenra Clarifying shampoo.,2.0
Shampoo works fine but very strong perfume scent.,2.0
"I have used a multitude of products for my aging, dry, curly, Italian hair.  I used ouidad for several months and did not notice a change in my hair.  Expensive products, loaded with laurels and chemicals = bad choice.
I settled on Wen products and they work much better with my dry hair and are much more cost effective for me.",2.0
Dried my hair out and killed my curls. Went back to my drugstore brand- way cheaper and much better results.,2.0
"I loved this condition when I first tried it.  I used it whether my hair was going to be straight or curly that day. No frizz, great curls, tangle free.  I used a whole bottle and ordered another... then my hair started getting disgustingly greasy.  I thought it must be the shampoo, since I've been using the same conditioner for so long without problem.  (I did, at one point, use the matching shampoo for this product and didn't like it).  I tried changing my shampoo over and over and nothing helped.  Finally I tried a different conditioner and my hair eventually went back to normal.  I don't understand why it took so long to start getting greasy but I will never use this again.",2.0
I believe they watered it down or something. Did nothing for my curly hair. WAY too expensive for what it was,2.0
"This conditioner wasn't hydrating enough for my 2c/3a hair. My hair has low porosity and I felt like this never really penetrated the shaft to give it the moisture it needs. I didn't even finish the last quarter of the bottle before I switched back to my Shea Moisture Curl & Shine conditioner. Thanks, but no thanks.",2.0
Conditioner works okay but very strong perfume scent.,2.0
"Disappointed in this product. I normally use Ouidad's Lock-in leave in condtioner and so when I was running out I decided to give this a try in hopes that it would work just as well.  After using it a few times, I find that my curls are too poufy, even when I use a bit of the leave in conditioner on top of that, my curls look bushed out and not as smooth. Will be going back to the other conditioner, disappointed that I wasted money on this.",2.0
"Honestly, didn't see a big difference when I used the fibers without the spray. I just add a little spritz to my hair.",2.0
"Hurts my scalp, I feel it clogging up the pores on my head, I don't like using it, looking for a different spray. It does hold the shit there but so would any other spray adhesive shit. It smells and is painful to use for some reason maybe Im a puss idk. Id skip it",2.0
"Buyer be warned - this is just a ""mist"" or gel, not something to blacken your hairs",2.0
I was unable to get the bottle to spray - tired & tired.  Cannot put on hair any other way.,2.0

"This stuff is like the cheap hairspray you can get at a convenience store for $1.00... it came in the box and had leaked all over the bag, and the smell was that of cheap hairspray.  The leakage even melted off the beige banding and some of the text, and it was a super sticky mess.  I compared it with a high quality regular hairspray for the fibers sold by toppik and I prefer my slightly more expensive top of the line hairspray hands down.  Thankfully I was refunded due to the leakage issue and frustration, but even without it, I won't even consider buying it again.... definitely not for 10 bucks for a 4 oz tiny bottle.  Yuck.",2.0
"Hold good, but smells weird.",2.0
The hair spray smells like a man's hair spray.,2.0
"too expensive, similar brands available with better quality for much lesser price like x-fusion",2.0
Don't really use it.  Not much different than hair spray,2.0
"First off, the Toppik Fibers are a great product and I couldn't be more satisfied. However, the ""Fiberhold Spray"" is just like any other strong hairspray. I'm a guy with long hair, so it's somewhat inconvenient for me to use hairspray (I normally leave it natural). I found that the moisture of the hairspray made the fibers actually clump more, so I stopped using it after a week and I've had no problems with the fibers. The most disappointing aspect of this product is it's alcohol-based, which can dry the shafts out and make your hair break easier (not to mention it burns my sensitive scalp). Hairspray would be good for activities where you'll sweat, but I'd recommend using a non-alcohol spray .",2.0
"This is no better than any other hair spray.  Just buy some generic spray on sale at the drug store.  The Toppik fibers, hair fattener and pump attachment are really good products.",2.0
"It's simply a hairspray, nothing special about it. If you really think this hair spray has a different chemical to bond to the toppik better then purchase it. I would compare this hair spray with any other strong hold hair spray you can buy anywhere. I don't want to burst your bubble and say Santa don't exist. I was one of those guys dooped thinking this hair spray was different. Save your money and just use your existing hair spray. Honestly, I want my money back but I already paid for the dumb shipping and handling fee so I'm stuck with it. Anyone want a buy a used Toppik Hairspray?",2.0
"Bought at my dermotologist's office - I think it was $40.
Sooo not worth it.
Many other products seem to work better.

Used to one week straight. Minimal results.
Used after that week sporadically. Little impact.",2.0
Color and consistency of makeup was great but packaging is so poor and product made me break out :( love stila though!,2.0
This is the second colour I've tried and it just doesn't feel or look natural. It's either too much or too little. I like Still lip/ cheek tints and tinted moiseriser. This just didn't do anything for me.,2.0
"The product ""Stila Illuminating Liquid Foundation"" is incredibly watered down. Feels like you're putting paint on your face, as you actually feel it dripping down your skin as you apply. At the same time, it feels heavy and sticky once applied. That being said, I was quite surprised to see how flawless my skin looked after using it. But if you're looking for something that will wear all day, this isn't it.",2.0

When I tried this, it looked too fake. I tried the liquid foundation alone with my Marutaki Rice Powder I got some time ago from the VT Country Store. Better, but still too shiny for my taste. I ended up sending it back.

Right now I've decided to wear (in this order) moisturizer, the Stila Beauty Balm, my Walmart liquid foundation topped with the powder version of the Illuminating Foundation. I top everything off with the Marutaki Rice Powder because it gives a nice matte finish. Sounds like a lot, but it works and looks really natural blended well.",2.0
I got mine to pink,2.0
"It's an okay blush. Applying it is painful whether it's done by finger, brush or sponge applicator. I've noticed using either of the aforementioned tools that the clean-up after applying this is just a goopy mess. Doesn't last long on the lips at all. There's no delicate way to layer this color without rubbing my cheek raw trying to blend it in.",2.0
"I'm disappointed.  I have tried over-applying to get enough color, and it looks great on lips and cheeks for a bit.  But it fades in no time and constant reapplying removes the BB cream foundation I use, so then I look like I forgot to apply my makeup as flaws and discoloration become more apparent.  I got Petunia, which is a bright peachy color. Very pretty and just right for my coloring if it would just stay.  I'm just not loving it and will continue to search for a long-lasting cream or stain blush that is right for older skin.  It's time for me to avoid powders, but I'm sure struggling with this.",2.0
Color was a lot brighter than expected when I put it on. Wish I could return it.,2.0
"I thought for the money that I would really like this. I don't. I tried to apply some to my cheeks and barely got any color at all. So I rubbed my fingers on a little longer and applied....still barely any color. I was hoping for more considering I paid $20. Not impressed.
Note to Self: Just cause you pay more, doesn't mean you get a good product. Sometimes the cheaper stuff works better! (I bought a $7 bronzer by Rimmel and I love it) haha",2.0
Just doesn't stay on me.... The color fades quickly.,2.0

Package came open. A factory seal under the twist off lid is standard.. really weirded out that this is already open. It means a) this products has been used or tested.

"This is very overpriced here on Amazon, which is disappointing. You might as well buy it at a department store. They might even have it on sale.

So one star for pricing and 4.5 stars for the product.",2.0

"Scent is so subjective. What you love, someone else hates...and vice versa.

Unfortunately, Eternity wasn't a good fit for my husband. I didn't mind the initial woodsy, musky notes of the cologne, but as the fragrance lingered, the smell became much too feminine for my manly, outdoorsy kind of guy. And, he didn't like any of it...first spray or lingering scent.",2.0

It does moisturize my hands well, and protects them during the winder when I am likely to get cracked skin at my knuckles from driving with the heat on too high.

Skip this whole line if you are sensitive to scents. If you aren't, I'd recommend going to a store and finding the scents you like first - they are very hit or miss!",3.0

This toothpaste is okay but I didn't use it very long. I didn't like to texture (I know that's a little weird).,3.0
"Even tho' this product gives a very cinnamony flavor and leaves your mouth feeling clean, it falls off the toothbrush and comes out of the tube in little clumps.  It can't compare to the mint  that I used previously, which performed like regular toothpaste, which was creamy and had no problem staying on the brush.",3.0
"I used Supersmile for a couple of months.  I was delighted with my new smile--brighter and whiter, without that unnaturally bleached look.  Fine.  I was a bit worried about Supersmile's efficacy as a toothpaste, but my teeth looked great.

Then I discovered the Crest 3D line.  Wow.  Not only did 3D whiten my teeth beyond Supersmile, I trust Crest for dental hygiene.  The Supersmile is cosmetic, the Crest is great toothpaste.  I kept the Supersmile I already has for emergencies, but I'm sold on Crest 3D.  And it's way less expensive than Supersmile.  Win all around!

Just for the record, I used Supersmile a couple of years before Crest came out with the 3D.  My dentist  never commented on any problems nor did I develop any cavities.  I am not connected with Crest, its parent company or any affiliates, either",3.0
"I had developed staining on my teeth from prescription Peridex.  I had researched potential products to treat this.  I expected more from this product particularly considering the cost.  After one week of continuous use, I was disappointed.  I then purchased Colgate Optic white and achieved much better results.",3.0
I'm not sure if I really see a great difference in whitening of my teeth...a little disappointed with this toothpaste.,3.0
Item received was runny compared to my previous tube.  Hope it works as well but don't feel very confident it will.,3.0
"I guess my teeth were already white enough.  Did not see much improvement.  My wife did, but she has never used a whitening product before.  Stick with Colgate Optic White.",3.0
"Supersmile is expensive toothpaste, but the question is, is it worth the price? Answer, maybe. I have used this product off and on for several years. I find that with repeated usage it will lighten the teeth several shades, so it does work better than regular whitening toothpastes. For the best results though, one has to use this toothpaste in conjunction with bleaching, proper dietary habits, flossing, etc. for the overall whitest teeth. Even doing all the above, I have never gotten my teeth to the dazzling whiteness, as seen on TV. I guess for that one must go to veneers, sigh. This product has a nice cinnamon taste, and it is purportedly easier on ones tooth enamel than regular toothpaste. The downside is that it is expensive, and I don't think that it is the miracle product as portrayed on infomercials. Your results may be better than mine, because everyone's teeth varies in ease of whitening. I have found that bleaching works best for me overall, but Supersmile is certainly the best whitening toothpaste currently available. My suggestion is to give it a try and see how it works for you.",3.0
I don't see evidence of this product whitening my teeth and it's been a month of using it. May have to try the whole system.  I only ordered the toothpaste.,3.0
"I've had this product for about a month, I use it twice a day. I was hoping it would make my teeth whiter. It did a little but I was expecting more. Perhaps it will take more than a month. I would try over the counter, less expensive before using this.",3.0
"I have been using this product for some time now and have seen no significant improvement in the color of my teeth. It might work for those that do not smoke or drink coffe, but I do and It's just not working.",3.0
It works exactly like a regular whitening tooth paste. You don't need to pay this much money to get the same result you can get from the one you get for couple dollars in your grocery store. I am not going to order it anymore.,3.0
"This cinnamon toothpaste is a very savory and surprisingly almost natural tasting toothpaste. I cannot say that I actually love the whitening in Supersmile toothpastes, but they do not contain silica or SLS. The cinnamon flavor in this is so bold that I smelled it through Amazon's packaging. The essential oils were leaking through the metal tab on the tubes opening. It was more runny and liquid than the Mandarin Mint and had a better mouth-feel. It applied very smoothly.",3.0
So far i have been using this toothpaste for about a week about 3 x a day. The tube is not that big. Just like a regular sized tube of toothpaste. I have seen a small difference in my teeth but nothing too spectacular. I think it probably works better with the other products with i did not purchase. This product is ok but nothing special.,3.0
I love Supersmile toothpaste! I have always been extremely satisfied with the quality of their products. This one was a bit disappointing due to it seemed not to be mixed well (part of the tube was liquid and part was super hard paste material). I also didn't notice the whitening with this one nearly as drastically. The cinnamon flavor was great fro freshening breath though.,3.0
"... not so great toothpaste. I have been using Supersmile for a little over a year now, brushing twice a day, flossing, and rinsing as well. Within the first month of use, I noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth, and my mouth certainly felt clean; a year later, my teeth couldn't look any whiter without using professional whitening methods, but I still developed cavities.

I showed the toothpaste to my dentist and he told me he was actually impressed with how white my teeth became just from a toothpaste. After reading the bottle though, he cautioned me to find a better toothpaste to use intermittently, particularly, Arm & Hammer's Complete Care toothpaste. As I said, despite religious use of the product, I still have cavities, and I don't eat much sugar.

Supersmile does its job far better than many other whitening toothpastes. I haven't yet found a toothpaste that could get my teeth this white. Just use it with caution, it doesn't have the same cleaning properties that most other toothpastes do. My dentist suggested continued use of Supersmile, but to use it only every other time; Supersmile in the morning, Arm & Hammer at night. My teeth still look great, and they couldn't be healthier!",3.0
"The toothpaste is okay, I don't feel that my teeth are clean after I use it, so I have to use another brand of toothpaste after I brush with Supersmile. Maybe I should have gotten the accelerator to use with it.",3.0
"I bought this lotion after trying it on my hands at a friends house and absolutely loved it. I used it as body lotion and within days I started itching all over. I use lotion all the time. Don't consider myself to have sensitive skin so I am not sure what happened here. I stopped using it, rash and itching went away. Started using it again it came back. I can use it on my hands and that's it. Totally bummed. I paid 25$ for it. Love the fragrance it's very unique and earthy.",3.0
"There was a giant dent in the side of the can which was not so great since I was giving this as a Christmas gift. Otherwise, the smell was great.",3.0
"I love the Archipelago lotions.  However, I will only buy them directly from Archipelago.  The lotion arrived in a padded mailer, wrapped in a thin piece of plastic.  It was dented and lotion was leaking from the lid.  Archipelago does a fabulous job of wrapping the items.  Totally not worth saving a few dollars to buy from anyplace else. I have read the reviews and see that this is not an uncommon problem.",3.0
"Not as ""minty"" as I had hoped.",3.0
This lotion is good because of the refreshing smell. Not so much the moisturizing quality. It's very expensive as well.,3.0
It's okay. But it was annoying to find other places with lower prices.,3.0
"This is pretty strong at first, but it dies out really quick.  The Price is reasonable, however, but it is not my favorite scent.  I do still wear it occasionally as I will receive compliments.",3.0
"Wearing Calvin Klein One does not seem to illicit much response from others.  I find it kind of sweet, and prefer a fresher smell like the Nautica Classic. The CK is not over-bearing and lingers just a little while--maybe 3 hours. If you are looking for a smell that defines you, I would not use this one.  It seems pretty bland and forgettable.",3.0
"The scent seems to change between putting it on and wearing throughout the day.  It starts off sweet but gets more musky as time goes on.  That musky smell is a bit too strong and a bit un-natural for my tastes.  I'm sure I'll wear it again on occasion, but it isn't something I'd want to wear every day.",3.0
"ck one opens with a blast of pineapple and bergamot, and the sillage of an aircraft carrier.  About ten minutes in, the fruits yield to a heady rose, and for a moment the fragrance is heart-breakingly gorgeous.  But the rose fades quickly into the background with the other quiet florals.  Grassy notes spring up, followed by a whisper of cardamom and the chypre of oakmoss.  After a while, the grasses fade and the cardamom quietens.  What's left is a mossy citrus.

This eau de toilette surprisingly lasts all day, and most people will find it pleasant.  It is a classic sort of fragrance, but not an outstanding one.  It is nice, but not memorable.  It's the kind of signature scent one wears if one wants to wear a signature similar to everyone else's.",3.0
"The Calvin Klein ck one fragrance is marketed as gender neutral -- designed to be shared -- worn by either a man or woman. Among many included components, the citrus and green notes definitely create a crisp and fresh fragrance but the other prominent scents are floral -- lily-of-the-valley, jasmine and rose. This is where there may be a problem selling it to both genders.

Granted, so much of this is subjective  what we think smells good  so what may not work for one person is perfect for another, but for me, the florals are too noticeable. Neither gender residing in the household liked the fragrance  the male definitely would not even consider using the product and the female disliked the noticeable lily-of-the-valley floral.

The visual presentation is understated and classic -- frosted glass fashioned into a classic bottle shape with a brushed silver-toned metal top and sprayer packaged in a simple white box featuring an embossed impression of the bottle. The spray is released in a very fine mist and because it is Ea de Toilette the fragrance strength is light. After an hour a small spray on my arm had almost completely dissipated -- little scent remained.

To create this gender-free scent, ingredients typically used in male fragrances are combined with components typically used in female fragrances. The idea of a unisex scent is not new, but successfully creating one that actually appeals to both genders requires balance. The end result of this fragrance stew is not unpleasant, but in my view is decidedly feminine.",3.0
"Smells nice but I didn't notice this was deodorant only, not anti-perspirant.  It was my mistake for ordering as it's clearly stated in the description that it's deodorant only.",3.0

"I'm not sure if it's just the fact that I am not able to smell it after awhile, but I am fairly certain the fragrance doesn't last as long as it should. I've used CK products before and they have never diminished after one 8-hour shift. Anyone else experiencing this issue?",3.0
I love the smell of ck one and I was very excited to find this deodorant. I was disappointed. Although it works perfectly for the first couple of hours it doesn't last. The deodorant works but I started feeling 'sticky' which made me paranoid. I spent too much money on it to have that feeling.,3.0

I don't know why some people think it's a fake, but it's not. I just received mine today, and it's the same as the one I saw in target. The only reason I'm giving this a 3 star is because of the shipping. I've prime, so I was suppose to receive this last week. It came 10 days later. Kind of disappointed it.

And yes, it does come with a spray. I'm not sure if I'll spray it around like that.",3.0

"I wasn't expecting this scent to smell the way it does, I bought it blindly just based on the reviews and because the price was pretty good, it smells like alcohol at first, but after i let it sit for like a week, i went back to smell it and it smelled good. I wore it to work one morning and i didn't get a reaction of how good i smell like i usually do when i wear my burberry brit or hot water, but later in the day a couple ladies said i smelled pleasant. So its not to shabby i guess. Nothing i would bend over backwards to get though.",3.0

I bought this iron 10 yrs ago & it lasted the test if time! So i bought it for my teen daughter & i feel the product is now being poorly made because a piece of it literally came off of the handle as i was using it. Never been dropped or mishandled.  Shame cause this was my go to for years!,3.0
"I purchased this flat iron originally in 2013, and it lasted almost 2 years. Pretty good lifespan for a $20 item. The hinge pin came out, and I replaced it with the same flat iron. My second one lasted 10 months. Still not shabby, but a little annoying. Same problem, pin came out that holds the two pieces together. Again, I replaced with an identical model. My third flat iron lasted 2 weeks and stopped heating up. Amazon replaced it right away. The pin fell out of my 4th flat iron after 1 week. Again, Amazon replaced it immediately. I'm currently on my 5th flat iron, and the pin fell out after a month of use. Instead of giving up like I should, I decided to wrap tape around the hinge to keep it together. I still love how it works on my hair, it's hard to find an inexpensive flat iron with wide plates, and my hair doesn't get caught in it. The construction is VERY poor, though. They desperately need to redesign the hinge. I will not be purchasing this item again, 5 is my limit. I guess I'll just have to go frizzy.",3.0
"Started off being great, but now it doesn't get hot enough",3.0
"Works very well for thick hair. I've been using it for 11 years and never have been able to find one that works as well for my thick hair. BUT, one major con is that it's SUPER FRAGILE and breaks VERY EASILY so you have to be careful to not drop it. I order a new one every 3 months because it always breaks, but I'm not able to find another hair iron as good as this.",3.0
I would give this 5 stars because it does do a good job but it did break a month after buying.  I was able to exchange with no problems.  I'm just afraid it's going to not last very long.,3.0
"This is my favorite straightner. Works good with coarse hair. However, I have had to order several of these because the screw that holds it together keeps breaking.",3.0
Item did not heat up enough...surprising since I usually have no problems with Hot Tools....i will most likely reorder since I think I just received a  faulty one.,3.0
"This is the second set I've bought from this company. I also bought one from another dealer and they all have broken in the bend of the flat iron. This is a manufacturing defect that needs to be fixed. I believe it breaks in that area because of the amount of weight it has to support. I keep buying these because they are the only ones thay will staighten my hair like I want it but I WILL NOT be buying th any longer. If you buy these, I recommend keeping them layed on their side (even when on) in order for it to last longer otherwise they will break after about 6_8 months",3.0

"I have to say this is one of the best flat irons I've ever used. I have very thick wavy hair and I found that this was able to keep my hair straight for a couple of days. Which was great because I don't like straightening my hair every single day. Unfortunately I'm currently on my third one. While this flat iron really gets the job done, the design is really clunky and IT PULLS YOUR HAIR! Plus it starts falling apart after repeated use (which is why i'm on my third in the past 5 years). This might be a good buy if you don't plan on straightening your hair very often, but if you're like me and you HAVE to have your hair straight, then perhaps you should look at a flat iron with a better design. After my latest one breaks, I'll be looking at different brands.",3.0
"This brand of flat iron is hard to find now a days, so I was stoked when I found it for a good price on Amazon. However, it's not nearly as awesome as I remember. There are gaps and cracks that my hair gets stuck in. I don't think the last one I had was like that. It was delivered to me in a very timely fashion though so that was nice.",3.0
"I used my sister in law's ceramic hot tools flat iron with great results.  This one just doesn't cut it.  I have very thick, wavy hair that is easily destroyed by humidity.  This one does not leave my hair as smooth as ceramic flat irons and it also takes a few passes instead of just one to get it straight.  If you have fine hair that doesn't have humidity problems I think this one would be fine for you, but it's not great on thick, wavy hair.  It is definitely better than my old Conair one, though.",3.0
"I used this straightener while on a recent vacation with friends and I loved how I only had to make one pass on my hair to get it silky smooth and shiny. However, there seems to be some issue with quality control as the unit I received does not seem to get nearly as hot and I have to go over the same section a few times. I will say it performs better than other straighteners I've owned.",3.0
"I was pretty excited to receive this Hot Tools flat iron. I had used my ConAir one for about 2 years before I wanted something that had more heat and could straighten my hair even if it was slightly damp.  Well, this flat iron did exactly that, for about 6 months. It left my hair shiny, straight, and ridiculously soft.  I used it once every 2 days, for about 5 months (being that for a whole month I was out of the country) and now the thing won't even heat up.  I leave it plugged in for 20 minutes and its still as cold as ice. Also, the on and off button keeps sliding so when you're using the straightener you'll find it goes cold sometimes because the switch has been turned off.  If you're looking for something to last, I wouldn't invest my money in this one.",3.0
"I have just used up my first jar of Calm Cool & Corrected which lasted about 2 months using it sparingly morning and night.  I have rosacea and peri-oral dermatitis with severe peeling and redness.  This product was very soothing and definitely helped the redness.  It also did not cause any acne breakouts.  I was disappointed, however, in the moisturizing effect of this product.  It isn't very hydrating and didn't help the severe peeling in my T-zone. If the product helped the dryness and peeling along with it's positive effect on the redness, I would probably try another jar.  However, I just can't bring myself to get hooked on a product that's going to cost me $500 plus a year to use.",3.0

I apply at night after a shower and I wake up with odor, idk if it's making me smell because I'm not sweating at night. You can try to reapply but it does nothing because it has no scent so it doesn't cover any odor. Reapplying does not help. It's a shame because this helped so much with my burning breakouts but not for odors, now I have to search for something else.",3.0

"I bought this product from Sephora and have been diligently using it for about a month now. Along with this product, I have been exfoliating with a 2% salicyclic scrub every other day. I noticed the bumps on my arms have significantly decreased as well as the red spots that have plagued my upper arms. But now that I have run out of this product, I decided to try something else that would be cheaper. I bought an over the counter (Vaseline) moisturizer with cocoa butter and have been using this daily as well as continuing my exfoliation. It works just as well. I think the key to KP control is exfoliation with salicyclic acid and constant moisturizing. I have very little bumps now and the redness have decreased by 50%. I am very happy with the results. So although this product worked well, a consistent regiment is key.",3.0
"I've almost finished my first tube of KP, and while my arms are smoother and softer than they've ever been, I can't get rid of the redness. I'm not sure if that's what this lotion is intended to do, but after reading some of the reviews, I thought maybe that'd be my results as well. Good stuff, but I'm not sure I'll buy it again. Might try a cheap alpha hydroxy lotion from the grocery store, as another reviewer suggested.",3.0
"There are other glycolic acid products available that work equally as well for half the price. Additionally, there are lactic acid products that also work. This product is no better than cheaper options. Don't waste your money. Ask your dermatologist for suggestions, or simply do a google search for other more budget-friendly options.",3.0
i have used it for almost two weeks and haven't seen much difference.. i'm still hoping in time it will be worth the price.,3.0

"I've only been using the product for about a week and, while my skin is softer, the product is noticably lacking a warning of some kind... if you apply the lotion to ANY sort of broken skin (read: even after shaving your legs) it burns like CRAZY.

Why is this happening I have always used it on the hottest setting and I have checked the iron to make sure it's not dirty or has anything on the barrel.  I want to order another one but now I am afraid. DO they only last a year or less?,3.0
It was ok until something inside broke this morning. The whole barrel wiggles and tilts now and I'm scared to use it because it looks like it could just fall apart. I've purchased other marcel irons that have last MUCH longer. I only used this 3 times a week.,3.0
Don't hold a curl and not professional as mentioned.,3.0

It was a gift to me and I've used it for a few years now but I have not been able to get used to it! (I haven't got a new one because I'm cheap). Maybe it's just me. I like holding the top of my regular curling iron because I feel like I have more control. When I'm only using one hand I don't feel like I'm getting exactly what I want.  I still burn myself on the tip of it almost every time I use it. If it works for you, that's great. I suppose to each is their own.",3.0
"Works well and all but has no plastic tip and the part that is suppose to keep your hair in place on the rod doesn't have a spring. You have to open it AND hold it closed.

My rating has to do more with ease of use than the quality, love the varying tempatures and the way my curls look.",3.0
"Thr handles were a  bakelight finish ,Like that of a phone .When turning  it does not move  as easily.  .Also the temperature could  be hotter. Product arrived on time",3.0
"The iron heats up well, but unless you are used to using this type of iron, it may be difficult.  I probably could get used to it but I don't curl my hair everyday so I probably don't use it enough to do that.  I don't like that it doesn't have a cool touch tip on it either.",3.0
I am unsure of how to work this properly.  It is not intuitive.  It tells you in the directions that it takes awhile to get used to.  But I find myself going back to my old straightener instead of taking the time to make it work the way I would like.,3.0
"I read a lot about this product before I purchased it, and I was sure I would love it.  I've been using it for about a month and a half, and I have yet to see any remarkable results.  I guess the pores around my nose are a little smaller, but that is a bit of a stretch.  The product smells kind of funky, and tends to peel off when you apply another product on top of it (like a tinted moisturizer).  I tried using less of the product and I still got the makeup peeling.

Love O.P.I.  Have been wearing it for years. On the screen the shade looked like a light pink...the reason I purchased it. When it arrived it was actually coral...a shade I don't wear.,3.0
you need three coats for it to look right. ends up being too thick & peeling off a few days later no matter what you do. super cute color though.,3.0
"Wonderful quality. I personallt found it little overpriced, but still a quality product.",3.0
The small thumbnail I see on this review is accurate but the photo that was set for this color is no where close to be correct. The color is more of a pastel pink than a bright salmon.,3.0
Great color for summer or warmer temps however it chips easily.,3.0
Not as cool toned brown as i expected. Its a little warmer so appears as a dark mauvy brown. other wise OPI polish quality is great,3.0
"Passion is a pale, sheer peach.  I prefer a cool-toned pink.",3.0
"First I'll say I love OPI nail polish.  But, Pirouette My Whistle was not at all what it looks like. It's glitter in clear, not metallic polish plus glitter.  It's hardly visible unless light hits just right.  It's very rough on the nail surface after it dries.  I'm talking snag knit fabric rough.  Definitely needs lots of top  coat.",3.0
"The polish was way brighter then It looked on-line, and it did not go on as smooth as other products I have used.  It was just o.k.  Don't think I will buy again though.",3.0
Chips SUPER fast. But LOVE the color,3.0
Not a full bottle,3.0
This is the same colour as Lincoln Park After Dark. Save your money if you already have Lincoln Park After Dark.,3.0
"I was expecting a deeper, darker color. Too reddish....",3.0
Online color not as depicted,3.0
Product was already drying in the bottle when I received it. Only got a few uses out of it before it became unusable.,3.0
Not color or was expecting,3.0
"When I viewed this online I loved the color, ordered it, did my nails.  WOW!  If I was going to a Holloween party it would be perfect. It's very neon.  Not the same color in the bottle picture.  I've ordered O.P.I. polish before on Amazon and they were exactly as pictured, sooo buyer beware.  I may wear this again or not.",3.0
a little dried out and gooey.. not a fresh bottle of polish.  But I love the color.,3.0
"I love the quality of the product, but it really doesn't show up like its picture here. It's actually a bit more salmon in color, and not as pinkish as it is in the picture. Still pretty, but not what I was expecting.",3.0
Thinner than other opi product I've used before,3.0
"Nice color but much brighter than expected,",3.0
"I have been wearing OPI Mod About You for many years, sometimes there is a slight variation in color, but still a pale pink, this particular batch is a darker pink, not really an ugly pink but not the pink that I normally get or was expecting. Will not but again.",3.0
It is not like OMG wow! But it is good!,3.0
Gift,3.0
I thought this was a sheer color. It is Opaque.,3.0
The polish color is wonderful I gave fewer stars for the packing was not safe,3.0
"I love this color, however, it chips very easily compared to the many other OPI nail polishes that I have.  I have tried applying it every which way, but it always chips within a day.  Maybe I received an old or defective bottle?  I have the Nordic collection, Cuckoo For This Color, and St. Petersburgundy which I wear often, all of which lasts at least a couple of weeks before they begin to chip or wear down.  I'm really sad that this color doesn't last.  It takes several coats and a long time to dry, so I won't be wearing it much at all since the amount of work put into the application isn't worth the incredibly short life it has on my nails.",3.0
"The color looses a bit of it's 'pop' when it's actually worn.  It also takes a miminum of 3 coats, 4 would be better, to get good coverage.  It's nice but could be better.",3.0
NOT QUITE AS BRIGHT AS I WANTED BUT THE USUAL EXCELLENT OPI QUALITY.,3.0
"I thought I would love this colour more...
The problem is that it takes a LOT of coats to show...and if you have pale feet -- forget it!
Once I got a little tan, it was cute...but not my fave by a long shot.
If you like ""subtle"" toes, you might like it more than I do.",3.0
You need 3 coats to get close to the color in the bottle.,3.0
Periwinkle.  Was expecting more of a primary blue.,3.0
Color was darker than I expected.,3.0
This is more pink than I thought. Okay though. Saturated color.,3.0
The color is more orangey that it appears online which is not a good color for me.,3.0
This polish looks much better in the ads than it does on my nails. Color is not the same as shown in online ads.,3.0
The color is a little transparent which I do not like.  It took multiple coats to obtain the color as a solid.,3.0
"Color was fairly deep and gave full coverage after only 2 coats. When viewed in the bottle the polish appears to have a subtle, pearlescent shimmer. Unfortunately, once applied this effect was almost completely lost. I was left with plain purple nails, which was rather boring.",3.0
"I love OPI products.  The picture of this color is deceiving and it's not what I expected.  It will be a good color to try once I get a little tanner, I think I'm far too pale skinned to wear it right now.  I'll return and rate it once I've worn it.",3.0
nice color,3.0
"Beautiful color, can not last long",3.0
I literally have no idea why it doesn't have a good quality as I expected. I heard that OPI is a good brand in nail polishes but it takes a long time to dry and doesn't go smoothly on my nails. I love the color but this is not what I expected.,3.0
More salmon than the illustrated color. Flat. No pizzazz,3.0
"The polish I received looks nothing like the color depicted in photo.

With two coats this is a see through, shimmering, lavender shade.
This is not an opaque polish.",3.0
Not as bright or vibrant as I had hoped it would be--kinda flat salmon.,3.0
Wasn't the same color as the picture!,3.0
"I thought it would be just silver glitter, no other colors.",3.0
Good color! Had weird red spot in it. Mixed it up and is better. Love opi polish,3.0
"Ordered this for my fiancee last week. She said it's a nice color, but she complained that it is much more silver-y than it looks in the photo and she was looking for something more blue.",3.0
"I am a huge fan of shimmer, holographic, and (some) glitter polishes. OPI's ""Simmer and Shimmer"" looks better in the bottle, in my opinion... It has beautiful colors in the bottle, but when applied, it is very gritty in texture. I applied several coats of clear polish to try to make it smooth. Not only was that barely successful, it took a very long time to remove! I had to use straight acetone and a textured brillo pad- it was still difficult. So if you like the textured feel, then this is for you- I just prefer the smooth finish. Again, this was pretty, just too textured for me personally. Since receiving this, I have been checking out images of the original version of this, and since the two are not at all similar, they should have given this new version a different name.",3.0
"This shade is more pink than the original. I liked the more orange tones in the old one, sucks that they changed it.",3.0
It's good quality and all but came very pink instead of nude looking. I have always gotten this color on my toes at nail salons so I decided to order it but I knew of this problem before but was hoping mine would be more on the nude side.,3.0
"I Think in Pink was so sheer that I originally questioned if it was actually OPI and not a fake, but after reading various trustworthy online reviews, I found that it's simply the way this color is formulated.  I was hoping for a more color on the first coat, but it does have a pretty sheer pink on coat one and is true to color by coat three.  It's not what I expected so I'm dropping it two stars - I expected more out of my OPI polish.",3.0
I love OPI nail polish. I ordered youve got nata on me because it looked like a pretty shade of pink. This is a very light pink with a tan nude base. Its not a bad color just not what the picture shows.,3.0
Pretty color but sparlkly. Not what I expected from looking at the picture.,3.0
"I loved it, just hard to get the sparkles on your nails. Had to pick them & place them on my nails myself.
Also was shipped pretty fast. Thank You!",3.0
"Different from the color I thought I was ordering.  Still, it's pretty",3.0
"Bubble bath is a pretty color, but, this nail polish is not quality (2 layers in the photo). My picture is the third attempt, as the polish is not typical OPI consistency. However, as an ivory/neutral skin tone - I think it looks great, it's a nice dainty pink.",3.0
not for me,3.0
Different color than at the nail salon,3.0
"I gave this 3 stars because the polish is thin and requires more than 2 coats or it streaks. However, once you build up the color with extra coats it is a beautiful shade.",3.0
The color is bright bubble gum pink. The online color swatch was totally incorrect. I like this color but it wasn't what I wanted for this purchase. The polish itself was really thick but still smooth. My other fresh OPI polishes are smooth but NOT thick. Make sure you want bubble gum pink as your color before ordering this item.,3.0
"The texture of the liquid sand was kinda cool and I like the color, but even with a top coat, it looks dull.  I like shiny nails, so I didn't really like this polish.  This polish is in the Minnie Couture set if you want to just try it in the mini bottle.",3.0
"Absolutely LOVED the color and the way it looks on my nails.  The only reason that I didn't give this more than three stars is that each time I put this on the color started to come off after about 5 days and considering how expensive OPI nail polish is, I find that unacceptable.",3.0
Nice colour but it stains my nails. Some nails became orange and I can not remove the colour . .,3.0
"This nail color is a bit watery, however when added as a top coat to purples and darker reds it adds a bit of flash that is beautiful. Shipping was prompt and on time also.",3.0
"Well, OPI is suppose to be great nail color - I guess it's ok, I don't see the big deal about it though that people seem to think is worth spending the extra dollars. I buy this because it is not tested on animals.",3.0
color is not capture correctly on the picture.,3.0
Color was much lighter than it looked in the photo.  Waste of money because I'll never use it.,3.0
"This would look better on longer nails. I am pretty pale and I don't think this looks the best on me because u can't even tell I am wearing it unless you look.
And it not super pigmented. The picture of my nails has 4 coats on. And a top coat over it. I would recommend wearing white under it. Or at least a base coat.",3.0
"Really disappointed in color and consistency.  Much thinner than expected and certainly orange, like Halloween orange, not copper at all.",3.0
Just what I wanted.  Took longer to get here than  2 days.,3.0
"I purchased this color hoping I would finally find the right kind of ""gray."" All the grays I've always purchased end up being either too blue or too white and streaky. Unfortunately, this was too blue. The picture was definitely misleading, since the nails look much more gray than mine did. Maybe with a slight undertone of blue, if even that. But, the color I received was definitely blue. Maybe, it was just my bottle? Looking at some of the other reviews though, I don't think so... Also, the application of it was a little streaky. I definitely needed to apply three coats.

Whenever I wear it, people ask what kind of blue polish I am wearing. The only gray I ever see is when the lighting is dark, and there is a ""pearl"" effect which gives it a bit of a gray shine. If you're looking for more of a light blue with a hint of gray undertone, this would be perfect. It has a nice pearly shine to it too.

Otherwise, I am still on the hunt for my perfect gray.",3.0
"I found this color to be more of a light blue than grey.  Not really what I was looking for, but not a terrible color.",3.0
Very translucent,3.0
"Opi always makes good quality polishes. I thought this would dry a purplish blue like it appears in the bottle, but it actually looks almost black when dried. Very dark blue with no purple.",3.0
"I got the Barefoot in Barcelona thinking was a neutral with some pink in it. When I put it on my nail to test it, it was more of a brown mauve/dark dusty rose color. I'm having a hard time giving it an exact description, but it is not a light color by any means. More of a fall color I think. One coat was alright on my nails and I think two coats would have made it a little darker. OPI is great and I enjoy using their products, but this just wasn't the color I wanted. Too bad I can't return it!",3.0
Great,3.0
This was my first OPI Polish so I had high expectations. The Polish went on nicely but the color is not as shown. I expected a nice pink /coral color. The color is definitely more of a hot pink. So far I've had it on one day with no top coat and no chipping so far,3.0
"Way brighter then I thought, but thats why it is listed under brights lol  I guess I will stay with the more calmer colors.  Not bad though.",3.0
Nice bright white but it cracked on my nails.,3.0
Did not expect the subtle purple undertone.,3.0
not a full bottle,3.0
Nice color but I thought it would be darker.,3.0
Didn't even stay on a full day,3.0
"I love the color in the picture, but the actual product is more of a coral color.",3.0
The color is pretty but the polish was very old and thick. I was not impressed.,3.0
"The brand of the nail polish is great, however the color was not accurately represented on the picture. In stores and online, the color looks more salmon and in reality it was quite orange",3.0
Watered down product.,3.0
Comes with small and tiny sparkles.  Didn't hold up as most OPI polishes.,3.0
I think it is okay but needs more depth,3.0
"I really like OPI nail polishes, BUT I was very disappointed when I received this bottle.  Awhile back I purchased a bottle named ""Tickle My France-y"", which I really love.  It was more of a nude color.  I just got this bottle with the same name and it clearly is not the same shade.  It is more mauve in color (see pic).  I already have a bottle that is very similar to the new color.  Ignore the dry hands.  As you can see, these two colors are NOT the same.  Delivery was fine, got it as promised. I tried to exchange, but was unable to do so.  I could swear it said product was eligible for return.  Oh well, I'll give it to my mom.",3.0
The glitter pieces are very large and round.,3.0
Questioning the color,3.0
"This color (Tickle My France-y) was definitely not what I expected.  I don't know if it is an old batch or what but it's not my favorite.  MUCH more of a purple-mauve than any of the photos here appear.  I would not call this a neutral, really.  It's very purple to me.  It looks all right on my fair skin but I would not purchase this shade again in the future unless it was in person and the color appeared more neutral and muted.",3.0
shade ok but wanted a darker one.,3.0
"Nice polish. Pretty color, but it is lighter than the photo makes it look.",3.0
"Decent color, but a bit more orange than it looks here.  OPI needs to make their brushes a bit longer.",3.0
"Takes heavy application to get dark enough. Also, it is s bit streaky.",3.0
Lifts off some color pretty stay power not so much,3.0
"It's got a slight sparkle to it that I wasn't expecting, and it takes two coats to put a decent layer on your nail. For an OPI color, disappointing.",3.0
The color is very light. I find that I have to apply several coats to get good coverage.,3.0
"A nice color, perhaps a bit darker than expected.",3.0
Disappointed in the color and coverage.  Nail polish should be seen in a store.,3.0
Looks completely black when it's on my nails.,3.0
"Like so many OPI colors I have tried, the polish is a beautiful shade but the quality is just not what it should be...hardly lasts a week without chipping, even with great care and a perfect manicure.",3.0
this color was too clear,3.0
This brand nail polish is very good but this color was just too dark for my taste.,3.0
This Passion is so much more pinkish than the one I bought at a cosmetic store.,3.0
Its different color on the picture and what i got !,3.0
"Ordered ""Raisen the bar"" nail polish because I thought it was more of a dark eggplant/plum color.

It turned out more dark scarlet (more magenta than plum)

Still a beautiful color, but not what I was expecting compared the advertised pictures.",3.0
"The color of this polish is really pretty, it's a soft white that is really really shimmery. The problem is that it's really thin and takes at least 3 coats to get a solid color. I usually love this brand and I have about a dozen different colors and most of them aren't like this but this one is next to useless, especially for nail art.",3.0
"Color: Hold out for more
The color itself is very gorgeous(in between jacinth and Chinese red), but unlike other opi polishes I purchased, its too thick to apply on the nails. Wonder why this formula is SO different compare to the others",3.0
"Bought the primer and top coat to go with this.  It just didn't stay on more than a couple of days without chipping.  I will give it another try.  My nails are very thin, so someone with stronger nails may not have this issue.",3.0
Love the brand and the color is fun.,3.0
great for polish,3.0
Darker than expected.,3.0
"Love the color, but the brush is not like my other OPI brushes. The nail polish was also not as thick or long lasting. Of other opi nail polishes. Disappointed in this purchase.",3.0
"The color is a lot darker than I expected. It looks very bright on the product page, but it's darker in person.",3.0
"I have used several different OPI nail polishes.  Although I like the subtle shade of pink (You Can Count on It), this polish is difficult to apply.  It comes on streaky, and I have to apply three coats to get adequate coverage.  I didn't notice any difference in durability or longevity.",3.0
A little too pink for me - that's the trouble with buying online,3.0
"It is more like a gel, not solid color. But works well.",3.0
nice color but chips easily even with two coats,3.0
"There's something off with this particular color.  I have another color from the OPI Infinite Shine line that I love.  Not only is the texture different with this one, but unlike most nail polishes (even my my other OPI Infinite Shine), this one does not have the beads in the bottom to help blend/smooth when shaking.  That may be why it feels much thicker and harder to apply.  I really like the color itself but it also chips way too easily.",3.0
Not as bright as I would like it to be. Had a dark hue to it,3.0
"I love the Infinite Shine products generally, but this particular color surprised me a bit.  I expected it to be a true gray, but on my nails it came across as a blue-silver.  It's a pretty color, but comes across a little bold for day to day office wear.  I would recommend it for a cocktail party, night out, or even as a wedding guest.  Or for the more bold, as a daily color if you like sparkly silver in your day! :)",3.0
Don't like this new line of polish. It is like trying to spread molasses on your nails.,3.0
"Color is not as depicted in picture. I thought it was a subtle coral, but it turned out to be a bright tangerine orange.",3.0
"Pretty color, but almost impossible to remove!  Really stains the nail and cuticles and I have a really hard time getting the color off.",3.0
"This is one of my favorite OPI colors and it historically lasts on my toes until the next pedicure. I have had the same bottle forever so I decided to purchase a new one on AMAZON because it was such a great deal. (I always bring my own polish to the nail salon as sometimes they do not have my favorite toe nail color ""Dutch Tulips."") I brought my newly purchased nail polish for my pedicure and within a week my toes were chipping.  This NEVER usually happens. I thought it was a fluke. Went for another pedicure, brought the same (newly purchased OPI color from AMAZON) and it chipped again within 10 days. I was questioning if this product is not the real deal and in fact a knock off OR did OPI change their formula. So disappointed.",3.0
The pink just slaps you in the face there is no subtlety it reminds me of a polish you might use on a little girl who wants to look like a grown-up I don't I  like it,3.0
cute color but doesn't last like the others I bought from the beauty store,3.0
"Although this is called ""infinite shine,"" it really has a more matte finish. Not even close to what I expected.",3.0
I was expecting a peachy color as pictured online but received a muted hot pink instead.,3.0
"The color was pretty but MUCH, MUCH darker than the one I had applied at my nail salon.",3.0
This is my first nail polish from OPI and I wasn't really impressed since its easily remove. You can also see in the picture how dry it is. This product is just ok for me.,3.0
Real color is not capture on the picture.,3.0
Great color and applies smoothly but chips very easily.,3.0
"Meh.  The color is pretty but the polish isn't any more durable than regular polish - and maybe less durable.  I bought the entire 3-step system and carefully cleaned and prepped nails, then applied thin coats with dry time in between then cured under UV light as instructed but it still chipped at that tips of my toes within a week.  Regular pedicures usually last at least 3 weeks.  It's also a bit hard to apply because it's thick but requires thin coats to dry properly and not peel off.",3.0
Nice flesh color but washes out on my hands so I painted my toes instead.,3.0
"I want to love this, I really do, but every time I use this particular color, I have bubbles all over my nails. It doesn't happen with any other color from this brand, it just seems to be this one. Also, I can rarely get the bottle open. It sticks more than any other color I have. And this color dries SO incredibly slow. I'm not sure if I got a bad bottle or what but I love every other color from this line. And the color itself is beautiful. The Polish itself was a huge let down.",3.0
"Love OPI, but I have longer lasting results with their regular formula (with Seche Vite gel top coat and Gelous base coat). I'm a bartender and can get two or three days with minimal chipping with regular OPI, but this stuff chipped after just a few hours at work multiple times. Set in Stone is also way more purple than taupe as pictured online, but that's the risk you take buying nail polish on the internet.",3.0
"Not true to the color I found in the nail salon. I saw the bottle and looked at the label, it was most definitely Live, Love, Carnaval, and the color of the one I bought here is very pink compared to that one. Either way, it's not a bad product, I'm just surprised OPI doesn't use the exact same color in each bottle of the same name!",3.0
"Good product, just don't really care for the color.",3.0
Full of air bubbles and a lot lighter of a color than it looks. It would be aswesome under nail art or as a french manicure polish.,3.0
Very streaky. Did not like. Did arrive in a timely fashion.,3.0
Gift,3.0
The color of My Dogsled is a Hybrid is not as bright as pictured... it's quite muted/grey toned. It's not one of my favorites in my collection.,3.0
"Maybe this was old, but it was kinda goey.",3.0
not my style,3.0
Hawaiian Orchid. The color in person doesn't look like in the pictures. I had to use a mate top coat to bring the shimmer down. Not what I like,3.0
Love it but too expensive!  I found it at Marshalls for 3.00 - Your price is 3 times more!,3.0
Not the color I was hoping for.,3.0
This is not the same color as a friend had.,3.0
"I did not end up liking this color, I thought it would be a matte color but it's very  metallic in color, unfortunately that's part of buying without being able to physically see or test.",3.0
Kind of bright for me.,3.0
"I'd been looking for a top coat to get rid of sheet marks when I bought this
Pros: no sheet marks!!, lasts
Cons: bubbles on nails (I don't shake the bottles, I roll them, so it isn't that), seems to lift nail polish off nails in places. This leaves marks on my nails where polish is visibly missing. This was a very odd thing I'd never noticed before with previous top coats or polishes. You can see what I mean by this in the pictures in the areas where my nails are clearly not entirely the color they're supposed to be.
Overall: answered the problem I wanted to but also created a new one.",3.0
Color is way darker in real life. Think dark bronze not skin tone for a fair toned person,3.0
Not quite a matte just dull,3.0
Does not work that great. Its a 4 out of 10.,3.0
Fades away to fast,3.0
"high quality nail polish, it lasted 10 days without chipping and the only reason I took it off was because of the gaps created due to growth of my natural nails..
I took 2 stars off, because --
1) I don't like the brush applicator, it's really hard to achieve a smooth and even application;
2) the color is very cool toned, with a blue-ish undertone that is hard to tell in the bottle but very obvious when applied, I guess it would compromise cool/pink undertoned a lot better than warm/yellowish toned gals.",3.0
"The color To be continued does't match the image on Amazon. To be continue is a light blue, not a light pink. I would encourage you to look at the colors on the OPI website before ordering on Amazon. The quality is really good and the product does last longer than a regular polish.",3.0
I was trying to venture out of my comfort zone w this shade. Didn't really like it but that's just me.,3.0
"Doesn't completely mattify your nails, also the formula doesn't self-level so that kinda stinks. Streaky and still kinda shiny!",3.0
"the polish was kinda thick, not sure if it was an old bottle",3.0
"Not too bad, a little dark for my tastes. I wear it as a neutral with almost any color. OPI is my go to bran for all my nail color because it lasts.",3.0
It's OK,3.0
"I like the product thus far, easy to use, dries fairly fast but this color is too opaque and looks like bubblegum! I have the nails of a Vegas hooker.",3.0
"Love the color! However, my brush wasn't in the best quality. This is the only time one of the infinite shine brushes was like this.",3.0
"I don't see the ""shine"" difference between the high-shine and the regular top coat.  I wish I had saved my money and bought the regular OPI top coat.",3.0
"I use this on my toes only since they don't get much ""abuse"".  I don't use this on my fingernails because it makes my entire nail polish (underlying layers as well as the topcoat) chip far more easily than the regular non ""rapid dry"" top coat made by OPI.",3.0
"Have tried several colors and none last 14 days or even close. This was 7 days, at best.  Disappointing.",3.0
"Beautiful color but...didn't at all last the length of time advertised without chipping.  Really wanted an alternative to ""gel"" but no-go on Infinite shine. Used OPI's infinite shine base and top coat so no excuses OPI!  Buy it for the color, but don't expect the last!",3.0
"a little disappointed.  I purchased this as a fill-in between manicures.  This is the color that I chose from my manicurist, however, this one is a bit lighter in color, so it really doesn't match up, and it's also on the thinner side.  So this doesn't seem to be the same exact product, although the name is the same.",3.0
This product remained tacky for a very long time along with the top coat. My nails were ruined shortly after I polished them and ended up taking off the mani.,3.0
The regular top coat had more shine....,3.0
This is OK.  I put this over micro glitter and flakie to mimic something Id seen on IG and it was OK at mattifying.  I honestly expected a little more.  I'll still use it but was a tad disappointed.,3.0
Was disappointed that the polish didn't stay on longer. Chipped after 3 days.,3.0
Not nearly as shiny as I hoped. The number of stars this product receives is a bit inflated. My nails dried well and haven't chipped but they look rather dull. I have been a fan of Poof My Nails Are Dry but can't buy it anywhere. I have also used the Sally Hansen base/topcoat and it's wonderful too but over time it takes a lot longer to fully dry. Gave the OPI a whirl and it could be a lot shinier. The China Glaze used in salons is better too...I will buy that instead next time. oops,3.0
Pretty Color. Came off my finger nails the very next day. Stayed on toes for two weeks.,3.0
"Looks like a dirty old penny, not sure if that's good or bad",3.0
"Within 24 hours of applying, using OPI base and top coats, the tips of my nails were chipping and looks like a cheap manicure. The polish itself went on very unevenly and in some cases, a 3rd coat was in need. Being off work and not doing much but relaxing, I have no explanation. Super disappointed because it is a nice color.",3.0
it was a nice glitter but i thought it would be more purple than anything it's more of a mix,3.0
I bought this because I friend had on the color and I loved it. This colors seems to be slightly off and kind of chalky.,3.0
"The matte look is wonderful. However, the polish and top coat peel and flake off easily.",3.0
"A little dingier looking than expected, but okay for daily use.",3.0
Much more pink than I thought.,3.0
"I felt the color was lighter then what I had, not true to the color",3.0
"I like the brush size. It works great as a top coat. I hope the formula doesn't become too viscious after a while. I have yet to find a top coat that doesn't do that. I will update on that matter.

It's nothing special. It doesn't dry your nail polish quickly. It's not meant to. At least it doesn't say so on the bottle. It will make your nail polish last longer as opposed to without a top coat.",3.0
"It does make your nails very shiny, but takes too long to dry! I am someone who does not like to wait and this top coat never seems to harden well.",3.0
I have been using OPI's Bubble Bath for years. This was my first time ordering it online and the color is different. It was much more pink than any other bottle I've ever purchased. I don't know how that happens but I was disappointed.,3.0
"This is the color I was looking for, but the polish is very thin and requires at LEAST two coats to be consistent.  This is a good top coat on a darker color (like black).  Very sparkly, yet the sparkles are tiny and don't have a texture like some polishes (which drives me nuts).",3.0
Liked it but I only wore it once,3.0
I bought this for the daughter.  I do not know what I am to say beyond that.  She liked it though.,3.0
I was hoping this was a dark red or purple-ish color but it's more of a brown to me. I don't plan on wearing this much.,3.0
The seller was great. They shipped quickly and the item arrived nicely packaged and the price was good. The polish however... I was looking for a white nailpoilsh that wasn't so white that it looked like correcter fluid on my nails.  Peace Baby is a softer white and not as harsh looking.  Unfortuneately the formulation is very thin and it takes at least 3-4 coats for a nice even coverage which then is impossible to dry without wrecking it.,3.0
Just okay. I never knew that nail polish could be just okay but this one doesn't go on smooth and it's tough to get an even application. But it's a very nice color.,3.0
The new brush seems odd on other products ok on this one makes it worse since it is a thick chunky glitter polish to begin with I hate the way it applies and does not stick as good as regular opi but color is pretty once you get it on.,3.0
This polish is very streaky going on.,3.0
"I enjoy most O.P.I. products.

As far as top coats go, this is a pretty good one.
After years it finally started getting too thick to really go on well.

I'll probably buy a cheaper top coat in the future just to save money.
If you want a nicer brand, try Butter brand.",3.0
This was not the same color I had used on me at the salon however it has the same name.  Slightly disappointed in quality and color.,3.0
"I think the bottle I received must have been old because the polish would be ""stringy""..when I pulled the brush out of the bottle...",3.0
"I have a few colors from this brand which I like, but this one, Mimosas for Mr and Mrs needs a few coats, the first one is very thin and streaks so you need to apply at least two coats.
I'm happy with the color, its a great every day use color which I can wear without it standing out.  If I want my nails to stand out I wear my other supper bright colors.",3.0
"Great polish for 1-2 days of wear, then it starts to chip.  Can't use a top coat with this polish because it will eliminate the ""suede"" look.  One nice factor is that because it isn't glossy, imperfections don't show as easily.  If you have a little chip here or there, you can easily touch it up without removing the original polish.  You should still only expect 2-3 days wear total though.  Good for short term use!",3.0
Its okay kinda dissolves with the nail polish,3.0
"This bottle of rapid dry was sticky.  I have used this OPI product for many years. This is the first time I have purchased a bottle that was thick and sticky. I don't think I order this from Amazon or an affiliate again.  Stores I have purchased rapid dry from are thinner and apply smoothly.  Thanks for giving me a chance to review.,",3.0
Showed a nice pink and got more like a brick brown.,3.0
"I expected the color to be less translucent than it actually is, it takes 3-4 coats to produce the desired color.",3.0
Peels off easily.,3.0
"Great polish, but the color isn't as pretty as it looks in the bottle",3.0
Much lighter color than I expected. I needed to do three coats.,3.0
"More of a pink than an off white nude. Almost the same color as ""bubble bath"". Still good quality paint though.",3.0
"Have been buying this color for years and I agree with others that this is not the OPI Mod About You color. This is too pink and the original is a whitish pink color, I compared to the bottle that I still have and it is way off.  This will work , but I feel that someone is not being honest here and I won't order again.",3.0
"The color is very thinned out in this polish.  I can't tell if it is just the color or if somebody used it and actually thinned it out, but I have to use three coats just to get even coverage across each nail.",3.0
Still feels a little tacky even hours after application. Doesn't seem to seal like it should to protect the color.,3.0
Ok color but so sheer it takes 3 coats.,3.0
"I was using the Sally Hanson Insti Dry top coat before buying this one. In comparison, it feels like ages before the OPI top coat dries. The Insti Dry indeed dries in 1-2 minutes and it has spoiled me. Now I am going to see whether the OPI top coat will keep the polish from chipping for longer. If not, I will skip this product in the future.",3.0
"Chips after only three days, even with a top coat. Sad to say their quality has gone downhill.",3.0
"I can't not have painted toe nails. I don't know why, but I just can't. I rarely paint my fingernails, but will drop anything I'm doing if I realize my toenails look shabby and need to be repainted. I've had a bottle of Wet 'n Wild wild shine nail polish FOREVER, and it's finally dried up and no longer usable, and now I can't find it in the right color. Obviously this is a problem for me, and I needed to find a replacement ASAP. I remembered back when I used to get acrylic nails, my go to color was OPI's ""got the blues for red,"" so I decided to order some since this color most closely matches the wet n wild stuff.

I cracked open the bottle as soon as it arrived and went to town painting my toenails. I painted two coats, let it dry, and all was right in the world. I went about running errands the next day, but when I got home I noticed the polish was already chipped on a few nails. I thought maybe it was a fluke so did a quick touch up and continued about my business, only to find it chipped yet again the next day.

Guys, as much as I want to love this nail polish, and as surprised as I am to say it, it doesn't hold a candle to the cheap wet n wild stuff I'd been using for the last 2 years. I used to be able to go 3-4 days without any chips, and honestly thought with OPI polish being so reputable and loved that it would hold up just as long, if not longer. The color is gorgeous, but it's just too big of a pain to have to touch up every single day. Thus I continue my quest for the perfect burgundy polish.",3.0
I would have given this 5 stars but it takes so damn long to dry.  I even tried using a blow dryer but it was sticky and I just had to wait and wait and wait.  Will be looking for something with less time to dry.,3.0
"It's very slow to dry, I would recommend the OPI Fast Dry top coat. The shine is there but it just takes to long to dry.",3.0
It's a nice light color.,3.0
I grew out of this color.,3.0
"Just for the record, I generally love OPI products.  This product was just a bit lighter than I prefer and is definitely lighter than the picture expresses.  I happened upon OPI Cajun Shrimp when out shopping and it resembles much more closely the picture of Live, Love Carnivale.  I love Cajun Shrimp which is darker, richer with pink/blue undertones.  Other reviewers mention the thickness of the product.  It is thick, but not like ""old"" polish is.  I find it goes on evenly and doesn't smear or drip which I prefer.",3.0
Goes on easy and makes my nails shine. Only gave it 4 stars because Sally Hansen top coat just as good and less expensive,3.0
"Bought this and turned out I got the Rapi-Dri instead which wasn't clear from the ad. i don't like it as much and am using it anyway, but prefer the regular.",3.0
"The nail polish was fine, but the color was much more purple than the color on the website.",3.0
"I got this color a bit back and it is very dark. In the bottle it has a red sheen which looks very pretty. However, on the nail it looks more like a black with a bit of a muted look. I wouldn't recommend this if you are looking for a dark burgundy with red sheen. Other wise, it you just want a dark color, it is good. OPI is a good brand and majority of their colors are good and what they should look like. I highly recommend OPI just not this color.",3.0
"Will come back buy it again, When i done this one, still okay and the prices are not too expensive.",3.0
I always use OPI because it covers so well and lasts a long time without chipping. Unfortunately I am unable to get that same affect with the ridge filler. I put on 3 coats and the ridges still show through and are not smooth to touch. It also starts to chip off after a couple days.,3.0
"I like this product.  It does dry your nails to the touch very quickly.  I always use it when I do my manicures, but just keep in mind it really only dries the top coat that you apply. I still wait awhile for my polish to set before doing any activities because you can still mess it up!",3.0
I was looking for a nude color and this appears more beige in the bottle but it has a light pink hue when applied. Was slightly disappointed because I wanted a more nude shade than pink. It is still nice though for a spring color.,3.0
"I didn't really find that this filled my ridges.
After getting my acrylics off, my nails were left brittle and incredibly damaged with tons of minute ripples and ridges left in them. So, logically, I looked for an alternative to eradicate this.
The Ridge Filler does create a protective layer on your nails so they feel less likely to bend and break but I don't think my nails ever ACTUALLY got thicker.
The formula for this sheer, milky white polish is easily malleable and leaves a nice, glossy finish, which I like.
Just wish it did what it says it does.",3.0
It does work somewhat but it doesn't totally dry the nail polish and it leaves an oily substance on your fingers which you have to wash up!,3.0
great,3.0
I'm still not sure if I like the color on. I go back in forth. It's definitely outside the norm for me.,3.0
Quick shipping from vendor--wondering if it is old product because it doesnt seem to last as long as product I've purchased locally.,3.0
Color is a shade of red it looks pink in the bottle,3.0
Doesn't work well to dry but it does smooth out polish and adds a nice shine. Nothing spectacular as a buy.,3.0
Based on the reviews I thought the nail strengthener would be more effective. I will keep using it hoping that by the time the bottle is finished I will have a better result.,3.0
The top coat left bubbles on my nails because of its thick consistency. My nail technician had to add something to it to thin it out.,3.0
"very small
even smaller that i thought
it works good on the surface but it doens't work inside that good

when you apply it dries the outside quick",3.0
"This nail Polish looks so good! It's white as snow and really stands out. The only problem is that even with a good top coat, after one or two days it's chipping. I have always been a fan on OPI but it has been annoying how often this needs to be reapplied. I normally only need to redo my nails every week or two. Still, I'm a fan of this look and the quality and color are still on point!",3.0
Don't know the aloe of this product. Not sure what it does other than make my polish thicker. Not going to buy it again.,3.0
"I'm a man with damaged thumb nails and needed a filler. I had no idea this would dry as white instead of clear. If you want white, this seems a strong good product. Did try it once but will keep on looking for one that dries clear.",3.0
"I followed the directions but still got dents in my polish. It makes them dry to the touch quicker, but what good is that if you can still get dents in them. Not sure there are really miracle drops that dry your nails.",3.0
"Very pretty color, but honestly the things inside are very hard to get on your nail..",3.0
Love OPI but didn't care for the glitter in this. More a pinkish/peach color.,3.0
"Well first of all I wish it was a lot thicker...... And also the bottle,, mines fell of a table n shattered,, never had any of my other nail polish bottles break before.... Other than that its not the worst,, just wish the product was thicker",3.0
"I bought Bubble Bath and I thought the color was going to a bit whiter but it was pink with no hint of white at all. I'm a bit disappointed, I thought it would be like the Pure Ice Satin Ribbon but apparently not. Pure Ice Satin Ribbon is lighter and kind of streaky but I like that one better than this.

Bubble Bath is not streaky at all. So that's a plus.",3.0
"This product does fill nail grooves, but at a cost of significantly whitening the nail's appearance.  The result is not natural looking.",3.0
I don't like it. It is a bit dark color.,3.0

"A gorgeous true to color black, BUT it was already chipping the day after I painted my nails. I expected better quality from OPI.",3.0
"This product worked really well at first, but after a couple of weeks the polish got more gooey and it didn't dry as well",3.0
"Does not look as blue/teal as the photo in the description.  Looks identical to ""Mermaids Tears"" from the Pirates collection a few years ago (a softer green), which is disappointing when you already own a similar color, and thought you were purchasing a more teal color.  The quality is on par with OPI, but be weary when purchasing online that you might not get what you expect.  I would suggest window shopping at a store, and then purchasing online so you know what you're getting.",3.0
Not the color pictured. Much lighter. It's more of a light turquoise.,3.0
"For some reason I thought How Great Is Your Dane was more of a gray color but it is actually brown. I am sure it is great just like the other opi polishes, I am just a little sad because I don't wear a lot of brown. If you are going for a brown color this will work great for you.",3.0
The color doesn't quite match like the one on the picture..,3.0
"Pro: Whitens and brightens my natural nail tips. Looks really nice by itself.
Con: Bright nail tips really show through color polish and look horrible. HORRIBLE.

Pro: Quite a good basecoat -- keeps polish firmly in place and makes nails strong while in use.
Con: It really doesn't fill in ridges very well. It does make nails somewhat smoother but nothing to write home about.

Additionally, my bottle is gloopy and it tends to pool on the sides, making my polish colors uneven. Yeah, I'm not really impressed with OPI Ridge Filler. I'm going to stick with my Nail Envy.",3.0

"I have pretty high expectations for OPI, and I wasn't happy with how slow this top coat dried. It isn't as glossy as I'd like, either. I have been using Clinique's Fast Dry Top Coat for the last few years, and it drys completely within 60 seconds, regardless of how many coats of polish lie underneath. Sadly, it is no longer in existence, so I ordered this. Based upon the way it dried, I had to order OPI drying drips and a fast dry top coat. I'll probably just stick with the OPI fast-dry.",3.0
"I used the top coat making the layering thicker on my nails and it the color came off within 2 days (i was extra careful by using gloves when necessary, etc, etc)....

Not sure if its use is really necessary....will try again...",3.0
"This is a good product that goes on smooth, leaves no bubbles, and dries quickly. However, it doesn't (in my experience) have the same brilliant, glossy shine as the OPI for Sephora top-coats.",3.0
My nail were able to grow out some but the strength of them wasn't really enough to keep them long. They would bend and brake. Just not as fast as usually. It is kinda annoying have to apply it so much.,3.0
This color is nothing like shown here.  It looks more like a dark pepto bismol.,3.0
"I ordered two bottles. Upon opening I discovered one bottle opened and smashed to pieces , the other stained. Very disappointed",3.0
"Sadly, this is not the exact same shade that I purchased several years ago in a salon.  This Wyatt Earple Purple had a pinkish cast to it, and not the lavenderish gray that I expected.  I was so disappointed.  I have only used it once, and I used to wear it days on end.",3.0
"As one who has been covering scars for many years, this new formula does not do quite as good a job of covering discolorations. It does go on smoother but I was more concerned with coverage. If you don't have that problem though...it is a nice looking finish with great durability.",3.0
"It came quicker than expect and it blends really easily. It also covers my tattoo well,
which is what I wanted. But I got a shade too light.",3.0
"Good foundation. High coverage but be prepared to spend time blending and buffing to avoid cake face. Lasted the whole day on my normal to dry skin. I did set it with powder. The reason for 3 stars is because the color selection can be tricky. I purchased yellow beige which was described as for light skin with yellow undertones, in my opinion this would be for medium skin. The color range is not extensive and the difference between one shade to the next is quite a jump. The ideal shade for a given individual would be a mix, which I think professionals do all the time. Im not so impressed that Id purchase 2 shades to custom mix.",3.0
I prefer the stick version of this product but it is not available anymore.,3.0
"I bought this for tattoo cover up and i don't recommend it for that. the color is more orange than i expected. using this on my face as concealer is a terrifying thought. it would just increase the look of my wrinkles and make them stand out more. it's bad enough with the wrinkles on the side of my finger.
Advice: find some other tattoo cover up but get this bran's loose powder it's amazing",3.0
Does cover up Fairly well but it is not smudge proof it rubs off on everything and is not all day wear,3.0
seems lighther and its not as easy too appply but great coverage,3.0
"If your skin is not all plump and perfect, this stuff will totally settle into lines!!!",3.0
Easy to apply foundations. I found that I needed to apply touch up applications throughout the day as it seemed to rub away/be absorbed. It gave me a nice finish without the appearance of wearing makeup. My blush blended well with it as well as my toner. I don't have overly oily skin but areas of the foundation seemed to need touching up. Otherwise very nice foundation.,3.0
"The reviews for this are extremely impressive so I keep thinking I'm doing something wrong but I find this very difficult to work with.  I have tried with and without primer, applied with a brush, a beautyblender, and my fingertips, but it takes forever to warm up and become easier to work with and it breaks up on my skin creating patches of uncovered skin here & there.  I wanted to use this on days where I needed a stronger spf sunscreen but it is just too unnatural on me.  Maybe I will try a different shade and see if I have different results.",3.0
"I like the color of this, and think the coverage is great -- it hides blemishes well. But I'm used to squirting my foundation out of a tube or from a bottle, and the application process for this is a little too much for me. My makeup routine is really basic, so if I can do it in a couple of minutes, I'm not interested. But, if you're used to this sort of foundation, I do think it's a nice product. Just the wrong form for me.",3.0
"have acne prone skin and a lot of blackheads and pores. It's hard for me to find a makeup that works - aka: doesn't sink into my skin and can cover my breakouts. This makeup seeped deep into my pores making my face look like a hot mess. It did cover my breakouts but the cakey feeling was just too much for me.
I'm bummed because I have other Dermablend makeup and have been happy with those.",3.0
"Dermablend makes products that cover well & do not cause irritation. Unfortunately, I was way off in selecting this shade & it's too dark for me. The ""identify your shade family"" chart I didn't find all that helpful. It says look for your shade number to determine your tone. When I click the photo, I don't see any numbers.

The best way I can help you with this review is showing the actual product so you can see what the ""Golden Brown"" actually is. See attached photo. As far as the quality of the product- I have this cover creme in another shade & it works wonderfully. It is easy to use, a little goes a long way, & it stays on throughout the day without having to reapply. The reason I deducted - 2 stars was solely for the difficulty with color selection. The product is darker that described, & the chart was unhelpful. I'd recommend this product, but you may want to check the color selections in store first so you can get an idea of all the different shades offered.",3.0
OK,3.0
"My skin is extremely sensitive. It often breaks out in hellishly itchy red dots of hives when I wear sunscreen lotion or very fragrant lotions. My skin did not break out in this foundation, so that's a big plus, especially since this has SPF protection.

However, I can only give it 3 stars, because it made me look very unnatural.

It is cakey and dry on my skin. It looks uneven and my skin seems to look peely after sweating just a little bit under the sun. I did not use a set-powder, though, so maybe that's part of the reason. This foundation does not make my skin look smooth - it made all the fine lines even more pronounced. It also feels sticky and easily rubs off.

When I put it on my arm, it was too dark. When I put it on my face, it is too light. Maybe if I use a darker color it would look better.

The first photo shows the right side with the foundation and left side without. You can see it's a very faint difference. However, once I put it on my whole face, the middle photo shows how pale my face looked compare to my neck, which is the natural color. I took another photo showing my forehead and how dry it looked after a few hours.

All in all, I don't think I'd be using this often. It looks as good as my mineral based sunscreen lotions.",3.0
"The warm beige is a good colour match for my skin, but I really find this make up very heavy feeling on my face and much more difficult to apply than some other brand that I have in a tube.
Perhaps for those who need a very heavy covering this would be a good brand to try but for those who just want a smoother covering this is thick.
I have found the darker colors to be very dark but rich in appearance which is sometimes hard to find in a deeper shade.",3.0
"We received three of these shades as a trial, along with one tube of the mousse. The mousse was much easier to apply, and that's the product we'd purchase in the future. Other reviewers (and the company's marketing copy) mention the 30 SPF, but the label says if you are using it for that purchase you have to reapply it at least every two hours!!!!!

""For sunscreen use: apply liberally 15 minutes before sun exposure; reapply at least every two hours; use a water resistant sunscreen if swimming or sweating.""

This is obviously in direct contrast to their push that it lasts 16 hours with the powder (which we did not use).

The application is a bit fiddly; the mousse goes right on, but these require a scoop (included, but don't lose it)---it doesn't store with the product well. Then you have to warm it in your hands and apply it. It does have a mask-type feel. All of the shades we received seemed darker than expected.

My daughter is in the theater, and these will be fine on the stage or other situations where the lights make you look washed out, but it will not be something we'll purchase again.",3.0

"Honestly, I don't care for this as my foundation.  I'm not used to having to add water to my foundation to get it to spread and I don't like having to do that.  However, I am really liking this as a concealer.  I apply it to areas I want to hide (without water).  It's thick enough so that it doesn't come off when I apply my normal liquid foundation on top of it.",3.0
"This is supposed to be a cover cream with SPF 30 (titanium dioxide sunscreen). As soon as I used it for the first time it really reminded me of VERTRA elemental resistance sunscreen face stick (tinted), which a lot of Surfers prefer to use here. If you have used the Vertra stick, most likely this Dermablend product will suit you too; and it has more color options, but not for surfing, it washes away in water too easily. This Dermablend cover cream is very similar, but little more on the oily side and can cause breakouts easier, also it wipes off way too easy, even slightest contact with my face wiped this ""protection"" away. This cream seems waaaaay too heavy (oily/layery/film like feel) for me to use as a everyday sunscreen, but not resistant enough for my beach days, so unfortunately I have not found a good use for it. Not for my type of skin, anyhow, which is oilier/mixed type and with high humidity around the cream doesn't suite me at all. I believe for someone with super dry skin this can be ok, but it doesn't absorb easily and you feel a layer of it sitting on you and creating breakouts... not for me...",3.0
This is a thick coverage cream and comes with a special applicator/dispenser. It definitely needs to be used with a blender sponge for even coverage. Highly effective at scar coverage and providing a uniform skin look.,3.0
"So the color on this was way darker than expected.  I guess it can be a challenge buying any sort of foundation online for just that reason.  For informational purposes, I'm a definite ethnic mix with dark skin.  But not this dark.

The consistency of the creme was a little heavier than expected, but would work well for a cover up of any blemishes.

Since I wasn't about to walk around with this on my face (again, way too dark), I did end up putting some on my arm to see how long it would last.  It definitely lasted all day.

I did like that there was no noticeable scent - especially nice for the scent sensitive.

I will be trying a lighter shade of this.",3.0
"I've never used a cover creme before so I was surprised at how thick this is.  You are supposed to take it out with a small plastic 'spoon' they give you.  (It has the consistency of cold butter.)  Then warm it in your hands to make it pliable before application.  Well, it does cover things but it is also very messy and too dark.  So dark that it could be a contouring color on a normal palette.  So for most people this color is too strong.",3.0
"I was excited at the thought of having a foundation with built in SPF protection. It did provide adequate protection from the sun, but it was so hard to apply and caused extreme dryness on my normal skin that I didn't even use it a second time.
The makeup is really thick, you have to scoop it out with a little paddle that is included, then work it around on your hand to soften it up before applying it. This was quite an annoying process and even after softening it up, it was still really thick and I felt like I was tugging and stretching my skin just to apply it.
The make up rubbed off quite easily and gave no better coverage than other foundations or concealers that I've used in the past.",3.0
"This makeup is very easy to apply and provides excellent coverage. You just scoop a little out onto the back of your hand and warm it with your finger, and it becomes super creamy. I probably won't end up using it as a foundation mostly because it felt a little thick and I prefer a more natural makeup look, but I will definitely be using this as a concealer for any problem spots that my usual makeup and concealer don't effectively cover.",3.0
"This foundation was okay but didn't provide even coverage, which was a let down. The color was true to expectations. I won't be buying this again.",3.0
"I don't like this version of Dermablend foundation as well as I like the Liquid Camo. You can scoop this out with a little spatula. The formula is thicker and gives more coverage than I care to have on my face. I thought the medium beige would work, but it's a little too pink in the undertones. I need something with more yellow. If you're looking for more coverage, then you may really like this foundation.",3.0
"Dermablend Cover Cr&egrave;me is a full coverage foundation that I wanted to use to cover a birthmark and a healing scar.  The color was ""off"", so coverage was not completely full coverage as the attached videos show.

Color: the Honey Beige color seems to be more of a reddish brown vs a ""honey"" brown, so my olive-ish skin wasn't a good match.

Coverage: the cr&egrave;me foundation comes with a spatula to scrape the product and allow you to put it onto your hand in order to blend.  I followed the instructions (place on hand, blend/warm, then blot onto coverage area. Wait 2 minutes and buff off). Coverage was decent and lasted all day. The cr&egrave;me foundation didn't feel ""cakey"" and didn't settle into ""fine"" lines.

While I like Dermablend's products, I like the cr&egrave;me foundation the least.  Application is a little more time-consuming and the color is not as anticipated - which makes it difficult for online ordering). Advice-wise, I'd say to try Dermablend's liquid camo foundation first to see if the coverage sufficed before reaching for the cr&egrave;me foundation because the camo foundation is quicker to apply and does covers quite well.",3.0
"I find DermaBlend products to be hit or miss.  Some are incredible and a fair value, while others are just pricey and miss the mark.  The Chocolate Brown shade is a rich pigment, a little darker than I would expect.  You can go very light with it, but because it is so rich you end up blending longer.  My main knock is DermaBlend markets their expensive cover cr&egrave;mes as lasting up to 16 hours....yes, if you let it dry and then cover with setting powder.

I could make the same statement about numerous, far less expensive brands.  It last for hours...if you cover it with our equally expensive setting powder.

So, it's OK, but pricey for what it is.",3.0
"This is a decent foundation type creme.  It did blend well and the color is exactly as pictured.  It is smooth and works as a good compliment to my foundation and powder of the similar color.  I have pretty sensitive skin within about 3 hours of putting this on, I could feel a bit of an itch, and by the time I washed it off, I had red, splotchy marks everywhere I'd applied it.  I waited a few days, until the redness had cleared and tried again, with just the creme, no foundation or powder, just to make sure it wasn't the combination that caused the irritation.  It wasn't it was the creme, same thing happened again.  So, overall, if you have sensitive skin, you may want to skip this one, if you don't this is a great product, as it covers/blends well.",3.0
"This is very creamy and goes on smoothly with very little effort. They included a little spatula to make it easy to apply as a spot concealer. As actual foundation, this particular color is too dark for me, but the product feels nice on. I wore it as foundation around the house just to see how it would fare through a full day.

The make up didn't get cakey or look heavy. It does act as sunscreen which is a nice bonus. However, my face started to feel itchy after a couple of hours and I had to wash it off. I have sensitive skin, so this reaction is not unheard of for me, but I don't think I can use this in any color as my face foundation.",3.0
"I have mixed feelings about this product. On the plus side, it gives you pretty good coverage, and I like the SPF. I also have acne prone skin, but this product didn't seem to affect my breakouts in any way.

Unfortunately, the negatives outweigh the positives for me. To begin with, it's not very blendable. I expected it to be creamier than it was--it's actually very dry! I'm pretty pale, but the pale ivory was lighter than my skin tone. I actually have a drugstore foundation/concealer than I like better, and it's about a third of the cost. The Dermablend one is tiny! Also, ""L'Oreal USA"" is on the bottom of the product, so that's worth noting.

I didn't hate it, but it won't be replacing my usual products.",3.0
"DermaBlend Quality

DermaBlend quality is unequalled. The biggest issue is finding the shades that match skin tones best. Another concern is depending on where and how used creasing is possible and needs touchups during the day.",3.0
"The color was too dark for me, so I mixed this with a lighter foundation. It's easy to apply and a little of it goes a long way.  That said, the price is kind of high for this type of productm and I didn't see a big difference between this brand and lower priced ones. Also, I don't see the point of including SPF in makeup this dark. If you have dark-colored skin, that usually has enough melanin to ward off the sun's rays. Perhaps it would make more sense to include SPF in the lighter shades, but here it felt extraneous.",3.0
"Hard to get a shade to match (and complement) one's skin., June 26, 2017
It is hard to find the shade/s that match and complement your skin. What is especially tricky is figuring out now the rosy-undertones (or yellow-undertones) affect how, ultimately, a particular shade looks on one's skin. I wound up having to blend too different shades, which I don't view as a viable path forward.

The good quality of this make-up really is off-set by the quirkiness of the shades.",3.0

"It is hard to figure out what shade/s will work well with one's skin.  What is particularly tricky is to get the right undertone: counterintuitively, my rosy-undertoned skin looked pretty awful with shades that were rosy- or neutral-toned, and better with ones that had yellower undertones, or that were tan-ish.

The descriptions and the on-line color patches really were not useful.  I suspect that one must try several different shades 'in the flesh' and with a cosmetic-counter clerk's help to find the right shade.

I ended up blending two shades, which I don't regard as a good option.  (Too fussy and too expensive.)",3.0

In the end, what I found was that I needed to blend two shades.  That works.  But it's really not a convenient or viable solution for me.

My suggestion is that if you are contemplating using this--otherwise excellent--make-up, you should go to a cosmetic counter and have a professional give you shade-selection advice.",3.0
"Warm beige is more orange in color than I expected (compared to my usual reference point of Bare Minerals medium beige).  The creme has excellent smooth texture, but even after softening it with my hands as the instructions indicate, the application feels too thick and cakey.  It seems to enhance wrinkles.  It works ok as a concealer, but I prefer to use a more fluid concealer and build up layers over it.  The spatula applicator is easy to clean/disinfect, which is nice.  A little goes a long way, too, so this 1oz container will last a while.",3.0
"I ordered this product because of some irregularities on my face and discoloration near my eyes. I don't normally use much makeup, so I wanted a light textured, natural looking product. This product feels a bit heavy and goes on a bit less smoothly than other products I've used. I used my finger to fix that and it looked better. I am more used to a semilar cream with a more liquid texture.

As a concealer the Dermablend product works very well, and though it has a rather odd fragrance, it disappears pretty soon after the product is applied, so fragrance may not be a problem for those who are sensitive. The color was a bit darker than I expected but it blends fine with my skin tone anyway. The product comes in a small, easily transported container, and the one I received looked fresh and appealing.

All told, this is a good product. Recommended to those who are happy with a drier, more less creamy texture.",3.0
"I've tried a few different products from the Dermablend line and have to say I've been somewhat disappointed. They aren't anything extraordinary, and don't do much beyond what full coverage foundations and concealers do.

This product is solid and comes in a jar with a scoop. You remove a small amount, warm it up, and apply. The color was a good match for me skin, but although I took the ""less is more"" approach, it highlighted every pore and imperfection. I tried it again with a primer first, and it looked better, but still not something I could use on my whole face. It is also not full coverage, as it did not completely cover a small red dot I have on my forehead.

I would recommend buying this only if you have young, smooth skin with no visible pores. Otherwise you'll look all cake-y and weird.",3.0
"Cover Creme does not do this product justice. It should be called D-Elmer's Makeup Paste. In its defense it does cover amazingly well. For some area like bad under eye circles maybe it would work, if you were putting foundation on over it to help blend it in. But on its own it does not blend. It just sits and stays there thick and definitely covering. If it blended a little better and was a touch lighter it would be great of acne and for under eye darkness and any other serious issues you need to fix. Think wood put or bondo for your face. But as it is I couldn't find a use as its just way to thick and almost sticky in terms of how it bonds to itself and refuses to blend even with blender brush and and every brush in the arsenal.

So it wasn't for us, but maybe if you need something that covers absolutely and sticks and stays, this will do better for you.",3.0
"It has good coverage & overall a good product, but it isn't the easiest to apply. you have to take it out, then mix it a little on the back of your hard to make it smoother, then apply. I don't like multiple steps like that, so wish I could apply easily straight out of the package. Coverage was nice once applied & I appreciate the spf 30.",3.0
"Great makeup, long lasting, full coverage.",3.0
"I do not have good skin.  My pores are too large but my skin is not oily, at least anymore.  Even using a moisturizer underneath this make up, it went on very dry and also made my skin look kind of dry.  The coverage on marks was good, but I think the foundation itself needed a wetter formula.  To cover up scars, pimples, etc. Dermablend has always been top notch and this makeup also works well on that but Im not sure it does any better than other medium to heavy coverage makeup.  It is also a little bit awkward to stick your finger into a jar to put on foundation, although Dermablend includes a small spatula if youd like to use that.",3.0
"One of the problems I face as an African American woman is finding make up that actually matches my skin. As women, we come in many shades and trying to find the right shade for my skin has always been a challenge. It seems that when I do find the right color, the product isn't worth much.

I ordered this because it is called Deep Brown. I'd like to think I have deep brown skin, but not real dark skin. I ordered this cover creme and found it to be several shades than my regular skin. However, what I ended up doing was mixing it with a light contouring shade of make up and using it in the contour areas of my face. I'v recently ordered two other colors with the hope that when they arrive, at least one will match my skin color.

The instructions a to apply liberally every two hours. I don't like this because I'd rather have something that has at least 6-8 hours of coverage. I live a busy life and don't have time to stop every two hours to reapply this, which means I'd have to reapply other products. The good thing is that it is a sunscreen with SPF 30. I do like having to use only one product instead of two.

We'll see how the other two work. If there is any improvement from this one, I will supply an update.",3.0
"This 1 oz. jar of foundation is packed with makeup-making it last quite a while. The color I ordered appeared lighter on the sample picture. This would be ok if I had a tan. This is easy to apply and comes with a tiny spatula-which isn't really needed, in my opinion. Unfortunately, it really highlights my wrinkles/fine lines! If you're younger, this may work better for you.",3.0
"I like this cover cr&egrave;me just a bit more than other products in Dermablends lineup.  It actually does a decent job hiding imperfections, but the downside is its thick, must be applied by fingertip or spatula (included) and can look unnatural if applied incorrectly.  Its unfortunate the Amazon product description doesnt include some important information found on the insert that comes with the cover cr&egrave;me.  Dermablend recommends using their SkinPerfector Primer before applying cover cr&egrave;me, but good luck finding it.  Dermablends website offers twelve different primer products, but I couldn't get information on any of them.  I wonder if primer really does enhance this cover cr&egrave;mes performance.

In general, I find Dermablend products hard to match and work with, and none of the ones I've used are lightweight, so less works best when applying and trying to achieve a natural look.",3.0
"I found this sunscreen cover creme to be a little too thick for my taste. I couldn't get the knack of applying it perfectly.
You need very little for coverage. Also, it is recommended that you reapply it every few hours when out in the sun.

It may be that I should have chosen a somewhat darker shade to match my skin color, which is not as pale in the summertime. Summer is, of course, the ideal time of year to use this product, as it is thick and, as mentioned, contains sunscreen.

If you have blemishes, redness, or splotchiness, this creme may be ideal for your face. The coverage is even and complete.
Just be sure to go with the exact shade you want for your face.

I have found that the creme is nice to have for less noticeable areas of my body after a mild sunburn. The creme helps protect the area from further sun damage.",3.0
This full coverage foundation comes in a small jar with a little plastic spatula to assist with application. It is a fairly thick cream I found I needed multiple application to cover a tiny red spot and it didn't mask it completely.. It tends to wear off so be sure to set with powder. The color was a bit to dark for me and I didn't care for the orange undertone. My skin tone is cool and the orange tone is just to warm and reddish for me. Frankly I expected more coverage with less product. I liked the inclusion of the high SPF and that this product is fragrance free. I experienced no irritation from using this product and it washed off easily.,3.0
"The Dermablend Natural Beige is a great color match on my fair complexion. I love the moisturizing feel on my face while adding SPF 30 protection. Im very disappointed the high color coverage foundation did not work for me. I followed the Color Cream application instructions with a primer moistener and setting powder.  After a few hours it clings to dry areas and appears caked and scrabbly on my face.  Fine lines became visible. I have a few lines in my eye area, but nothing like this!  Ive never met a person who wanted to accent facial fine lines.  It also made my pores appear larger than life by appearing more like white heads.  I'm glad this Cover Cream works for so many other people and wished it worked for me too.",3.0
"This is an overall good product unless you have really oily skin.  However, it is a little darker than expected.  For non-oily skin, the product applies well and stays on all day in normal temperature ranges.  In 95 plus degree heat at 85% humidity combined with light perspiration from light to moderate perspiration, you will need to reapply.

In my case, I found the product darker than I would have liked/  However, it blends out very well for contouring.  If you are using it for coverage, it will do a great job.  I experienced no breakouts using this product though your mileage may vary.",3.0

The Supersmile Cinnamon Burst Toothpaste is very refreshing.  It makes my mouth feel clean just like the original supersmile toothpaste.  The cinnamon does at an extra burst of flavor to the monotonous chore though.  It tastes a lot like chewing on Trident Cinnamon Gum.  Definitely not bad, just a little different.

Again, its only been a month but I am loving it and I do think my teeth look whiter, which is really why I purchased the toothpaste.  And just a side note:  gave it to my highly skeptical son, and now he wants a tube.  So far just a terrific toothpaste (PS: only gave it 4 stars as I always believe everything can use a little improvement but this is a 4 3/4 stars for sure.",4.0
"One tube really goes a long way, and with Amazon's discounted price this toothpaste is definitely a worthy investment.

I will comment, however, that the flavor is not quite the same kind of cinnamon found in cinnamon candies, nor will your breath smell as though you've been chewing on a cinnamon stick. The aroma itself is perplexing, but I know for a fact it's not cinnamon. I did not find it unpleasant (and in contrast, I find a low-key flavor more compatible with breakfast than something overpoweringly minty).

Flavor aside, the toothpaste on your dry toothbrush somewhat glides onto your teeth with normal application. After a few brush strokes, however, it does foam with your saliva.

It really works as advertised: It did not make my teeth feel sensitive. I can eat and drink cold items without feeling pangs in the same why other bleaching toothpastes have.

As for the whitening, it works to lighten maybe a few shades at the most. I noticed some improvement around 2 weeks after use, but I worry this may have been a placebo effect. By now (one month later), my teeth does look as though it got two shades lighter, and it also seems that this may be the limit to its lightening properties. I have considered that with my complexion (Asian), my teeth will not look as bright as if my skin was maybe more tan to produce a contrast. In addition, golden tones may accentuate yellow hues, even if they were not that noticeable on another person. Regardless, this is definitely a natural improvement to my teeth before using Supersmile.",4.0
"Seems to be doing the trick, my teeth have not had a drastic change, but look good none the less.  I only purchased the toothpaste so not sure that makes a difference.  Either way, I am satisfied so far.",4.0
"Surprisingly moisturizing.  I've tried so many products to find the right moisture in a lotion without it being runny. Body butter was all that really worked but can be pretty thick. Living in the desert, it's difficult to find lotions that can hold up to the dry conditions out here. This product goes on with plenty of thicker moisturizing ingredients, not as thick as body butter, and not runny. I really like it - would purchase again. The scent is slightly minty with citrus. Good combo, but the citrus is too artificial to garner a 5-star rating.  A very nice product, however.",4.0
"good stuff, use daily",4.0
The mint lotion is very silky and smells divine!,4.0
I bought this because there was a can of it in my hairdresser's restroom and I loved the way it felt and smelled.  This bottle feels the same but the smell seems more citrus like than mint like which is why I am giving it 4 stars.  But I plan to use it until its gone.,4.0
this is a big bottle and the mint smells really nice!,4.0
"very refreshing, energizing, cooling. i prefer the oat milk though.",4.0
"Fresh scent (not overpowering), rich and creamy, absorbs nicely!",4.0
First tried this at a spa and I was obsessed. The mint is rejuvenatin and really wakes up your senses. I put it on my hands after my morning hygiene routine and the scent will last until I wash my hands again. The bottle is metal and hefty. It is expensive for just lotion though so I will either wait until Ulta has another sale before I repurchase or if Amazon has cheaper prices.,4.0
"What a lovely mint smell!!!! Can't get enough of that. The reason I give 4 rather than 5 stars is that once this bottle is nearing empty, I cannot get the final smears out since this is metal that I cannot cut like I could a plastic bottle. The lotion absorbs quickly and leaves no sticky feeling. The minty smell lingers pleasantly on your skin (so leave out other perfumes if you use this in the morning); it is not overpowering, though.",4.0
Nothing but great things to say about this lotion. I just love it. And delivery was great too. (Lotion did open up during transit and was in bag when it arrived. Not that big of a concern to me though.),4.0
"I love this product and the brand, but the container can arrived dented and the cream leaked. I wish they offered this cream in a different container.",4.0

I love the lotion but it came with the pump messed up and lotion oozing out of it,4.0
"didn't expect it would be like this but its still a good product, smells nice, feels great. kinda smells like morning dew to me",4.0
Smell is too strong if using on the whole body but nice for hands.  Fragrance is refreshing first thing in the morning.,4.0
"Best in the world! However, packaging was slightly damaged. I would give it 4 starts had it not come dented. Lovely scent. Best mint I've found in any bath/body product in the last 15 years. Would be perfect hostess gift or just nice in guest bathroom. But beware, you will want to use it all for yourself!!",4.0

"I love the smell of this on my husband, but at this Amazon price, it was not worth it.  Got it for half price on Overstock.com.",4.0
I love the smell!,4.0
"It smells just like the cologne. It lasts a decent amount of time, considering it's only a deodorant and not an antiperspirant, but I wouldn't recommend using it if you expect to be sweating. It should work fine for the office, a date, or just before bed, but its usefulness ends there.",4.0
The deodorant is great and exactly as expected.  However the packaging was minimal and the cap was cracked upon delivery.  Luckily I had the cap from my old one so that this wouldn't dry out.,4.0
It is a unisex perfume! I love it! Smells very fresh!,4.0
I strongly recommend it.,4.0
ck is flowery with a dash of herbal essence. ck is for men or women so I made my husband try a little and he was--into the shower! In no way did he (or me) see this as a man's scent. I am particular about my perfume and often make note when someone walks by with a scent I enjoy. And although I did like ck it doesn't draw the same response as other perfumes I wear. I gave it four starts because I really liked the scent. It is fresh and clean not heavy like some. It is worth the money.,4.0
"I'm hard pressed to think of something more subjective to review than cologne. It's just one of those things you won't know if you like until you try it yourself. That said, I personally like this cologne. It has a nice, pleasant aroma that is not overpowering like other fragrances. My wife also likes the way it smells on me. I just use one spray on my neck - two seemed to be a bit too much.",4.0
"Recently, I was sent two different Calvin Klein colognes to review. Being both busy and lazy, as well as eager to give both colognes equal treatment, I spent two weeks with my left half doused liberally in CK One, while I drenched my right half in Obsession for Men. Here are the results!

First, much less nausea than I expected. In fact, none nausea. They both pass test number one.

Next, my initial preference is immediately for CK One. Obsession smells like if baby powder grew up into man powder. It smells like a dentist's waiting room if it were also a Baptist church full of freshly showered senior citizens. Over the past two weeks, my right side got mostly ""meh""s from the men I hit on. The women I hit on with my right side were more receptive, but not my much. None of this is conclusive; I haven't tried hitting on anyone in a long time, so I'm out of practice.

I also found that Obsession for Men was far too easy to over-apply. I know I previously joked about dousing myself in the stuff, but in actuality I apply cologne by spritzing it in the air and walking through the cloud, so it's less potent than when you spray directly onto the skin.  Even with this approach, the smell was almost too strong. The smell lingers for days.

Although I preferred it, CK One still smells similar to Obsession. It's got that soft powder undertone, but it's much less pronounced in One than it is in Obsession. One is brighter, fresher, and a little fruitier. Not in a gay way (unless you're into that), but in the pineapple and papaya in the top notes. After looking up the notes for both fragrances, I think the baby powder odor must be coming from the musk and amber that both colognes have in their base notes. It makes sense that these two smell a little similar because they have many of the same components (Bergmot in the top notes, nutmeg in the heart notes, and the two aforementioned scents in the base notes).

Anyway, I preferred the CK One to Obsession, although both left the linger of powder hanging on me for days. Like that Shower-to-Shower talcum stuff my grandmother used to use all the time. A clean if not terribly sexy scent.",4.0
"Launched in the mid 90s as a fashionable and edgy fragrance, it stood the test of time, and aged along with its early adopters, just like Jordache, it's now ""safe"" for the grandparents to wear too. It is a unisex fragrance by design and in actual smell, handy to have around in case you have guests who may need to freshen up.

Inside the package (opens easily with fingers) you will find the 1.7oz (50ml) bottle with a standard screw-on cap, along with the spray screw-on cap on the side of the bottle. So if you travel or use this as your to-go fragrance, you can switch caps to prevent accidental sprays while it is in your bag.

It is a nice pleasant scent, I did not find it overpowering, and no one complained that I smell like a fragrance counter. While walking outside, one bee (or bee-like creature) landed squarely on the spot I sprayed this. So it has the bee-like creature vote of confidence as well.",4.0
"This product has a complex scent that I really enjoy. This is a scent meant for both men and women, and as a person of the male gender, I find the musky undertones to make it plenty masculine for my own wear. Yet, there is enough complexity in the scent that I wouldn't balk if this were worn by my wife. I find that I don't need that much to achieve the subtle effect I'm going for, and that means I've eschewed the sprayer in favor or just dabbing some using my hand. At the rate I'm currently using it, I expect this relatively small bottle to last many months. You'll have to make your own decision regarding value, as this certainly doesn't rate as an inexpensive scent, but it is dynamic and deep and I really like it. As a somewhat unuseful but potentially helpful-to-some aside, my wife is quite sensitive to many ""sharp"" and artificial odors (such as many perfumes, car scents, etc.) but this hasn't bothered her at all.",4.0
"One has been around for a while and while I used to wear Calvin Klein, I wore a different scent than this one but I really loved it. I do like the light, citrus scent of One and its versatility. It can be unisex and it isn't heavy or over bearing. This scent can also be wore during any season and night or day. I like the freshness of the smell because I dislike heavy perfumes-they can give me a headache and make me sneeze. One is a classic that never goes out of style. The price is reasonable and the scent will last though out the day or evening.

I like the Aqua scent by Calvin Klein a bit more than One but I've been wearing them both and have gotten compliments on the fragrances.",4.0
"I don't wear cologne normally. In fact, the last time I did was when I was in 12th grade back in 2002 and overdid it one day. Since then, I'll occasionally get cologne as a gift from people who don't know anything about me. This stuff doesn't smell bad at all. In fact, it smells pretty nice, though it immediately brings to mind guys too old to be wearing Aeropostale. It comes with the little sprayer with an attached tube in the box in case you don't like dabbing it on your doilies or whatever people use these days to apply it.

4 stars instead of 5 because this is one of those rare things that Amazon sells at full retail price, and because it reminds me of guys with lots of hair gel who wear black polo shirts tucked into their khakis for some reason.",4.0
I've liked this fragrance before so was thrilled at the chance to try it out on Amazon Vine. The fragrance is pleasant and not overwhelming and is enjoyable by my wife...and hopefully no one else lol.,4.0
"I picked Calvin Klein CK One Eau de Toilette because I was curious to see if a fragrance designed for both men and women to share really worked as advertised. For the most part I was pleased. The fragrance is a nice blend of scents (mandarin orange, nutmeg, violet, jasmine, sandalwood, and musk to name just a few) and it is a light, not heavy scent. I do not believe in smothering myself in perfume and I found that a few spritzes of this are enough to create a light pleasant scent. I had the male living in my house try this and he was equally pleased - he liked to scent and said it didn't feel too feminine a smell for him. My one complaint is that the scent doesn't last all that long  a couple of hours at most.

Calvin Klein CK One Eau de Toilette is a nice pleasant scent to wear.",4.0
Picked this up for my husband who was looking for a fresh new scent to try. I love how the citrus and wood tones smell on him. I put a little on my wrist and the scent changed more than I expected. This is truly an adaptable scent.,4.0
"Calvin Klein ck one is a scent that I first tried about 15 years ago when I was a teenager. I loved the scent then and I still like it now. It is Unisex which means it can be used by Men as a cologne or by Women as a perfume. I tried it and so did my Husband. I personally liked it better on me. His cologne that he wears is a lot stronger and more masculine. The ck one fell a little flat in comparison. I do love it as a perfume though. It smells sweet on my skin and the violets, jasmine and Lilly scents really shine through.

The bottle that I received is 1.7oz. It is a decent size bottle that will last a long time...providing that you do not spill it. This comes to my one and only issue with this bottle. It has a screw on cap and no spray cap (like it shows in the picture). I am not sure if I received a box without the spray cap or if it just does not come with one. However, a spray top is necessary for me with fragrance. I have worn this 4-5 times already and I have already sloshed it all over my wrist once. Frankly, I am a klutz and this would be a pricey spill if I knocked the entire bottle over.

The 1.7oz is the most expensive size that you can buy (currently $28.82 per ounce). The 6.7oz bottle for the current price of $69 is a steal ($10.30 per ounce!). However, that is a lot of perfume. I would only recommend buying that size if you know that you or your gift recipient REALLY loves this perfume and will use it a lot. For me, this is an occasional perfume and the 1.7oz size will last me for years. The 1.7oz is big enough size wise to make a decent gift for a loved one. So, use your discretion and knowledge of the individual you are buying for when purchasing.

I would recommend this perfume. I just hope that my bottle only having a screw top was an error and everyone else receives a spray bottle as pictured.",4.0
"CK ONE is now more than 20 years old. At the time the idea of a unisex scent was daring and provocative. Not so much anymore, in the current social atmosphere of softened gender boundaries and sexual fluidity.

ONE is a light, citrusy and benign EdT which yes, has notes typical of women's scents along with other notes typical of men's scents. However I do think it works better for a woman, giving her a mysterious air ..",4.0
"If you're into unique, subtle scents, Calvin Klein's ck one is for you. It reminds me of unisex fragrances that had their heyday in the 90s. It's spicey, with the merest hint of a floral. I like it for myself, as a non-girly change of pace for my usual perfume of choice.

My husband likes it - but on me, not on him! We share everything, but we like smelling different!",4.0

I decided recently that it still smells pretty darn good and wanted to go retro like the secret hipster that I am.

"I was on my last drops of my 6 years old bottle so I decided to get new one. I think the one from amazon is definitely smell lighter  and doesn't last long. The one I bought from Macy's sometimes I could smell it after long day at work and I didn't spay much; one 3.4oz bottle lasted more than 6 years. The new one doesn't last  more than 3 hours. I spayed on my arm to see how long would it last and it vanished after 3 hours.
Update 10/22/14: after wearing it for two weeks i think the cologne seems to be real. it does last longer than my previous estimate, the smell is good, raised to 4 stars.",4.0

"You smell great, but it's just a deodorant, not an antiperspirant. I've noticed that it's best used if I'm not walking a fair distance, because I've noticed moisture. Never good. But I just use it at times when I'm not likely to sweat much and it's fine.",4.0
"I give most colognes a 4 rating if I will wear them.

They say the women like it but I have yet to be mobbed by them. I suggest a person loose weight first and get a face lift to assure the desired effect.

Smell is undefinably somewhat neutral not masculine though could be called slightly feminine.

Preferred Stock is more stud-ly to me but seems to have changed from how I originally remember it so I'm looking for something new and tried this.",4.0
CK One is a staple for me.  Always good right out of the shower.  Not flowery or heavy just a good light fresh scent.  Clean.  This one seemed a little lighter or not quite as long lasting to me than others I have bought in the past.  But could just be me and my nose.  Just glad I can come back to Amazon and find some of the staples that I like and enjoy.,4.0
"I found this perfume about 10 years ago, and I just loved the scent. And while I do like the way it smells on me, the scent just doesn't seem to last for very long.

"I owned a total of 3 Helen of Troy flat irons similar to this throughout high school and college, and once Sally Beauty stopped selling them, I was heartbroken. Believe it or not, every new flat iron with new technology has damaged my hair and for some reason this one has not.  My flat iron was delivered on my doorstep literally within 30 hours of me submitting my order and I didn't pay for any type of expedited shipping.  High school for me was over 17 years ago, and back then the iron was called ""Helen of Troy"", but this Hot Tools iron looks, performs and when it's heating up it even SMELLS like the one I had when I was a younger!  4-stars only because my only complaint is that it snags my hair a bit sometimes & yanks out a strand here or there,  whereas the Helen of Troy one didn't.  Hopefully it just need a little bit of breaking in; sometimes when natural hair oils & heat protector product that I put on my hair prior to straightening build up on the plates, it glides through easier & more smoothly for me.",4.0
"I have thick, wavy hair and have been using flat irons for years.  I have bought every kind from ceramic to tourmaline, but I keep coming back to this one.  It's the only one that doesn't kill my hair, actually adds volume, and keeps my hair shiny.  It's also come down in price over the years and is very reasonable.  The wide plates also allow you to get the straightening process done quicker.  The only issue I find with this iron is that it's fragile... if you drop it, it's not durable and the wiring usually breaks within a year.",4.0
"Other than the fact, that I thought somehow, I was buying a 1 and 1/2"" flat iron and it turned out to be 2"", I really love it.  I had a Helen of Troy flat iron for about 5 years and it finally died about 8 months ago.  I went back to Sally's Beauty where I had purchased it to get another, and they did not have any.  The girl there recommended a One n' Only which cost about $70 dollars and it was the worst thing ever.  It either would not straighten your hair or if you turned it up to where it would, then it burned your hair.  Also the plates were not seated in it correctly so you were always getting little pieces of your hair caught in the plates.  I am VERY glad to have another Helen of Troy flat iron.",4.0

This is the same one used in a salon, and I searched online and purchased because of how well it actually straightened my hair. It's thicker and hotter than store bought. Loyal fan.",4.0
"Huge disappointment. Thought it was going to be top of the line, but didn't straighten well and a bit too large and awkward to handle.",4.0
"I have been a hairdresser for over 30 years and this is my go-to flat iron. I have purchased over a dozen types of flat irons (including Chi, wet to dry, ceramic and tourmaline) over the years (gotta keep up with the trends!) and I always return to this one (and sell it in my salon). The wider bumpers mean you can't burn your scalp, which is a big plus for clients, unless they are very good with a flat iron. The wide size lets you put a gentle curve in your ends, which is hard to do with a thinner iron. I always use it at the highest temperature, which will not burn the hair (unlike the high temperatures on some other irons). The reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 are:
1-There is some sort of coating on the plates, so you have to let the iron heat up for at least 30 minutes before you use it for the first time to burn off the coating and it's a little stinky.
2-If you drop it too many times, the case may crack and catch hair in the crack (not dangerous, but a little painful).
3-The wide bumpers won't let you get close enough to the scalp for very kinky hair, although you can overcome this by ironing the scalp hair in different direction - up, down, forwards and backwards.
Even with these 3 small problems, this is still my favorite flat iron.",4.0

"I'm pleased with this purchase. I've been using it the past two weeks. The iron heats up quickly and straightens really well. I've grown my hair out and it's really long so this works perfectly for longer hair styles. I will say it's a little heavy and bulky, so if you have hair above your shoulders it may be harder to straighten.",4.0
This flat iron is the best I've used.  I bought it 5 years ago and have used it everyday on my thick wavy hair.  It works excellent.  Today one of the plates stopped heating (after 5 years of much abuse) so I am buying another!,4.0
"I love this flat iron.  It is wide enough to handle big areas of hair at a time.  It also heats up fast.  Only problem I have is that is can't hold its temperature during use.  It quickly cools down.  However, the fact that it heats up fast makes up for it",4.0
Love this straightener! I have long hair so it is so much easier than trying to us a 1 inch straightener. The variable heat settings are great so that I don't burn my fine hair. Thanks!,4.0
I bought the iron and use it regularly. It creates an awesome straight look for my naturally wavy hair. The only thing i think that hot tools should work on is being bale to get the back of your hair better. But over all i love the iron and are now thinking about but the curling iron.,4.0
"I have thick, corse, super curly hair and this is the best flat iron I have ever used. Although I don't use it on a weekly basis I do use it pretty frequently and my last one lasted 5 years until one side of it stopped heating up. Definitely worth my $30 investment! Looking forward to getting another one to last the next 5 years.",4.0
"My friend has a Helen of Troy Hair straightener and I use it on my hair when I forget to bring my other brand straightener over her house.

Helen of Troy heats up VERY fast, and work extremely well, straightener large portions of my hair at a time without buring my hair in a faster time. It does a better job than other straighteners that I have tried.

The only downfall is that after about two years of use, the striaghtener died.

Also, when you straighten your hair, sometimes pieces of hair get caught in the sides of the gold plates. but its only a strand of hair about every other time I straighten.",4.0
"I doubted it was even possible to banish the redness, but I was just desperate enough to spend the $85. For a gal who cringes at $35 for Clinique moisturizer, that's a lot of dough. But this was by far the best money I ever spent on my skin! I have self-diagnosed mild rosacea and didn't want the usual treatment of oral antibiotics (which have their own set of problems for me). With just a few dabs of this product twice daily on my nose, cheeks and chin, I'm virtually redness-free, and my occasional blemishes are reduced by about half.

CC&C isn't miraculous. On infrequent occasions, I remain blotchy despite using it. This is usually when I've been under a lot of stress or have been sick. Extrapolating from that experience, I believe the greater the severity of the rosacea, the more limited CC&C's results will be.

CC&C doubles as a regular moisturizer, so - unless you have extremely dry skin - there's no need to use another moisturizer over it. I wear it at night, and beneath makeup during the day, applying it only in my redness-prone areas. I save a few bucks by using my less expensive moisturizers on the rest of my face and neck. At this rate, one $85 jar lasts me about 5 months. Not too bad, when I think of it as $17 per month.",4.0
My wife used this cream on her face and hands. She liked it as a good product. This product arrived right on time.,4.0
"I have used this cream for a few months now.  I don't wear makeup, but I try to take care of my skin. I have mild rosacea in a few spots.  I have been to the dermatologist and gotten lots of prescription creams, even a steroid cream that worked pretty well.  This works almost as good as the steroid.  It keeps the redness managed without all the chemicals. I'm sure it has chemicals in it, but you don't need a prescription so I would think that these do not have the side effects of a prescription cream.  I use a very small amount and it keeps the redness down.  I'm still on my first container of it.  I would guess a jar would last 6 months if you used it sparingly. It's worth it if you can afford it.",4.0
"I love the way this tub is setup so you don't waste the product. I like the way this stuff feels however, I am unsure about how well it does getting rid of redness. I kinda feel like though that with redness reducers if my red isn't gone I'm kinda like meh... haha I think it might be something that takes a little while of consistent usage and I don't like using creams all the time. I use it at night after I put the Ain't Misbhavin on because that can make your face feel a bit dry and this helps a ton with that and makes your face feel soft.

I have horrible skin issues and am stressed to oblivion at school which always makes my skin way worse than what it normally is. I've used this product about two weeks so far and I have to say, my skins not perfect but its getting there!! Its the closest to perfect it has been since I was about 14 (I'm 22.) I have a lot of cystic acne problems and had read somewhere this was good for hormonal and cystic breakouts. (I'm not saying that is true since I am not a scientist but my face has improved so I wouldn't be surprised if the claim is legit.) Within a week my face improved a lot and for me thats just an incredible thing.

Just a side note I used a trio of products not this alone! I think that is important to say. I used the Ain't Misbhavin face wash and gel stuff too.",4.0
"I have been looking for a face product that would address my skin issues: rosacea, acne and de-hydration. I tried this cream after reading the reviews and I am impressed with the results. I have little, to none, redness now (usually noticeable on my cheeks/nose and chin). I did not want to have to use prescribed metro-cream for the rest of my life. Although I really like the results I am seeing with Calm, Cool and Corrected - the down side is the price....I might not always be able to afford this cream and am afraid that I might have to experiment with cheaper brands. I am using this twice a day, but only as a spot treamtment in the morning and then I layer my SPF face cream over it....this makes the cream last about 7 weeks rather than 4 weeks (which is about how long it lasts when you use twice a day on entire face and neck). I still have some unwanted acne, but that is likely partially do my work conditions. I do wish this product was more affordable....in this economy I have to struggle to pay the bills -versus- treating my unwanted (and unsightly, in my own opinion)skin conditions to make myself feel better. I just want to have clear, healthy looking skin...and for now I  will pay what I have to in order to achieve that goal.",4.0
"I am 30 years old and have acne as well as rosacea.  I have tried everything over the counter for both problems, and most recently the very expensive laser surgery.  That laser surgery (Isolaz) did NOT work.  Save your money.  It cost me $700 for three treatments and my acne and rosacea were both worse.  I tried this product, even though it is very expensive.  I have been using it for 2 1/2 months, and my acne has improved greatly.  My rosacea is lighter and there are less ""bumps"" in my rosacea.  My skin is not perfect by any means, but it is definitely 70% better than what is has been for the previous 10 years.
Also, it is a great moisturizer.  This is good, because I used to use Clinique's Moisture Surge which is like $40 itself.  So, it sort of kills two birds with one stone.  I like it!",4.0
"I developed a bad allergic reaction to mainstream antispirants in the last couple of years and have struggled to find a tolerable alternative. I ended up having to settle for using deodorants without an antispirant and applying baby powder with cornstarch as a crude way of controlling sweating. Then I found Total NonScents, which has a very low dose of an antiperspirant called Aluminum Zirconium Tetra Chlorohydrex Glycine that has been shown to be much more tolerable on sensitive skin than traditional mainstream chemicals. It has definitely worked for me in helping to control sweating so I can feel fresh throughout the day. My only two complaints is that it's unscented, I actually like the perfumed scent of most deodorants and miss being able to have those scents. And secondly, it's a wet roll-on. In order for this product to work properly it needs to be completely dry before you start getting dressed. If put clothes while it's still dry you are definitely going to be sweating by mid-day. So you need to either walk around shirtless for awhile to let your pits air dry or you can use a blowdryer to speed up the process. I know it sounds weird, but it really works if you are in a rush and can't wait 15 minutes to air dry. Despite these issues, this product has been a lifesaver for me and I'd still recommmend it in a heartbeat for those unable to use most other products because it does work.",4.0
"After about a month using this product, I noticed a difference. It is gentle and works effectively. I recommend it.",4.0
"I tried this product for six months, I felt some mild improvements but it did not lightened up the area completetly but, to be honest, it looks better than before. Well, it depends significantly on the skin type and how it responses it the product.",4.0
I just  start using it But I love that it's not sticky and give you a fresh feeling although Ijust use it for two weeks  the area become  Whiter,4.0
"Been using this for a year. Not effective as far as whitening. Yes it does NOT give  day long protection against sweat. I guess it is because it is so gentle there's less aluminum in it.  But at least it doesn't make the pits darker like other deodorants do. My pits sweat but it does block the smell. I don't mind having sweaty pits as long as they don't stink. Also, it takes a while for the deodorant to dry because of it's weird consistency. But what I do, I use the hair dryer to speed up the drying process. ;)  Just got my second bottle. I'm not after it's whitening property anymore. I'm just soooo glad that it doesn't make them pits darker. :|",4.0

"Discoloration:
First of all, if like to say I want I wasn't expecting a miracle. All my life I've had dark armpits and I hate it. I went to the dermatologist to see if she could help me and all she said was ""it'll cost you."" Upset at her lazy response I looked for alternatives myself and noticed the great reviews this was receiving and bought it. Within a few weeks of usage I noticed it had cleared some of the dark pigmentation but not in its entirely. In hopes of better results after continuous usage I kept purchasing this item; so far I've bought 5 and the armpits have not gotten any lighter since its first debut and I don't think it will. It will help, but to a limited point.

Body Odor:
None whatsoever!!! I can go to the gym and not smell anything, friends and mom have confirmed this. Until I find something better to help me with the dark armpits I will definitely keep using this bc there's never any body odor. To my shame, I have used dresses two days in a row only because there was never any odor on the armpit area.",4.0
"I have super sensitive skin and I've been looking for an antiperspirant/ deodorant that would not only do the job, but also be kind to my skin.  So far,  ""Total nonscents"" is doing a great job!!

This deodorant does control odor and sweat for me. I read this product lightens dark underarms. It took a few months but I did notice some lightening for me.,4.0
"I have very sensitive skin and have been using this deodorant for two years now without a problem (no itching or irritation).  Also, it does not leave a residue on my clothes or cause discoloration.  I think it controls odor and perspiration very well, however, I do not have an extreme problem in these areas.  I have recommended it to my daughter who just had another jacket ruined with discoloration from her deodorant.  The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is due to the hefty price of around $20.  I am not a heavy deodorant user and only have to purchase a bottle about twice a year.",4.0
"I have used this product for about 1 year now as it was the only anti-perspirant that I could find that I did not have an allergic reaction to while using.  It is a lot more effective than a product like Tom's or one of the crystal products, however, it becomes a challenge in the summertime or when you are working out because it is not very effective overall.  I have found it to be the best with my allergy sensitivities so far but if you don't have to use it, don't.",4.0
"the brightening part of the product works really well.  the antipersperant part works fine for every-day use, but when i'm really active (dancing, working out, etc) it doesn't always cut it.  that's fine, though, because then i just wear some normal deoderant.",4.0

It took over 12 months using the brightening product for my skin tone to return to its natural color but once that happened, I followed the product recommendation to switch to the regular ultra-gentle antiperspirant.

Both products control wetness and odor during a routine day for me, even through hot flashes!  The product is liquid, so is wet when applied but I apply right out of the shower so by the time I've finished my hair and make up, it has dried on its own and I can dress without concern.  The downside for me is the product's price and availability only online.  It means I purchase 2 bottles at a time, which last me about 6 months (3 months/bottle).  It also means when I received a bottle that was only partially filled--which I would have rejected in a store--I was pretty much out of luck.",4.0
"I have to say that some of these comments don't seem genuine... they seem a little too commercial.  In my experience, no KP product ever works completely, some are just slightly better than others.

I wish the price was as little better because the tub isn't very big and we have worked through it pretty quickly.",4.0

Con: Cost!",4.0
"This lotion did what it said it would do: softened up my bumpy KP arms. This softening however could be reached by other and much cheaper lotions from the drug store.  I give it 4 stars b/c it didn't fail but didn't impress; also, grossly overpriced.

Pros:
softens KP
smells better than other KP lotions

Cons:
does nothing for redness
uber expensive",4.0
"This item works great. Those who gave it a 1 star review didn't use it properly. It takes TIME and consistency. It's not a miracle lotion that can morph your skin overnight. It takes consistent application, and it's more effective if you exfoliate first. Also understand that it does NOT CURE KP. There isn't a cure. Your skin will continue to try to overproduce and create the bumps. If you quit using this, it'll come back. It stinks but that's the way it is.

I would give this 5 stars if it didn't have parabens in it.",4.0
"Arrived on time.
Non-greasy, not heavy.
The Mrs seems to like it.

"This definitely works, not quickly, but it works.  Does not burn like others say, but head the warning on the package about applying SPF bc you will get sunburn.",4.0
I'll give it some more time. I'm seeing a little change but the red bumps are still there 2 weeks later.,4.0
"I have been diligently using this cream two times per day for about 2 weeks now.  My skin is certainly smoother and slightly less inflamed, but as of yet the redness is still there - I'm not sure if this will ever go away.  I will continue to use this product, and I would probably buy again if not simply to keep the skin smoother.",4.0
"I've researched products to help wit Keratosis Pilaris for a while, because my skin has become so awful that I don't want to show it. BUT, it's an extremely hot summer and who wants to wear quarter length shirts all the time?

I've only just begun using it, but I'm so excited about it I wanted to leave a review with my first impressions. It is pricey. I want to keep up with the product - the price is iffy - , but if it works it will be worth the money! Also, the smell is very mild. Hardly even noticeable and goes away after 45 minutes or so. It smells like any unscented lotion really. Has a very mild chemical smell. So far the only problem I've encountered is that it is very thick and leaves my skin 'sticky' for hours. I've applied it at night and have woken up with it still feeling unpleasant, but it's bearable and once again hopefully worth it! Also, a little goes a LONG way. I would say about a dime sized amount works well for me, but of course that would be different for everyone.

I'll update this in a few weeks with progress on my skin!

Update 6/24/2015

I never updated this and I would love to share a few exciting treatments for treating KP that works heaps better than this lotion. I stopped using this lotion once I finished the tube. My skin became sensitive, raw, and my KP wasn't cured at all. Disappointed, I began my search again for other methods of curing my unsightly KP. I would say my skin bumps are severe. They occur frequently and are rather large making my upper arm skin red and dry. I experimented with dry brushing, which does help, but to truly eliminate my KP (which I found out as a complete surprise) was when I began using an organic, hand-made, coffee infused body OIL. I've completely stopped using lotion. The body oil I began using all over my body has helped to completely eliminate and heal the bumps on my thighs and arms. It's actually pretty mind blowing. If I stop using the body oil, yes give it three days and my bumps will be back, but when I'm consistent with it, they are GONE and my skin looks smooth and healthy. I recommend you doing research on the benefits of body oil for KP. It will change your life if this is something you suffer from.",4.0
So far it has dissolved the kp on my upper arms it's slowly working on my back though. I will continue to see better results.,4.0
"i have been holding off on trying this but had been curious and finally thought i would give it a try. I am happy with it and have seen results when used regularly-meaning nightly. some have mentioned that it is greasy but it really is not, you just have to use a dab and rub it in and it is fine. i don't know if i will repurchase it when it is gone so i will use this up and see what happens but it does take persistance as well as using the scrub. at least when you buy from Sephora they have a good return policy if not satisfied so that is why I finally decided to give it a try and I haven't returned it yet",4.0
"I recently purchased the KP Duty Scrub and Lotion.  I've had keratosis Pilaris for almost 2 years.  I think I started developing it on my arms around the time my son was born. In the past few months, it had got a lot worse.  That's why I turned to KP Duty.  I had tried the stuff my dermatologist gave me, and had NO change.  I read about KP Duty in Good Housekeeping, so I thought I would try it.  I've been using the products for almost 2 weeks, and I'm definitely seeing an improvement.  My left arm looks much, much better.  My right arm (which is the worst) looks better, but it's not as improved as the left.  I am very diligent about application though.  Twice a day for the lotion, and I use the scrub every other day.  I know it says not to use it that often, but it doesn't seem to irritate my skin.

I am seeing an improvement, but I think the key is diligence.  The sales people who sold it to me have used it, too, and they also said you have to be very diligent about it.",4.0
"I've had bumps on my legs for a few years.  My doctors recommended various products and tricks, but nothing worked as well as this product!  It does not completely eliminate the bumps, but it makes it 80% better.  I have to use the product every day (and for better results, twice a day) or else the bumps reoccur.  I also use the scrub about twice a week.
If nothing else has worked, try this.  I highly recommend this product, even though it is pricey.",4.0
"I've had these red raised bumps on my arms for years. As long as I can remember. I've always been embarrassed about them, because people make comments - they think I'm sunburned, or that i have a rash. I get the ""What happened to your arm!?!"" and an alarmed look. I hate that!! I've used countless other brands of lotions and creams, trying to get rid of this problem, and nothing ever worked. One day I stumbled on this product online.

I read a bunch of reviews on KP Duty online, and determined that it was worth a shot. An expensive cream for a small amount of product, but a little bit goes a long way.

I use a loufa in the shower to gently exfoliate, then, just after drying off, I apply the KP duty, about a dime sized amount in my hand is plenty for both arms. I apply this product in the morning when I get up, and at night before I go to bed. When I use it consistently, I notice a VAST improvement in the bumps. The redness is still there, but my arms are significantly smoother, and I feel better about them. I had hoped the cream would help with the redness, but I don't think it's happening.

However, I would definitely recommend this product. You have to use it consistently, or the bumps come back. Hope it works for you!",4.0
I found this product to be a little greasy so I had to try a few methods of application before I found the one that worked like magic.  I take a small amount for each body part that I apply it to on my hands and then really rub them together.  I then apply it where I need it.  I found that all the red spots and most of the bumps had disappeared within 1 month of using this method.,4.0
"My daughter has only been using this product for about a month and being an adolescent, I have to keep behind her to use it.  Even so, it has shown much greater success than anything else that we have tried in the past.  I'm sure if I tied her down and applied it myself we would have 100% improvement already.",4.0

"This is easy to get used to and works really well, but I find it hard to make the curls look as good as they do when I use the Hot Tools wand.",4.0
"Bought this because I loved the curls it gives when my stylist does my hair. There's a bit of a learning curve if you're used to using a regular clip iron, but you get used to it quickly. I previously had the purple version, but the coating came off the barrel and was snagging my hair pretty quickly, and that was just me, not in a pro setting.

My other complaint, which they seem to have fixed, is the clip handle. The old version of all of the marcel irons did not have a cap on the end, which meant that, eventually, the washers that hold the cover on the metal handle would loosen and the cover would come off. There was no way to put the washers back on because they were held on by tabs and not threads. Hot Tools customer service is eh, I've had to contact them a few times about their warranty and it's iffy whether or not I receive a response (and when I do, they swear they've contacted me). They also wanted $5 and you pay shipping to them for a replacement, and really, I know these aren't expensive, but for ""professional"" quality, these should really last more than a couple of years, ESPECIALLY when being used at a professional level.

That said, the new ones (I originally purchased this specific one in 2014, having had the purple one before that, so the ones manufactured in 2015 and later) seem to have fixed the issue and capped the end of the clip handle. I haven't been using that one long enough to see if it's helped, but I'm pretty positive that it has fixed the issue.",4.0

"I am loving the marcel irons - this is my second (I bought the 1.25"" before this). In general, I really like the control I get from the lever and being able to adjust the level of heat. Being able to adjust the heat saves my hair from being burned. Specifically to the iron I received I like it a lot, but the swivel of the handle and the marcel rod is a bit ""sticky."" I don't recall that the 1.25"" marcel (which I also ordered from Amazon) started out this way. I'll keep using it to see if it loosens up with use.

The Hot Tool Marcel Irons are very nice. It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of it, but it's not as hard as one thinks. Watch the YouTube videos, practice with no heat or very low heat, and be patient with yourself - you'll get it!",4.0
"There is definitely a learning curve with this curling iron if you're used to the traditional spring loaded irons.

"I was afraid that it would be hard for me to get used to this type of curling iron - and I am not particularly skilled at styling hair - but it was easy to catch on and does seem easier than a traditional curling iron. I just cut several inches off my hair so I was looking for a curling iron with a smaller barrel than what I currently had and so far I am very happy with this purchase. It heats up quickly, is easy to use, reasonably priced....no complaints!",4.0
"My hair is thick and wavy so I need the high heat and this has it! A marcel iron takes some practice because there is no spring where it clips onto your hair. You control the pressure and release, etc.  Just be careful when handling because it doesn't have a heat guard on the rounded tip.",4.0
"Not that easy to use, just enough long for short-medium hair, I would go back for XL type (no handle just a clip) but heat is good.",4.0
I've had a few of these irons (used to be a licensed cosmetologist).  They work well and usually hold up for years.  I'm expecting the same from this one.,4.0
"I have used this brand of iron for many years.  I use the professional iron, without the clamp.  It is generally hot enough to curl my stubborn hair, but hot enough to burn my skin harshly if I accidentally allow it to slip.  As curling irons go, it is a bit heavy, and a strong hand is needed.",4.0
"The handle is a little loose and different from my old Hot Tools curling iron.  It is a little trickier, but I like the result it produces",4.0

Once you get the hang of the handle it works so nice!,4.0
the first Hot Tools marcel that I bought from Amazon had a problem with the rotation mechanism in the handle. I returned it and bought one from a local beauty supply store where they let me test the item before purchase and it worked fine. I think it was just random defect. I like the one I have now just fine.,4.0
"I've never used a curling iron like this, it's not bad but I'm a bit uncoordinated and clumsy so I can't seem to use it well. I'm still trying!",4.0
"I'm new to the marcel iron, so I've found it somewhat difficult to use. I had hoped it would be a little easier, but still find the mechanism somewhat awkward. That may just take some more getting used to. Other than that, it seems to work well. It heats up enough to hold the hair in place for a few hours, even for fine hair.",4.0
"IMPORTANT TIP:  Most curling irons have a tip at the end that one can hold onto.  THIS DOESN'T!!  There are gloves one can buy to use with these Marcel types of curling irons so one doesn't burn the tips of the fingers. I'm still getting used to it, because I don't use it every day, but so far, I love the ease and size of this curling iron.  I thing a glove or at least 2 finger cots should be in the package for what it costs, but other than that, no complaints so far.",4.0
I had a iron like this one that I had and used for years. I am happy for one improvement. The cord's lighter weight makes it easier to handle. The only problem is that the marking showing the temperatures is still hard to read. Using trail and error could cause you to burn your hair. Overall I am pleased.,4.0
I got this for my daughter who is a teen. I thought that she would be less likely to burn herself than with a wand. She figured it out with the aid of some YouTube demos. I wish that i had ordered a slightly smaller barrel but it still does a good job curling her ends.,4.0
"this is a great iron, i work in a spa and just had prom up-dos, it worked great, it warms up quick and stays hot. plus i love the marcel design, also nice that it has an adjustable heat setting. my advice: buy it!",4.0
"I love hot tools!  These curling irons are all I use in the salon and hold their heat well.  The curl is superior.  Never get buildup or crusties on the rod and has a heat control setting which is nice for delicate or coarse hair.  Marcel is perfect.  My only complaint is that the cords always end up melting on other rods or showing wires which eventually short right up by where the cord attaches to the base.  I usually get a good year, maybe18 months out of one of these but never more.  Keep in mind I use it repeatedly almost daily though.  Wish the cord was better but love everything else!",4.0
I bought it as a gift for one if my coworkers n she loves the curls that it gives to here clients.,4.0
"My wife is the primary user and she is very pleased with it. Skin seems to be smoother and without a doubt it shrinks the pore size. The only negative would be with the dispenser, you have to be very careful not to squirt out too much.",4.0
"First of all, let me say that this was actually a bad buy for me since I didn't realize that it had Retin-A in it (because of this, you really need to use an SPF in conjuction with this product) and Retin-A makes my face break out like someone hitting puberty. It's just not a good thing for me.

I'm Italian and I have the biggest pores all over and around the nose area.

Aside from the breakouts, I did notice a shrinking in the size of my pores. The most IMPORTANT thing to know about this product is that, in order to see results, you must use it TWICE A DAY, or you probably won't notice much, aside from the first time you use it.

The reason why I am in favor of this product, except for the horrible breakouts I had because of my freak-of-nature problem, is that my husband, who is not succeptable to breakouts, noticed an immediate differece in the tightning and size of his pores, as well as the smoothness in his skin.

This product really does work, just beware if you have any sensitivity to Retin-A, make sure you USE YOUR SUNSCREEN, and you really have to USE IT TWICE A DAY to see results. Make sure you go the full 8 weeks (I have no idea if one bottle lasts a full 8 weeks, so that's something you may want to find out)! I have heard that the product tends to pill when other things are applied on top of it. I didn't experience any of that, but it's something that you may want to be aware of.

Go to Sephora, ask for a sample, and see if you notice a difference the first time you use it. If you do, there's a good chance that it will work for you in the long run.",4.0
"So my friend swears by this and she got me to try it out.  All of my girlfriends and I are constantly trying out new products and sharing ideas, our husbands are lost, but then I don't know if I really get fishing either so I suppose we're even :P I use Retinol in at least one other product I use for wrinkles that has worked great.

Very bright color. Will be a great color for Easter!,4.0
"The color is really nice, but it's hard to get it to go on smoothly without leaving lines. Feels like you need multiple layers, but after 3 layers, it starts to bubble a bit. That said, I still use it for work on a 2 coat max.",4.0
This is my favorite OPI color ever! I get a lot of compliments on it.  Unfortunately the Polish in this particular bottle chips easier than the last one I had.,4.0
Love this polish!,4.0
Wonderful color goes with all shades of clothing,4.0
The only downfall is it's more black than dark purple.,4.0
"This is s beautiful, long lasting winter color.",4.0
"I really like this nail polish and color.  This would be five stars but the bottle was not a full bottle of nail polish ...this was a bit puzzling if I'm purchasing it new.

"Chick Flick Cherry is a rich blue-red that makes me think of old movies and late nights in the summertime. This is the color of red I like to wear in the summertime with open-toed shoes.  It gives a little mystery, but flirty enough to say hello.  It is a versatile red that is perfect in the winter months as well.  I really like the darker, richer reds in the winter time as there is something comforting and cozy about the color.  If you are not one for blue-reds, this would not be the shade for you.  I put on one coat of polish and it is the perfect shade of red for me.  I don't think I would like it with a second coat.  I do love OPI products but this came with some of the bristles straight out to the side.  While they don't get in the way of polishing my nails, I do worry about product dripping off those stray bristles.",4.0
"Love the name!  the color is a deep purple, but not as close to black as I thought it would be.",4.0
"This is a good, basic shampoo but it does not give my hair the lightness that I like, and get, from some other shampoos.  The lightness I get from other shampoos allows my hair to fall naturally into place after lightly combing it.  After using this shampoo my hair does not fall naturally into place and is somewhat stiff.  I do not usually use a conditioner with this shampoo or other shampoos.  I have fine hair and I generally keep it short.",4.0
Requires at least 3 layers for best color,4.0

"Looks a bit more gray in person, but I love it.",4.0
This is more of a blue-grey,4.0
Nice bright color.,4.0
I love the color the only problem is that it tends to chip easily & instead of  chipping off small pieces like normal paint will do it come off the entire nail at once.,4.0
"I love the look I get when I use this OPI color. If you catch the light just right it makes a disco reflection on a wall. However you need to put on a few coats to get the full blue color if you don't want to have an undercoat of a base color. I also hate the sand paper feel if I don't apply a top coat. Overall I do love this polish as well as the Katy Perry ""Last Friday Night"" sparkle as well. P.S. This polish works best on toes.",4.0
It's fine,4.0
"This is a neutral color. Put on one coat and it gives the nail a shine. add another coat and you get a slight color I like it because it goes on smooth, no ripples or ridges and it is a great color.  It doesn't take long to dry.",4.0
"Nice color, but chips very easily.",4.0
Great,4.0
Typical OPI quality. Shade not exactly as I thought.,4.0
I love OPI but this particular bottle seems a bit thick.,4.0
This color is prettier than it shows in the picture. My only wish is that I did not need to put on 3 coats of nail polish to get a full cover.,4.0
2 coats does just fine,4.0
It is a very cute color.  My daughter (age 14) likes it as well.,4.0
I really love the look of OPI nail polish but it stained my nails.  Anyone else have this problem?,4.0
It is a little more hot pink than I expected. Great product though I love this nail polish brand,4.0
"Haven't tried it yet.  Surprised at the ""terra cotta"" color from the outside of the bottle, I thought it would be more muted.  As soon as I use it, I will report more objectively.",4.0
One of the prettiest blues.,4.0
"Not as good coverage as OPI usually gives, needed 3 coats to perfect",4.0
I love the color but for some reason this one seems to last less days than the other OPI colors I have. I still use it frequently and will keep using it until it runs out!,4.0
"Lovethis color. A nice soft lavendar, not neon or garish. Nice full brush, too..",4.0
I love the color but started chipping right away.,4.0
Beautiful color. The smell is a bit strong.,4.0
"Like all OPI lacquer it wears like iron. Personally I didn't care much for the color - more orange than I expected, but that a personal preference the product itself performed properly. I took a star because I didn't care for the color.",4.0

"Such a beautiful color on my brown skin tone (Carmel); took a star because the packaging was risky. The line polish in a standard small Amazon box with a couple of those air pillows. Fortunately for me, it wasn't damaged. *NOTE* I looked into returning because I mistakenly thought it was OPI gel polish and discovered it's not returnable due to the packaging needs... hopefully the exception is if it comes damaged. :/",4.0

"It was hard to picture the color, but it is all right!!",4.0
So pretty but takes ~3 coats to become opaque!,4.0
"More bubblegum pink than expected, but still a nice, bright mod pink. I received compliments from my coworkers, too.",4.0
"LOVE this color - I wear it all the time. It is VERY transparent, however (which is why I took off a star). You have to apply a different (more opaque) basecoat, or apply several coats to get a good color. It would be good for adding sparkle to another color, or just as a slightly transparent polish.",4.0
Pretty color but sheer. 3 coats to build up.,4.0
"Beautiful color. Great price and excellent shipping package. Timely delivery, too.",4.0
"Quite a good Nail Polish! Has a light pink color
It gives a very sheer tint to the nails...not very opaque.
But it dries like in 1 minute and it is so shiny without a layer of topcoat",4.0
Great color- no shimmer and slightly similar to Cajun shrimp but more pink.,4.0
"This color is not as dense as others I have from OPI where 1-2 coats gives complete, even coverage. After 3 coats of this you could still see the flesh color of my nail beds beneath the polish. The color itself is a beautiful shade of periwinkle, but may only look it's best if put over a white or pale base coat?",4.0
i got a diffrent color its much darker but still pretty !!!!!!!!!,4.0
It's a great pink for summer. The picture on Amazon of the color is definitely not true to life. It's more of a coral color. Just lovely.,4.0
Love the color.,4.0
"- The color is rather pink than lavender. However, it lasts much longer than any other nail polish I have used.",4.0
This polish is a beautiful light blue and perfect for everyday summer or spring wear.,4.0
"I loved the color more than it loved me. A bit too much lilac in this shade in person, so that it clashes with my pink-toned skin. I can't wear it.",4.0
"The color is perfect. It's not as shiny as I'd hoped, but it's such a great, summery color that looked good when my toes were pale and is holding up well as they tan.",4.0
The color doesn't look good on my hands.  I decided to try something different.  Nothing wrong with the product- just not the color for me.,4.0
"When I do a French manicure I like to do the white tips first, then a coat or two of the nude color on top of the whole nail. I like for the tips to be less bright, and if I make a mistake with the tips I don't have to do the whole thing over again, but only correct the tip.

When I put this one on it came out very uneven, plus it made the tips look gross. Just the same as most cheap drug store brands I've tried.",4.0
I like OPI Polish a lot. Not as fond of this color but it is hard to tell on the computer.,4.0
NICE COLOUR.ELEGANT.PRICE IS GOOD FOR DELIVERY CONVIENANCE.,4.0
Discrete. It is very natural looking and I like that.,4.0
I agree with other reviewer it's not as bright as I had pictured this to be. Still I will wear once I get a tan .I think the color will stand out more. Mine looks on the peach side some say pink but I didn't see that.,4.0
Love the color,4.0
"Great color, but it stains nails, even with a base coat.",4.0
"This is a perfect color for spring. Looks nice on tanned or darker skin. Four stars, vs 5 because it doesn't go on evenly and we had to put 3 coats on.",4.0
color is pretty,4.0
I think the price is too high!,4.0
Nice color for summer,4.0
I ordered 4 bottles and one was broken. What a mess. I won't order nail polish again.,4.0
"This is a really bright shade of red. I could not tell that from the picture, but I still like it.",4.0
"If you like dark colors, this one is worth getting. You can see the blue undertones in the light, but in normal lighting...it looks black. Not sure if it was the manicurist or the color formula, but it stayed on for weeks before chipping! Awesome!

Hard to find at target or drugstores. I really liked the place I bought it. It was Amazon! Fast shipping from the seller.",4.0
VERY PRETTY COLOR! You do need a couple of coats to make it really have full opacity. its a pretty purple color.,4.0
"Not exactly the color I thought it would be, but very pretty and looks good on my light skin tone!",4.0
"I gave this product four out of five stars because I haven't worn it yet, and I suspect the glitter doesn't go on as intensely as shown.",4.0
I received the polish and was pleased with the color. It had a lot of different sparkle tones to it and will be fun for a toe polish. I can't wait to try it out and would recommend it to anyone.,4.0
"I had another bottle of this shade from a couple of years ago, and this shade was not exactly the same.",4.0
This is by far my fave OPI color so far.. only 4 stars because it chips a lot easier than the regular colors because of the large glitter chunks..but it's still great.. only need to coats for the glitter example shown.,4.0
"Beautiful color, easy formula, with 2 coats for full opaqueness, and as a bonus, NO STAINING!
Unfortunately it chipped after a day, but it's not a big deal for me since I change polish often enough.
Ultimately, if I had a mainstream brand next to an indie, I'll buy the indie.  I only buy OPI or CG when on sale.  I'm happy with this purchase @ $5.50 but if it were $10, I'd buy me an indie instead.",4.0
Good to go over another purple polish but you have to apply way too many coats for it to be a stand alone polish. Also it's not quite the color in the picture. It's more purple.,4.0
Long wearing and great color. I received lots of compliments.,4.0
love this color.  it's a cross between grey and blue,4.0
"More orange-ish.  Not crazy about the color but love, love, love the texture.",4.0
"I'm not usually a fan of blue nail polish, or maybe I just find it hard to find the right shade, but this shade by OPI is bright and fun and screams ""summer""!  I have a lot of red tone in my skin and I've already developed some tan this season, and this shade of blue works really well on me. It goes on evenly and dries quickly. After two coats I was ready to go. OPI is a brand I like and trust--fun colors, great coverage, and long lasting. Finally found a shade of blue that I like!",4.0
I liked it.,4.0
"I've purchased polish from the OPI Texas Collection before and I love them all. The formula is thin and needs to be applied 2 or 3 coats. If you have the patience, 3 coats is best to show the beautiful sour cherry color of this polish. These ""jelly"" formulations have fantastic shine and look good enough to eat!",4.0
love this brand but  the Hawaiiiian Orchid color ordered has a little more violet tinge in it than picture sample shows.,4.0
"I like the color, but this feels more like a silver than a peal color.  Very nice and high quality, not a gaudy color by any means, would likely purchase again, just not intending to get a white color.",4.0
I really like this color.  It can be described as a neutral shade.  I Would buy this product again. Great,4.0
"I have gotten rid of many other polishes since discovering the Designer Series. They add shimmer without being obnoxiously glittery, and hold up really well. I have every color in the collection and wear them all, but Jewel is totally different than the others. Not sure if I just got a bad bottle or what, but it's watery and takes at least three coats to look ok. It also doesn't cover the edges well. But the other colors are keepers, with beautiful, rich tones. I get tons of compliments when I wear them.",4.0
"This was not the same shade as the one with same name at the salon. This was still ok. Just a little disappointed, especially with the inflated price!",4.0
"The cap was messy with polish like it had been opened and or used. When I have purchased OPI polish in the past, it looks brand new and untouched.",4.0
"this muted sage green is a nice color for spring. it is a sort of pastel celery color, one that I wouldn't usually be attracted to but one that I've been enjoying lately. I expected this to clash with my pale-end-of-medium skintone, but it actually looks nice. this sort of odd color is really interesting on the nails. the pro-wide brush from OPI makes application easier and this polish requires two coats.",4.0
"Another home run with this new addition to my nail polish collection. I've never been disappointed with this brand, and I love the way it shines on my nails.",4.0
"I just want to start my post by stating that I love OPI products. They consistently produce a quality nail product in a variety of gorgeous colors.  I would describe this color as an eggshell, light BLUE.  It's definitely not a gray color.  If you're looking for a gray, you might try ""French Quarter for Your Thoughts"" by OPI, which is a flat medium gray color.  In my opinion, it's very hard to find the right color gray.  It's always more blue, purple, or green than grey, but I think the French Quarter color is pretty on with the gray color.

I love:
1. The quality of OPI products
2. Beautiful, eggshell light blue color

I wish:
1. It didn't chip so easily  (I do the whole thing with a good base and top coat, but it still chips.)",4.0
"I like OPI because it doesn't stain my nails and it's easy to remove, unlike the cheap stuff.  That written, it's also just as easy to chip - but what nail polish isn't?  I like how it dries quickly and doesn't look totally atrocious when I accidentally bump into something when my nails are still wet. Love the color.  Love the name.  I have a few different OPI colors and have been happy with each one.",4.0
"Very pretty kinda blue but love it.  Can't wait for winter  , I think this will be my go to color.",4.0
"After much deliberation and a lot of wine, I decided to go ahead and buy I Vant to Ne A-Lone Star and happily put it on my nails when it arrived. I was impressed with the color, an opaque light gray with a slight pearl to the finish, but it seems a little weaker than the solid gray that we see in the photos. I wore it for about three days before I decided I wanted something a little flashier.

As far as low-key colors go, it's good for work, play and about anything else. Survives dishwashing well, but the opacity of the color leaves a little bit to be desired. Unlike other OPI polishes, this is streaky on the first application and okay on the second...it requires a full three coats to not be able to see light through the tips of the nails.

Overall, the color is good. I like it better than a comparable polish (I think Recycle) by Essie, has no brown undertones, and is good for all skin tones. However, it made my long nails look short compared to other polishes. Where the moon of the nail meets the cuticle, the layers of color were pretty apparent and again seemed weak, and at the tips the polish wore off pretty quickly, even with a good topcoat. I think this is why the nails look shorter.",4.0
"great color, nude is my favourite. OPI is a good quality.",4.0
I expected this color to be a little nicer than it was. Application was great but the color seemed a little blue to me. My mom even actually thought my nail polish was blue. Its a nice color but it kind of makes my skin look a little sick.,4.0
I love the light color.,4.0
"I purchased on sale and glad I did so (original price was $45). The color is nice, but my nails chipped after three days.",4.0

Opi polish is great not sure about this particular color.,4.0
"It is a very pretty red color, but I was hoping it would look more like the darker color in the ""see it on"" pictures. It is more true to the picture of the bottle. I never use anything but OPI. They go on smoothly and last longer than other brands.",4.0
OPI is always a great quality product.,4.0
"The item was as expected. This is an older color, and it arrived a little dry. I added some nail thinner as I would if I had owned the color since new, and the polish was perfect. Brilliant, deep hues make this color beautiful.",4.0
"works good, just don't use it very often",4.0
I love the color!  Great everyday polish.,4.0
It's funny...this color is one of my favorites and my other that I was running low on is a different color on my nails. It is slight and probably because the new one is thinner at the start. But this is one of my absolute favorite color of the winter this year.  Try it you'll be in the fan club if you do. Some people are afraid of the dark colors but I have normal nails and get compliments galore.,4.0
picture color looks different from actual color.,4.0
The color looks weirdly dirtier than the image.,4.0
I haven't used this particular color; I have so many other options.  Just from the stand point of the container it's a  beautiful hue of pale purple.,4.0

"Tutti Frutti Tonga is a BEAUTIFUL, nude-ish color but it takes forever to dry!",4.0
Purchased it because I already use it but have difficulty finding it in the storers.,4.0
"I hate anything beauty related. I do it, but I'm always on the lookout for more efficient ways. For example, I have full makeup (with color correction and dramatic eyes) down to under 5 minutes. This extends to everything else, like hair and nails. I won't stop, but the less time I have to spend on it, the better. I read the reviews on this and got the impression that it would last a while, which is exactly what I needed. The verdict is now in: from the time of my first 2-layer application to the first chip, this polish lasted a solid 10 days. From the time I first applied it to the time it was so chipped I needed to remove the rest and re-apply was 15 days. Even then, 5 nails were in near-perfect condition. That's respectable.

Keep in mind that I don't do much strenuous with my hands that may otherwise affect this outcome. It works for me, though. It's not as long as I'd like, but I don't think any polish short of a tattoo would last as long as I'd like.",4.0
Great solid black. Buy the matte also by OPI for a great combo,4.0
Very pretty.,4.0
Color much pinker than pictured. OPI always great product.,4.0
"OPI is fantastic and my favorite brand but the quality really varies depending on the color.

I can't make separate ratings for each color so I'll give my rundown here:

I love the color ""Do you Lilac It"" and I give it five stars for the perfect springtime lilac color and smooth application.
The ""Princesses Rule!"" color is almost a rose gold so it's pretty but it has more sparkles than I was expecting which creates a rougher finish than I wanted. 3 stars.
The ""AmazON...AmazOFF"" color is a beautiful foresty green color but it stains nails and skin like there's no tomorrow! Very difficult to remove even with acetone. I give it 3 stars for that.
""Strawberry Margarita"" is a perfectly fun bright pink. Five stars!
""I'm Not Really a Waitress"" is a deep red that's beautiful as long as you don't get it on your skin. Looks just like blood if you're a messy nail painter like I am. I give it a 4 star rating.",4.0

"Nice shade of pink.  Transparent pink unless you apply more than one coat, which is my preference, so I like it.",4.0
"I love sparkly nail polish, but in the short time that I've been painting my nails (as a recovering nail biter), I've been mostly using topcoats with sparkle in them. I was surprised to paint this on and get a full sparkly coating happening on my nails.  No base color other than a clear coat needed.  This is a party on your nails and is a great color to go with almost any look.  I have another bottle from this line that I will review when I try it out, but I'm sure it will be just as sparkly and fabulous.

This would be a fabulous stocking stuffer idea for almost anyone who likes to paint their nails.

It's the perfect shade to go to if you want super dark nails but you're bored of black! It's like a super dark eggplant color. The only thing I don't like is how sheer it seems to go on if you stick a light under your nails. The sheer spots show up but it's nothing a 3rd coat of the nail polish won't cover up! I love the color so much I've used it 3x in a row!,4.0
Love opi,4.0

pretty color but gets thick and old when it is only half full.,4.0
A pretty nude if you have a bit of a tan or darker skin tones,4.0
"Mixed feelings on this polish. You definitely need 2 coats for even coverage and also need to shake the bottle multiple times during application. On the other hand, I am pretty rough on my nails but this polish still lasts all week. It also dries fairly fast which is both good and bad feature. For someone who is a little more careful, this would most likely last more than a week. All in all, its worth the effort and money, I would have give 5 stars if it applied just a little easier.",4.0

Really good summer shade!,4.0
"This is a really pretty color...the shade reminds me very much of a Christmas tree.  It's a little darker than I expected, but I love that one coat was more than enough on my toenails.  It's thick, shiny, and applied easily.

My only complaint was the brush.  It had random hairs sticking out all over the place, which made it much more difficult to get a clean, pristine look.
Will update regarding longevity in a few weeks.",4.0

Love this color. It's fun and versatile. I buy a lot of OPI brand and find it to be good quality.,4.0
"The nail polish itself is definitely a 5 star. Opi is my favorite brand. Quick drying, stays on for weeks.

However, I did not give a 5 star due to the fact the color match isn't exact. It's definitely a red and I was thinking more of a deeper, darker wine. It's still gorgeous though!",4.0
"OPI's My Private Jet is supposed to be dark charcoal/black with silver sparkle.  Instead it's a frayed dark brown with silver sparkle.  I think it probably looks good on those with a warm skin tone but I'm not thrilled with it on my cool, pink under toned skin.  Essie's Tribal Text-styles is a blacker base with silver sparkles that works better for those with cool toned skin.  I think the Essie wears better in this case too.  I got 6 days without chips with the Essie Tribal Text-style and only 3 with the OPI My Private Jet.",4.0
very sheer. need three coats to get even some coverage,4.0
good,4.0
I took a chance with this one hoping it would be the color that shows in the picture. On my screen it looked a bit orchid but it's definitely more of a bright barbie doll box pink which is not a bad thing at all just not the color I was hoping for.

Love the color. It did chip pretty easily. But not bad for the cost.,4.0
the color was a little darker and less red than I expected but still a great polish!!,4.0
"I actually really love the top coat and base coat. I've purchased one color and it was just ok. It started peeling off on the 3rd day. I actually use regular nail polish with the infinite shine base and top coat and get much better results! My polish lasts a good 6 days before I get the urge to pick it off.  Its the only no light gel polish ive tried so I can't compare it to any other brands.
So far I'm pretty happy with the results. Top Coat is super shiny!",4.0
"Hmm, i find I'm conflicted about giving Infinite Shine (IS) 4 stars, but 3 stars seems too severe. This is not nearly as tough as real UV gel, but it is better wearing than regular OPI lacquer and less damaging to the nail bed than UV gels. I usually get  long wear with only minor chips, but it is difficult to apply smoothly. So, I often have to redo some nails that went on lumpy or smudged hours later.  One thing that makes me unsatisfied is the long drying time needed between coats to avoid dents and smudges. I found one color (Princesses Rule) thickened in the bottle rather quickly. IS color coats maybe difficult to apply without bare spots, or streaks if you try to smooth out the bare spots. I try to float it on quickly, keeping the brush almost parallel to the nail. I agree with another reviewer who noted, it is best to just use 2-3 quick strokes and avoid over working the surface with the brush. It helps to wrap the base and top coats over the tips. I also get better results if I dry my nails in bright, direct sunlight, if possible. Indoor lighting is a bit wimpy to work on the natural light activator in the top coat. I find it helps a lot to add a new top coat every day or so - I usually use OPI Plumping Top Coat the next day after the initial IS2, as I like the deeper, glassy shine it gives.",4.0
"Hey, nothing spectacular BUT just does what it's suppose to do.....cannot ask for better than that!",4.0
I rated 4 because it's really a lot more lavender than the color implies.,4.0
"I love this polish, but I haven't yet been able to find a pink polish I like to go underneath. I have a Robin eggs blue polish and combined my nails look just like that - a Robin's egg.",4.0
"Nice,although the picture shows a bluish tint it's actually greenish.",4.0
"great dark black color... however, i found that (as i have found with another black nail polish i've purchased) that the consistency is a little different.",4.0

"OPI is my favorite brand of nail polish.  This color is too bright a pink for me, but I mix it with white and off-white to make the perfect shade.  You just need to have a bottle of some pink that is empty or nearly empty so that you can start  mixing.  What's nice about Pinking of You is that it is opaque, not translucent.  It covers well in 2 coats.  The paler pinks that I have tried have been too thin and translucent - so I mix my own!",4.0
The color is so nice but the liquid is so old and thick and bulk. It might was old.,4.0
"I have been looking for a matte top coat for a while.  Sally Hansen's would leave white looking streaks on your nails and there was no other brand I could fine until Amazon suggested this.  It goes on smooth, no white streaks and the polish is a pretty matte finish.  I will add pictures later.",4.0
With OPI Infinite Shine you need to use their primer and topcoat.,4.0

"Really pretty color, but not good for a yellower skin-tone. Gave it to my mom who is more of a pink skin tone. Very blue undertones",4.0
Not as bright as it looks,4.0
"I adore this on my toenails. Not as much on my fingers for some reason, maybe it's a little *too* pink for them. It is the most beautiful coral pink and really looks good with my pale skin. Perfect summer color!",4.0
"I love the matte finish, it looks so smooth and perfect, this stuff dry fast too. Only thing is its a bit pricey",4.0
very elegant as an accent,4.0
"Like all of OPI's nail polish, this polish is great quality and I loved the color in the bottle. The only thing I dislike is that it takes about 3 coats before the color is opaque and not streak-y on your nails.",4.0
Polish is nice. Just seems like the color has changed from what it used to be.,4.0
"Pretty color, but even with the 2 step process, its not as shiny as I had hoped.  Polish doesn't last.",4.0
"I love it and it didn't chip quickly but it took me a couple tries to make it look nice.  For a nice smooth matte look, it is better to put a thicker layer on or it will look streaked.  After figuring this out, my nails looked good.",4.0
"Bottom line: Opi Infinite Shine polishes are difficult to apply, but are pretty, so shiny, and more durable than traditional Opi polishes, although they are removed as easily as other Opi polishes. From Here to Eternity is a bright, happy color -- it is tropical and makes me smile and think of summer, despite the snow outside now. The Infinite Shine requires 3 coats of color to be opaque (=5 coats total, including base & top coats). These polishes are not forgiving, in that it is very easy to leave more bare spots, from working it too much; this is not the type of polish that you can brush on carefully to cover from top to bottom and side-to-side on each nail before it starts to set. This polish goes on best with minimal brushing, as 3-4 quick brush strokes per nail. The brush is as good as all Opi brushes and it dries quickly enough between coats but is overall more difficult to apply than the traditional Opi shades. After 3 days, I have noticed 1 tiny chip in my pedicure, but having tried the Infinite Shine shades several times, they look good for at least several days (and up to a week) longer than traditional Opi shades. I can get 2-3 weeks out of a pedi done in this color collection. The color is rich and deep, and shines nicely. Pretty Pink Perseveres is also lovely; it is a light pink that contrasts nicely, especially if you have darker skin tones.

If you are thinking about switching to Opi Infinite Shine, I am not sure it is worth the bother (or expense), unless you need new Opi colors -- because the Infinite Shine polishes are so frustrating to apply, plus switching requires the purchase of new top & base coats.",4.0
"I wish all of the the reviews were pro or con ""A Grape Fit.""  Many OTHER color experiences are reported here.
If possible, I would appreciate a more accurate filter system.",4.0
Nice color,4.0
useful,4.0
"The color is more grey than purple, but either way, it's still very pretty. The consistency isn't as thick as you'd expect it to be for a gel polish, which is great. It distributes evenly and dries fast.",4.0
