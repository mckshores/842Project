"While there was a lot of information in this piece (some of it coming at your faster than a freight train, another down side of the video), there is no doubt that it was produced as right-wing propaganda, which means I'm not able to use it as I hoped (for my children's home schooling). One large section of the video is a series of quotes from historical U. S. leaders, mentioning God and/or the Bible -- the quotes are simply inserted without any background or even a common-ground to relate each of them.",2.0
Terrible soulless version of the classic Dickens tale,2.0
We got bored and didn't finish the film.,2.0
Very slow start. The old grouch was not too believable since he was such a terrible jerk! Acting is sub-par,2.0
"Hate to say it, but this is an example of a re-make falling short of the mark.",2.0
I just did not like this version...still like the old originals.,2.0
Not very good.,2.0
Very Slow,2.0
Pathetic reproduction of the Dickens classic. Interesting that the movie is particularly concerned with  the problem of people who lose their possessions to money lenders--corporations not unlike the ones which own directly or indirectly the media which present us with the American version of the Christmas carol.,2.0
This was a terribly boring movie; glad I didn't pay to see it.,2.0

"this was not a good edition of the story, all the others are much better.",2.0
Love the movie but didn't have closed captions.,2.0
"I am amazed at the high ratings this ripoff of ""A Christmas Carol"" has?  Overall a terrible movie with wooden acting.  If you want a real Christmas movie, watch the real movie and not this cheap imitation.",2.0
"It started out promising, but it began to drag on and on focusing on too much irrelevant history.",2.0
"An unusual take on "" A Christmas Carol.""  This movie takes place in New Hampshire in the early 20TH century. It is a made for tv movie on a very low budget.  It has some good parts and the acting is not bad, but Henry Winklers' make up is very badly done, when he made this movie he was in his late 40's and he plays an old Scoroge, in this case Slade.in his 80's. Interesting but I would not recommend it.",2.0
BORING !!,2.0
Another entry in the retelling of the classic.  Ho hum from start to finish.  Henry Winkler is not believable as a Scrooge type.,2.0
this movie just did not live up to the expectations of other Christmas Carol movies.... it seem contrived and was not very well put together,2.0
I didn't find this version of the classic very moving or interesting.  The original Christmas Carol was so much better.,2.0
"This is a first for me, I didn't like this movie and I think I only had it on for about 20 minutes.  Acting just wasn't there.",2.0
"We began watching this video, but stopped it a short way into it when we realized this was not what we had hoped for.  It was too contrived and predictable.",2.0
"If you gave this a high rating. It was for being a great HOLLYWOOD Production.. If you read the BIBLE you will find out Joseph was quite the opposite. It's in a small part a Christian movie. I can't see God pleased with exploiting sex scenes. If the Hollywood director when by the bible it would have raved reviews. It goes to show you how many BIBLE read the bible and how many never have opened one, going by all this Five star ratings.",2.0
My fault I didn't realize it was VHS so it's nice to have but what I was looking,2.0
"I Didn't like this movie. I will keep and add it to my collection..This movie hit a soft spot with me it's about jealousy something a lot of people have had against me my whole life even family members. This movie was really sad I cried at the end because I couldn't hold myself any longer, and I'm a very strong woman..Joseph brothers sold him into slavery because their father favored him. Joseph had several brothers who sinned in the eyes of GOD, so their father favored Joseph because he was the youngest and most righteous. That enraged his brothers they trapped young Joseph and was going to leave him for dead then Egyptians came along the brothers decided to sell him into slavery instead....I didn't see any nudity in the movie. I decided to write that because I read some reviews that talked about nudity I didn't see no nudity in Joseph.......I purchased 3 movies.......David..........Abraham & Joseph....I rate #1David.....#2 Abraham..#3 Joseph..I liked David the most...",2.0
"Way tooooo much Potiphar.  You'd think he was a primary mover and shaker in this story.  He was a literary device.  Ben must have needed an ego boost or something.  As to the story of Dinah, well much license has been taken to tell a story which has no chronological placement in the Jacob/Joseph story.",2.0
"This ""Not Rated"" version is NOT family-friendly! Don't watch it with the kids!",2.0
"This film is, without a doubt, a Christian perspective on the Joseph story. Or as one of your reviewers commented, there are messianic threads cleverly interwoven throughout. For example, nowhere in the old testament does Jacob EVER say that he gives his inheritance to Joseph. This is an obvious suggestion that Jesus, descended from the tribe of Joseph (and whose nominal ""father"" is Joseph)is to inherit Gods blessings, with Christians inheriting the covenant of the Israelites. And the scene of Joseph imprisoned in the Pharaoh's prison saying to God ""why have you forsaken me"" is NOWHERE mentioned in the old testament; it is strictly put in to provide a Christian slant. Toward the end of the movie, when Joseph goes to see his father, there is a scene in which a large number of crosses appear (briefly). And incidentally, when Joseph and his father meet, the former is shown bowing down to the latter. However, as is clearly stated in the old testament, when Joseph has his dream in which the sun, moon and the stars bow before him, for this dream to be fulfilled (as are all the others in the Joseph story), Jacob (the sun) must bow down to Joseph, not the reverse. I don't have a problem with Christian Messianic films, and I in fact saw this on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, but before everyone falls all over themselves saying what a saintly film this is, please, recognise that it has been made with a specific point of view in mind, namely Christianity, and that there are other perspectives on the Joseph story that are quite different.  I think that some honesty on this subject would raise this film above the level of Christian propaganda.",2.0
"This film is closer to the Biblical text of this account, than any we've yet seen....it's very emotional and very encouraging as well.  Long film, but not too long!  The only real problem (meaning unacceptable) is the bath-tub scene with Joseph.  He's seen from waist up, in a pool relazing/bathing, and in comes his boss's wife who's been after him sexually.  Potiphar's wife seductively rubs up and down his chest, until (WITH MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS GOING ALONG WITH THE SEDUCTIVITY) she goes down into the water below his waist and connects with his genitals (yes, for real).  Both Joseph and her are shown to react to the moment ever so....""slightly"" and then she leaves him alone until the next time she confronts him.  We had this film for YEARS and thought how awesomely Biblical (compared to any other film) this movie was, but never noticed this part until this year.  Why?  because we had younger children at the time, and so the inferred sexual tension of her rubbing his shoulders over the bath-tub/pool was something we'd simply pass by w/ the fast-fwd button a mere several seconds.  We didn't do that this year, and WHOOOAH!!  We were SHOCKED at what transpired in those few moments.  They don't show below the water, but they PLAY UP the moment big time to let you know what is happening.  For this reason, i say DON'T BUY THE MOVIE unless you can edit it.  If i had this film on VCR, i'd simply tab the ""edit"" tab on the VCR tape and i'd record a whole minute or two over that one moment (which wouldn't hurt a 3-plus hour long film!).

It's truly a shame that the film makers snuck in a scene of this degree, they simply could have ended with the woman rubbing Joseph's shoulders in flirtation (showing her constant pursuit of him) and played up the moment that way, at that time.  However, they stuck a little leaven in to satisfy Hollywood and to ""leaven the whole loaf"" with making it clear that she was touching his genitals for a bit and he was helpless to deal with the tempation for a few moments.  This cheap move by the film makers reminds me of the ""Sampson"" film put out by the Bible Collection film makers....which is TOTALLY TRASHY...taking the sexuality way OVERBOARD for the Sampson screen (don't buy it! My family was apalled!).  Again, i say if you cannot edit the movie, DON'T BUY IT.",2.0
"It is a good film for someone who has never heard of or studied Jesus, but a tad simple in its presentation of all the material.",2.0
"Slavishly faithful to the Gospel of Luke, this by-the-numbers retelling of Jesus's life never develops dramatic momentum.  As cinema, it's just plain dull; the photography is washed-out (as it was even when the film was new), the zoom lens is overused, and the special effects, minimal as they are, get really cheesy.  Everything is exposition, and it's not terribly competent exposition at that.
Some continuity gaffes create unintentional hilarity.  For example, when Jesus dips his head in the water for a total-immersion baptism, his hair never seems to get wet.  (This is a miracle we haven't read about, folks.)
Extras are fun, including a short documentary about the Jesus Film Project, which carts this particular film all around the world as an evangelical tool.  Especially surreal is an hour-long compendium of pious testimonials from such luminaries as George Bush XLI and David Copperfield (huh?).
The soft but adequate full-frame transfer on this DVD doesn't leave out any significant information -- I suspect the film was shot open matte.  But many of the compositions are so inept that you'll swear they were cropped at the sides anyway.
Catholics beware: This film presents a very Protestant-American Jesus, with its emphasis on a ""personal relationship with God"" and other faith concepts that Mother Church could find potentially heretical.  That's no surprise, though, considering that the film was financed by the leader of Campus Crusade for Christ.",2.0
"While it is mostly Biblically accurate, nevertheless this is a very lackluster re-telling, being obviously low-budget. The most dramatic and emotional scene for me was when Mary Magdalene's tears fell on Jesus's feet and she wiped them with her hair. The scourging scene lacked any impact, probably not to horrify the audience. According to evidence from the Holy Shroud of Turin and the witness of several Catholic mystics, His scourging was absolutely heart-rending in its horror. Of course, this being an obvious Protestant production, they gave short shrift to Jesus's mother, Mary! Maybe that is why they chose Luke, instead of using material from Matthew, Mark or John!!! I guess what I am looking for is a good Catholic rendering. Any good Catholic out there have about $100,000,000 (or possibly less), as I am ready to do it right!!!",2.0
"""Frosty Returns"" is the epitome of why classics from the 60s and 70s need not be remade.  Although Jonathan Winters does a respectable job as narrator, the story suffers from ""politically correct"" environmentalism and de-Christianization of Christmas.  None of it was necessary and detracts the story.
Furthermore, there is no artistic continuity with the original ""Frosty"".  None of the characters are depicted in their original form and the computer-aided animation doesn't really add anything, either.
I was disappointed that this episode was included with the Frosty DVD.  The true and worthy sequel to the original Frosty is ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"".  Watch that instead as it is MUCH better than this one.",2.0
"The people at Amazon don't make it obvious that this DVD is in Spanish and is only available in Spanish.  If one doesn't speak Spanish, it isn't possible to watch.  I returned it TWICE because Amazon was unaware of their own product.",2.0
"... the Story of the real Saint Nicholas.  If they had started with him as the real Nicholas was, priest and then Bishop of Myra, and told of some of his real miracles, and then added the fantasy elements of his transformation into the Santa Claus of today, it would have been an incredible classic.  A perfect bridge between the Rudolph/Snow Miser type specials, and the Nestor/Little Drummer Boy ones.  As it is, its a fun show with some good songs and memorable villains.  But it could have been so much more.",2.0
"I bought this DVD to replace the one I had before (and which was lost in a church library), about 8-10 years ago.  The older version had a chapter that corresponded with each chapter in the book, but this revised version had condensed DVD chapters that grouped book chapters, which made it much less useful for my purpose, which was to support a chapter-by-chapter discussion of the book.",2.0
"this is not the version i was looking for. this is the short group version, I was looking for the full version.",2.0
no comment,2.0
Quality is not very good.,2.0
"My daughter and I love the TV show but this was definitely not as well thought out. Would not recommend for kids who still believe in Santa, could lead to a lot of questions. Rather disappointed.",2.0
"We ended up stopping this movie less than a third of the way in. I was displeased with the heavy Jesus references and the bratty nature of the characters. The former complaint is certainly specific to our tastes, but the latter is not. We just felt there were better options.",2.0
If you want a wide spectrum exhibit of all beliefs including being a Gnostic this is your movie. I am a practicing Catholic and I had to turn this off while watching because it seems to undermine Christmas and try to show that there are many other beliefs during this time. It should have been named Arthur's guide to the winter season and practices. I  guess that is what you get with Arthur type stuff.,2.0
My kids are young (under the age of 4) and couldn't get into this. Plus I don't enjoy movies about Christmas when they're really about being politically correct.,2.0
"The DVD was blank, unfortunately.",2.0
Maybe not.,2.0
"This DVD is easy to understand and is highly recommended by reviewers.  However, I have to say after doing 3 of the sessions, I just could not take the boredom of it.  The exercises are fine, it is the instructor.  She says the exact same words every time.  And I was not motivated by the fact that she is dressed in street clothes. The whole thing felt odd and I have ordered another DVD.",2.0
"If you have already been to a pelvic physical therapist then this is not for you. I would say this is strictly for beginners, but even still I didn't think there was much substance to this video.",2.0
I just started the exercises about a week ago.  I plan to try it for 6 weeks to see if my pelvic floor is tightened.  The exercises are easy and she explains things well.,2.0
Video and sound quality are terrible,2.0
"The DVD does not work on my DVD player or laptop without skipping or getting a jumbled picture. My DVD player and laptop play all other DVD's just fine. This DVD seems like it is low quality. I like what I see in Tasha's video, but I don't have the patience for the DVD issues. Deciding how best to handle this, return the DVD or get a replacement. I am doubtful a replacement will resolve the issue.",2.0
"I bought this dvd for postpartum incontinence and diligently did the workouts for about 4 weeks. I saw some improvement but it was very small and I still had moderate incontinence issues. I bought the XFT iEase also available on amazon

http://www.amazon.com/Calliger-Pelvic-Exerciser-On-Screen-Biofeedback/dp/B00H5GDO4Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1407339566&sr=8-1&keywords=iease

This thing is amazing. I can actually see on the screen how strong my muscles are contracting when I do a kegel exercise. I had no idea how weak my muscles really were but this machine measures your strength and ranks you according to levels. I started at level 2 (weak muscles) and am rapidly improving because I can SEE how much I need to push myself. With this Hab It dvd, I thought I was working hard but never really knew where I was at so I didn't push myself even though I thought I was. If you truly want to regain muscle control, go with the XFT iEase. It's a but more pricey but is SO worth it. I'd pay a lot more now that I know it works.",2.0
This DVD is poorly designed in it lay out of the exercises.  It is hard to get from one exercise section to another. The speaker talks too much and is too repetitive. She is very irritating to listen to over a long period of time.  DVD was produced a long time ago and has never been updated.  Needs updating badly.  It is also overpriced for what few exercise you get.  Would not recommend it to anyone and wish I had not purchased it.  There has to be something better out there for strengthening pelvic floor muscles,2.0
"I was really hoping this DVD would help, but all it did was frustrate my many attempts to play it. It came to me very dirty! After trying to play it on numerous DVD players and then cleaning it several times, the DVD finally played.  The information was good on the DVD...but the experience of trying to get it to play was grueling.
Another huge disappointment was that this item comes with no written list of the exercises...so if you want to do them on your own without a DVD player you are out of luck.  I cannot speak to the effectiveness of the exercises as it is almost impossible to do them unless you plan on doing them in the same location day after day. I thought it would come with a booklet which would be a synopsis of the contents of what the DVD contained. I am very disappointed in this<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hab-It-Pelvic-Floor/dp/0510539610/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hab It: Pelvic Floor</a>&nbsp;product.",2.0

The Chinese words in the CD & books are so simple -- you can learn it from Nie Hao Kailan.

Not recommended - if you want to learn chinese languages pls go to your nearest Library. There are tons of how to learn Mandarins books!",2.0
This was a nice 30 minute video and the extra resources are great.  But for $50 I was expecting more than a single episode!  My 9 and 12 year old sons enjoyed it and we'll watch it a few more times and practice with the flash cards.  BUT this was way over-priced!!!!,2.0
"this product is probably good for teaching english speaking child chinese, but definitely not for a child who already understands chinese.

we bought this thinking to give our daughter (16mos old) an alternative dvd movie to watch that's all in chinese. the description said it's in english and chinese, and we thought we'd have the option to choose the language. what we got was each phrase spoken in english, then followed in chinese.  maybe there was a storyline to it, but we skipped through each chapter and didn't notice any storyline.  the making dumpling chapter was mostly in english.

we ended up returning the product, not what we were looking for.",2.0
"I'm sorry,  I just felt like this flick was one joke told again and again for about twenty minutes.  I think it would be more amusing as a concept you share with your friends at a bar one evening, but as a completed short film...you should probably borrow it, as opposed to renting or buying.",2.0
"Probably just because of all the hype about it, when I finally got a chance to see it (on the Sci-Fi channel's ""Exposure"" show) I  ended up only finding it fair at best. It's basically one very simple joke  told repeatedly. This isn't a terrible thing as the film was so short, but  surely something much better and much funnier could have been achieved with  the same idea.
My recommendation is that you watch it before buying. You  may, like me, not see what all the hype is about.",2.0
"Unfortunately cinematography and music are really all there is to this short. The rest was soulless and pretty weak comedy. The film has nowhere  near the passion of ""Hardware Wars,"" etc., and the comic moments  are highly repetitious (they have to be because of the ""idea""  behind the short, I guess, but that doesn't mean it's enjoyable). But I did  enjoy the way the cinematography and music danced around both films they  are spoofing, and the actors were decent, so I give it a 2.
Don't fall  for the hype.

"John Ankerberg and Jimmy DeYoung come together to create ""Israel Under Fire: The Prophetic Chain of Events That Threatens the Middle East,"" a book that promises to explain the Biblical predictions concerning the current events in Israel, how what happens in Israel affects the rest of the world, and answers the age old question, ""Will there ever be peace in the Middle East."" To come to these answers Ankerberg and DeYoung interview - on location in Israel and the Middle East - many of the policy makers and experts who would be close to the situation, such as, Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel and Reuven Rivlin, the Speaker of the Knesset in Israel.

Ankerberg and DeYoung are less authors than interviewers for much of the book (and interviewees, as I will explain.) The authors claim that the book will answer questions and give a biblical basis for the current events in Israel. To accomplish these goals the authors provide a brief history how the modern state of Israel came to be, what exactly is currently happening in Israel. On these points, I found that the authors were successful. Unfortunately, this was only the one part of the book.

In the second part of the book, the authors interview current world leaders and here is where I feel the books goes awry. I had two issues here. First, the authors advertise on the back cover that they interview Adnan Husseini, Yasser Arafat's cousin and Palestinian Authority spokesman.' It is true. But this is a little misleading as he is one of three world leaders advertised yet he appears in only one very short section with only a couple of questions, while the others leaders, Jewish pundits exclusively, are interviewed extensively. This is far from balanced coverage.

Second, the authors didn't just interview pundits they agreed with - they also interviewed each other. I understand that the authors may be experts in a field but their opinions should be bolstered by other expert's opinions, statistics, reports and the like. Author's opinions should not be proved by their own opinions. The issue of lack of documentation and proof isn't just relegated to their opinions in interviews. Unfortunately, the authors take comments and opinions from pundits they agree with for granted, moving right past controversial quotes that cry out for data that reinforces the opinion. The only reference in the book to an outside source (other than the Bible) is on page 156 (of 174).

In the third section of the book, the authors attempt to tie current events with Biblical prophecy. I would expect that anyone, after reading this book, even someone who has no experience with Biblical prophecy or current events, would be able to walk away understanding the ""prophetic chain of events that threaten the Middle East."" What I found in this section, though, was confusion. To explain a complicated book like Revelation, I would expect we would start at the beginning and work our way through the (purported) time line from start to finish. I would expect that current events would be tied in to the timeline to show how the events fit into the puzzle. I would expect that the authors would show how these events work together to fulfill prophecy. Unfortunately, Ankerberg and DeYoung did not make a convincing connection for me.

While I did find the first section of the book interesting, this book left me unsatisfied in my search for connections between current events and Biblical prophecy. Revelation itself is already difficult to understand and I found the authors didn't accomplish their goal of making it accessible and understood by the novice.

As much as I would have liked to, I cannot recommend this book to anyone but the expert Bible prophecy student.

"I gave this to a friend's daughter who is 27 months old. She's just beginning to watch video as her parents waited until she was two years old before exposing her to videos. She was eager to watch the video, but after five or ten minutes she said, ""I don't like this."" She asked for Elmo. Her mother tried to fast forward to other places in the video, but she soundly rejected it. Instead, she happily watched the Letter factory video I sent her a few weeks ago.

We're still hoping with time and more exposure she might come to like this video. But today I ordered her the Elmo Potty Training video. If she wants Elmo; I'll send her Elmo.

"My 2 year old daughter enjoys the songs, but the snarky and rude behavior modeled by Ernie and the bellhop is a bad example for her. Sesame Street, at its best, teaches children respect and kindness towards others. That's not only absent here, but what is shown is the opposite of how I would like my child to behave.",2.0
thought i would use it for my grandson.have to wait till he is older.not as musical or colorfull as i had hoped,2.0
"My 2.5 yr old will watch just about anything, but this just has never grabbed her attention. I don't know if it's an Ernie issue and just not enough other characters or what, but she's just not having it. She usually loves Seasame Street stuff, but this is a big miss with her. I'm glad I bought used.",2.0
"I loved Sesame street growing up, but Sesame street as a whole seems to be going downhill to me.  This video, while it does have a couple of great vintage clips, models HORRIBLY rude and disobedient behavior.  The bunny is extremly rude to Ernie and the Honker, and Ernie and the Honker repeatedly bother and annoy Benny, even after Benny asks them to stop (and of course, asks in a rude way).  The educational value is minimal.  I really don't think this helped my child to count to 15 or to recognize his numbers.  If you want some good vintage Sesame STreet clips, check out the 25th anniversary.  Good clips, educational value is about the same, but no rude behavior, and no disobedient behavior.",2.0
"I rarely review books or DVDs but I felt compelled to do so with this one because it is really, really bad.  There's a lot of yelling from one of the main characters (the bunny) and, though the songs are cute, there's no way to play all of the songs without also watching some of the bunny, who comes across as really cantankerous and angry.  I love Sesame Street as a general rule, but strongly dislike this particular video.",2.0
"The story line is very boring.  My toddler loses interest immediately.  As a parent, I do as well.  Compared to some of the other Sesame dvd's, this one is poor. Story line is portrayed by Ernie, along with ""second string"" characters.  I think you should spend your money on other learning materials.",2.0
"Part 1 of this DVD is crammed with standard shred licks...but not much in the way of how, when and where to use them. In that respect, it's one of the more disorganized guitar instructional videos I've seen. Despite Paul's youth and enthusiasm,, the material gets relatively advanced rather quickly (and he can play the licks so fast and perfect, it's just as discouraging as inspirational).

In Part 2, he sporadically mentions things that would be aimed at relative beginners...which definitely doesn't belong on these videos.  On the other hand, Example #7 is so much more intricate/difficult than anything else on this disk, it seems out of place.  The best thing on the whole disk are the 2-note per string/string skipping arpeggios (wish I woulda started practicing those 10 years ago). There are a couple of other cool licks, but the video ends up a mess of a lot of talking...my mind wandered.

Before attempting to play along, you should already know all the major scale modes and the melodic minor scale.  Your alternate picking should already be very controlled/synchronized and you should be experienced with string skipping.  It also contains some extreme finger stretches/intervals that a lot of people might never be able to do (a shorter scale neck or extraordinary long fingers will come in handy here).

If you don't already have the skills mentioned above, I highly recommend Don Latarski's ""Guitar Theory Basics"" and Frank Gambale's ""Chopbuilder"" be bought first.  Sequentially, they'll introduce you to all the basic mode fingerings and get your alternate picking, control and speed somewhat closer to Paul's level.",2.0
"The title on this exercise DVD does not really match the actual content. ""Yoga-Lite for Biblical Worship after Childbirth"" may be a better title.

Tonya leads a gentle, soft yoga practice (not powerful as in the title) geared towards intermediate practitioners. There is not a lot of sculpting performed in the practice, although her Yoga routine can provide some toning. She provides very little instruction or beginner options so I would not recommend it if you're looking for a beginner's stretching routine. For instance, during Chaturanga (slow downward movement plank), she does not give the option to lower your knees first, then goes into the full upward dog position. She does bridge pose (an advanced yoga posture) with very little instruction and poor form.

Also, if you're looking for a non-demoninational practice, this is not the DVD for you. She talks specifically about God, Jesus, and Repenting and includes quotes from the bible during what's called the ""Spritual Warm-Up"", which assumes all spiritual practitioners believe in God and follow the Bible. It felt more like a sermon/lecture to me. This turned me off, specifically since it's marketed as a regular ""stretching"" video.

The practice is somewhat weak, Tonya's voice is too soft and she does not provide clear enough queues so you have to look up quite often to follow her routine. Moveover, the music is too load and has church-based singing which even more overpowers her delicate voice.

The introduction video section has Tonya and her single student showing their new babies. It is commendable that they both just gave birth and have made a video. All the proceeds go to ""Acres 4 Life"" which helps people in Africa learn to farm their land, which is awesome! I really appreciate their efforts and work helping people with their loving kindness, but again, it would be better to be straight forward in their marketing that their efforts have religious undertones. It's not that I don't support them, but they should be clear on the cover of the DVD that the proceeds will be used for religious-based projects.

If you're looking for a couple excellent (non-demoninational) well produced stretching DVD's, I would recommend the following:

"I'm not sure if I should fault the video or Amazon's description - but being blindsided with a Christian prayer sesh is Not ok. I think we all can agree that everyone is free to be whatever religion they want, therefore, tricking viewers via lack of information is sneaky, rude, and disrespectful. I finished the video regardless and found the stretches to be nice and relaxing (and that is the ONLY reason it is getting two stars) but I agree with other commenters that ""power"" and ""sculpt"" have no business being in the title and description.

Also - to other commenters that were complaining that yoga doesn't fit their religion -- well -- yoga is an Indian lifestyle practice. It's more than just exercises and poses to them. If you are going to partake - have some respect and appreciation for something outside of your comfort zone. If you faith is so easily shaken, I hardly think that's yoga's fault.",2.0

"Great Expectations, 1999 film

A young man runs through reeds into a cemetery. When he returns home his sister scolds him for his absence. A man catches him alone and asks for a file and food. He is an escaped convict! Back at home he is told to be ""grateful"". Soldiers arrive for the blacksmith, they found the escaped convict and put him in irons. Joe never learned to read. [No schools for common people then.] Pip is cleaned up for a visit. He plays cards with a young girl (pretty and proud). [Does their behavior seem odd?] Pip is questioned about his visit. ""Can this be true?"" He returns in six days for another visit. He sees strange things in that house. When he returns he is given a large sum of money. Afterwards he gets into a fight. [What a strange household!] Pip dreams of a better life. There is conflict in the shop. Later Pip finds a body! Who did it?

Later Lawyer Jaggers tells Pip he has a fortune and will be brought up as a gentleman ""with great expectations"". It's a secret benefactor. Can Joe be compensated for the loss of Pip? Pip gets a new suit and goes to London. They show scenes of life in those days. [To shock the viewer?] Pip's education begins. He lodges at Bernard's Inn. He visits a coworker. He visits Jagger's home and is given a letter. He learns of the death of his sister. Pip visits Miss Haversham again. Pip meets a young lady, they go to a recital. There is a dinner, a toast creates conflict. Pip is jealous of Estella's beau. Pip is in debt, he gets 500 as a birthday present! A strange man meets Pip to tell him a secret. What will Pip do now? Pip visits Miss Haversham, there is a conversation and conflict. Then he visits Joe Gadgery. Miss Betty taught Joe to read. ""Never leave documentary evidence laying around."" Pip advises Abel to leave. Drummel married Estella. Jagger's housekeeper Molly has a past.

Pip returns to question Miss Haversham about Estella. He reproaches her for her past actions. There is a fire! Pip finds Auric and there is conflict. Pip tells his secret! [Who is worse off?] pip goes to the funeral. Abel talks about his lost daughter, given up for adoption. A side-wheel steamer is on the river. Another boat draws near. There is an accusation and a struggle! Two men fall into the water. Pip dives in to save a man. Abel is taken to court for trial. Pip and Wimmick visit a church. Later visits Abel on his deathbed to say goodbye. Abel's daughter is a lady now, but he never met her. Pip arrested for unpaid debts. Joe pays off the debts. Pip talks to Betty and learns surprising news. Pip returns to Miss Haversham's mansion and finds Estella living there. Is she unhappy? What will Pip do now?

I never read the book so I can't say how faithful this adaption was. The beginning dragged for nearly an hour. Maybe another writer or director would have done better? There were a lot of close-up shots as you would expect from a movie made for television. Charles Dickens's story tells how riches can make an average man into a gentleman, and no one seems to care as to the origin of these riches. Could someone who becomes wealthy through illegal or unethical means become a respected gentleman? Yes, it has happened many times. There once was a book that told about the History of the Great American Fortunes. There may be comparable books today, if they could be published.",2.0
"Even though I have never read the book I found this Production very good.

I would recommend this to any one who is a Dickens Fan but do youself a favour and don't buy this DVD release.

As a British review on Amazon uk site indicated this DVD looks as if it was copied straight off the TV and also the commentary in the beginning and end of the movie telling us about the Great Expectations novel made the DVD worse.

Masterpiece Theatre has spoiled this Great BBC Production of Dickens Great Expectations with it's Commentary (even though they think they are being helpful- but are not) and poor DVD.

Four Stars for the Production itself but giving this Two stars because of the DVD quaility.

Wait until BBC Release a DVD of the Production and the DVD quaility will be much, much better.

I will be selling this DVD and wait until BBC release the DVD in Australia.",2.0
The video quality of this fine adaptation is terrible. I've been waiting years for a DVD release only to be dissapointed by the poor video transfer to DVD.,2.0
"I've never read Dickens, or watched any movies/tv series based on any his novels, so I don't know what is from the book and what is from the movie director. I really enjoy historical dramas, especially BBC tv series. In this Great Expectations, the acting was good, especially the heartless little Estella. However, what I didn't like about the movie:
1. Too much scenery, not enough interaction. Instead of 10 seconds of Pip walking on the moors, we get 30 seconds. The same goes for birds flying, waves on the water, Pip walking through dark tunnels, Pip walking through dark streets, Pip walking up stairs, Pip rowing a boat. Pip opening doors and walking down dark hallways. Lots of extended scenes of scenery and no character conversations. Also, there're lots of scenes of Pip and Miss Haversham, Joe and the convict. But, there's next to no scenes of Pip and the love of his life, the grown-up Estella. Which leads to the next point:
2. As a result of the lack of scenes with Pip and Estella, we hear secondhand that she's unhappy, and we only hear Pip say that he's in love. The editing/screenplay is so choppy that we never hear why or how. I guess we are to assume from 10 minutes of the movie that Pip loves her madly because she is pretty and treats him very cooly.
I mean, honestly, we get what's got to be a total of 30 minutes of boring scenery in the movie, and then almost none of the adult Pip falling in love with Estella, or what happens to Estella after marriage?
3. Discontinuity. I don't understand why Estella is so heartless and cruel as a child, then comes back as a soft mannered, kindly seeming lady. Is this a gentleman-trap of some sort?
I give this 2 stars because the acting was very good, but the storyline is super choppy, cryptic, and unbalanced.  It would have been better if more time had been spent on explaining the plot instead of long panoramas of the scenery.",2.0
"I guess I'm the only one disappointed in the Masterpiece Theater adaptation of Great Expectations, but I was.  Ioan Gruffudd is a fine actor, but he is no Pip.  The only aspect of his portrayal I liked was his devotion to Estella.  Even his horror at discovering the identity of his real benefactor was too ""subtle"" and too short-lived.
I was even more disappointed in Charlotte Rampling's Miss Havisham.  She was too young, too soft-spoken, and too kindly -- not at all cold and distant -- and not at all manipulative.  And the scene of her incineration is terribly overdone.
From the beginning ... in which we are told of Pip's visit to the graveyard ... to the end ... which is not at all in keeping with the spirit of Dickens' ambiguous ending ... this was a true disappointment.
The Anthony Calf, Anthony Hopkins production for the Disney Channel is far superior.  I wish that one were offered for sale.",2.0
"I had fond memories of TTMAR. So I watched it for the first time in 30 years. Now I find the movie lacking. TTMAR is very funny at times but the romance part did nothing for me (the scenes seem reminiscent of other late 60's movies I haven't watched in some time either. A man and a woman, Two for the Road?) and the gags are both too erratic and too far in between.",2.0

The tape tracks well and has good HiFi audio, but it's all downhill from there. Recorded at the slowest speed, it's got a blurry picture that over-saturates with color.

"This is an entertaining enough cartoon for kids to watch, and mine do, but it is only in the most tangential way about learning to use the potty. It's a fifteen-minute movie and the kid doesn't even get the potty for about eight minutes.

The fact that everything is in rhyme bugs only me. The kids don't mind, and you do turn it out. The 21-month-old likes it more than the three-year-old. It's probably not a coincidence.

We got this with a little book called ""The Potty Book"" about the same little boy with the same art. The book is of great interest to the baby, although it still doesn't really have that much to do with the potty either. The movie and the book are just about an ordinary little boy who learns to use the potty while doing ordinary things. It doesn't tell anyone how to do it.",2.0
"My daughter's potty training has been a process and I was looking for anything and everything I could get my hands on to reinforce potty training. My 2 year-old seems to like the movie and asks to watch it sometimes. The movie helps keep potty training top of mind. But, the animation quality is very limited -- my husband thought we were watching and old VHS-tape, not a DVD. This is one tool you can use with your kids and I don't think it hurt to buy it -- but I'm looking forward to when my second child is potty trained and we can give this DVD away to someone else! I also agree with the other reviewers that the movie talks about diapers way too much and could send the wrong message to children you are trying to get out of diapers.",2.0

Season Four had some very long periods where the picture was so blurred that it bothered my eyes to watch it.  Overall, I am quite disappointed with the results on DVD.

REVISION OF PREVIOUS REVIEW: At times it is difficult in Amazon reviews for readers to determine exactly what is being reviewed: the product (in this case, a TV series), its manufacturer (here, Shout!), or the vendor with whom Amazon is dealing (Crystal Choice). To clarify: (1) The first Newhart show is a classic sit-com. (2) Crystal Choice is an honest vendor that tried to make good on a sale that backfired through no fault of their own. (3) Shout! atypically, in my experiencehad quality control problems with the new set of discs I was sentthree of which were unplayable.",2.0

Anyway, silly story, not greatly acted, and sub-par pacing makes this one to avoid for the most part.",2.0
"This movie had some plusses going for it, primarily the cast.  A lot of money was spent on the production design and special effects, but the film suffers from a misconceived premise.  First of all, it's dealing with a witty, effervescent spy romp -- an iconographical series of the 60's -- but it tries to turn it into a darker, insupportable James Bondian (same production designer).  ""Dark"" and the Avengers don't really mix.  The whole production is dark, lots of crashing special effects, derring do, conflict between ""Father"" and ""Mother"" which is never explained.  The dialogue is hard to understand and captioning is not provided on the streaming version.  A problem.  Other elements in the script are also confusing--the Emma Peel imposter, rationale, etc.  The direction is just leaden and that's fatal to this type of film.",2.0
"This has got to be one of the worse movies ever. Especially since the elements to make an interesting movie were already there. Story. Characters. They even had decent actors. The dialogue was terrible.

But there is something strangely benign about it. It doesn't make you angry. It lulls you. To sleep. Sometimes that's not a bad thing.

I have several movies I put on that put me right to sleep. This is one of them. Maybe it's the low droning sound that is the characters speaking. Worth the $3 used I think I paid.

Fargo puts me to sleep too. Something about the snow.",2.0
"ok benning the some what new kid at 28 yrs old I have watch the movie in question and all of the origal tv shows. Benning in the Army I have alot of time to watch and compare things. We all know at this ponit in life that no matter what Hollywood gets thier hands on one of two things will happen. They will do it right or they will just stright ""F"" it up. So I don't know why you are sitting here wasting time to bitch about something you can't do anything about. It's done and over with people. The movie suck a** and we are stuck with it from now to the day we kick the bucket. The only thing we can do is stay true to the tv show that we have come to love and joy and never bring up the movie again unitl someone can get it right. Thats all you have to do. As far as the movie goes it was alright nothing to really talk about. Oh here something to think about.""Shows made in the UK that are a big hit should stay in the UK don't let hollywood get a hold of it and anything that hollywood puts out the Britsh will probbly make it better,thats the way I see it so far.""

"No one was clamoring for a big-screen remake of the classic ""Avengers"" TV series, but Hollywood didn't listen and churned out this forgettable box-office fiasco. Despite its impressive visual style, the finished product made a good cast look terribly foolish. Ironically, the film's most positive aspect was introducing new viewers to the original exploits of John Steed and Emma Peel.",2.0
"I have to say that I am not familiar with the series, or had had any other contact with the characters apart from this movie so I cannot make any comparisons to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not ""know"" of The Avengers prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed!

Apart from the GREAT cast (Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and Sean Connery among others) and the very good acting, the plot and the dialogues are way below average!  In addition, the whole ""weird"" atmosphere just for the sake of being ""different"" and ""original"" just falls flat!

Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...

In a nutshell, it's a weak movie; it lacks that something to make it bearable, let alone put it over the top.  No masterpiece here.",2.0
Disappointed that it does not have SUBTITLES as the Fox ones do.,2.0
"i give this film two stars because although you have to question why three good actors such as these would even consider this script, they still acted well with the poor amount they got. but still, how could great actors such as these three accept such a terrible script? what were they thinking?",2.0
"The rumor that shuttled around a while is that the original script stayed very close to the TV show. The people who developed the film were huge Avengers fans that spent years trying to bring this to the screen and saw it as an art house action movie. When Warner's realized that they didn't have a big budget summer film for 1998,they rushed production on The Avengers, threw a lot of money at it, and more or less told the producers they wanted a big hit. Needless to say, pandering to the masses and doing good ""Avengers"" are incompatible, which the test audiences more or less told the studio execs during test screenings by not liking it at all and getting confused (though I am hard pressed to see how they were any more confused than I ended up) . Unfortunately, take out the sublime strangeness and the film falls apart and makes little sense. Apparently, the studio thought they could rush this out on name power and no real story and maybe make a little money, which is exactly how much they made.
Regarding the film itself, it is gorgeous to look at but painful to watch. The three leads are badly miscast (You can't replace MacNee and Rigg, though Patrick Stewart and Lucy Lawless would have been MUCH more interesting than Fiennes and Thurman) and Sean Connery chews scenery like he hadn't eaten in months. would love the DVD to have loads of extras I am sure are milling about somewhere, including commentary by the director on what happened.
Stick with the TV Show.",2.0
"Why does Hollywood waste its budget on movies based on 50's, 60's, or 70's TV shows?  Can't anybody think for themselves anymore?  Films like these give good actors bad reputations, and Ralph Fiennes, Sean Connery, and Uma  Thurman are great actors.  The three of them must've been trying to hang  themselves after the theater release.",2.0
"Despite what other reviewers are guessing to be true, the video quality of the episodes in seasons 1-4 in this complete series set is NOT an upgrade from the original DVD season releases. I have done an extensive side-by-side comparison and the transfer is unquestionably inferior with the new set. Colors are washed out, detail and definition are reduced. It's a very stark contrast. The video bitrates are markedly higher for the old discs vs. the new. I'm noticing bitrates that are as much as 30% higher in the head-to-head comparison.

Perhaps most importantly, there is for some reason a significant variation in quality from episode to episode in the new set. The last one or two episodes on each disc are consistently and inexplicably much lower in quality than the other episodes on the disc. This is not the case with the older set. Take Season 1, Disc 3 for example: it contains eight episodes, and the first six average around 1.03 GB in raw size. But the last two episodes (""Bum Voyage"" and ""Who's Been Sleeping on My Couch?"") come in around 780-800 MB. If that 30% difference doesn't sound bad to you, trust me when I say it is very noticeable, particularly with a 40-year old series shot on film. The older discs have no such variations in quality; the same episodes in that set consistently come in around 1.09 Gb each. Size isn't always a true indicator of video quality but in this case it holds true. Many episodes in the new set  just look plain bad, like they have been through an additional transfer generation or two.

However, the ""Complete Series"" set is the only way to get your hands on the final two seasons, so if you own the older discs, my recommendation would be to make your own set with seasons 1-4 from the season discs and 5-6 from the new set. I can't comment on the bonus features as I haven't viewed them yet. But the episode commentaries are all still here and there doesn't seem to be anything new in that department.

Another difference that may matter to you: the new set does not include subtitles, whereas the old discs have both English and Spanish subtitles. It seems Shout! Factory left them out as part of their misguided effort to cram as many episodes on each disc as possible. I'm no fan of the double-sided disc format Fox used for the season releases, and it's a pain to switch the discs more often with fewer episodes per disc, but I'll take them over the new set any day.",2.0
"Standing on its own, the film is probably no worse and no better than the average action film: it's more an occasion for special effects,  unexpected situations, special effects, stylish banter, special effects, spectacularly  dispatching the villain, and more special effects than anything else. Seen  from that point of view, noone would complain much about Big Ben exploding  in such a spectacular manner when Sir August de Wynter lets loose his  out-and-out weather attack on London: it's just what this kind of film is  about. They only poison in jest, to borrow an expression
  And seen from  that angle, noone would really expect anything out of the ordinary: it's  just a bit of fun, and need not be very believable. However, the comic  relief that most good action films  produce over a bit of unbelieavable  action is largely missing: the characters are too serious for that. There's  a fairly reasonable fencing scene at Trubshawe's, but when Mrs. Peel turns  her back on Steed and walks away from him, while still defending herself  against his attacks from behind, it goes over the line of being  belieavable, and turns into nothing more than a well choreographed action  sequence in a film, and so becomes a bit obtrusive: my suspension of  disbelief broke down very badly here.
  I came to this film with a  considerable dose of the original Avengers in my memory: in particular the  years when Diana Rigg played Mrs. Peel againt Patrick Macnee as John Steed.  That's probably unfair: the film cannot stand that kind of comparison.
  The original relationship between Mrs. Peel and John Steed is gone. They're  no longer cooperating; instead Mrs. Peel is under grave suspicions of  sabotaging the Prospero weathershield, and Steed is to keep a check on her.  And so the occasionally bright patter, which in the original was more an  expression of the protagonists' relationship, here turns into something  more like fencing with sharp weapons.
  Mother -- that rather poor  attempt to explain ""the Ministry"" for which the original Avengers  worked -- is here, and with Father, looking like Dr. Strangelove's twin  brother, as an extra burden:  one lame, the other blind. Again, my  disbelief-suspenders had a very  hard time with Father.  Colonel I. Jones  is more like the spirit of the original, but that may have something to do  with the fact that Patrick Macnee is ""appearing"" in that cameo  part.
  It's a bit as if a film historian had found a set of reviews, and  some odd script fragments from the original TV series, and then set about  to recreate the original from those bits and pieces, while not entirely  being able to  free himself from an old dream of writing the next big James  Bond film.
  The best way to appreciate this film is to forget the  original Avengers entirely, if possible.  Those who haven't seen the TV  episodes have a huge advantage here.",2.0

"This movie goes down as one of the biggest lost oppertunites in the history of film. Ralph Finnes and Uma Thurman and Sean Connery all camping it up, great style, british accents, cool special effects, what could go  wrong? Well... ever seen pictures of the hindenburg? The film gets an added  star just because there were some sequences that worked, but it's an awful  film. And I don't mean awful as in, a great awful movie like 'Batman and  Robin' or 'Jack Frost'. Avengers is deathly dull. I mean, they even made  Sean Connery boring!! What a waste.",2.0

"I thought the movie brought back a sense of 60's charm of the original avengers series.  (If you have never seen the series you will think this movie is the biggest flop ever.)  I think the director should have spent  less money on special effects (especially the flying bug scene ?)  Sometimes I think when making movies they think the namebrand actors like  Connery , Thurman and Fiennes will just satisfy the audience, well this  movie proves that wrong.  It is very entertaining to see Connery in  different roles rather than 007 and Fiennes in a different role than a SS  officer.  But, they still don't satisfy this movie watchers expectations.  Nice try but this movie won't be a cult classic like it could have been.",2.0

"This movie is good, but entirely too rushed. It would have been a very good idea, in my opinion, it have at least put captions letting you know how many years passed between particular scenes. With it not being this way you miss much of the power of her story. However, no screen adaption is ever perfect, and given that decades of Jane's life are covered in an hour and a half (thus the benefit of captions) the movie adaption is about as faithful as you can do.",2.0
I thought this would be the movie that didn't cut out some much of the book when Jane leaves Mr. Rochester. It barely shows the time she spent away from him and her growth as a woman.  I might try the BBC version because it looks longer and might actually include more from the book.,2.0
"The series is a gem.  Believe every positive review about it. It is television at its best. The only outrage is the poor quality of the transfer on the A&E set released in the US and Canada.

You can get an idea of the difference in picture and colour quality on the Upstairs Downstairs web site, video availability page at [...]  A&E should be ashamed to give this excellent series such a bad treatment and charge over $300 for the insult.",2.0
"Do not waste your money on this version - get it at the library if you absoultely want to see it  - it is too short and moves too fast - the actors are actually all very good, especially ""Mrs. Fairfax"" - if you love the book don't even bother watching this, unless you want to see how a classic can be ruined!!  Alot of things are changed or omitted as other reviewers have said - not enough scenes of her childhood life, and not enough of her time with her new found relatives after she leaves Thornfield, etc. etc. Again, very disappointing!!",2.0
"I have seen all versions and for once this one got it all wrong all over the place.  These actors surely had to cringe at the treatment of the classic tale.  For once I found the phrase ""never see the picture after reading the book"" correct.  It would have been kinder to change the name and only allude to the author.",2.0
"I love the book and the 1983 adaptation with Dalton and Clarke is my favorite.  I told my husband years back (then just a bf) how much I love the book and movie and he gifted me this without knowing anything about different versions out there.  I was not even aware of this adaptation myself back then and was curious to see what this Jane Eyre had to offer.  I was horried to witness Ciaran Hinds screeching and screaming all the time like he was having a never-ending PMS.  And let me just say I love Ciaran Hinds.  He is a truly talented actor, amazing in Persuasion and Phantom of the Opera, not a one-note actor by any means.  I don't understand what could possibly happen here.  Did he so grossly misunderstood the character?  I cannot beleive it.  I am  blaming the director (and maybe editors?) for misguiding him into making such a travesty out of Mr. Rochester.",2.0
"I've been wanting to watch this version of JE for years. Despite seeing scores of negative reviews here, I thought to myself--it can't possibly be that bad. It was made back in A&E's classics heyday. [Remember when A&E once stood for Arts & Entertainment? But I diverge.] It's stars Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton. It's Jane Eyre! How could it possibly be mucked up?

Despite having everything going for it, this version doesn't live up to expectations. There are several reasons for this:

~The atmosphere. You won't feel submerged in Jane's world. The sets and costumes look cheap. What is more, the gothic touches are missing. For example, the red room sequence. The camera just flashes around the room-but it doesn't show us the shadows, the things Jane imagines, that make her scared. It's just a room.

~the script. JE is dense book so not everything is going to be able to be packed in a two hour movie but too much was left out of this movie. Where is the gypsy scene? Where is Jane's discovery that she is not solely an orphan but has family? Where's Jane's conversations with Mrs. Reed when she returns home? Even on a basic level, the script suffers--rather than develop plot points, it just jumps to them as the story requires. For example, the St. John sequence is too short. The Blanche Ingram sequence is especially undeveloped.

~the acting. Samantha Morton is the saving grace of this production. Her Jane is gentle but formidable, quiet but with a backbone. Ciaran Hinds is not a one-note actor, but as Mr. Rochester, he is only shown as being agitated, spiteful and mean. Even when he is kind, he is cruel. Jane would never fall in love with this Rochester.

At times, it also feels like a parody. The parody elements particularly come through in the handling of Bertha Rochester. It's like watching a Monty Python sketch when she's onscreen.

In short, this is a dud! It's worth watching in order to be able the appreciate how good the 06 version is. Also, if you are in the know about BBC programs, it can amusing to watch just to see the once and future Captain Wentworths both featured in the same production. Otherwise, skip it.",2.0
"I found this interpretation of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre good. One need only view various interpretations, such as the 1944 Orson Welles film, starring both himself and Joan Fontaine, to appreciate this 1997 version. Twentieth Century Fox's wartime genre encapsulates the studio art department with very poorly executed visuals in the 1944 film. One knows without doubt that this was made in Hollywood.
However, each version is different, with different characterizations,style and pace. This 1997 original A & E version is good stylistically, the lead characters give earnest interpretations, but seem a bit caricatured and one-dimensional.
I have read the various reviews praising the Timothy Dalton version and cannot for the life of me understand the praise. He is entirely too wooden and one-dimensional. One does not even perceive the character of Rochester, with its depths and nuances, in his portrayal.
The best film Jane Eyre thus far, in my opinion, is the BBC 1973 version with Sorcha Cusack and Michael Jayston, also available through Amazon.com. Read my review on this version. It lacks the sumptiousness of the latter entries but the acting is first rate. This 1973 version has been unanimously hailed as one of the best interpretations of Jane Eyre.",2.0
"This ""Film"" version of the classic story by Charlotte Bronte is grossly overacted by Ciaran Hinds. Personally, I found him to be too harsh and cruel, barely even nice. However, Samantha Morton balanced it out quite well as the title character, though. I also didn't like the omission of the middle scenes with Mrs. Reed, which I feel are very important to the story. I prefer Timothy Dalton (4 years before he embodied the role of James Bond in ""The Living Daylights"") as Rochester. He was very well suited to the part; I read somewhere that he considers his role as Edward Rochester his personal favourite. Gemma Jones (""Sense & Sensibility"") was great as Mrs. Fairfax. If you're looking for a faithful version of ""Jane Eyre,"" I highly recommend the 1983 BBC miniseries starring Timothy Dalton, the 1944 version starring Orson Welles or the 1996 version starring William Hurt. This film version is Not Rated.",2.0
"First of all I would like to say that Samantha morton was one of the best Jane. She was really believable in her role and her acting was fantastic. it is really a pity she got put in this version. I have to main objections to the book which you may read here below if you wish.
My objections to the books are this: First of all I did not like Ciaran Hinds as Mr Rochester. I saw him a few months ago in Persuasion and was so Happy in his portrayal of Captain Wentworth. It was not the case with his sad portrayal of Edward Rochester. He seemed to think that Mr Rochester was an very, very, very angry man and nothing more. I never really liked Edward's character but he was a lot more complicated than that. He may be weak and selfish but he is also brooding, moody and passionate. To see a proper portrayal of Rochester. You must refer to the performances of Micheal Jayston, Toby Stephens and Timothy Dalton. Especially Dalton! Ciaran Hinds did nothing but scream all the time. And I never could imagine Mr. Rochester with a mustache.
Secondly I would have liked the script to be a little closer to the novel. The first half is not that bad but the second is horrid. Nothing is mentioned of Jane inheriting a fortune and one of St John's sister is deleted. And speaking of St John we don't get to know how mesmerizing his character is(And I have definatly seen Rupert Penry-Jones look better). The version was just too short! Jane and Rochester's readmitting their love for each other is shortened into one scene but Morton managed to pull it off quite well. I repeat she is the only cause why I do not give this version one star.
Need I say more? Those are the main things I find disagreable but there are several more I could state, but I will not waste my time and I think I have made my points.
To conclude if you want to watch this movie so badly go watch it on the internet. If it happens to please you and you wish to see it agin then you may buy it. If you wish to see a truly fantastic version. Then I suggest you buy the 1983 version. If you want to see other ones then also buy the 1973  or the 2006 version. They are definitely better than this one.
Thank you for your time.",2.0
Some are in Black and White and some in color. It often stalls. I guess the DVD version has some compatibility problems. The sitcom itself is SLOW. I do think I would have enjoyed it - not in a memorable way - but for the day if there hadn't been so many technology problems. I should have and may still send them back as they are basically unviewable unless you have the patience of Job.,2.0
"either skip this one all together, or watch it first- because it's pretty bad.

jane eyre has been my favourite book (i could read the book and watch most of the film versions any time with pleasure) since i was very young, and i ordered this copy thinking i would like it as much as the others.
wrong.

the acting is decent (i wouldn't expect less from Ciarn Hinds), the setting isn't too shabby, and it's fairly true to the the story- however there are few points that drove me absolutely crazy and kept me from getting swept up into the story.

1.) Mr. Rochester is a gruff, touchy type who likes his own way, he does NOT however, scream and yell at the drop of a hat. from the first scene, that's what he pretty much does the entire rest of the film.

2.) samantha morton just isn't jane eyre. period.

3.) Ciarn Hinds' mustache. it made him look like Hitler in a lot of scenes, and quite frankly it ruins all the heart rending moments.

it's sad, because i really wanted to like this movie. i even watched it twice. no good.",2.0
"Not a great version.  Both Jane and Edward come off as angry and hard instead of the sympathy inspiring characters they are in the book.  The Timothy Dalton version is much better and truer not only to the book, but to the spirit of the book.  Jane does not leave Thornfield because of her pride, as intimated in this version, she leaves because it would be morally wrong to stay.  The whole book is about doing the right thing despite the main character's own personal desires.  That in the end is what brings her happiness.  Check out the other version before you buy this one.",2.0
I am most certain that the dvd release is an A&E abridged version; which they usually broadcast in their reruns and for their Classroom series. There is a more complete version which had originally aired encompassing Jane's school experiences. I'd guess that approximately 30-45 minutes of material are missing from the beginning of the story and was replaced with quickly edited scenes with a voice-over. I've heard this before about other A&E releases I just wish the official description would clarify...I would not have purchased it if I knew this was the case.,2.0
In Black and white!!?? Poorly produced.  Nothing like the quality of Downton,2.0
"I think that Samantha Morton's Jane Eyre in Robert Young's 1997 TV adaptation of the great novel, could've been the best screen Jane ever. Morton was 20 years old and the closest in age to the young orphaned governess, childlike in the appearance but strong willed, serene yet very intelligent with acute sense of right or wrong. Two years prior to her Oscar nominated role as a mute girl in Woody Allen's ""Sweet and Lowdown"", Morton proved that she could say a lot by the mere look at her face, by her impressive and speaking eyes alone. It is sad that the film took too many liberties with the book and not only in omitting many important plot lines in order to fit in its 108 minutes length, but with too many changes to the very nature of the novel's two main characters and their relationship. Jane in the scenes with her employer is sometimes too demanding and not as tactful as she is in the book. The changes are especially obvious in Mr. Edward Rochester as he was played by Ciaran Hinds. Hinds is a talented, intense actor but I can't agree or like his reading and interpreting of Mr. Rochester's character. Some his scenes in the film made me cringe. Mr. Edward Rochester of the novel was not yelling or rather barking brute - it was difficult for me to believe that Jane Eyre would come to love so much. I also was unpleasantly surprised with Mr. Rochester openly displaying his affection for Adele. This manifestation was against the logic of his character.

2.5/5",2.0
"I have it in my Jane Eyre collection and the chemistry is not believable at all.  Ciaran Hinds is barking at her the entire time. There is no inflection in his voice that would give way to you believing he had a soft spot for her on more than one occasion. He also didn't have Mr. Rochester's dark wit.  If you want to see Ciaran Hinds in a wonderful movie, see Jane Austen's ""Persuasion.""

Samantha Morton, although a great actress here, played Jane far too impertinent for her position, the era and most importantly for the post-Helen Jane who had a gentle spirit that made Mr. Rochester drawn to her in the first place.

I was glad to see the Bertha portrayal was very close to the book in this one as well as the 83' version.  Unlike, the most recent Masterpiece version that had Bertha looking like she could step out of Thornfield, put on a gown and walk the red carpet.

If you want to see a great and TRUE adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's ""Jane Eyre,"" watch the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version  which still is powerful even after 24 years. Timothy Dalton is the book's tumultous, playful, introspective and passionate Mr. Rochester. Zelah Clarke plays Jane perfectly as unworldly and innocent and knowing her ""station"" so to speak, but also having her own mind. The 83' version wasn't Hollywood's version, it was Bronte's version.",2.0
"I'm not going to repeat the plot, nor am I going to go on and on about comparisons with the book.  This is just a critique on this version of JE.  I've seen the others, and this version isn't bad, it's hilarious.

I've never laughed so hard at an adaption which is supposed to be a tragic but uplifting love story.  Oh, let me count the ways....  First, the Jane Eyre character, played by Samantha Morton.  I thought she appeared to be a bit of a vindictive, spiteful, co-dependent girl.  She is a ""Heather"" in Victorian dress.  However, I think she was the perfect for this version of Mr. Rochester.  Oh boy.....

I LOVE Ciarn Hinds, I love his range, his voice, it's a doggone shame that the scriptwriter, director made his character laughable.  Yes, his mannerisms are cringeworthy, and his 'attraction' for Jane, bordered on sexual harassment.  The character's lust for life, and vigor appeared to be a bipolar disorder.

The part that made spit out my water at the TV screen, the scene after he and Jane first shared a passionate kiss.  After we hear Jane narrate how she imagined the kiss or that moment, here comes Mr. Rochester.  Jane addresses him as ""Mr. Rochester"", and he has an expression of perverted that only Austin Powers could love.  He whispers, ""Edward.""  I was waiting for him to wink, wink, nudge, nudge and wiggle his eyebrows.

If you're down in the dumps, this version will make you shake your head and perhaps laugh it off.",2.0
"When the screenwriters adapted Robert Stevenson's ""Jane Eyre"" movie, they had to leave everything out that couldn't be condensed.  The mini-series approach, however, allows ample time to study the characters in depth. In my 29 years, I recall not one, but *two* BBC TV mini-series adaptations of Jane Eyre that played in the early 1980s.  These attempted to portray the book as a complete experience.  I won't judge which of the two is more definitive, having only read part of the book.

The 1983 one, released to VHS/DVD, starred Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. Some reviewers have commented on how well Sian Pattenden portrays young Jane, mistreated by her aunt Reed's family and at Lowood school. This is the first hour of the series, and I was riveted. When Jane is grown and Rochester arrives, Clarke and Dalton do the work justice - they're just not as much fun to watch as their counterparts in the 1973 mini-series.

The 1973 series starred Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack. The series is excellent, almost to the point where I'd call it treachery that it's not available either on VHS or DVD. This was no minor production: in fact, it played in the States on PBS up to ten years after its original broadcast.

Dalton's Rochester seemed at times too leaden and serious, almost a caricature. It's probably not necessary to blow this aspect of Rochester out of proportion. Jayston plays Rochester as a bitter man with a secret thorn in his side, but balances sardonic wit with what's been called a ""poetic imagination."" Check this out when Rochester is explaining his secret to Jane.  You may find Jayston on record as saying that Rochester was his favorite television role. His enthusiasm for the part is obvious. Clarke's Jane is plain, and seeks independence, love and servitude, but it's a little harder to see where the fire in Jane Eyre comes from. It's not so much Clarke was a bit too good-looking, although that may be. Cusack, an Irish actress, is irresistable in more ways than one.  A governess who must mind her boundaries as a subordinate, she converses on would-be equal terms with Rochester, trading jabs, despite the difference in age and experience.  Thus, in the early scenes, we get a good sense of Jane Eyre's spiritedness (even though we might not have seen the part about her childhood). The interaction of Dalton and Clarke, while fine, falls short of some of these bonus characteristics.

Other things to note: the first episode of the 5-part 1973 series was seldom shown outside of the UK.  The memorable theme music was the passionate ""Introduction and Allegro"" composed by one of Britain's greatest, Sir Edward Elgar.  My approbation goes to the director Joan Craft, the screenwriter, Robin Chapman, and to the cast:  Megs Jenkins (Mrs. Fairfax), Stephanie Beacham (Blanche Ingram), Geoffrey Whitehead (St. John Rivers), Susan Brodrick (Mary Rivers), Caroline Harris (Diana Rivers), Edward De Souza (Richard Mason), and the rest.

It's unfortunate that few people will have the opportunity to see both series to compare them. ""Jane Eyre"" is a classic novel. Many different adaptations of it are currently for sale. In fact, it appears some extremely poor adaptations of it are for sale, now. Even uncharitable people must acknowledge the 1973 version of ""Jane Eyre"" is not ""bad,"" and had a good run before the BBC decided to produce a new series for 1983.

If you write to the powers-that-be, BBC America or BBC Worldwide, they'd be able to estimate the market potential of a video release. Go ahead and give it a try. Both mini-series are good television productions and should be distributed.

There is a website dedicated to the 1973 series that can be easily found.  Look online also for an image of the Radio Times cover that announced the original broadcast.",2.0
"As a huge fan of the novel, I was very excited to try and find a film that would do it justice.  I had read the amazon.com reviews of this particular version, and in spite of some severely negative opinions, I decided to give it a try anyhow.
Well, let me just say to those with the poor reviews: ""I concur!!""
The child actors who play young jane and young Adele are not good at all.  Additionally, the character Adele - who is SUPPOSED to be 10 - looks to be at least 12 year old!  It was ridiculous.
Samantha Morton who portrays our heroine, Jane, does an fair job in the role.  She could have been a bit less attractive...yes, that's right, folks, just because a woman doesn't wear make-up and have a fancy hair-do doesn't necessarily make her unattractive!  Her portrayal of Jane was a little too impertenant.  Yes, Jane had spirit and professed her opinions honestly when asked, but the adult Jane was not openly confrontational and defiant in the way she was sometimes acted in this movie.  Her character was not done justice.
Cirian Hinds physically was a good Mr. Rochester, in my opinion.  He looked the part of the unattractive - even could be called ugly by some - large boned, tall man.  (I have seen him in ""Persuasion"" where is is the dashing Captain Wentworth, and looked purty darn hot I might add!  so kudos to his transforamation!) But it is a pity the likeness should end there.  He was made far too mean.  I don't remember him ever actually SCREAMING at Jane in the novel, yet he does it here frequently.  In the scene where they first meet, and Jane startles his horse, causing him to fall (they changed the setting and dialogue greatly in this scene by the way), he begins to scream at Jane, demanding and insisting she help him although she declines.
Isn't this a bit backwards?  Was Jane not the one insisting upon helping Mr. Rochester in the book??!
Anyhow, Mr. Rochester is a gruff, unpolished man towards her in the book, but they take it to extremes in the movie.  He is downright, plain old mean.
Additionally, his feelings towards Adele are much different than they are supposed to be.  In the book, of course, he is resentful of her presence and greatly irked by her.  He sends her away at every opportunity and never bestows her any real affection.  In the movie though, they have him asking for her, calling her to him, even setting her in his lap!  And, remember, this girl they have playing the supposed 10 year old Adele is more like 12 or 13!!  This makes for a fairly disturbing moment in itself!
They whiz through Jane's childhood with fair accuracy.  Condensing her childhood to being locked in the ""red room"" then being shipped away to school to face typhus.  It takes all of about 10 minutes for her to become 18 and leave to pursue her govenerss position.  Everything flies by you.  There are several scenes added in that are not in the book, but for the most part, it is done to provide the viewer background to better understand what is happening and why.  These scenes are basically dialogue between secondary charcters.
There is a scene where Mr. Rochester takes Jane into town to shop for the wedding clothes, and the run into Blanche Ingram.  That is the strangest addition - completely unnecessary, in my view!
Anyhow, after the wedding is called off, and Jane resigns to leave Thornfield, there is about 10 minutes of completely made-up dialogue between Jane and Mr. Rochester.  He does, in the end, actually start screaming at her!  He screams at her to leave!
Never - not in a million years! - would Mr. Rochester EVER tell Jane to leave!!  He even throws her bag after her!
They once again whiz through her three days of homeless wandering and begging, and her year spent with the Rivers's.  They completely leave out Maria Rivers's character altogether, and St. John is made a gregarious, pleasant, happy soul who smiles as he kindly asks Jane to marry him.  They pack all this into about 5 minutes.
She rushes back to Mr. Rochester after hearing him call to her on the wind, and about five minutes later it's all over, folks.
As far as some critizism of Mr. Rochester's healthy appearence at this point in the film (other than his blindness and mangled left hand - which was SUPPOSED to be gone altogether!), the book specifically notes Mr. Rochester is physically as strong and robust as he ever was.  Only his ""countenance"" has changed.  He is brooding and sad.  But physically, he is still strong and healthy looking. He is not supposed to look withered, sickly, and weak.  In that part, they again do Mr. Rochester physical justice.
In conclusion, the film may have been better had it been longer.  If they had more time to devote to the development of story lines, etc.  My other HUGE gripe is that they used SO LITTLE of Bronte's actual dialogue!!!  WHY???
AND they left out some VERY important scenes!
Just one example the springs to mind is the scene when Mr. Rochester is proposing to Jane.  So romantic, so climactic!  And yet, they not only use hardly ANY of the real dialogue, but the tree - the chestnut tree - is not struck by lightening!  HELLO!!  I'm not literature major here, but isn't that a prime example of what is called, 'foreshadowing'??  An indication of things to come?
They messed up one of the most romantic and climactic scenes in the entire book.
So, it's too short, hardly any dialogue is used, they change things that should not be changed, and add so many things that should not be added!
They have changed the characters' personalities and it has been for the worse.  They took EXTREME artistic license in making this movie, and I DO NOT like it one bit!!
It's not even a good movie in itself.  Even if you have never read the book or even heard of it...the way they rush through it all would leave a viewer completely confused.  I was constantly having to explain to my husband what was happening and why.
Anyhow, I am not recommending it!",2.0
"Cirian Hinds and Samantha Morton are wonderful actors, but why didn't the screenwriters even glance at Charlotte Bronte's book when they wrote this screenplay?  It was a very strange experience to see some of my favorite characters of literature saying and doing things that weren't even remotely connected to the story.  Rochester screaming at Jane to leave Thornfield?  Jane and Rochester shopping downtown for wedding clothes and ""bumping into"" Blanche Ingram?  I don't think so! Not only did the screenwriters make up entirely new scenes, the dialogue in familiar scenes was often totally unrecognizable.  I watch film adaptations to see my favorite characters and scenes fleshed out, not given a major overhaul.
Two things they got right -- the age difference and chemistry between Rochester and Jane (although Samantha Morton is too pretty.  Come on!  She can't be pretty Harriet Smith in the A&E version of ""Emma"" and plain-Jane Eyre in this movie!)  If you just like to watch good acting, you might like this.  But if you, like me, are a fan of the book, this is a very jolting and unpleasant ride.",2.0
"I must fervently disagree with the many positive reviews shown here, for 2 major reasons.  First, the writers took great 'liberties' with the novel that detract, rather than enhance, the characters.  The best two examples involve the main characters of Mr. Rochester and Jane.  In the book, Rochester is a brooding, singular figure who is very much a victim of the cruel plotting and vices of others.  But in this film version, he is cruel and vindictive in and of himself.  Vengeful, plotting, and profane, you have little reason to see why Jane would ever attach herself to such a worthless creature.  Jane of course does fall in love with him, but because he is so repugnant, the viewer can hardly see any reason why.  Thus, Jane is herself reduced greatly from a woman who loves unconditionally - -as was shown in the book- -to a strange, misguided young woman racked with a codependent psyche.  The second area in which this version is inferior to the book, and the other far superior film versions (particularly the William Hurt version) is its brevity.  It is only 90 minutes long.  It leaves out so many of the small aspects that would normally give vitality and life to the characters.  Being that it is such a poor version, this is not necessarily all that bad, but willing to give the film chance after chance to redeem itself, it falls terribly short on nearly every measure.",2.0
"While this production is worth renting, it is not faithful to the book because of its omissions, and I found Ciaran Hinds to be a very unsatisfactory Mr. Rochester.  The script highlighted his unsavory features (he is a deceiving adulterer, after all) to such an extent that his romantic and heroic qualities were insufficient to overcome the detriment to his character and likeability.  In the book, his evil deeds are swept away by the force of his personality and the depth of his love.  I also felt that while Timothy Dalton looked too young in the part, Ciaran Hinds looked too old and a bit worse for wear.  The Timothy Dalton version is the most satisfying in terms of completion of plot.  It is indeed straight from the book, as someone noted, and what a book it is!  I think it takes quite some nerve to edit Charlotte Bronte to this extent.",2.0
"Jane Eyre is one of my very favorite books, so I simply cannot like a film version that leaves out important details.  I liked it when I first saw it, but had the nagging feeling that something was missing.  So I re-read the book, and discovered exactly what was missing -- about 1/4 of the book.  Among the scenes that were missing were the other reasons behind Jane's return to Thornfield.
And then there's Samantha Morton.  I cannot think of a film where I liked her, so that is another strike against this version.
Some have said that Timothy Dalton is ""too handsome"" to play Rochester.  Perhaps he is.  But he is such an incredible actor that I will forgive him. *grin*  I do appreciate Ciaran Hinds, and it pains me to say that I did not like him as Rochester. I read someplace that he hadn't read the book before making this film.  Well, it shows.  He rants and raves too much; there was no subtlety in his performance.  And subtlety is something Dalton understood in his performance.
An adaptation does not need to be a word-for-word translation from page to screen, but it does have to retain the spirit of the original for me to appreciate it, and this version does neither, so I cannot find much to like about it.",2.0
"I've read the book (10 times) and seen all the movie versions.  The ""Jane"" in this video was unbelievably haughty and unattractive.  How in the world did Rochester ever fall in love with her?  When they kiss in the movie there is the ""chemistry"" (mentioned in other reviews), but lust isn't what the book is all about.  All my favorite passages were cut out or adulterated beyond recognition.  This would be a terrific disappointment to any one who really loves the book.",2.0
"I was so excited when I heard A&E was doing ""Jane Eyre,"" especially when I heard Ciaran Hinds was cast as Rochester. I thought that was perfect casting and that I would see something of the caliber of ""Pride and Prejudice."" I was bitterly disappointed! What a travesty!
My main objection is that the scriptwriter decided she could improve on Charlotte Bronte. Instead of sticking to the words in the book as closely as possible, she completely rewrote the dialogue. What arrogance! The result is that both Rochester and Jane say things that are completely out of character to anyone that's read the book. ""I feel your passions are aroused""? I found myself screaming at the screen ""he'd never say that!""
My second main objection was how Ciaran Hinds was directed to play Rochester. I blame the director because I've seen Hinds in many movies and know the range of emotion he can display. In this version he was essentially one-note: he shouts all the time. The ONLY time he softens is in the bedroom with Jane after the fire. That one scene showed me what could have been, and only sharpened my disappointment with the rest. What a sad waste of what could have been a marvelous production.
I did like Samantha Morton's Jane best of all the Janes (I've seen every version of this). I just wish she'd been given better dialogue to speak.
The Timothy Dalton version remains my favorite. Too bad Hinds and Morton didn't have that script and that director!",2.0
"Extremely disappointing production.  Adumbrates the story.  The makers apparently didn't believe the audience could take the real Jane Eyre, as they dumbed it down and tarted it up.

I'm a Downton Abbey junkie and hoped this series would satisfy my cravings between seasons.  It does not come close.  The acting is not even up to daytime soap opera level. The sets are cheap-looking and not at all reflective of the era.  What I've watched thus far reminds me of high school plays--seriously.  I finished two seasons and that's all I could take.  Maybe the others are better.  I'll probably not know because I'm not at all into any of these characters or the storylines.,2.0
"I was expecting this to be wonderful from the reviews, but due to the wretched moral values of many of the Upstairs people I had a hard time enjoying the story.  A few of the Downstairs people had difficulties, too, but they in general set better standards of conduct.  Wish I could sell my copy.",2.0
"I watched the sequel first, which was so good it prompted me to watch the original series. I'm 3 episodes into season 1, and don't think I can slog my way through any more of it. The acting is horrendously hammy, and the story lines are foolish and juvenile. Unlike the recent Upstairs Downstairs, it's unrealistic (in one scene, one of the actresses was changing out of her clothes and you could see she was wearing bikini underwear under her white bloomers), and showed little of what the world was actually like in that era. The house it's set in is dull, and alll of the characters are over exaggerated, annoying, and unlikeable. Basically, it's just a bad 1970's Soap Opera.",2.0

It seemed they thought they were on the stage.  Also the first few were in black & white, due to a strike by
technicians.  I wish I had my money back on this one.  I could not wait for one of the servants, Alfred, to be

"The first episode was in color.  The next episodes were in black and white.  The sound went up and down throughout each episode.  I think it was episode 21 or 22 which was repeated and the ensuing episode wasn't on the disc.  I wrote the BBC to ask about getting a replacement disc with the missing episode and never got a response.

Whoever did the quality control for this DVD set should be required to give us all refunds or at the very least prevented from ever producing DVDs again.

I bought this series as a gift and it made it look like I bought some slightly irregular box set on clearance, instead of getting a quality set like I assumed I was gifting, which was highly embarassing.  So if you're buying it for someone else, keep it in mind that they're going to be disappointed.

You'll still get to see most of the episodes, but expect that you'll be adjusting the volume throughout your viewing and don't count on watching the episodes in color, as they originally aired.  At least it's a period piece, so you can tell yourself that's why it's in black and white.",2.0

I bought this to help teach my kids about their country's roots, but this movie was no real help at all and a waste of money.",2.0
"I recently saw the HBO miniseries ""John Adams"" and was compelled to watch this movie for a different perspective on a portion of the same period.  Like most American schoolchildren, my familiarity with the crossing of the Delaware at Trenton was limited to the famous painting of that event which shows General Washington perched imperiously in the prow of a boat while being rowed through icy waters in the dead of night.  The reality was decidedly less cinematic; unfortunately, so is this made-for-television treatment.  Admittedly, I was spoiled by the superior production values of ""John Adams"" beside which this production pales.  In its favor, it does present a grittier version of life in the Continental Army than we are accustomed to seeing and does much to humanize the deified personage of its Supreme Commander.  But the production was hobbled by obvious budget constraints and prosaic camera work that make it look very like the TV project it was.  This decisive battle that turned the Revolution in the colonialists' favor is portrayed as little more than a skirmish between Washington's ragtag band of volunteers and a bunch of unsuspecting drunks.  Maybe in truth that's all it was, but the amateur look of this production does nothing to elevate the action into something a little more noble.  It appears that the fate of the Revolution hinged on little more than a brawl.  But it was a brawl the fledging nation desperately needed to win, and Washington is revealed as a crafty stratetician who was willing to risk all on a breathtaking gamble all others dimissed as insane.  The isolation of Washington's command is portrayed with numerous references to the utter lack of support for Washington from the very body that had authorized him to carry out this war.  Citizens of the Republic in the present day may take comfort (or not) in the knowledge that from its very earliest incarnation, the Congress honed its reputation as a bunch of blow-hard self-promoters who existed to endlessly debate but not to act.  Also shown is the in-fighting among Washington's generals, some of whom resented his authority and in some cases, plotted actively to undermine it.  As Washington, Jeff Daniels successfully gives the 'statue' flesh and bone.  He has a wonderful physicality for the role and looks every part the vigorous and devotion-inspiring leader in his prime.  More problematic is his delivery, which sounds too much of the contemporary Midwest (Daniels is a Michigan native) and not much at all like the 'gentleman from Virginia.'  In general, I am not in favor of American actors larding up their dialogue with distracting accents, but though Daniels looks great, he does not sound convincing as a Tidewater aristocrat.  In contrast to the mostly British supporting cast with their more elegant diction, Daniels is rough-hewn and out of his element.  He also delivers his lines very s-l-o-w-ly; one hardly thinks Washington, in the heat of battle for his life and the Republic would have been so laconic. The teleplay by Howard Fast (based on his novel of the same name) displays a tin ear for authentically colonial-sounding dialogue, with many 20th century anarchronisms creeping in, and it presents the greatest obstacle for the actors.  Some worthwhile moments of content, but stylistically this could have done better by its subject.",2.0
"The Crossing is really just not a good movie, but I still find it interesting because some of the movie was filmed quite close to where I live; the opening scene when Washington's bedraggled army is marching through a wooded area, and the camp scenes near the beginning of the movie.
To say that the acting in this movie was good would be a slight over-statement, and the dialogue is not what one would call stellar.  I would not be so certain about the accuracy of the movie either--few movies are.  The general course of events may be faithfully adhered to, but no movie based on a historical event that I can think of has not taken liberty with the truth for one reason or another.",2.0
"Although most reviewers found this movie to be very accurate, I find one glaring error.... NO Americans of African decent.  THE FACTS: George Washington himself requested two black oarsmen to accompany him on his boat.  The biographer of ""The Crossing"" made sure he included the action between Henry Knox and General Washington in reference to swamping the boat, but again, no blacks. Please understand, I was excited to finally see a positive portrayal of my heritage displayed on the small screen.  Can you imagine my sadness when seeing we were purposely left out? (Every other aspect of the film was painstakingly accurate.)  I am keeping this short, check the facts and remember we were there!",2.0
"Being a big fan of Jeff Daniels' acting and Revolutionary War drama, I ordered this movie and was very disappointed. The sequence of events is historically accurate but the characters are not very well portrayed. The crudity and obscenity were unbelievable in an unrated movie--in at least two places Washington uses the a-word to refer to someone's behind. Right! In the 1770s they still used that word to refer to a donkey. And we still have a copy of Washington's orders that his troops were to refrain from profanity. It is known under extreme provocation Washington used an occasional four-letter word, but never in casual conversation like in this movie. Stick with true history...try Jeff Shaara's books on the War.",2.0

"Again- There were so many times during this movie that my jaw just dropped at the stupidity.
The typical argument in defense of a film like this is, ""Of course it's stupid. It's an action movie."" Yes: even the good action movies tend to be stupid. This one, though, is stupid but has nothing to recommend it. The patriotism is simplistic, insipid, and insulting. The plot is trash, the characters trash, the action trash.

"Short on plot; long on violence for its own sake. I was disappointed in the way it ended; never getting Harrison Ford on Terra Firma. The only memorable line, ""Get off my plane"" didn't warrant a rating higher than two stars, and wasn't enough to make it worth watching a third time (I watched it twice to see if I might have missed further enjoyment, but I didn't). They cast Wendy Crewson; one of Canada's greatest actresses as First Lady, and gave her nothing to do but cower in the corner acting timid. And Glenn Close as Vice President was a commendable choice; if only she hadn't bowed to all the men, even the discussion over the 25th Amendment lacked the anticipation one might expect in the given situation. This film was cast w/ some of the greatest talents; its just too bad they were let down by what I feel was so weak a script.",2.0

"How this movie received positive reviews and generated $300,000,000 is a complete mystery to me. I have enjoyed Harrison Ford's films since childhood, but ""Air Force One"" is complete and utter cheese. The special effects are laughably bad, from Air Force One's ridiculous evasive ground maneuvering, to the Fax Lady's & friends' comfy-happy-no-fear parachute jumps, to the painfully fake fighter windshields, to the crappy green-screen hand-to-hand battles on the rear loading ramp, to the 64-bit video-game quality mid-air fueling sequence, to the preposterous ten-second-per-person rope transfer to the C-130, to the cartoonish breakup of Air Force One into the ocean. Bad. I mean REAL bad, made-for-TV-movie quality effects. I also fail to understand how multiple terrorists could take out multiple secret service agents in their initial assault, yet they timidly refused to enter the belly of the plane to take out one remaining agent (who was actually the president). I also don't understand how FIVE Mig jets would fail to destroy a gianto, relatively slow-moving jumbo jet after they would clearly detect F-15 fighters closing on their position. The only redeeming quality of the film was Gary Oldman's commitment to his performance, and Harrison Ford's usual awesomeness. However, even their epic acting chops cannot overcome the royal cheesiness of this nuclear cheesoid of a cheesy action flick. CHEESE. FAMUNDA CHEESE. FAMUNDA CHEESEVILLE.",2.0
"Who does not worship at the altar of the evil incarnate Gary Oldman? OK
given his ""Immortal Beloved"" venture, went against type but he
represents the zenith of scare tactics even with the most insipid of
actors, Harrison Ford. You can tell he did not know what hit him when
his eyes realllly bugged out in all of the strangleholds by Oldman.
Ford was in real pain and fear and I was cheering, FINALLY a real
emotion from this one noter.

The only dialogue worth mentioning was the reference to killing 100K
Iraqis to affect pump price reductions. This sentimental ""USA All the
Way"" notion would fall on deaf ears today given the lowest ratings for
leadership. I am confident we would be overjoyed with a huge military
base from China near Los Angeles. There are approximately 800 'known'
bases around the world, that is some kinda democracy imho.

Where did they discover the FAX Lady? She was awarded PostMaster
General for sending a 3line FAX, and she LOVES Skydiving! I believe
that honor would be best bestowed to the President's daughter, she had
it all under control. Another astute observation is the Russian
actors sure were good looking and hard to view as enemies, they even
work out! However, not enough for that savage cunning 53YO President
who kicked a$$ in 'Nam 30+ years prior.

I respect the director for his other projects, i.e. Das Boot, unclear
how he would accept this dirge of gratuitous.... you name it, they had
it. Consequently, hilarity ensues with this many hits and more misses
than is conceivable. Congrats Hollywood!

"I'm just tired of movies that have no individuality.  They don't even try to attempt something remotely original, and that seems down into their casting decisions.  How many times do we need to see Gary Oldman play a creepy villain?  Honestly, how many times do we need to see Harrison Ford play a Presidential figure of some sort?  Even Glenn Close gets type casted in those `women who wish they were as powerful as men' roles.  That is the big issue with `Air Force One', there is nothing original here.  The story is preposterous and pretty straightforward with no real stimulation.  It doesn't make a lot of sense and yet it is forgivable action fluff for the most part really.  The action scenes are effective and some of the visuals are nicely constructed, but the tension just doesn't live up upon multiple viewings, and really with a film this redundant in basically everything it isn't worth watching more than once.",2.0

Everything in this movie just seems so pat and set, there's always going to be an out, and surprise! Guess who's going to do it! Yes! Harrison Ford! Our president is going to kick (...)!

Doesn't that bother anyone? This movie screams Hollywood and follows it so faithfully its scary. In real life, for that is what we are trying to portray, would the president jump out of a falling plane, try to save his rogue commander or any of the other numerous things that never stop happening? Maybe...maybe not. Obviously on Air Force One he's a superman, because he is able to do all these things.

Air Force One needs to come down out of the clouds and have some reality shot into it. Other than that, this movie is a rather decent action thriller. Just for action mind you. That, and fans of Harrison Ford should apreciate his superhuman role.

"Just because The Beatles&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/have-done-it/dp/B0000542D2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">have done it</a>, that doesn't mean the Spice Girls should do the same.  It's a heavy risk for music artists to sell their name on to the big screen, and believe me,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-could-go-very-wrong/dp/6302261589/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this could go very wrong</a>.  Some make it out okay with just the bio-pics, other played it safe and just make theirs a concert movie, but ""Spice World"" took a completely alternate step.  It's a Spice Girls power hour where a lot of zany antics occur, and nothing makes sense.

I might be completely biased with this movie, because much like my unholy memories with Tom Green, the Spice Girls were also a devistating memory of youth; the thing is I used to like Tom Green while I was strongly indifferent with the girl band.  But for most of my middle school years, I'm surround by many fangirls in support of this group who play their music loudly and constantly, and I had to be the butt of a ongoing ridicule just because I made a simple comment that Ginger Spice was cute (and Geri Haliwell still looks pretty good).  My adolescent years was damaged because of the band, so reopening this mental wound does lead to personal spite.

But there are objective things to legitimately castrate this movie.  The biggest problem with the movie is that it's aimless.  The Spice Girls were setting up for a concert, they had a convenient pregnant best friend to chat with, their agent was pushing them to work hard and not have fun, and a tabloit journalist hired a sleazy paparazzo to tarnish the band because he's bored.  Everything else is practically plotless, just random scenarios that segue into other random scenarios.  They sing in different places, they meet celebrity cameos, they go on a photo shoot, two American studio execs are pitching a Spice Girls movie out of the blue, they ride on sport boats with their contest-winning fangirls, they were in a military dance camp with a stern gestappo instructor, and they were discovered by an alien race who loved their music.  There's no connection with each of these scenarios, the randomness of the goofball situations is akin to ""Family Guy"".  It also means these situations are practically idiotic in direction, if not just wordy whenever the girls just run their months about stuff only pre-teens would get into.

Just to hide the fact that the Spice Girls have no acting talent, the rest of the actors have to be completely bonkers. Their agent acts like if Ari Gold popped some speed and drank a pack of red bull, the tabloit guy is pontifically British, and the studio execs are so desperately perverse when they pitch the worst ideas ever in a film, almost like a parallel to this film; the execs even ripped-off an idea from a show pilot in ""Pulp Fiction"" (Spice Force Five, get it?). Neither of them are funny, they're just pretentious, much like the movie's gags.

Again, I'm being biased.  I am not the film's audience, the audience are young impressionable girls who loved the band's songs.  This movie understood its intended audience, that's why the Spice Girls went on an S&M club, they let their pregnant friend drink alcohol, they wear revealing outfits, an alien nearly copped a feel on Scary Spice, and their agent threatened to hang himself live in concert if the band didn't show up.  But seriously, the audience for this movie is limited at this point.  It wasn't long after the movie's release that Ginger Spice followed her own independent example and left the band, which cause the foundation to crumble and the fans had to move on.  I could say the Spice Girls are gone for good (and no, I'm not counting their world tour stunt a few years back that lasted only a week), but something life has a funny way of turning things around.  If New Kids on the Block manage to get together&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/and-release-an-album-not-too-long-ago/dp/B001LN2W38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">and release an album not too long ago</a>, it's possible that this girl group would rekindle their friendship.  Regardless, this movie is a nonsensical publicity stunt.",2.0
"This movie isn't the best, nor is it supposed to be.

"Britain, circa 1997.  Tony Blair is elected P.M.  Princess Di perishes.  And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public.  This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing.  To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what ""A Hard Days' Night"" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.  I was reminded more of the Monkees' ""Head"" than I was of ""A Hard Days' Night"".  Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught.  Oh, well.

"I still don't understand why everybody seems to love Air Force One so much.  First of all, the ground-based subplot with Glenn Close as the vice president is boring and just detracts from the movie's momentum.  Also, it's kind of interesting that the evil Secret Service agent tries to kill Harrison Ford at the end, even though none of the other villains are left to expose him and he could walk away without ever being suspected.  There was some scene that actually explained WHY that guy was betraying the president, but thanks to some boneheaded editing it was cut out of the movie and that character was reduced to just another stock villain.  In addition, almost all of the action sequences are sick mockeries of reality.  Granted, I can sort of go along with having that much random automatic gunfire on an airplane without losing cabin pressure.  But it's just ridiculous when the characters stand next to a big open hatch without getting sucked out into the sky and their hair just blows in the wind like they're standing in front of a movie studio fan.  And the most unintentionally funny moment has to be when the plane crashes-- the whole shot, one of the most awful CG effects I've seen in a big studio movie, is pathetic and kind of sad.  I don't understand why this film has been so successful and popular, especially since we've all seen MUCH better action movies from directors like James Cameron and John McTiernan.  Cameron could make a better movie than this standing on his head.

"This is not so spicy as the groups music is.  I love the Spice Girls music but when I saw Spice World ... I thouht that I may not even LISTEN to them no more much less WATCH them.  This movie, while being spicy and sorta on the verge, was not what I expected.  When I saw it in theathers I though it was a really good movie.  So good that I ACTURALLY bought the movie on VHS and then updated to DVD.  I watched it on VHS and it was okay but when I popped in the DVD ... it lost it's magic.  First off ... a few things where wrong with the dvd.
1.) Quality - The picture was great.  Clear and perfect.  The only problem with the picture was it was too dark to even see who was who.
2.)  Music - Couldn't they had put more felling into the music and acturally, I don't know, sing for once.  I know you lip-sing in music videos but, if you really want to get the crowd going and yelling for a sequel or another Spice movie, just sing and don't be scared and stupid as lets say, Britney Spears is.
3.)  Special Feautures - There were only 2 special features on the disc at all.  People usually upgrade to DVD's for the special features.  Am I right??  Of course I Am!
This movie, while being sporty and spicy, this is not a movie I would recommend you upgrade to DVD.  If you have the VHS ... keep it.  Don't upgrade to the DVD. Your just wasting your money!  Read my other DVD reviews and listen to my advice.  It's the best on this website!",2.0
"In a grand attempt to instill a healthy dose of national fear during these glory days of booming economy and virtual peace, Air Force One puts Harrison Ford in the only good guy-type role he has left to play--dream President of the U.S. of A.
AFO, like those Clancy-based  political-actioners, is technically pretty snazzy. But it also suffers from  a ham-fisted arrogance.  I mean, who would have thought we'd actually see a  movie where the prez himself becomes the super-dude (Bilbo Clinton would  need to cut down on the cheeseburgers, lose the gray, and run four million  laps around the White House to be up to such a task).
The minor  cleverness of AFO stems from director Wolfgang Peterson's ability to set an  unbelievable situation squarely in the realm of the possible, kind of.  Sometimes it works, but the apple pie propaganda gets pretty gooey,  especially toward the end.  A Presidential sounding horn section plays in  the background every time Marshall kicks a vodka-drinking scuzball in the  groin, and the brow-beating of the first family becomes a melodramatic  hoot.

"This review is NOT about the movie as it is five plus stars. It is about the blu ray from Twilight Time. I have the DVD and just received the blu ray. For some unknown reason Columbia Pictures never issued this as a blu ray, so Twilight Time did. Normally I have been pleased with Twilight Time releases (HINT: all their releases are far far cheaper on their website, as I just found) as well as Criterion Collection releases. Honestly, Criterion is the best of all of them...Criterion, Twilight, Shout! Factory and Scream! Factory.

This is FAR FAR from a blu ray. I still own the DVD release and will continue to do so. There is absolutely NO difference between the blu ray and the Columbia DVD both in video and audio. I mean NONE. In fact, the blu ray is darker in tone then is the DVD. The darker tone does not account for a richer deeper picture, it is just dark. The DVD has a much brighter picture and the color at times appears sharper.

Perhaps there is a reason why Columbia never issued this as a blu ray. If their reason was because the negative would not transfer well, I certainly understand--as it clearly does not.",2.0

"The movie is the embodiment of the existentialism philosophy.  [Spoiler Alert]  The road trip [life] has no larger meaning except as an avenue to explore one hedonistic experience after another.  There is no higher purpose and the two protagonists eventually end up dead on the side of the road.  The interesting part of the film is that it tried to portray the counterculture movement as the heirs to the traditional American life.  Wyatt and Billy are modern cowboys.  The hippie communes are the heirs of the traditional farmers and ranchers.  The sentiment is given voice by George Hanson [Jack Nicholson]:  ""You know, this used to be a helluva good country.  I can't understand what's gone wrong with it.""

Easy Rider also attempts to redefine the traditional American definition of ""freedom.""  In the same monolog previously mentioned, George Hanson explains that Wyatt and Billy make people nervous because they represent true freedom.  He then defines freedom as the ability to do what you want, when you want, without any societal restraints.  The Founding Fathers of the United States defined freedom [liberty] as the ability to do what was right.  They defined the ability to do whatever you wanted without restraint as licentiousness and warned that it would eventually lead to the loss of freedom and liberty.  Easy Rider and the existentialist culture succeeded in altering the concept of American liberty and freedom away from what the Founders envisioned.

Overall, the movie is a good representation of the existentialist life.  Otherwise, it is a boring and meandering journey with only a few highlights.  I am glad I watched it but it is not going to be a personal favorite.",2.0

"Two hippies, Wyatt and Billy, drive cross country on their motorcycles in order to blow a lot of money at Mardi gras.  In the process they meet a slew of strange yet vital characters in their eventual understanding of their own existence.

The problem I have with `Easy Rider' is that it doesn't go anywhere for nearly half the film.  I usually adore this freelance style of filmmaking, but `Easy Rider' does not sit well with me at all.  In fact, the film is one gigantic fail for me until Jack Nicholson enters the story.  His performance is outstanding, but I'll get to that in a minute.  The film seems to just hang there, serving as a longwinded music video for some great classic rock tunes and some stunning (yet unrefined) cinematography.  The `profound' statement that this film is trying to make gets lost along the way, only unveiling itself in small doses (like when Nicholson gets preachy in a sleeping bag).

`Easy Rider' is sort of boring.

Dennis Hooper's direction can be distracting at times (the way he splices his scenes together is creative yet unnecessary) and the tonal shift of his film towards the end is rather questionable.  In fact, the whole Mardi gras sequence (that psychedelic cemetery trip scene) is staggeringly brilliant yet completely mind-numbing in that it is so out of place it becomes a deterrent to the film, not an aid.  The eventual ending, while wholly prolific and steeped in profound insight, is more of a head-scratcher than anything else.  I think that is my biggest complaint with the films second half (which is far better than the droned out first half).  It is entirely inconsistent and winds up lacking any cohesive feeling.

But, there is always Jack Nicholson.  His performance is one of the best supporting performances of all time.  It is slick with wit, intelligence, bravado and profound sentiment.  He ties together a lot of loose ends about the `meaning' here, without ever feeling out of place or forced.  His charisma is in tact and his humor is just what this film needed.  I won't demean him by using the phrase `comic relief', but I will say that he spices up a film in dire need of some `spice'.

Jack playing Jack to perfection.

In the end, I have to say that I am NOT impressed with this one.  I was really excited about seeing this, but halfway through I was aching to turn it off.  The only reason I watched it through to completion was the fact that I wanted to see what Nicholson did here, and I'm glad I witnessed that performance.  So, if you are a fan of Jack then see this, for it is one of his best turns (he should have won the Oscar for this), but the film as a whole is not only outdated but uninspired, clumsy and boring.

This is the definition of a missed opportunity.",2.0
"This is one of those movies that is on the AFI's ""Top 100 films of all time"" list. In my opinion that list is bogus. Only about a quarter of the films on that list deserve to be there. I don't think Easy Rider is anywhere close to one of the top 100 films of all time. Easy Rider seems fairly pointless. Billy(Dennis Hopper) and Wyatt (Peter Fonda) drive around on their choppers, pick up a hippie, and drive around some more. That sums up the first half of the film. Don't get me wrong, it isn't exactly boring, but it isn't exactly a great story either. To be honest this movie doesn't really have a story.

Dennis Hopper directed this film and the word is that he was completely stoned out of his mind. I can believe that. There is a scene at the end where the Billy and Wyatt drop some acid and go on a little trip with two hookers in a cemetary. To me it seems pretty easy to shoot an acid trip. Just shoot random stuff, cut it together randomly and voila! You have your scene. Or better yet, give the camera to a monkey. The out of focus shots and frenetic animal jerkiness will only add to the overall aesthetic of the scene. Its ok for the first 20 seconds, but anything longer than that gets monotonous.

Jack Nicholson is amazing as usual. He is so good, so convincing, and has such presence that he completely steals every scene that he is in. The other actors are good too in their own ways; Dennis Hopper made me laugh several times, but then again watching stoned guys do stupid things will usually make you laugh anyway.

The cinematography is very good. Lszl Kovcs does good work and he captures the scenery very well. God knows there is plenty of time for that during the course of the movie. There is a little incongruity towards the end when they try to match 16mm footage with the rest of the 35mm film, but other than that the picture is good. There are some weird things done with the editing that I didn't really understand or care for. There is a reoccuring theme of stuttering images before cutting to a new scene. It kind of seems like a film student experiment that was left in the film accidently.

I'll bet this movie was great back in the days of hippies and woodstock, but now it just comes off flat. It does give some insight into that time period, but there are many other better films that can do the same thing and tell you a story at the same time.

"I finally got around to watching this ""landmark"" - this ""generational touchstone."" After 35 years of cultural saturation - the music, the Academy Award montages, the one-liners - I watched it. Or at least I tried. It was extraordinarily disappointing. I'll bet I ""had to be there.""

Here's a movie which deliberately portrays late-sixties counter-culture with the ""counter"" component completely missing from the self-awareness of its participants. The characters are portrayed not as culturally savvy human beings who have tuned in, turned on and dropped out, but rather as pie-eyed mildly retarded adults on chrome-moly hobbyhorses frolicking across the country occasionally bumping into folk who misunderstand their unmeasured, playful skinny-dipping innocence. If this film weren't so revered it would be endearing as an interesting museum piece - not as a cinematic record of 60's culture, but as an unwitting artifact of 60's culture. As a film to be revered it fails.  As an artifact it is as successful as a piece of Sumerian cuneiform.

But the film is preachy - in the non-verbal way that films can be - in the way that the choir can never quite notice. The scene where Jack Nicholson smokes ""grass"" is hilarious for all the wrong reasons. Here's an early-thirties ACLU lawyer in 1969 written to act all agog at the sight of weed. ""You mean...mar-i-wa-na??"" he gawks like he's being offered the ignition key to an alien spacecraft.

In fact the only salient problem with this movie is that it tells a small, feeble lie - and does so in a silly sales-pitchy way. It lies by underplaying the deliberate and wry character of 60's counter-culture in an effort to intersect its participants' motivations with traditionally appreciated dispositions like joy and innocence and googly-eyed curiosity - and it does so with a dishonest straight face. It is the inverse of Reefer Madness pitched dry. All bitternes, measurement and calculation is attributed to the capitalists, rednecks, homophobes and jingos who litter the woods, the coffee shops and the highways. The net-effect this film had on American culture was as a springboard for the American motorcycle aftermarket industry - as anyone who is IN that industry, such as myself, can attest to. Thousands of would-be Captain Americas rebelled against ""the man"" by giving ""the man"" their paychecks in exchange for fork tubes, flag helmets and chopper 'zines. Ka-ching!",2.0

"I can't help, but ask that question. I really wasn't that impressed with this movie. I feel that it really didn't explain what the 60's were all about. I feel that what it did was tell everyone ""Party, and you'll be alright."" It just didn't gel together enough for me as I feel that the 60's may have been just a complete waste of time. I know one scene that really gripped me was when the main characters go to this hippie commune, and we see a guy who's is obviously stoned out of his mind holding a little baby who's crying, and while it makes the guy disturbed he doesn't do anything about it; Let's face it to me what the father of that baby was wanting was to have someone take that baby away from him so he can get back to the free sex, and the drugs. You see I feel that the movie would've sold me better if it was more geared towards the values the people were trying to hold to back then. I know that the decade was about equality, and world peace, and how everybody wanted them so bad, but the movie looks more on the selfish side of the hippies. With the main characters scoring alot of money from a drug buy, and the carefree style of just traveling along the country without a care in the world. The only character I feel was worth something was played by Jack Nicholson. A lawyer who seemed so dissilousioned with the way things were that he joins Hopper and Fonda for awhile on the trip. I know that during this decade everyone was wondering what's going on? Was the way our parents raised us, and the values they tried to instill in us wrong? This is understandable considering everybody was starting to think more broader. I can't say if it was because of the drugs, or not that caused everyone to start challenging the values of thier parents, but that's where the movie should've been centered. I just can't help, but feel that Fonda's character was right ""We Blew It."" I know that's what happened with this movie here. A somewhat decent soundtrack, but it's not the masterpiece that everyone feels that it is. I know that this is tough stuff, but I've kept silent about it for 16 years, and it was time to release my feelings on this movie. I feel that it revealed to me that this hippie culture is one of self-indulgence, and escaping responsibilities. It's not about peace, or love. Now there is no resolution as the former hippies have gone on to represent the people they hated, and they've developed a callous attitude that the people they hated had, so what are we to believe? Are we to accept this on blind faith? Well some people may say yes as once again the movie left me feeling with one of the songs from the Blind Faith album ""Do What You Like"".",2.0
"Can somebody please explain to me how this awful movie became one of the signature movies of a generation?  Did this movie come out during a lull in full-length film productions?  Were there no other movies that had a decent story or camera work?  The cameraman appears to have seveal seizures during the filming, and apparently, Dennis Hopper was too strung out on coke to realize this during the editing process.  Also there appears to be a huge gap in the plot line--a lack of decent ideas and dialogue that doesn't make me laugh at it's pathetic attempt to be hip and/or serious.  There are only two things good about this movie: the soundtrack and the fact that this movie propelled Jack Nickolson's career.  Other than that, this movie should be burnt, or at least end up like the main characters do.

"Something of a dubious milestone. When it first came out it was hailed as a classic and groundbreaking cinema and it was just as much required viewing as ""2001"". Over the years it has come to be considered as the spearhead of ""form without content"" cinema. Having seen it again since it's initial release, it is something of an embarassment and little more than a misguided curio and observation of a social movement as seen from a comfortable disengagued distance (no matter what people say about Corman, he was still in the business of selling tickets and this was just as much exploitation as ""Riot On Sunset Strip"" was a year or two earlier). Not just for the false notes it hits and stereotypes it depicts, it revels in its own smugness and conceit making, at least for this ageing hippy, a very uncomfortable experience. Sadly, this movie will be judged by many as ""the way it was"" and it will become something of a reference point for viewers and film makers who were not alive during this period to point to as a touchstone of accuracy. The hippie movement becomes pigeon-holed much the same way people viewed surfing in the 60's from the standpoint of ""Beach Blanket Bingo"".

"I watched this the second time in film class in 1970 with a professor who claimed to have watched it 40+ times, teasing out the deeper nuances.  That seemed excessive even given the zeitgeist of the times.  Watching it once would be excessive now but for the insight it gives into the completely vacuous values of the 60's.  Some aspects of the 60's have held up well (Jimi Hendrix still sounds great), but this movie isn't one of them.  If you can listen to Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper babble with the other stoners on the commune about doing your own thing in your own time without bursting out laughing, you need more drugs.  I would give this one star but for the fact that the music is pretty good, it helped launch Jack Nicholson, and Fonda has gone on to do some very good movies and Hopper some great ones.",2.0

"""Easy Rider"" (1969)
""A classic...a great film for its day...everyone is sure to love it"", those were the comments I had been hearing about Easy Rider before I rented it. I expected this movie to be great because it was called a counterculture classic and topped many people's lists of the best film of the 1960's. In my opinion, Easy Rider is a case of don't believe everything you read.
Sure, the movie has its good points. The music is fantastic. The songs are all very memorable and suit the road theme, styles of the film and the time in which it is set very well. Many of the songs of the movie have become classics since the films release. Easy Rider is also shot gorgeously, with heaps of great sunset shots and motorcycle journeys.
The performances in the movie are also very good. Jack Nicholson is the stand out as the innocent comic relief Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda meet when they go to jail. Nicholson deserved another Oscar for this role! Hopper clearly put a lot of effort into the film being a writer, director and lead actor, but his continuous ""man's"" and hippie references annoyed the heck out of me, as did his monologues about what he ""sees"" after he takes drugs. Peter Fonda was hailed as the leading actor of the movie but he really doesn't say that much and he has very little facial expression. His acting definitely got better.
There was also way too many drugs in this movie. In the film, this is basically the story: these 2 guys take drugs, encounter people, take drugs, make the people they encounter take drugs, take some drugs, sleep, take a couple more drugs, have sex, and then take drugs. And apparently this story is all about ""freedom"" according to Dennis Hopper. Yeah right. Also, Easy Rider doesn't present any ideas why or why not the characters should be doing this. Why are they doing it in the first place? Is taking drugs a way to make people free and express freedom? No. I found the use of drugs both pointless and excruciatingly unrealistic in this film.
So, the movie does have its good points - the cinematography, bikes and Jack Nicholson - but not enough to overcome the whole pointlessness of the entire production. This is one big disappointment for me, and I can't believe such a film that was hailed as a ""classic"" could be so banal and stupid.

"This is considered the classic 60's counterculture film. Released in 1969, the American Film Institute (AFI) ranks it the 88th best film ever made,  Time Magazine called it ""...one of the ten most important pictures of  the decade,"" and the LA Times said it remains ""...an astonishing  work of art and an overpowering motion picture experience."" It is the  movie that  rocketed Jack Nicholson to stardom. All that said, it has not  aged well!
The plot is; Let's buy drugs, then sell the drugs and use the  money to go to Mardi Gras on our motorcycles. Along the way, we'll stop at  a hippy commune, we'll have small-town girls sitting in a soda parlor think  we're cute and we'll have sex with prostitutes in a New Orleans house of  ill repute. All individuals in 'straight society' (in that term's original  sense) are portrayed as cretins.
No storyline, no character development,  no nuance, no maturation or lessons learned by the characters. No tension,  either based on time running out or options running out. Only obvious  metaphors, the editing doesn't come close to meeting the standards of the  time, there's no backstory, no flashbacks, no richness, no depth, NO  WAY.
I am writing this review because I was gullible enough to BUY this  movie on DVD, based on the AFI ranking and my eagerness to accept it as the  de facto standard drug culture movie of the sixties. I erred. There are  only two redeeming elements in this film. One is great Rock music from,  among others, Jimi Hendrixx and the Byrds. The other is Jack Nicholson, who  has the role of  a factoid spouting young, alcoholic lawyer. In effect, he  is playing himself and he does so magnificently. But, in spite of this  performance, the rest of variables that constitute a good movie or a good  story are either missing or  misused. Miss it!",2.0

"Easy Rider is a legendary movie. This ofcourse is due to its cultural and box office impact rather then the quality of the film itself. Today the film is merely a curio-item, but as a film, it just doesn't work. Witness  for example the ludicrous dialogue, when a farmer invites Fonda and Hopper  to eat with his family, there is a close-up of Fonda's face as he says  ""Its great thing for a man to live off the land, you should be  proud."" Please, this sounds like a public service commercial for some  farmers union. Hopper as a director has this highly annoying gimmick of  falshing frames of the next scene twice before actually moving onto it, and  he doesn't do it once but throughout the film. Now I'm aware that this  gimmickry might have been revolutionary back in the sixties, but now it  only breaks the flow of a film that is already hard to sit through. The  movie consists of endless shots of Fonda and Hopper on their bike, and not  much else, but it does however recieve a major jolt with Jack Nicholson's  arrival, he briefly awakens this movie out of its slumber. Unfortunatly  he's not on for long, and we're back to Fonda and Hopper on bikes. The  movie then ends in an extended acid trip which despite being completely  pointless is far more entertaining then the rest of this tepid film. Watch  this if you're a serious film buff and want to know what the hoopla is  about, but once you've gotten through it once, I doubt you'll have it in  you to sit through it again.",2.0

"In 2005, we took a weekend trip from Baton Rouge, LA to Natchitoches, LA, where fifteen years earlier the filming of Steel Magnolias in 1989 remains about the biggest thing that ever happened. Having never seen the movie, we rented it as soon as we got back home. Everyone had a reason for watching it in two segments--mine was my sense that this was one of the ""cutest"" movies I'd ever seen, and I'd had quite enough ""cute"" lately, especially after sitting through Will Smith in ""Hitch"". The accents and the caricatures of the characters were all so thick that it reminded me of The Beverly Hillbillies, though more embarrassing than funny. One ""Hillbillies-like"" moment that pretty funny was the few non-female characters' effort to shoot some ""crows"" out of a tree so that they won't ""**** all over the reception"". Their creative use of a crossbow is a classic.

Sad to say there isn't much else classic in a story that is at the same time saccharine and maudlin. There was also some choppiness between scenes (as the movie was adapted from a play that never left the beauty shop). I can think of two scenes in particular--one where the town-big wig Clairee (played by the noted-Southern belle Olympia Dukasis) buys the local radio station so that she can do the color commentary on the local football games (the scene features the same guy filmed bare from the back waist-and-lower view as he walks in front camera in the locker room three times.) In another scene, the Darryl Hannah (hard to recognize) committed Christian character argues with her boyfriend over his repeated taking of the Lord's name in vain. Neither scene has any impact on the rest of the story.

Dolly Parton is her usual big hair, big smile, big **** self as the lead hairdresser. Shirley MacLaine has a very unsympathetic character as the Eatonton's (Julie and Sally, and family) ill-tempered neighbor. The male characters are more or less wasted, especially the estimable Sam Shepard, who spends most of the film underneath a car, or sitting lifelessly in front of a TV.

The movie improved from the seemingly endless wedding prep and wedding of the first half to the second half, which became more dramatic. Sally Field has a pretty good scene near the end, she and the story make you think a little about the motives of the main character (Julia Roberts as Shelby).

Overall, I thought that Steel Magnolias was a relatively embarrassing depiction of life in the beautiful town of Natchitoches, LA. Given that the locals seemed not to mind too much, I may be overreacting. They even showed us where the truck made an illegal left turn in the final scene.",2.0

"Watched this after watching Contact for the first time, and there is no contest about which one is better. The positive reviews for this movie mention ""a sense of wonder an awe"" a lot, Ebert included, and I just don't see it. The main character is an awful person that I didn't want to root for BEFORE he starting losing his mind, let alone after. The pacing is dreadful and the motivations of the characters and the government is poorly sketched, so it's just hard to care about what's happening on screen. Possibly worse, they kept trying to add suspense with mysteries and spooky happenings that the movie had already let the audience in on 10 minutes ago.

The only redeeming factor was some good thematic moviemaking. People struggling to communicate and have relationships with each other, giving a dim view of the almost impossible communication with another species. It's a shame those themes don't get resolved in the script and that the main character doesn't appear to change himself or the plot by the finale.

"The movie focuses primarily on Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), an electric line repairman who goes to work one night to fix a massive power outage and sees several low flying spacecraft.  Many others see these craft including Gillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon from A Christmas Story) whose son is later abducted by the aliens.  At the same time, a group of researchers who apparently work for the government travels around the world gathering information on various alien sightings and encounters.  All of this comes together when everyone converges on one spot to find... well, that's the question that plagues all of them.

The government researcher scenes tend to be chaotic and confusing.  It's not unusual to have to sit through a few minutes of incomprehensible material before you can finally understand what's going on at the very end of the scene.  They also didn't add a whole lot to the film, especially given the amount of time they take up.  The plot line involving Roy Neary is the most interesting.  After his encounter, he's driven by strange compulsions but he doesn't understand what they mean or how to deal with them.  His family gets pretty freaked out, especially his wife (Teri Garr).  If his wife wasn't screaming all the time, this would have been a great story, but she gets old very quickly.

The climax of the film involves a light show that lasts about twenty minutes as various alien ships dart around, hover, and finally land.  They then play a rousing tune for a few minutes to communicate even though they give the earthmen no way whatsoever to put the notes into any meaning or context.  It felt like an endless nightmare watching this scene drag on and on before it was finally over.  I'm fine with a peaceful encounter but this could have been done in one fourth the time with absolutely nothing lost.

It's difficult for me to recommend this movie.  For hard-core sci fi or Spielberg fans, you should see it once for yourself because it is one of the milestones in the genre.  Anyone else can safely skip it since there are far more entertaining films for you to choose from.",2.0
"I may be the lone hold out, but.... on my Samsung DLP , the transfer is terrible. I am of the opinion that the HD transfer is also enhancing the grain of a thirty year old movie. The DNIe engine in my Samsung is making that grain more enhanced. Any family scenes in the house look like they're  in a snow storm. Other than that the outdoor scenes are great, and the colors and sound are awesome. If you have a Samsung DLP, though, you will have to watch it with the DNIe off. The picture is not as sharp, but the snow is not as bad. By the way, I looked at the regular DVD version in the same Blu- Ray player and there was a little grain, but no snow... with the DNIe engaged.  32 dollars wasted? Hard to say at this point. Anybody else having this problem?",2.0
"Can you believe, I have never seen CEO3K until the other week.  I looked forward to seeing it, but unfortunately it did not measure up. After hearing mixed reviews (so many of them referred to it as 'boring'), I was prepared to give it a go.

Close Encounters is very slow moving, with the occassional interesting thing occurring, but it is not until the end where something interesting happens.  And even then, I expected more.  I was left thinking ""is that it, after all that slow build-up?"".  Many scenes during the film are just too stupid for words.

I have viewed the 2-Disc collector's edition which apparently is a combination of the Director's Cut and the original theatrical version. For a first timer to the film, it made no difference to me. However, as fans of the film have stated, the tampering by Spielberg for this special edition was not appreciated.  He re-edited the original version removing scenes that perhaps gave it its popularity (eg. Dreyfuss entering the mothership).  Spielberg has said he will never re-instate these scenes. Doesn't it annoy you when a Director refuses to let people see a film the way they originally remember?  It's almost a kick in the teeth for helping him make his millions.  Oh well, at least he had the decency to allow the original 'untouched' version of E.T. to be included on the 2002 digitally enhanced version DVD.

The second disc of CE3K contains the extras which I guess would be gold for fans of the film. The DVD overall is a limited edition and at a price too - I am surprised at the price considering the film isn't that great.  I wish someone could enlighten me on why this film is considered a classic.",2.0
"Idle hands is a poorly made teenage serial killer film, in which a slacker teenager's hand is possessed and kills other teenagers.  Jessica Alba has a small part as a girlfriend.  Skip this film",2.0
"Which isn't a good thing. If you've seen any recent horror flicks within the past 10 years(Taking Lives, Wrong Turn, I Still Know What you Did Last Summer, Scream), then you know it's filled with the dummest imaginable good guys, cheesy plot and almost un-killable bad guys. And scenes that are supposed to thrill you and you just wonder when this is going to end. I almost fell asleep in a few of those movies, that's how lame, tiring and boring they are. Fortunately, for this film, it has Jessica Alba and Seth Green, who are two fantastic actors/actresses and are always delightful to see. Seth Green is hilarious as the main characters buddy, and Jessica Alba is more then sexy. However, the movie is beyond cheesy(like a hand jumping out a microwave through the window, smashing the glass in the mean time and landing in the bush, but it can't escape the microwave. Or, when the lady(played by Vivica A. Fox(Kill Bill)) is hit by a car, which is backing up, and then is sent 50 feet. Uh huh, that's realistic. Ends sarcasm.) Then there is tones of un-necessary gore and silly scenes like the guy losing his head. And how exactly did his buddies get back? They don't explain anything and assume everything is magical. It delivers the comedy pretty well, thanks to Seth Green for that, but is just too silly, far too cheesy and extremely lame(a hand that is possessed? Please, give me a break.)",2.0
"Let me be direct: 90% of the movie sucks. The acting and effects are decent. But the story, the direction, and well, pretty much everything else, are bad.
A few minutes into the movie, I thought it was a horror movie. Even then I was disappointed because it's not nearly horrifying enough. Then a third of the movie gone by, the plot became more and more ridiculous, and only then did I realize that the filmmakers wanted to make it a black comedy. But just that the movie has the style of a black comedy doesn't mean that the filmmakers would feel obliged to offer you any laughs, witty dialouges or dark humor. The movie has none of those.
The only reason I didn't give it a 1 star is some really really terrible movies deserve the lowest grade more than this one does. Not by a lot, though, I have to say.",2.0
"Remember all those really campy films from the 1950s such as The Crawling Hand?  Idle Hands is basically the same type of movie, only much sillier, much campier, and in some respects embarrassingly bad.  The filmmakers really don't even bother to explain the whole silly concept; a corporeal, murderous hand on the rampage normally doesn't need a lot of background info, but in this case Anton (Devon Sawa) simply has his own hand somehow possessed without the rogue hand causing all the mischief even finding him.  Only after Anton cuts his hand off, do we return to the more traditional animated, murderous hand on the rampage theme, and that works much better than Anton's constant battle to control what his right hand is doing as long as it is attached to his arm.  As far as the rest of the explanation goes, we have a Druidic priestess (Vivica A. Fox) trying to find and destroy the hand before midnight Druid time, at which time the hand will take a soul into the netherworlds.  In my opinion, this story doesn't even begin to work.
A little bit of comedy is supplied by the always-funny Seth Greene (who plays Mick) and his buddy Pnub (Elden Henson).  These two, along with Anton, are the triumvirate of lazy, pot-smoking teens (just the type of victim said hand likes to prey upon).  Probably the funniest part of the film involves the reappearance of an undead Pnub and Mick (who carries his severed head around with him most of the time); the staircase to heaven, they said, was just too far to walk, so they decided to just stay on earth.  The only bright spot in this film, and the only reason I wanted to see it, is Jessica Alba.  I was somewhat amazed to see some of the facial expressions and attitudes she would later display in her role in the incredibly good TV series Dark Angel.
Idle Hands is just too stupid to be at all horror-inspiring, and it is too stupid to even be funny for the most part.  I usually love these types of campy films, but in this case I would have to say that the fellow with the most idle hands of all was the scriptwriter, as he really didn't give us much of a story for this film.",2.0
"""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" was a movie I fondly remember from my youth as kindling that spark of cinema magic that seems to be in short supply these days.  For its day the visual effects were mesmorizing and the prospect that we are not alone in this universe became very real for me after viewing this movie.  Plot: People from all walks of life are brought to the Arizona desert by a series of space ship visits to our planet earth.
Columbia Tristar has really angered me with this release.  Steven Spielberg should be none too thrilled with them either.  Their 2 disc special edition presents his masterpiece in a digitally grainy, thoroughly unsatisfying visual quality topped off by excessive aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement, low contrast levels, colors that bleed and an overall visual characteristic that ranges from too, too soft to digitally harsh.  There's no happy medium.  The arrival of the alien mother ship is totally ruined by excessive pixelization that breaks up fine details.  This is not the way I want to remember this sci-fi classic.  The soundtrack is dated but overall well represented.  The extras include a making of that is informative but a direct import from Columbia's laserdisc and some extra test and rehearsal footage that is somewhat dry.  I think Columbia would do wise to just hand over their film library to more capable hands to preserve.  Of late their transfers have gotten even worse than this.  However with this DVD release, there was a definite beginning to that end!",2.0
"I had been hearing how great this movie was but I had never seen it. So I bought the dvd. I was a little disappointed. This version has the added scenes that were not shown in the original theatrical release, and maybe that is what I don't like. It is slow and too long. If you have already seen it and liked it then this is a good dvd, but if you haven't scene it, I would rent it first, just in case.",2.0
"Close Encounters has great special effects and an amazing light show but the story is so humorless, cold and sterile, I cannot recommend this movie.
We're supposed to sympathize with Richard Dreyfuss's character who becomes possessed with a vision imparted within him by super-intelligent, super-sensitive aliens.  But how can anyone sympathize with a man who willingly throws away his wife and children to follow some vague abstract space vision.
And yet we're not supposed to think of Dreyfuss as a victim of an alien-induced obsession.  Rather, Spielberg wants us to be in awe of and admire these aliens who are, in Spielburg's view, a more intelligent, advanced enlightened species than the human species.  But the facts of his story completely contradict this Spielberg vision of alien goodness and virtue.  The aliens kidnap and/or brainwash innocent people for no apparent reason and yet, because they're ""sensitive"" and intelligent, we're supposed to go ""awwww"" and think how wonderful they are.
The acting is fair but nothing special.  The only truly good acting performance is by Teri Garr who realistically and grippingly shows what is like to have one's life turned upside down by a spouse who's caught in the grip of an obsession.  Other than Ms. Garr, the rest of the cast is either way over-the-top (Dreyfuss) or forgettable.
Close Encounters is long, pretentious, sometimes dull, but often visually interesting to look at.  If you want to see a great light show, rent it.  If you want to watch a compelling movie, look somewhere else.",2.0
"Idle hands is hopefully at the end of a cycle of horror flixs that was started in 1996 by Scream, a satire of the slasher pictures of the 70s. Like all cycles in the movie business, this one has been brought down by the weight of too many cheap and derivative knockoffs When this happens, it finally doesn't matter if a movie in the category is good or not. People don't buy it. Ironically, the next big cycle was kicked off this summer by another, albeit more sophisticated and serious, horror genre - the psychological horror / ghost story [The Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense]. Idle Hands is further handicapped by being neither one of the best nor one of the worst of the ""scream"" cycle.
It starts off well enough. The time is Halloween. What other time is there? Young Anton's parents retire to bed. After the lights go out, they see an ominous message written on the ceiling. All hell breaks loose, and this sequence unspools like a twisted situation comedy. The next morning, Anton [Devon Sewa] wakes up, oblivious to the fact that his parents have gone missing. But then the teenager is oblivious to almost everything except drugs, sex and rock and roll, as are his two best friends, Mick and Pnub [Seth Green and Elden Ratliff]. As the day progress, it becomes apparent that one of Anton's hands has taken on a mind of its own. It has become homicidal. Most of the funniest moments in the movie show the boy and his deranged hand fighting for control. Devon Sewa, like Jim Carrey, is a very physical actor.
Idle Hands is a homage to many old movies. The uncontrollable hand reminds me of a Peter Sellers character, Dr. Stranglove, in the movie of the same name. The opening pays tribute to Halloween, while the dance scene is straight out of Carrie. Anton's ghostly friends are just like the ones in An American Werewolf in London. One problem is that Idle Hands is nowhere near as good as the movies it salutes.
The bigger problem is that every character is self-centered and stupid. The writer and the director do not understand that, even when a movie is a horror satire, if the audience cannot relate to any character, interest quickly wanes. One morning Anton discovers his parents have been whacked, and, by that night, he's trying to make it with the girl next door. You can laugh at this idiot, but do you really care about him? This is not to say that there are no clever scenes in the movie. It is to say that the audience's involvement remains superficial. It's one of those pictures that leaves no impact and is forgotten by the next day.",2.0
"This is the kind of movie that would be compared to something like Chopper Chicks in Zombietown. It has all the laughs, some frights, but too funny to take seriously. That's the issue with Idle Hands. Devon Sawa doesn't take the fact that his parents are dead very emotionally, which is weird.
The only part of this movie I really hate is the ending. It completely stunk, and made me agree that it was only a two and a half star movie. There are a lot of people who still like this movie and I hink it's great. But to give this film three stars is silly.

"I read and heard amazing reviews for this movie, so I wanted to like this movie... I really did. The cast is amazing! However, I did not like it. Too predictable, cheesy, and the line that made cringe in my seat was when the son asks the mother if she can teach his dad how to tie the shoe laces like she does. It seemed like an insensitive line, like the boy had no feelings for his mother. And the ending was the worst... I don't know I just did not get on this bandwagon.",2.0
"I vividly remember seeing ""CE3K"" as a teenager and I especially remember the ads with the long stretch of highway and the ominous quote ""We are not alone!"". Seeing the film 25 years later makes me wonder what all the fuss was about. This has to be one of Steven Spielberg's most overated films. It resembles a tv mini-series, long and plodding, and follows a select group of characters and their experiences with UFO sightings and abductions. I'm all for character development but most of these characters get stale really quick and you just want them to get on with it! As with many early Spielberg films, there are lots of noisy, irritating kids and messy houses which are meant to represent suburbia. After a long hour and a half, these people finally make it to Devil's Tower, where the aliens arrive and communicate with humans. This sequence is still dazzling, but basically just amounts to a spectacular light and sound show. And, oh yes, that five note tone gets really irritating by the end of the movie!
I was disappointed with the quality of the dvd as well. There is a highly noticable ""shimmering"" in the interogation scene between Dreyfess and the government agents. Also, the night sky scenes looked uneven with streaks of gray overlapping the blacks. Many scenes were ""soft"" and uneven. The bonus disc, however, is very nice and contains great interviews and a documentary about the making of the film.",2.0
"I purchased CLOSE ENCOUNTERS when the DVD first went on sale and was very disappointed with the picture quality.  The night scenes - of which there are quite a few in this film - display very uneven levels of ""blackness"", resulting in a splotchy effect that is very distracting and detracts from the viewing experience.  Playing the same discs on a different DVD player and television produced the same results.  I can only assume that mine is not the only CLOSE ENCOUNTERS DVD with this flaw, and I am surprised that the quality control folks at Columbia Pictures did not catch this problem and correct it before shipping the product.  I contacted Columbia weeks ago, but have not received a reply.",2.0
"Yer another comedy flop. The film promises, but never quite delivers. Sure it's corny, hammy and dumb and for a while it's funny, but towards the end it just becomes stupid.

"this is a completely boring film and one of Spielberg's worst films. Usually his movies are fantastic, like Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, or even E.T., but this so damn slow and plodding! And this is coming from someone who loved Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey! Trust me, this movie is worthless, watch it only if you want to fall asleep in front of the TV.",2.0
"Depending on who you are, you will either enjoy this film or think it is rather stupid and insipid.  I happen to fall into the latter category, and  although I do believe there are good movies aimed at that particular  audience (teens) I don't feel this is it..  The writing is underdeveloped,  with a story that is, although has its moments, seems to be trying to hard  to be humourous while still maintaining its horror element - resulting in a  graphic gore element mixed with botched comedy.  This, like HALF BAKED,  seems to support dope smoking, although the interpretation can be that that  is the reason Anton's two friend's end up dead and he has a possessed hand  because he is lazy and is going no where with his life.  Yet this is  nullified when the kids still smoke it at the end, contributing the end to  `good marijuana'  The main character's name I figured was a nod to Anton  LaVey, who is the founder of the modern day Satanic church.  There is no  explanation given why Anton's two friends come back from the dead, other  than they just didn't want to go `toward the light'.  In a scene  reminiscent of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD they come out of the ground,  providing gross humour.  Like the horror genre it is more of a spoof of  than an actual example, there is nudity (two kids decide to fornicate and  are dressed in KISS costumes).
All in all, a bad movie that is aimed at  the teen-age genre with pointless drugs and a bad script.  I do like Seth  Green, however.  He is one of the few redeeming factors (that and the  movie's refusal to take itself seriously) in this B flick.",2.0
"I LOVE Spielberg, please don't get me wrong. I even kinda liked this movie when I first saw it all those many years ago. But we watched it with our kids (13 & 8) in the year 2000 and they hated it, and frankly, I dozed off myself. Science fiction is the hardest genre to keep fresh for generations, for obvious reasons, but some core elements of film-making never go out of style.
It feels so self-important and plodding. The pace is slow and the special effects no longer have the power to stun. And the movie doesn't really surprise.  There is no ultimate mystery to the plot.  Yes, one might wonder what the aliens are like, but we never doubt that they're there, that Dreyfuss will get to see them and that nothing bad will happen.  The movie never builds up any truly engrossing tension.  We feel safe throughout, and wouldn't you think that the world, getting ready to see aliens for the first time, would feel more frightened (and the viewer more frightened)?
It's fun to hear the ""alien theme"" music again, and Richard Dreyfuss is very good. But Francois Truffaut?? Why did Speilberg cast him?  He's usually so assured with his ununsual casting choices (Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams?  Great idea!  Roy Scheider in Jaws?  Oprah Winfrey in Color Purple?  He's so often gone with unknowns or unusual choices and we've usually been SO pleasantly surprised).
I don't want to dwell on this too much, but CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is a piece of movie history, but sadly, not a living, breathing one.",2.0
"How very strange...usually I'm the one giving great reviews for the things everyone else hates, but here...
The premise has some potential: A boy's hand is possessed and no longer obeys him. And the movie has much fun with  that, and I'm sure Devon Sawa had a lot of fun with his hand. But the movie  is really unimpressive. You have to wonder how much pot the *writer* was  actually on, because that's pretty much what the movie revolves around:  smoking lots of pot.
As in most movies, the requisite girl (played here  by Jessica Alba) has nothing better to do but to be a sexual object, and be  in danger. She is apparently a ""songwriter/musician"" but that's  just thrown in there for the hell of it and has no purpose whatsoever. In  fact, none of the female characters here are at all developed. The  ""evil-fighter"" just randomly appears. The other girl has no point  but to die. The movie is mindlessly gory.
I award the movie two stars for  having a message against laziness (which is overtly stated by Sawa), having  Seth Green, and being fun at some points.",2.0
"There is no excuse for the poor image quality and distorted sound track. Excessive noise in dark scenes was distracting to an otherwise superb film. Of the nearly 150 DVD's I have purchased from Amazon.com, this is the most disappointing. You may want to rent it before you buy.",2.0
"First of all let me just say that this movie has the worst anticlimatical ending of all time: there's no verbal or telepathic communications established with the aliens, no sense of what their intentions are, no reason mentioned for why they've abducted people, no reason to explain why Richard Dreyfuss' character is the ""chosen one"", and worst of all we (the audience) are left to believe that a stupid little hand gesture means that everything is all hunky-dory with the aliens- case closed, everything is all right with the aliens because Steven Spielberg says so. Don't worry about cattle mutilations or any of those other violent abductions you've been hearing about, everything's all fine and dandy.
The first half of the movie was good, but for some reason they decided to turn it into some watered-down, cheesy, leave-the-audience-feeling-secure kind of movie during the last half. Another reviewer mentioned the movie 2001 and compared it to Close Encounters, all I have to say is that they're completely different from each other- one has a philosophical message and one doesn't. Basically this movie is for those who wanna lie to themselves and say that there's nothing to worry about. 2001 is definitely the movie to see if your interested in aliens- im not saying it's real (who knows though?), but its sure more engaging than Close Encounters.",2.0

"Oh for Lord's sakes.  I can love a drama, but not when it hits all my hated M's -- Maudlin, Morose and Morbid. This overwraught sobfest features  Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts as mom and stepmom respectively, working  together to build a stable environment for the kids under trying  circumstances (illness, kids' hostility towards Julia, Julia's busy career,  a dad/husband who raises his voice, but can't lift a finger).

"This movie is not credible on a psychological level. Sam/Ben was too well-adjusted, too articulate, and too mature for his age. Any kid in real life would not be expected to abruptly pack his bag and leave his home behind. He would not have been able to psychologically heal--never mind forgive--his older brother. It would have taken years of therapy for the family to come together as a family. Basically, this is an escapist, feel-good movie with competent enough acting.",2.0

"Pfeiffer plays a mother who is devastated when her son goes AWOL in a crowd. Nine years later he returns - but is he her real son?

"The story begins with Beth Cappadora going to her High School Reunion in  Chicago.  For some reason, she brings all her kids and leaves her husband  behind.  However, a tragedy strikes when she leaves the older boy (Vincent)  to watch the younger one (Ben) and he goes missing.  He goes missing for 10  years.
Much of the movie involves the consequences of such an action  immediately after the abduction as well as the scars that it leaves even 10  years later.  Vincent, who is not like 17, has become a hardened teen,  partly because of his guilt for letting Ben go and partly because his  mother stopped doing her job as a parent for so many years.  The  wife/husband relationship is also strained but is on the mend as Ben (now  called Sam) comes back into their lives.
However, Ben/Sam is not happy  to be back.  He has been living a quiet, happy life with the only parent he  ever knew, his father.  To be stripped of his father because of something  the now deceased mother did is also a tragedy in itself.  Who are the  parents here?  The Cappadora who raised him to age 3 and are the biological  parents or George Karras who raised Ben/Sam for the remaining 10 years and  is the only parent that Ben/Sam ever knew?
Well these questions are not  really answered in this melodrama because Ben/Sam becomes less the focus of  the story.  Actually the director goes all over the place patching up story  leaks with quaint little fixes that are reminiscent of Sit coms.  I felt  this plotline belonged more on ""Growing Pains"" than on the silver  screen.  The worst part of the movie comes at the end when George suddenly  lets Ben/Sam go ""home"" and Ben/Sam suddenly feels that the  Cappadora's are his real family.  This is after Beth lets him go and  Vincent is a real jerk to him.  It is a cop-out ending IMO.
If you want  drama, there are others that are better than this formulaic  timewaster....Rating: C-",2.0
"Like far too many films these days, ""The Deep End of the Ocean"" begins promisingly then collapses midway under the crushing weight of heavyhanded plot mechanics, incredibility and sentimentality. The premise  of the story is so compelling that the audience can't help but be drawn  emotionally into the intense plight facing this family.
Michelle  Pfeiffer portrays a young photographer, living an idyllic life in Madison,  Wisconsin with a loving and devoted husband (Treat Williams) and three  adorable young children. While in Chicago for a class reunion, every  parent's ultimate nightmare becomes a reality: her middle child  unaccountably disappears in the middle of a crowded hotel lobby. These  scenes, in which she undergoes a sense of mounting panic as well as a  crushing sense of guilt and personal self-doubt, are more terrifying than  anything contained in a conventional ""horror"" film. We cringe too  as the investigators come up against one blank wall after another,  empathizing fully with a mother driven to desperation in the face of the  unspeakable.
As months pass, the family attempts to cope with the  horrific reality of their situation and the film promises to become an  insightful study of the effects of the loss, fear and guilt that  accompanies the disappearance of a child. But then the film goes agley as  it moves ahead a decade and the child is miraculously discovered living a  mere few blocks away, happily ensconced with a man first thought to be a  kidnapper then revealed as an innocent pawn in an abduction scheme gone  awry. As the child moves in with his ""true"" parents, the  screenplay settles into a bland T.V. movie formula, in which each character  must act out his or her customary little drama with little heed given to  believability or originality. Instead of exploring the various stages a  family goes through in the wake of a devastating loss, the film cheats us  by coming through with an unconvincingly upbeat resolution. It becomes  quite clear that the filmmakers are far more concerned with jerking out  tears than with providing a truly thoughtprovoking exploration of its  theme. This is a shame because the actors (especially Pfeiffer) handle  their roles admirably. Only Whoopi Goldberg, in a totally thankless role as  a compassionate investigator of missing children, seems hopelessly miscast.  This film might well have been a labor of love for her (and indeed for  everyone involved), but for the audience, it only makes one sigh over how  much better it might have been.",2.0
the cast in this movie is trying to make this movie dramatic and touching but is wasted with bad acting and cheesiness. Michelle Pfeiffer could have done a lot better. Whoopi Goldberg was kinda good in this,2.0

"Did not hate the movie, only reason did not give it one star. The story and idea of a movie coming to life and Danny Mannigan being part of his favorite character's movie is cool; something most of us could all probably relate to in some fashion or another. It's entertaining for what it's worth and plays on creative imagination, but I would not give this movie another shot. One and done is all it deserves I believe. Other than that,  super cheesy lines and kid Danny is a horrible actor that overshoots his reactions and facial expressions. I know the movie in the movie is intended to have bad puns as to give the viewers an idea of a good action/bad dialogue type movie, but even the whole movie overall contains some of the worst puns in the history of movies; and did Arnold really have to say ""I'll be back""? (More than once) Its as if though he is doing a cameo as Terminator....character within a character, within a movie thats within a movie. Too much! As long as you like Arnold, this movie is bearable and has a few laughs along with decent action. But I would not buy this movie because all it will probably be good for is collecting dust.",2.0
"""The Last Action Hero"" is a rare thing- an action comedy spoof that has difficulty remembering what it is supposed to be exactly. The action genre is certainly ripe for a mocking, what with the thousands of  ""Die Hard"" clones Hollywood has thrust upon the public. This  could have been the perfect spoof film- team ""Die Hard"" director  John McTiernan with The Terminator and let the jokes fly. But instead the  movie tries to be serious, then tries to make jokes about the genre, then  goes back to being serious again. The actors are making one kind of movie,  the directors are making another. It ends up a damn mess.
Aside from a  humorous bit with Arnold as Hamlet at the begining, this one is a real dog.",2.0
"Child actor Austin O'Brien steals scenes in THE LAST ACTION HERO, although his stand-out performance is not enough to make the film worthwhile.  Not that the filmmakers weren't trying to make a quality picture.  For effort,  THE LAST ACTION PICTURE tops a number of routine action flicks (COMMANDO,  ERASER) Arnold has made.  But by time the closing credits roll, THE LAST  ACTION HERO's slow moments outnumber its memorable ones.  Inspirational  line: ""It's what you make it.""",2.0
"My mother taped this wonderful holiday classic on VHS when it first aired on TV for me and my brother when we were little and every year around Christmas I would (and still do) watch this holiday classic with my family. So a couple years ago when I saw that they had finally put it on DVD I thought 'Alright it's finally on DVD!' but it was so expensive, even the VHS's were selling for 20 to 40 dollars. So one year after Thanksgiving I started calling every video rental store in town just to see if they had this movie for rent and only one store did. I was really excited about it at first but when I started watching it I noticed that some things were cut out from the movie. Like Fozzy's musical comedy bit with the snowman (It's a very noticeable jump), the muppet home movies (that whole scene was cut out). Miss Piggy musical bit when she finally makes it to the farm house, and a small scene is missing when they do their 'Carol sing'.

I'm glad I only rented it and spent 2 bucks rather then spending more buying it. All I can say is save your money, if you've seen the original 'uncut' version that was aired in the 80's this DVD is not for you.",2.0
"I have been waiting and watching for this TV special to be released in its full origional version forever (so it seems).  After nine years of waiting after the VHS version was released, it's not looking good.  However, I was smart enough to tape the first run on TV with my Sony Beta-Max, without commercials.  The cuts are a little ragged but to this day the quality is still as crisp and sharp as the day I taped it.  Even though I am an old f, (Ah, I ment Senior Citizen)it's still one of my favorite Christmas specials, one that puts our family in the ""holiday spirit"".  Like everyone else who remembers the full origional version, I hope that someday it is restored.  Still, the edited DVD version does pass along the ""flavor"" and ""spirit"" that is the Muppet's trademark. So all things considered it's better then nothing.",2.0

"Like everyone else, I am disappointed that there are parts missing from the video version of the show.  Luckily I was able to find the original one on Limewire and download it for free.  It's the one that is 587 MB.  Hope this can help some other people get the real version!!",2.0
"My husband recorded the Muppet Christmas from TV when the kids were little and we watched it every, single year. (Sometimes numerous times in one season, on car trips, at grandparents houses, etc.)  It was fun and very enjoyable since the Muppets have great kid appeal and we remembered watching the Muppets as kids.  Unfortunately, our old VHS tape, complete with commercials is worn out and we wanted a DVD version.  I purchased this last year and was tremendously disappointed to see that some of our ABSOLUTE FAVORITE quirky moments of the show were completely cut out and were not even in the extra features.  My favorite joke, ""It's Reindeer""... ""No, it's snow, darling!"" was cut out as well as the muppet baby film and some other really fantastic jokes and ridiculous slips on the icy patch.

If you've never watched this in any other form, you'll love it, it's still very cute and heart warming.  For those of us who know it by heart, it is a tremendous disappointment.",2.0
I'm glad to have read everyone's reviews that the DVD is not the original! I too had the original on tape (with the oldies commericals!) and the tape BROKE from watching it so much.  Now I'm out to find the ORIGINAL version as a gift to my sisters.  (...) Thank you!!!,2.0
"One has to wonder about the reasoning behind removing so much of this wonderful special's original material from this DVD release.  I have my original copy that I taped off of television way back in the mid 80's, and I'd rather watch THAT, fuzzy degrading, annoying Osh Kosh commercials, and all...at least it's INTACT.  Not only have several songs been removed, but the final pay-off to a VERY long running gag (the icy patch) ended up on the cutting room floor, as well, being that it was at the very end of Piggy's song (""Home for the Holidays"", cut out).  The editing is SO bad, you can actually TELL where things were removed.  Such a shame.  Here's hoping the matter can be settled, and a fully-restored version offered...though I wouldn't hold my breath.  After all, there are MANY more Muppet  television specials that have disappeared into the mists of time, as well.",2.0
"I cannot believe Henson Co. allowed a heavily edited version to go to DVD.  Usually a DVD has ADDED content. Not this one. Among other edits they removed an entire musical number(Sleigh Ride) which also has needed elements to advance the plot (Fozzy and Snowman).  Nowhere on the DVD are we warned that pieces of the original program are missing. By saying it is digitally Mastered it is misleads one to assume they are using the original Master tape.  Not so.  We were so excited to see this available on a clean DVD, so it is with great emotion that we were disapointed upon viewing.",2.0
"Really now...  When I heard that they were putting my FAVORITE Christmas film on DVD, I was so excited.  A Muppet Family Christmas is something I watch every December.  It's funny, sweet, and so entertaining.  But, unfortunetly, the version on this DVD is not the version I just praised.  There are massive edits that are very noticable to viewers who have watched it since it first aired on TV and may leave first time viewers confused.  Fozzie's duet with the Snowman is cut out, the Muppet Babies home video is cut out (leaving Doc with a very strange line that doesn't make sense) and in my opinion the best part, where Miss Piggy enters, sings her song and slips on the Icy Patch, is edited out.  The best Icy patch gag and it's left out of the DVD/VHS.

I am not going to buy this DVD.  Fortunately, my VHS tape still works well enough to watch it (yes with the OshGosh commercials and Double Mint Gum ones, too!).  Until they put the real complete version on the market, I will not spend my money on this DVD.",2.0
"This awesome made for TV movie has been shredded to pieces!  The once 50 min long show jam packed with Muppety action has a whole 8 min of beautiful songs and moments taken away.  I suggest not wasting your money on something that isn't complete.  I'd rather watch a crummy quality FULL version of this classic any day!  The fact that there are no extra features would be fine with me, as long as there was the Snow Man song with Fozzie, Miss Piggy's entrance song, Rowlf the Dog with his ""Outta tune piana..."" and the complete medley at the end of the movie!  If these scenes wer e included I would most definitely give the movie 5 stars, but without them it only deserves 2...",2.0
"The original version of this deserves a full 5 stars--it's warm, inviting, and incredibly fun with appearances from nearly every muppet created from Fraggles, Muppet Show and Sesame Street.  HOWEVER, this version only gets 1 star because whoever released this thing has edited a full 15 - 20 minutes out of it.  IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN EDITED! In comparison to the original, this version is too jumpy, leaves out entire character developments and funny scenes.  The original's pacing allows you to settle into the house with everyone and see how they mix.  The pacing of this video barely gives you the flavor.

"I Still Know I Did Jennifer Love Hewitt Last Summer.....oops that's not what it's called...my bad. Anyway after the first ended with Hewitt getting attacked by hook man she's back and I guess we're supposed to believe the end of it was just her dreaming. In this her and her victims....I mean friends go on a trip ""that she won on the radio"" to a tropical island. Of course it rains there the entire time. I guess that was hook man's plan, to get her on a spooky looking tropical island and he must control the weather too ""damn you hook man!"". Actually no, because of him making it rain, we get to see her in tight shirts in no bra in the rain yelling ""what are you waiting for!, what are you waiting for!, I need new lines!, I need new lines!"".

  Well guess I made it obvious that once they get their Hookie is there as well. He starts killing people...., including the nice drug dealer played by Jack Black. He gives his best performance ever!! Okay I'm just kidding, he's annoying. Since hookie wants Hewitt dead, it puts her friends in danger. Which pisses off Brandy's horny b/f played by Mekhi Phifer (E.R, 8-Mile) who's just on the island to do the nasty with her. While Freddie ""I act so bad even my show was canceled"" Prinze Jr. steals a boat to come to the rescue. Nope he doesn't rescue the movie with his acting abilities.. I actually found the movie to be a decent slasher flick. But the end is just awful and isn't needed. It should've just ended with Hookman realizing that Hewitt looked hot in a wet tight t-shirt and asking her to marry him. Instead he still wants to just kill her for being one of the people that threw him off a dock after hitting him with a car. You would think this guy would've just got a life by now.",2.0
"2.5 Stars If Possible

A year after the success of I Know What You Did Last Summer, JLH and FPJ are back in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.  The first installment has the advantages of a better cast, more character development, a mysterious feeling, and originality, thus making it an all-around better movie.  I Still Know isn't all bad, but it doesn't live up to the previous effort, which itself wasn't anything amazing.

The cast isn't quite as good this time around.  It still has Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prince Jr. (as Julie James and Ray Bronson, respectively) but since Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe were killed off in the first film, the secondary couple is replaced by Brandy Norwood and Mekhi Phifer, as Julie's best friend Karla Wilson and her boyfriend Tyrell.  There is little character development here.  I guess the writers just assumed everyone saw the first one and could figure out what was going on.

I Still Know takes place one year after I Know and two years after the night where the four teens accidentally killed a man.  Julie and Karla win a trip for four to an island in the Bahamas.  Julie sees strange things hinting that the killer is there, but nobody else does so she can't convince then.

The killer stalks the teens and other random, innocent people along the way, including tough bartender Nancy (Jennifer Esposito) and bound-to-die stoner Titus Telesco (Jack Black).  Once dead bodies start popping up, people start to believe that there's a killer on the loose.

After everything is seemingly settled, there is a little surprise at the end.  It nicely sets up for yet another sequel.  Nothing has been announced, but rumors for a trilogy have been speculated.

I didn't like how the sense of mystery as to who the killer is was gone, since it was revealed in the previous film.  However, there were some twists and turns thrown in (one in particular comes to mind) that make the movie more exciting.

I Still Know What You Did Last Summer was not as successful as it's predecessor.  This is understandable because, not only is it a sequel, but it simply isn't as good.  I would only recommend seeing this if you saw the first one and enjoyed it enough to sit through a something similar.",2.0
"This movie just didn't compare to the first, which remains one of my favorite suspense films.

While ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" was creative and innovative, ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" just rehashes tried and trite horror movie concepts.  (Namely, small group of people isolated in a remote location with no way of escape gradually gets killed off.)",2.0

Oh, and the best characters died in the first movie, so I was cheering him on the whole time, since I hate Julie and Ray. If you haven't seen this movie and you liked the first one, you might not want to see this atrocity because it might ruin IKWYDLS. And the ending is stupid in this movie.",2.0
"Two years have passed since Julie James was tortured by her fish-hook wielding nemesis, a victim of her friends' hit and run.  However, the body was never found.  Still living in fear, and in college, Julie is delighted when she and her friends win a holiday to the Bahamas in a radio competition.
Although I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is meant to be a revenge sequel- it seems to focus more on advertising on a holiday in the Bahamas.  By the end of the film, we are sick and tired of Julie's moaning and just want to see her get slashed and gashed!  Yet again, the film ends with sequel potential.
Question is- can we handle another Summer sequel?  Or is the series tired enough as it is?
I Still Know What You Did... still manages to get away with the usual horror sequel criticisms.  So hopefully, producers will prevent another sequel spawning unless they want the whole saga to become one big embarrassment.",2.0
"Julie James is back with Brandy, not the drink. They go on vacation to the Bahamas, but boo-hoo! It's raining over there. Throw in Jack Black as a Jamaican plant expert. Better.

He pulls a double shift on the lodge and the teenagers. A bartender lady is tough, whoa, and a sneaky bellboy who's 60 years-old, steals toothbrushes. Whatever. Guys will enjoy this if they like Hewitt. Overall, ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" is way too long of a title for me to type, funnier than the first, Julie looks healthy, and Jack Black was thrown into the mix! Decent, but still lacking any intelligence.",2.0

"This sequel, I Still Know What I Did Last Summer, is a stinker. Not that it doesn't have it's brainless appeal. It does. What makes the first film look like a classic, is that this film doesn't have the fun, cool set-up of the original. It had a creepy feel. This one just falls into typical Friday The 13th type 80's slasher feel in the second half. Not that that's bad. It can be fun. Just don't expect anything from it. Jennifer Love Hewitt is okay in this, but the appeal she had in the first isn't quite here in this one. She seems to be there just to have really hot shots of her body which, um, well, okay, that wasn't a bad thing. Brandy, on the other hand, was wasted. Why was she in this?. Why did she agree to do this?. Freddie Prinze Jr. was another one who was wasted. He got second billing but his part is much smaller than any of the other co-stars. What happened?. The fishermen killer himself was creepy in the first one. Not here. His creepiness was ruined because you see way too much of him in this film. That always hurts a film and character. The ending had another ""shock"" like the original. Nothing shocking about it. It was expected. You could tell. Let's hope Kevin Williamson comes back to give the third outing more of a hook. Pardon the pun.",2.0
"Although this movie isn't really worth the time to review one way or the other, I just have to point something out. If the killer in the first movie was mad about what they did ""last summer"", then by the time this movie happens, it's the summer before last that he was mad about. So it should be called ""I Still Know What You Did The Summer Before Last"". Or, if the killer is now mad about both summers, it should be ""I Know What You Did For The Past Two Summers"". Or, if the new killer is only mad about last summer, but indifferent to the previous summer, it should be called ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", just like the first movie. Or, to cover all the bases, maybe it should be, ""I Always Know What You Do In The Summer, And It Always Pisses Me Off"". Just a thought.",2.0

"Why do some directors and writers of horror movies think it's fair to completely annoy their audiences with these ambiguous endings, so that even though you may have enjoyed the movie, you hate the resolution!  It's such  a cop out.  It's like they're telling you, the third in the series is  coming out.  Unfortunately, this particular series should probably stop.  I  liked the first movie a lot; it was suspenseful, imaginative, and pretty  scary.  The acting was generally better too.  This time around, the acting  and script are pretty irritating.  First of all, anyone who knows their  geography will get a big clue early in the film.  Secondly, Freddie  Prinze's character is such a jerk in the beginning, you can't believe his  sudden transformation.  Third, I figured out the villain very early in the  film, so there was little suspense.  The acting overall is lame; Jennifer  Love Hewitt has decided to join Neve Campbell in the ""I'm only doing  this for the money, and I'm really wasting my time in this silly horror  movie.""  She does look a lot like Kate Jackson in this one, though.  Freddie Prinze is absolutely awful, completely unconvincing, and a pretty  shoddy hero, to boot.  The guy who plays Titus is an offensive,  stereotypical insult to intelligent viewers, providing none of the comic  relief the director obviously wanted.  Jeffrey Combs, who was so good in  the ""Reanimator"" movies looks as bored as Miss Hewitt, and does  nothing to pad his resume.  Three actors do manage to rise above their  material:  Jennifer Esposito as Nancy, the barmaid is very good; Brandy is  surprisingly effective as Julie's best friend, although her character does  become annoying and stupid; and Matthew Settle as the good-natured Bill is  very effective.  I still think Gorton's should sue for using their  fisherman image, but it is a horror movie.  That's what so sad.  It could  have been a lot better, but it's too predictable and a little too gory, as  well.  When all is said and done, ""Halloween"" and ""A  Nightmare on Elm Street"" (the first in the series) are still the  benchmarks for modern horror movies!",2.0
"This is a sequel to horror movie that wasn't even all that good (or all that scary).  This is a movie with possibly the worst ending a horror movie could have.  This is a movie with no suspennse, no surprises at the end.  This is a movie that's main characters are so uniteresting that you find  yourself hoping they'll get axed.  The most interesting character in the  whole film is the bartender at the hotel played by Jennifer Esposito.  Of  course Esposito gets little time in the film, being only a minor character.  This was not the worst movie I've seen, but it is definitely near the  bottom of the pile.",2.0
"When I saw ""I know what you did last summer"" at the theater I was hooked. When I heard there's gonna be a sequel, I was like ""Wow! Can't wait to see it"" It was a big dissapointment when I finaly saw  it. First of all it completely destroyed the brilliant ending of the first  part. I think it should have been better connected instead of just being  explained as a nightmare. The character of Julie James is still pretty  interesting but all of the new characters are pale  in comparison. There  are a lot of really gory sequences, which are fun to look at but there  isn't as much suspense as in the first.

The ending is a ridiculous repetition of the ending of the first one and I  hope this doesn't mean there's going to be another sequel.

"When I saw ""I know what you did last summer"" at the theater I was hooked. When I heard there's gonna be a sequel, I was like ""Wow!

"The only thing stopping this film from being downright awful is the solid  characters. It isn't that long, but it feels extremely drawn out, which  shows the suspense it is lacking. The plot is very flimsy-even for a horror  movie. After only the first 45 minutes I was asking my brother if it was  nearly done.
A positive is the characters. There interaction is the only  thing that interested me at all. Besides that, the way the director  constantly tried to lead you into beleiving something was going to happen,  then it not happening, then happening a couple of seconds later was  irritating and uneventful. Someone was trying too hard.
So, sadly, this  didn't make me jump or even bat an eye once. And then there is the white  guy who's acting like whats seems to be a Jamaican-and thats in the big,  bad stereotype way. Probably meant to be comic releif but you only end up  wanting him to be killed off so you don't have to suffer with him anymore.
I think I've ranted enough but last words: don't bye, rent. And even then  only if you're really bored.",2.0
"this has got to be the most pointless sequel ever made. I hated the fact that it completely ignored the ending of the original. the plot did not make sense and the ending was even more ridiculous than the entire movie. I  know what you did last summer was one of the few slasher films that could  have and should have stayed away from a sequel. I actually want a third in  the series to tie up all the loose ends and ridiculously bad ending in this  one. Not bad as a slasher pic, but pretty pointless sequel....",2.0
"I really liked the first film because it focused more on suspense than gore. With the sequel, suspense took a backseat. It was basically just hooks in the eyes, throat and chins, and no curiosity as to what might  happen next. Now don't get me wrong. I think Jennifer Love Hewitt is hot as  hell, but the filmmakers could've made it less cheesy if they didn't have  her running around in a wet t-shirt for the duration of the movie. It was  such a throwback to those 80's slasher films. Also, I knew right from the  beginning who the killer's accomplice was. Will Benson! That sounded a  little too much like Ben Willis. I knew originality wasn't in Hollywood's  dictionary, but they could've come up with a name that wasn't so obvious!",2.0
"Why am I reviewing this movie?  It's poorly written.  It's full of murders with no motive (which I hate in a slasher film -- if the killer kills someone, I want him to have a reason for killing that particular person).  It's overflowing with cliches (the obligatory scene in a sequel where the  survivor of the first film talks about the strange dreams she's having --  and whoa! She's in a dream!  What a surprise!).
So, I ask again, why am I  reviewing this dreadful film, which is not redeemed by numerous shots of  Jennifer Love Hewitt's ample bosom (I don't have to buy or rent this video  to see that; I can turn on the TV)?
Because it has a pretty cool twist  at the end.  No, it does not measure up to the twist of a great film like  ""The Sixth Sense"", but it does allow me to give this film two  stars rather than one.
But enough with the slasher films, Jennifer.  Your  former co-star, Neve Campbell, had better luck with ""Scream"" and  its sequel simply because the screenwriting was better.  It didn't mean  that you had to do films in the same genre, and it's time for you to move  on from them.",2.0

The whole end of the world thing reminds me of the ""Left Behind"" stuff from Protestant sects and how they take advantage of Revelations,the way God is portrayed as a Vengeful God A-la Old Testament,it seems to be like a typical Protestant taking advantage like they do with Sola Scripture. The movie itself is not bad nor does it seem to be blasphemous(I could be wrong),the acting and Jesus seems very intense,But nobody knows when the End of the world is they say not even the Son.",2.0
"Movie 6 of 1976 and 37 overall in my journey through films of my lifetime.

I have had my eyes on this one for years. In fact so many 70's films exceeded my expectations that I wanted to buy it before I started 1976 to ensure it didn't go under the radar. I'm not disappointed with ""Taxi Driver"" it is precisely what I expected. I think what happened is over the years no one could give me a good reason to watch it. They just said it was great. All the effusive accolades amounted to vapid emotion to me. I want well thought out reasons why a movie is supposed to be good. I don't care who's in it, who directed it, or likes it, no movie gets a pass. If you aren't good then I'm going to say so and ""Taxi Driver"" is not good. It's boring and unfocused.
First and foremost was the daunting burden of having to listen to that droning music for two hours. I don't care if the point was to task us with the mind set of Bickle or not that was just atrocious! It was the musical equivalent to having a pebble stuck in your shoe as you walk: it's there nagging you about how crappy it is and you can't get rid of it and it does nothing other than be crappy and annoying. Completely ruined the movie for me. Now according to the composer it was a reflection of the main character's thoughts and mind set. Well there is an evolution of thought so why did the music remain static? I don't care about the great movies Herrmann had done before,  he did an awful job. It lacked creativity to me. I know the guy is in a cab all night long,  alone, night after night, so what? Is that worthy of any music that would reflect it? How about music that hints at the tedium without being tedious? I understand that Scorsese could have perhaps chosen other songs, I don't really care, just a mess in my opinion.
""Taxi Driver"" lacked focus. There was an interesting glimmer of thought where Bickle would judge those who might have been upstanding (Shepard) and worked to redeem those whom might have been considered ""scum."" I also liked the idea that there is a thin line between hero and villain that plays out. It was just too long of a meandering journey to get there.
One of Scorsese's biggest strengths needs to be tempered. He is incredibly aware of the camera's effect on the audience. The way we see only DeNiro's torso then the camera springs up suddenly to his head to reveal his Mohawk was jarring and very well done. The violence at the end was incredibly effective, I was jaw dropped. It couldn't save the story for me though and I wondered if this was a crutch for an otherwise bland ending. I do think the theme of hero/villain was movie worthy, that is to say there was a good point to the story but it just wasn't enough for me.
In the end I think ""Taxi Driver"" was just overrated as far as I'm concerned.

Pros
-DeNiro is great
-Foster's story line is interesting and compelling
-theme has weight
-Superb camera work
Cons
-boring mainly due to the music",2.0

"Ahh, ""Iron Eagle"".  A classic of the 1980's Golan-Globus production mill.  With the current spate of historic/""current"" military movies, it's sometimes good to see how Hollywood's come in trying to get the details right.  One can't do much better than using this flick as a baseline.  In case you aren't already familiar with this gem, Louis Gosset Jr. playing a reserve Air Force Colonel, and a teenage kid fly a mission inside an unnamed Arab country -OK I'll name it:  Libya- to rescue the kid's dad.  Pop gets shot-down when he's intercepted in international waters, but the US refuses to do anything more than diplomatic pressure.

The kid and Lou Gosset meet up when the kid's challenged to race the local bully with his PLANE while the bully's using his dirt bike.  Suffice it to say he wins and impresses his babe; he doesn't get his slot at the USAF Academy, though. You gotta take the bad with good I guess.  When the words on Dad get back to the family, this kid uses his base ""network"" to get access to imagery, enemy air defense data, and two F16s carrying a B52's worth of ordinance.  All of this being done by his friends exploiting the dim bulbs who are their parents, no less.  (If only strike planning was this easy.)  Of course, the kid has flown training missions with his dad, and has a boatload of simulator time, so he's a natural to fly the mission.  He convinces Gosset to go along with him, and his two-ship is on the way.  The flying scenes are nothing spectacular, with obviously Israeli F16s playing the good guys, and Kfirs (modified Mirages) acting as MiGs.  Cockpit scenes are completely the imagination of the set designer; I'm guessing he never was anywhere near a real aircraft.  These are especially dated now as many computer flight sims are pretty darn accurate in cockpit, flight, and combat models.  Anyway, lots of explosions on the way in, Lou gets hit and aborts and our hero must press on alone-go figure.  He manages to talk with the evil dictator directly and get his dad on the runway for him to land (!) and pick him up.  More silliness ensues as he launches weapons on the ground, taxi's out and takesoff.  He kills the bad guy and heads home to find Lou punched out and was rescued.  Rather than the prison sentence for espionage, and theft of government property that Lou, the kid, his pals and the idiots they exploited on base should've got, he gets his slot at the Air Force Academy.  The end.

Overall, I guess Lou's performance was fairly good, but everyone else performed at the grade-B level this flick is.  Note especially a very young Shawnee Smith as one of the kid's buds.  Worth seeing for laughs, and as a film version of a kid's pilot fantasy.",2.0
"I bought this 11 years ago from Amazon apparently. I may have watched it once or twice since then though i am not sure. But watching it 2/14/16, it begins with a  bunch of oriental characters (meaning letters).  I think it is not first quality-many scenes are much darker than I remember.  I am watching it while riding an exercise bike-so I AM FOCUSED ON THE MOVIE if you get my meaning.  Is it some cheap foreign copy? Or am I just older and judgmental? Could be some of both of both, but I am believing the oriental characters are giving a big hint tat it is not just me.  Love Oriental calligraphy BTW>",2.0

"Bottle Rocket is a 1996 film starring a young Owen Wilson alongside his brother Luke Wilson.  It's possibly worth checking out for that fact alone, Owen especially looks different to his later self in movies, you've likely have seen.  The film was written by Owen along with Wes Anderson.  There isn't really much of a storyline though, basically the two brothers play best (or only) friends, Luke's character has been in a mental hospital, but he's clearly the more level headed of the two.  Owen's character wants to impress his former boss (James Caan, who he doesn't mention at first employed him as a landscaper), by robbing a from what I could tell public library.  There's no ingenious plan or anything, it just happens at one point in the film, and it's not that exciting.  Their getaway driver a rich kid, is constantly being bullied and beat up by his older brother.  They decide to lay low at a cheap isolated motor inn where their driver leaves to deal with his brother's demands.  So hence they are stuck there.  Luke's character becomes infatuated with a housekeeping woman who doesn't speak English, the only language he does while Owen's just sets off fire works and mopes around the place.  There's plenty of opportunities for humour with all the above scenarios but for some reason they didn't go there. In fact there really aren't any laughs in the film at all, the characters all act oddly the whole film but that's it, and that just makes the movie seem unrealistic.

If you're a huge Wes Anderson, or of either of the Owen brothers you might want to check Bottle Rocket out just so you can say you've seen everything they've been in/written, but if you're not, you're probably only going to be disappointed.  This is a pretty slow, boring and pointless film.  Could even have been something they were making for a university class or something.",2.0

"I recently re-viewed Taxi Driver to see if it might make a better impression than 30 years ago.  It didn't.  Scorcese's confounding lack of character development, a gratuitous and underdeveloped plot, grimy violence, and lurid musical score contribute to a sludgy mess that gained accolades over the years primarily due to its cutting edge approach to the subject matter.  Well, it's no longer 1976, and the decades gone by have not been kind to the film.

Truly great films transcend the times in which they were made, and Taxi Driver, with its mannered and one dimensional performances, suffers from a lack of emotional credibility.  We never witness Bickle's motivations or demons, instead viewing him as a two dimensional, socially inept caricature who can't handle male-female interaction. Then, almost spontaneously he obsesses on making a violent ""big statement"".  The dialog and plotting provides little insight into this tormented man's inner voices- Is he suffering PTSD? Is he the product of a terrible home situation? Where do the violent and anti-social tendencies come from? What are Bickle's primary motivations?

I'm incredulous as to how Taxi Driver has sustained its aura after all these years when it basically plays out like a low budget, violent melodrama with a tawdry and frankly unbelievable conclusion. If it wasn't for Jodie Foster's amazing portrayal of the world weary teenage prostitute, there'd be little reason to watch the film other than for curiosity's sake.",2.0

"As usual, I do not write my reviews to get agreement since 95% or more of the population does NOT know what is good from bad, pearl to a swine.

You know how you watch old movies and now, even when you watch them again, you still tend to rate them high due to memories of watching them when you were younger and feeling the obligation to remain faithful to how you felt?

That's how this movie is. It's an oldie with good acting and whatnot, but I did not enjoy it very much because of the following reasons:

SPOILER ALERT!!!
INTENDED MAINLY FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE WATCHED THE MOVIE OR PEOPLE THAT DON'T GIVE A BLANK.

In no specific order:

1. The guy gets ready and does all this training to, in the end, kill 3 or 4 low life losers, some of which were not armed and even tried not to provoke him? The basically provoked them and acted like some sort of tough guy. The whole movie sets you up, making you sort of think that he was going after big game aka the possible presidential candidate when the whole time, after all the training he's done....he took out 3 low-life's, which by the way sucks and made the ending really disappointing. It's like the whole plot revolves around the end where he kills those guys.

2. He goes and kills those guys and he's declared a hero without going to jail? Was that how it is back then? You go out and you kill bad guys and you not only DON'T go to jail....but treated as a hero? Doesn't make much sense to me, either that or times sure have changed. What he did was basically premeditated murder or mass murder.

3. The movie doesn't really make clear who the main character plans to take out and the main character never seems to do much research or investigation into his mastermind scheme....which I really felt to be completely coincidental due to that fact. So basically that part of the plot goes like this: He talks about how he dislikes the scums and low-life's of the city aka drug dealers, prostitution, etc etc. Then he trains with a few guns that he bought, then one day he just decides okay it's time to do it. Then he goes and kills three criminals. Again I bring up that he does not do any research into these guys or the movie never shows him do enough research to justify his final scenes. You're left confused till the very end and it's not a clever setup either.

4. There was a lot of useless scenes that did not assist with the ending scene. Scenes like:
a) He fell in love with this blond, which dumped him.
b) His hatred for the geek that keeps following the blond.
c) The scenes with the other cab drivers, never really builds a relationship with them much and they do nothing to the story except make it longer.
d) Scenes of him training, did he REALLLLLLY need to train to kill 3 guys???? Thought he was going to take out an army or something, totally anti-climatic.
e) Most of the cab scenes, read the following below.

5. The movie, I felt, did not efficiently utilize and implicate his role as a taxi driver. Why do I feel this way? Because whatever he did and whatever he felt and whatever he knew, could have been done, felt, or known even without being a Taxi Driver. Let's go deeper. He drives around and notices all this crap in the street which makes him dislike the city more and wants to do something about it. You don't need to be in a taxi to feel this way or find out about this. A better way to implicate his role as a taxi driver to further help the plot of the story would be him spying on bad guys or getting important information as a taxi driver, using his taxi driving identity to somehow sneak into certain places and acting as a spy, etc.

Thinking back on that movie, the only spying he really did was probably with the presidential candidate that coincidentally got into his cab and talking to him, but even that I felt was useless. And this scene alone confuses the plot, not help clarifies anything. He knows nothing of the guy, how can he be a supporter?

So what? He feels sorry for one prostitute and helps her get free and he's a hero? What the heck? What about those other hundreds or thousands of other prostitutes? It's like if I went out and adopted a single cat at the pound and ran around calling myself a savior. CRAP!!

The acting was good, but the movie, IMO, is not that great. It was probably a good oldie, but a present day analysis makes the movie not so good at all.",2.0
"Other reviewers compared this movie with Rushmore and Kevin Smith's work (Clerks, Chasing Amy, Dogma, etc). Those are some of my favorite movies so I figured I would like this one as well. I didn't, and it took me a while to figure out why. They're all quirky, all dialog heavy, all off-beat. So what's wrong with Bottle Rocket? In the other movies, the main characters are more intelligent than everybody else. That is not the case in Bottle Rocket. All the main characters are unbelievably boneheaded. I had high hopes, and just couldn't get myself to care about the characters. In a movie like this, if you don't care about the characters, there's nothing left. Lots of people loved it. Maybe you will too. I couldn't get into it.",2.0
"Not that Crime and Punishment was happy but the film and the book are undeniably similar. From the isolation felt by the protagonists, to the heroic child prostitutes.

 The film is compelling there is no doubt of that but is that a good thing? With a book like Crime and Punishment where the character murders, the author at least shows the consequences of such a deed both inwardly and in the world.

 With Taxi Driver the climax is the violence, it is the insanity. An insane man saying 'you talking to me' is cool and funny. Travis is the hero, an insane man who murders and tries to assasinate people is looked up to and idolized. Thats a hallmark of Scorcese films and why I don't like a lot of his work. He shows the seductiveness and romanticism of satanic actions and people, but brings too much sympathy to them, too much idolization. Instead of showing the real consequences of these dark impulses, Scorsese seems to be infatuated with them and splashes them pornographically across the screen for his own amusement.

 This film is seductive yes, but certainly unhealthy.",2.0
"Didn't see this movie back in the 70's, and never intended to until I recognized that a lot of Amazon reviewers compared ""One Hour Photo"" (a film I thought was excellent) with ""Taxi Driver"". So I relented and eagerly viewed the DVD, only to berate myself for having been duped.

Briefly - ""Taxi Driver"" is the story of Travis Bickle, an ex-Marine turned NYC cab driver; a young man who ""means well"" but is a macho character with s*** for brains (kind of like the creators of this movie, I'm sorry to say). Anyone who hasn't sense enough not to take a woman to a smutty movie loses my interest and sympathy pretty quickly. Bickle is his own worst enemy; he doesn't have the patience or wherewithal to apply himself to get educated, etc. to make life better for himself and others. He just wants life to improve, NOW! OK, sure. So he instigates some bloodshed and death, and somehow sometime winds up a sort-of hero. HUH?

I tried to get some insight on the HUH? part by viewing the ""documentary"" section of the DVD, but I just couldn't muddle all the way through it. It was full of nothing but ego-driven minutiae; details about stuff no sane person would care about (yawn), so I gave up and will happily dispatch the DVD back to the Public Library today and wash my hands of it. The End.

PS What WAS interesting however, is the fact that this movie was made back when parts of NYC were so blighted that one could buy a Park Avenue co-op for the price (in today's $$$) of a used car. One of my relations did just that.",2.0
"Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a porno-loving, taxi driving, pie eating, Vietnam veteran that is slowly revealed to be completely out of his mind.

De Niro seems to be fairly sane at the beginning of this movie, but slowly (and I do mean slowly) his sanity gives way. Apparently he cannot stand the lack of morality and sleaze that he incounters every night, and eventually he snaps.

I personally did not care for this movie, but to each his own.

On a scale of 1 to 10

Violence-2/10

(There is some, but it falls short of the build up the movie creates)

Musical Score-0/10

(Absolutly Dreadful ragtime/blues/jazz soundtrack!)

Acting-6/10

(De Niro was good, but other acting was forced:ie. 13-year-old Jodie Foster acting like a prostitute was lacking)

Story-5/10

Overall-3.5/10",2.0
"After reading and hearing so many good things about this film I was sure it would be a great movie, especially because DeNiros in it. Unfortunatly I ended up being very wrong. The whole movie seemed like it was just a bunch of random junk to make it longer. The so called climax also left much do be desired. Bodies fell in some very cheap slow motion effect, and the whole scene seemed to end very quickly. It left me saying ""I watched all of that  for this?""

"I grew up on horror films in the 80's, and evaluating them now has proven to be a bit of a mixed bag. Some, like Nightmare on Elm Street, are every bit as gripping and fascinating as I remember them. Some, however, have suffered in the interim.
Fright Night is still a fun movie, overall, but it has not dated very well. The music, the look of it, is all very very 80's. The effects are good, but nothing spectacularly better then other films of the time. And none of the actors are putting their best foot forward. Roddy McDowell and another actor share a scene near the end that does manage to capture some real pathos, but other then that it's all too campy, with writing and plot that doesn't support that choice. Camp acting in a dark and serious plot is just not a good mix.",2.0
"I am amazed that this film gets so many positive reviews. I love horror films, and I want them to be scary, frightening, etc. I'm not a big fan of the horror comedy genre. There are a few good ones. But, this is not one of them. This is simply a bad comedy, and there are no real jokes here -- just kind of ""stupid comedy"": the characters constantly simply act stupidly, and that is supposed to be funny. There is nothing clever here. There is no believable character, with the exception of Roddy MacDowell. He is the one saving grace, and his professional acting ability shines way above the rest. He is playing a comically ""reluctant"" vampire killer, who doesn't really believe in vampires but plays a vampire killer in his films and on TV. Now he has to actually kill a vampire, after he finally comes to believe they are real. Thankfully, Roddy MacDowall is in this film. But the plot, the other actors, the ""jokes"" are really bad. The special effects are mostly consisting of ""melting faces"", and were done on the cheap. Good special effects for the time and for a low budget -- but, not very good for scaring the audience. At the time this was made (1985) perhaps it deserved good reviews as a send-up of horror films. But, it really does not stand the test of time, in my opinion.

There is a remake (2011) that actually is fairly good.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fright-Night/dp/B003Y5H5FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fright Night</a>.

"Rich snot has unbelievably understanding and cool parents that he pisses on and doesn't appreciate. Goes on about what it is to be punk.

Some of the story arcs are so stupid they can be passed off as comedy, such as the decently large part where they drive across state lines to buy stronger beer because Salt Lake City is a dry city that only sells low percent, riveting.

Poor representation of what punk culture is and what it was like during the 80's. The dialog isn't great, the characters are forgettable except for Heroin Bob, the narration done by the main character sounds like he's talking to a group of 8 year olds, it's historically inaccurate, the sound track is ok but is riddled with cliche bands and their most well known songs (nothing that isn't entry level), Tries to be intellectual but creates a flawed philosophy for the mentality that is punk. I know a lot of people who like this movie, but they are also people who aren't critical thinkers and don't really think for themselves. Watch Suburbia instead.",2.0

Its a very outsider look at punk culture, regardless of what the director would have you believe on the commentary.  My criticism isn't even so much that I disagree with the film's message (I'm not THAT unfair).  What we have here, quite simply, is a very poorly made film.  Everywhere you look there are lights and microphones in the shot, the characters are very poorly drawn, there is no shortage of pretentious dialogue that sounds like it was written by some depressed kid in high school, and the acting is UNBELIEVABLY bad(excepting a few bit parts).  I realize that the film is done with a ""punk"" ideology in mind, but if that were the case, the director/writer obviously knows nothing about the punk scene, other than the fact that its vapid and lame.

"After fighting her way through the tunnels of the Umbrella Corporation's Hive, Alice finds herself in the middle of Raccoon City's zombie outbreak!

I binged on the Resident Evil films this weekend and while the series is strong this one is fairly weak.  It marks a transition from an older style with practical special effects and conventional film making to the more stylized films that followed.  And the result is, even though this film is from 2004, it often feels like a low-middle budget films from the 80s.  The zombies are just extras with dirt smeared on them walking slowly.  The final monster looks and moves like a guy in a rubber suit.  The secondary characters are one dimensional 'jive talking black dude', 'tough chick' etc.

It's OK as part of the series but not as tense as the first film nor as over-the-top as the later ones.

I'd recommend instead seeking out the 5 film boxed set, this is much more acceptable as part of a longer series.

Meh.,2.0
"As it is the case with most sequels, this second instalment of ""Resident Evil"" franchise is significantly inferior to the first film. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILLERS.

This film begins 30 days after the contamination of the Hive described in the first ""Resident Evil"" movie. In opening scenes the Umbrella Corporation attempts to unseal the Hive in order to eliminate its undesirable occupants and reclaim this huge, precious facility. It is suggested that this attempt doesn't go very well... Some days later Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in an abandoned hospital in Raccoon City, naked, bruised and unable to remember jack... And then the film really begins.

The biggest problem with this film is that there is virtually no scenario, just a succession of shootouts and running. There is hardly any dialogs which would merit to be remembered, the sense of humour seems to have been completely eaten by zombies, most of decisions taken by people (both villains and good guys) doesn't make the slightest sense and let's not even talk about character development...

Milla Jovovich was asked to play here just a standard issue superhuman shooting machine and was clearly forbidden by the director to do and say anything else than shooting - and her two principal sidekicks, with whom she joins ultimately after more than 40 minutes (!) of film are even worse!

Sienna Guillory plays Jill Valentine, a police officer belonging to the Special Tactics And Rescue Squad (S.T.A.R.S.) who has the habit of coming to work dressed as a streetwalker and greatly praised may she be for that, because this firmer model is a supremely beautiful woman with such a figure, that Phidias and Praxiteles would KILL for the privilege of sculpting her (in more sense than one...). BUT, an actress she is REALLY not and even saying two lines of dialog is for her clearly an effort... And as for her character being an action hero, well, let's just say that she cannot even hold correctly the prop gun they gave her, because this thing clearly scares her...

Oded Fehr plays Carlos Oliveira, a mercenary from Umbrella Corporation private army - but being a simple soldier, he is completely unaware of all the evil plans of his bosses and in this film he actually is one of the good guys. Oded Fehr, who usually plays Bedouin holy warriors, demons from Hell or Arab terrorists, has of course all the necessary competence and physical attributes to make an awesome, legendary, bad@ss mercenary - but he is not really allowed in this film to do much. His character is just a subdued sidekick of Alice...

Another big issue with this film, that everything is centred around Alice and it really is hard to understand why is she SOOO important? Alice! Who the (----) is Alice!? But even worse, Alice enters the movie for real only after 40 minutes and in the meantime nothing really very important happens...

The second part of the film (once Alice appears) is slightly better than the completely useless first 40 minutes, but the operative word here is ""slightly"". There is a couple of good action scenes, but they are few and short. Of course, between those good action scenes quite a lot of munitions gets expended but mostly it is just a shooting of various fish in the barrels.

There is one sequence, involving an elementary school, which is not bad and will certainly delight all those who simply hate kids and puppies. It also makes sense that in the middle of an anthropophagic zombie infestation an elementary school is a particularly dangerous place, because playful kids need hearty balanced meals on a regular basis...))) On another hand the director couldn't follow this idea until its logical conclusion, because then this film would probably be banned in most countries...

The ending logically opens the way for the next film in the franchise and ask again the same question: Alice! Who the (----) is Alice?

Bottom line, this film is really not good and I managed to suffer through it all the way until the end only with some fast forwarding here and there (especially during all the one sided shootouts). This DVD is definitely NOT a keeper. Avoid!",2.0
"Not quite bad enough to be funny, but close.

Pretty much nothing in the story makes sense, no-one behaves in a remotely believable way. (People line up peacefully to get let out of a city, with cannibal zombies behind them? People aren't even that polite on the subway).

"Unethical film producers, actors, director, Oliver Stone et al: Midnight Express ""uses"" (as a drugie would) a ""true"" situation or story to tell whatever lies they want to.  I watched this with my male friend and at the end we both turned to each other and said, ""Never go to Turkey.""  Others have said, ""Never smuggle drugs in Turkey.""  The movie failed to make a legitimate point, or explore a theme.  It exploited drugs, violence, and sex.  It simple took pleasure in machismo -- whether hetero or homo machismo.  IT FAILED TO EXPLORE THE TRULY HUMAN.

I had hope when I saw the father come to visit the son -- as in the movie ""In the Name of the Father"" a 5 star movie about prison, cross-cultural (Irish-English) life.  But when I saw the father shout threats at the prison warden for no other reasons than sheer anger-indulgence, I realized this movie was probably bankrupt.  The movie reflects immaturity and failure to develop a controlling vision.  There were SO many wonderful ways this material could have gone.  The creative potential was enormous.  The 70's macho culture could only see this?  Slaves to their narrow world view.

The only thing good:  the cinematography, and evocative music and some of the nonviolent prison scenarios.  I was reminded of Dante's circles of hell.  Then a little research was in order.  I was thinking of Turkey's struggles between secular democracy (Ataturk's reforms) and its Medieval past.  There were clearly two power structures and judges (the secular and the religious?) struggling for dominance.  I was thinking of the issue of individual justice and the needs of society to make an example of Billy etc etc etc...But director and producers did nothing to develop any ideas.  I have so many ideas about how this material could have been developed....  it is frustrating to see that too often this type of junk wins out.

I don't trust Oliver Stones movies about ""real life.""  That is a joke.  Real life is more interesting and rich and meaningful than what he ""created"" -- here at least.

Go to YouTube and get the backstory on this movie. That is far more interesting.  Billy is kind of despicable, but if they had honestly told his story, perhaps tweaking it here and there...the movie would have been much better.  Billy claims the experience was the best thing that happened to him!!  Why didn't they run with that?  These guys failed to go deep into the human condition, instead they got hung up on violence and sex and machismo.  Not to mention that Turkey's tourist industry has never recovered -- apparently because of this film.",2.0
"Resident Evil is meant to be a video game series and *not* a movie series.  Simple as that.  Why?  Because the movie writers made Apocalypse nothing more than a generic run of the mill zombie flick, and a rather average one at that.

They bring in Nemesis, what I consider the ULTIMATE bad guy in the classic Resident Evil 3 game.  While extremely dangerous and intimidating in the video game, he does nothing but plod along in a slow moving way in the movie.  He's still relatively cool I suppose, with the ability to detect those who are armed and pose a threat to him which is a fascinating feature, and of course, his trusty rocket launcher is as explosive in the movie as it is in the game (of course it is- Hollywood can smell a perfect opportunity for special effects and the rocket launcher surely satisfies in that regard).  However, in the game (as Jill) you had to REALLY move your legs as quickly as possible or you'd get caught.  He's not fast enough in the movie so everyone can easily run away from him.  Cool looking, but lacking speed.  This is a vital and distinct feature that's missing.

I'm also not particularly fond of the fact that Jill Valentine takes a back seat so the always attractive Milla Jovovich can shine in the spotlight.  Throughout the film Jill basically sticks behind Milla's character so Milla can take care of all the approaching danger.  Meh, Jill deserves better in my opinion.  Also, it seems strange that Raccoon City is so enormous.  Don't get me wrong, it's a big city in the video game series so this makes total sense, it's just that it's hard to believe (without spoiling the ending in both the movie *and* video game) such a big city would be considered irrelevant when you-know-what happens at the end.  Not a good storyline direction for a movie.

There's nothing remotely scary about this movie.  Apocalypse is not going to appeal to Resident Evil 2 survival horror fans, that's for sure.  All kinds of adrenaline pumping shooting action aroung every corner with several Resident Evil 4-style athletic kicks and jumps is what you can expect instead.  I say avoid this movie and stick with the gaming series.",2.0

"I hate all the reviewers and critics who say that ""fans of the video game are going to love this movie."" These critics normally aren't gamers or fans of the source material, so how can they be an adequate judge of the tastes of gamers? I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil game franchise, the very person these critics believe that will enjoy the Resident Evil films. But I DESPISE these movies. And why, do you ask? Because they really aren't much like the games at all. Oh sure, there's a mansion, zombies, zombie dogs, a ""Licker"" creature, and the malignant Umbrella corporation. But aside from those aesthetical similarities, the film bears little resemblance to the games.

When preproduction of the first Resident Evil film began, the legendary George Romero, whose Dead franchise was a major inspiration for the Resident Evil games, was commissioned to write a script. His script shared many similarities to the game, such as the inclusion of characters like Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, and Albert Wesker. However, it also made changes to the story that game developers Capcom didn't like, and Romero was ultimately turned down. Instead, they hired Paul WS Anderson, director of Event Horizon and another video game movie, Mortal Kombat. His treatment was more like a prequel to the games, and this approach was more acceptable to Capcom's head honchos. Anderson's treatment was greenlit, and ""Resident Evil: Ground Zero"" went into production (the ""Ground Zero"" subtitle was abandoned after the events of September 11th).

The film begins in The Hive, a massive laboratory facility beneath Raccoon City. The mutagenic T-Virus is being tested in the labs, but someone releases the virus, infecting the hundreds of scientists within the facility. Sensing the outbreak, The Hive's security system, the artifically-intelligent Red Queen, locks down the facility and douses everyone in halon to further prevent their escape.

We switch to Alice (Milla Jovovich), who awakens in an empty mansion after passing out in the shower. Her collapse has has given her amnesia, a condition that becomes ever more frightening when a team of nameless Special Ops soldiers (see: fodder) employed by Umbrella storms the mansion. Turns out that the mansion serves as a secret entrance to The Hive, and the team has been sent to infiltrate The Hive and investigate its lockdown. The team directs Alice down into the bowels of the facility to assist with the task. Why they can't determine the nature of the lockdown from the outside is beyond me, since that would be a much more logical thing to do. And why can't they just trust the security system they created and leave The Hive locked down, rather than endangering the lives of an entire Special Ops team and potentially the lives of everyone on the outside by reopening the Hive? But as you're going to find out while watching the Resident Evil films, logic does not exist in this dojo.

Anyway, Alice and the team discover that the T-Virus has turned everyone in The Hive into flesh-eating zombies, and they must get out of the facility before it is sealed up  permanently. But seeing the risk of letting them leave, the Red Queen isn't going to make it easy for them.

The Resident Evil games excel at creating a dark, suspenseful atmosphere, where you don't know what horrors are literally waiting around the corner. The main characters are given little ammunition to fend off the hordes of zombies and creatures salivating for their flesh, perpetuating a sense of doom and dread since the player must be methodical and conservative with their weapons. Writer/director Anderson attempts to establish a suspenseful mood by not even introducing the zombies until about halfway through the film. But sadly, all attepted suspense is lost once the flesheaters appear and the Covert Ops team whip out their big machine guns and blast away at them. The film becomes less about mood and scares and more about action and gunfire.

The emphasis on action increases once Alice begins regaining her memory, suddenly remembering that she is a martial arts expert who can run along walls, do flying kicks, and break necks with her thighs. It feels like her sparring partner was Trinity in The Matrix.

In fact, the film cribs a lot of elements from The Matrix Bargain Bin, such as references to Alice in Wonderland (Alice, the Red Queen, the entrance to The Hive is a mirror), wire-fu, slow-motion bullets, and a lead character who suddenly discovers that they have incredible abilities. The film also seems to ""borrow"" elements from other genre films like Cube and Day of the Dead, though it's hard to criticize the game for using elements of Romero's zombie films since the games themselves are inspired by them.

The film also possess a chugging, screeching metal/electronica score composed by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson. No, I'm not kidding. Shock rocker Marilyn Manson assisted in the creation of the film's score. It's actually quite good, even if the combination of the crunching electronic guitars, pounding drum machines, and heavy gunfire could give you a headache by the end of the film.

This film is ""meh"". It isn't great, it isn't good, it isn't god-awful. It's quite derivative of other films it shouldn't be, and it lacks the elements that make the game so great. The acting is...well...there. It's also hard to care about characters who don't even have names. The only reason we know that Milla Jovovich's character is named Alice is because it's in the end credits. Characters are almost never addressed by their names during the film. So you feel almost completely indifferent when half the cast is killed off fairly early in the film. They all feel like nameless, faceless fodder, as bad as any cast of horny teens in any random 80's slasher film.

The highlights? The score and the rather humorous audio commentary of Anderson, Jovovich, producer Jeremy Bolt, and castmate Michelle Rodriguez. Jovovich sounds like she's in full ""valley girl"" mode here, and they joke about everything from Milla's gas (a little T.M.I. if you ask me), their time spent in a German nightclub (the film was shot mostly in Berlin), and cast member Eric Mabius' affinity for yogurt. But it says a lot about a film when one of the major highlights of the film is its audio commentary. After all, you don't watch Mystery Science Theater 3000 because the movies they're riffing on are great.",2.0
"As far as action flicks go, this one is decent.  It isn't anything spectacular, but it has ample amounts of blood and guts (the cube scene alone is a highlight) and some adrenaline pumping music to make the `zombie killing' entertaining.  In the end the film comes off feeling rather cheap, but it isn't a complete disaster.

Still, having been a fan of the videogames, I must say that this film went a direction I was not expecting and thus proved itself far less than I could have hoped for.

If you are a fan of the videogames, or have at least played them once or twice, you'd know that the whole idea behind this game (and the endless copycats) is to scare you.  You play it locked up in your room in the dead of night and find yourself transported to a place that shocks you.  Every noise makes your heart jump.  That is the exact feeling I wanted from this movie.  `Resident Evil' is not an action/adventure type game.  It is a dark and slowly paced horror game.  That is what this movie needed to be.  It needed to layer on the fear and tension, not the action.  Sure, it's cool to see Milla Jovovich kick some serious zombie butt, but I'd rather have seen her hyperventilate in a dark room while she listened to the corpses dragging their broken limbs across the hall on the other side of the door.

It's my opinion, but I think it is what the videogame warranted.

Taking my personal preference aside, this movie does deliver to a certain extent.  The story it develops is engaging (and the back story does have a certain amount of depth) and they tried hard to layer it with elements from the film, but overall it feels a tad hollow or unimportant.  When it's all over you don't feel like you need to watch it again.  There are far better zombie films out there (Danny Boyle's masterpiece '28 Days Later' is everything this film SHOULD have been).

Jovovich is a stunning piece of eye candy, and I really enjoy watching her breathe, so I was game for this film and its ridiculous sequels.  Still, I wish she were a better actress and I wish she were in better films.",2.0
"This used to be one of my favorite movies but it no longer is. When I was younger I did not bother trying to comprehend the underlying message of this movie, nor any other movie for that matter. The message of this movie is now perfectly clear to me: convicts in Turkish prisons are frequently maltreated and tortured. Turkish prisons are inhumane and the entire justice system is flawed, corrupt and unjust. Moreover, the director of this movie implicitly implies that all Turks are barbarous, intransigent and uncivilized. This is corroborated by the fact that all Turkish characters in this movie are evil and their intentions are always malicious. Also an attempt is made to defame Islam and to show it as a religion which is inhumane, barbaric and merciless. On the other hand, Christians are depicted as humane and infallible. The principal point of this movie is that the Turkish society is flawed and atavistic as its justice system shows no mercy towards drug smugglers, rapists and murderers. Many of these assertions may be true but it would be a gross overgeneralization and oversimplification to claim that all of this is true and that these injustices are unique for Turkey. The director of this movie should have done some research at home before he set out to criticize an entire nation. Consider some of these facts: U.S.A. still has capital punishment; it has been demonstrated in many cases that the application of the death penalty is racially discriminatory (much more blacks are sentenced to death than whites); in many states, minors and mentally retarded are sentenced to death even though this violates the U.S. constitution; the U.S. government incarcarates people without letting them know what they have been charged with and denies them adequate legal representation etc. (Guantanamo Bay in Cuba). If these facts are not indicative of a flawed and unjust justice system, then what is? In my view, it is extremely hypocritical and cynical not to judge our own actions and transgressions by the same standards we apply to others. This is a good movie but it would have been much better had it not been so severely biased and prejudiced.",2.0
"My review is for the SUPERBIT release of this movie. SUPERBIT is supposed to represent the top of the line and best image quality a DVD can achieve and many times those DVDs are actually reference DVDs. Well, the quality in this SUPERBIT edition of RESIDENT EVIL is so so, not bad not good, just like any other DVD. It certainly does not do justice to the SUPERBIT term. Other DVDs that honor the SUPERBIT name are the FIFTH ELEMENT and THE BIG HIT version but this version is nothing to talk about. It is not as terrible as the other SUPERBIT DVD or Charlie's Angels but if you are buying this DVD for reference or video quality purposes look elsewhere.",2.0
"OK, if you can sympathize with an idiot who would strap several kilos of hash to his body to smuggle them from a country where penalties for such crimes are often met with DEATH, then you can go with this slick,  atmospheric and incredibly violent movie.  Admittedly, it gets under your  skin, and Brad Davis was mightily effective in the role of Billy Hayes, and  John Hurt embodies creepily the stoned out prison mate Billy befriends  during his harrowing odyssey.  But this movie, directed with typical  stylish flair by visual master Alan Parker, never places the blame squarely  on Billy's shoulders, poor dumb guy.  And while his torturous stay in the  Turkish prisons practically smells, it is so dense and well-captured, it  did nothing for the image of Turkey, the country -- it is uncompromising  and brutally vicious in its depiction of virtually every Turkish location,  character and idea, for that matter.  If Turkey was such a pit of despair,  why did Billy decide to buy his hash there?  This movie revolves around a  character who is unrepentant and foolish, and while no one should have to  endure such human indignation, it is hard to escape that simple fact.  Parker's movie, taken on its own terms, has an almost poetic quality at  times, though Billy's dismissal of the Swede's advances actually made me  laugh out loud, and, by the way, was consummated in the book.  With so much  depravity at every turn, and hellish imprisonment your destiny, why  wouldn't Billy seek another human, even if he happens to be a man?",2.0
"Update-Jul 2015: I see that the widescreen is now available in the Blu-ray version.  Other reviewers have also commented on the disastrous widescreen DVD version.  This movie is beautiful to look at, but the pan-and-scan DVD version is like looking at the Mona Lisa with a bandanna over her face.
---original review---
It's September 2006, and they *still* have not released a widescreen version.  I got through the first 20 minutes of this pan-and-scan version before I couldn't stand it anymore.  There are so many beautiful shots; I just can't watch them butchered like this.

"First off, let me say this. I love the Resident Evil movies, almost as much as the first 3 games. That being said let me best describe my review in a short but concise way as to why I gave it 2 stars.

I have this movie on DVD as well. I have an upscaling DVD player. My upscaled DVD version of this movie looks almost exactly the same as the supposed High Definition Blu Ray version using a PS3 on a Sharp Aquos 1080p LCD TV. I don't know the reason behind the lack of fidelity and image clarity, but honestly, except to say you have the Blu Ray version with the rest (I got the 2nd movie for free in that 5 free movies deal), go with upscaled DVD. The sound quality is better on BluRay, but not so much better it warrants buying the Blu Ray over the regular DVD movie.

Heck, I saw it on TV on an HD channel and it looked the same, that is, nothing special.

So it looks ok, but don't expect superb quality, and instead expect a lot of graininess.",2.0

I found myself laughing at parts where we're ""supposed to be scared"". the acting is just not that good, it's corny as hell. hasn't anyone in this film ever heard of a zombie before? if a zombie was coming at you, would you lower your weapon or blast it apart? like, what are they doing? I got so mad at this film cause it's so stupid. why do the characters have to be so dumb? I'll blame the writers, the director's for this. Resident Evil is not worth your time or money. I found the second one more enjoyable for some reason. so please, look elsewhere. I'd be more entertained by a fish swimming in circles.",2.0
"If you are a Nick Nolte fan and haven't read the book you must watch this movie. He gave a nearly flawless and completely believable performance as Tom Wingo. If you are a Barbara Streisand fan and have not read the book you will continue to be a fan after this movie.
I give this movie two stars only for those reasons. Otherwise, this movie rots. If you are a fan of the book, you should go running in the other direction. The movie should have been named something else because it is an insulting betrayal to the book. First, I read the book and then watched the movie. Huge mistake. IN THE BOOK TOM WINGO ISN'T EVEN THE SO-CALLED PRINCE OF TIDES, LUKE IS! What an egregious affront in a long line of offenses. The book is an excellent work of fiction with beautiful storytelling which is completely lost on the movies disorganized plot and sub-par character development.",2.0
"Please read this review before you decide if it's helpful or not. Seriously, I played the games they are fun, I saw the first film, it was pretty good, this one does not have much going for it. If you want a good shoot-em-up Zombie film see the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" or even the great comedy ""Shaun of the Dead"". Both of those movies will give you so much more than this one. The ""Lickers"" in the Church is a good scene, and a brief scene with Zombie Hookers is cool, and that is the two stars I give it. Nemesis (The huge monster villian in this movie) looks no better than a Power Rangers creature I kid you not, and the acting is non-existent. If you are the kind of person that will enjoy anything with the ""Resident Evil"" tag you may like it just fine, but people with a higher-standard on their action/horror films REALLY should look elsewhere..........the Zombie Hookers are cool though.",2.0
"After just reading the book the movie was quite a disappointment.  Of course a movie cannot have the detail of the book, but a lot of the highlights I thought were overlooked.

"If you already have (and love) the Alistair Sim version (Scrooge, 1951), the Reginald Owen version (1938) and Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol (no, I'm not kidding, it's beautifully done), this will be an interesting film for comparison.
Two good points stand out for this version of Dicken's classic Christmas story:
1) Since it is an adaptation, set in a different time and place from the original (Depression-era New England), deviations from the text and basic plot-line, are not as bothersome as they are in the films that adapt the story in ""Dickensian"" England.
2) Henry Winkler, who, at the time, was playing against his well-known Fonz character, gives an excellent characterization to the Scrooge-like Benedict Slade.
George C. Scott and Albert Finney give detailed performances as Scrooge in their version, and the films that feature them have good production values -- and, in the case of the Finney version a couple of good songs -- but the deviations in text in the Scott version and the added material in the Finney version (Scrooge in hell -- what?) are both unnecessary and more than a little annoying.",3.0

"A movie with some cute moments, a big nod to the inspiration/source material, and nice setting... Unfortunately, the only thing holding this movie back was.... Henry Winkler.

The Fonz makes an awful Scrooge, or Slade, in this case. His acting isn't horrible, but it's also not that good. There seems very little emotion in his transition from corrupt, hateful, ""covetous old sinner"" to changed man, learning to care for others. He's stiff and seemingly insincere. (His interaction with the young boy at the end is a little creepy too. ""You're going to come for a ride with me."" Ew.)

His character is too old looking... it looks like he could kick the bucket any moment (yet he runs around like a man quite a bit younger), and caused a disconnect and confusion while visiting with The Ghost of Christmas Past.

I mean, it's not horrible, but I certainly didn't like it as much as many of the other Christmas Carol adaptations out there.

If you're looking to watch A Christmas Carol, I recommend the George C. Scott version for a wonderfully sarcastic Ghost of Christmas Present who gives Scrooge a good dose of his own medicine (however, the scene with Ignorance and Want may be scary to children*), or A Muppet Christmas Carol for a surprisingly touching musical adaptation- I promise the songs aren't too hokey. And the literature, narrated by Gonzo, is very close to the source material (very family friendly).

*They appear near the end of the Ghost of Christmas Present's time, while Scrooge witnesses the struggle of a homeless family (the spirit keeps Ignorance and Want under his robe).",3.0

Worth watching this new version of the classic.  It is a little slow in parts but still entertaining. The real negative issue and distraction throughout is Henry Winkler's make up that is supposed to make him look old.

Should be included in your holiday movies collection.  Funny though to be reminded how much TV you watched BEFORE a commercial break back in the early 80's (as it was a made for TV movie).  Henry Winkler does a great job playing an American/Depression era version of Mr Scrooge.  Corny (but what Christmas Carol version isn't?) but fun.,3.0
"Mr. Winkler failed to capture my attention in this ignoble version of the classic Dickens fable. However, it isn't without a certain charm all its own. And to Henry's credit, and partly to my own blame, I have never been able to seperate Henry Winkler from the Fonz of Happy Days. I can't say that I disliked the movie it just doesn't rate up there with the Christmas classics in my estimation and this is simply my own personal take on the film.

If you're looking for a Christmas movie that the whole family can enjoy together on occasion then this DVD will fit right in, but if you're looking to gather movies for your library that are the so called ""must have Christmas movies"" then pass it up for another title.",3.0
"For some reason I always thought this film was older than 1979...in any case this ""American-ized"" version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol stars Henry Winkler as the SCrooge character who is renamed Benedict Slade.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity when this ABC made for TV movie came out so I'm certain that's why he was cast.  Unfortunately you just can't see anything but Fonzie, even under layers and layers of make-up.

The scene is shifted from 1840's London to  Depression-era New England, as miserly businessman Slade receives a long-overdue attitude adjustment one Christmas eve when he is visited by three ghostly figures who resemble three of the people whose possessions Slade had seized to collect on unpaid loans. Assuming the roles of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future from Charles Dickens' classic story, the three apparitions force Slade to face the consequences of his skinflint ways, and he becomes a caring, generous, amiable man.

In a bit of ridiculousness, the ""Ghost of Christmas Future"" is portrayed by a black man wearing gold chains, dressed in 1979 fashions and listens to disco music. Their ""Ghost of the Future"" jumped a little too far ahead, and is comical by todays standards.

Winkler does an admirable job in his role and Dorian Harewood really shines.  Still...Dickens is a classic...why ABC felt a need to revise something so perfect is beyond me.  This is a good change of pace but if you really like ""A CHristmas Carol"" stick with the Alastair Sim or George C. Scott versions.",3.0

Now more than thirty years later, it doesn't resonate as well. More recent productions of the same storyline are more emotional, awestruck and have better photography and musical scores, but this version of Jesus is a pure bread and butter version especially suited for those not yet familiar with the teachings of Jesus and need an initiation presented in a plain and simple way. A few years ago, this same evangelical production company created a wrap-around version of the film centered on the conversion of Mary Magdaline which, oddly enough, seemed more affecting than the original.",3.0

This movie has been hailed by so many layity and pastors as a great witnessing tool.  If this is true, then the movie accomplished something good, however, I find it hard to believe anyone can set through it without falling asleep.  Read the Gospel of Luke instead.

"I like how it explains how all the Christmas traditions came together, but this was not the greatest Christmas special in my childhood. I never thought it was bad, I just did not like the idea of Burgermeister Meisterburger outlawing toys.because of my love for toys, I didn't quite like the idea of it, sort of my same issue with ""Toy Story."" But it is still a good special.",3.0

"I loved this as a kid.  So I figured I'd get it for my kids.  And they liked it too, despite the hilariously hokey special effects (hokey to them), so that's why I gave it 3 stars.

But for me, for all the christmas specials, this is the worst.

I couldn't believe the ""Sit on my lap"" song.  Really. Some strange creep comes to town and trades kisses and lap sitting for toys - he should have been arrested for that alone.

And then the way they tied everything to the song was really irritating.  Plus, why did the young man have an old man's voice? Annoying.",3.0

"I don't know, im really one the fence.  for Arthur, it was typical and true to the fashion of the books.

I will send the movies back. arthurs perfect christmas and good sport.",3.0
I rented this movie for my kids this weekend while we were laid up with fevers.  It was just okay...  I found it was educational regarding other cultural and religious celebrations surrounding Christmas-time.  But I'm annoyed by whining.  Arthur's little sister is bossy and whiny and speaks in an ugly tone - not how I want my children to talk to each other OR to me.  This is why I rated it low.,3.0
"Looking for something to watch with the kids (3 & 7), threw a dart at the free ""Amazon Prime Kids' Videos"" and watched this.  It is reasonably enjoyable but not much more.  There are quite a few story lines going on at once (Buster's mom and her emotional issues at Christmas, Arthur's search for the perfect Christmas present for mom, DW's anxiety over whether or not she'll get what she really wants from Santa, etc) so it isn't really focused enough to command much of an identity.  It's hard to capture much magic with a few too many varied story lines shifting back and forth.  My biggest complaint is the very forced multicultural element - not surprising since this is a PBS program, but it felt too educational & preachy in its covering of all the faith bases.  I'd prefer they make some unique holiday shows about Hanukkah and Kwanza instead of forcing the politically correct gamut at the expense of a more engaging story.
I imagine if your kids are fans of Arthur they'll enjoy this one just fine.  There's nothing especially wrong with it, but there's also nothing especially memorable about it either.  Worth a rental at best.",3.0
"I don't know how to write a review for this product. I have issues with the DVD like other people have had (How do I contact you, seller?!).

They  blew past the jokes so fast, you couldn't even appreciate them.  They tried  to cram so much into the 8 minutes, there wasn't enough time to really  expand and make it a movie that had real replay value.

"$8.00 for Nine miutes!  Even though it was enjoyable to see where George got his ideas from, if its any truth to it.

"A co-worker, a huge ""Star Wars"" fan, breathlessly brought this video to work and had me borrow it. ""It's so great!,"" he promised. Eh... My friends have made more effective nine minute movies, but  it's not hard to understand why this film sells so well -- there's an  endless supply of mythology for devotees of ""Star Wars,"" and this  movie exposes it, if not skillfully, at least blatantly. Few of the  so-called ""inspiration"" shots really work well -- Obi-Wan and  Jabba work because they're more subtle. The Darth Vader and R2D2/C3PO ones  stretch for believability -- I know there's weirdos at any university at  any time, but these caricatures try a little too hard as written (if what  I'm writing doesn't make sense, it's because I'm trying to not give the  movie away). Really good filmmakers (and remember that Nussbaum is still  new at this) don't pander in such obvious ways. Still, the acting's good,  it's reasonably well-made, and there's only nine minutes of it, so you  don't have too long to dwell on shortcomings anyway. Not a bad purchase for  ""Star Wars"" freaks.",3.0

"Remeber Grover the Waiter and his chubby blue customer?  This video is a great chance to visit them again - Grover has ""worked his way up in the food business"" to become a Planet Storybook (read Hollywood) waiter and change the unhealthy eating habits of his favorite customer.  Along the way are lots of gags about storybook characters (Grover trips over Jack Be Nimble's candlestick, for instance - and the restaurant is decorated with memorobilia like Cinderella's glass slipper)  Very cute.
I think I'm not cool enough to enjoy the song clips, but if you and your kids enjoy spoofs, you'll like them: ""Cereal Girl,""  Cookie monster rapping about ""Healthy Food,"" and bologna, cheese, and bread singing ""Telly's Lunch"" (Brady Bunch Theme) I liked ""Blueberry Mouth,"" a Leon Redbone style (?) tune about blueberry picking.

Personally,  I think that they count a little fast for him while the  ""Alphabet"" tape goes pretty slow.  And Baby Bear is always a  winner.  I think though that he will appreciate when he gets a little  older.",3.0

It starts off slow for a one year old child.  It is not a bad DVD but it may be more for an older child with a  longer attention span.  I attempt to watch the entire dvd but my son was so bored with it I had to turn it off and turn his attention to something more entertaining.,3.0

One if the characters is angry and annoyed and in a bad mood through most of the program. His voice gets on my nerves. I don't enjoy listening to it while I am driving and I don't really want my daughter to be influenced by seeing the character's negative behavior.

"This is a cute video with some catchy tunes (""one, two three, count with me, we'll count everything around us that we do and hear and see!""). It's not old enough to appeal to parents like me who like Sesame Street nostalgia and want to introduce their kids to the genius of Jim Henson. (Ernie, in particular, is without his characteristic mischief.) But, it's not new enough to be instantly recognizable to the kids of today. I'll put this video on without complaint when my daughter asks for it (she does like it) but it's not one of the first ones I reach for. I like the Count's ""Count It Higher"" much better.",3.0
It is ok dvd. But the style is bit old. I think the numbers are flashing too fast. If children watch for long time I guess it would not be so good for their eyes.,3.0
"This one has some decent material, but it takes too long to get to it. It begins with Ernie finding a room key from the Furry Arms Hotel and he proceeds there to return it. Once there, he engages in some banter with Benny the Bunny, the hotel owner and some hotel staff. This goes on for several minutes and becomes tedious before some short Sesame Street segments are able to offer a brief respite. Some of these are good, though the song with three blackbirds is not very good and lasts too long. Also, the MC Elmo song about the Number Five is also on The Best of Elmo DVD; so, if you are looking for exclusive Elmo material for your child, this is not your best bet. Now, I like Ernie as much as the next person, but I'm not certain what they were thinking when they decided to feature so much interaction with other, practically unknown characters. He ends up dinging the bellhop bell fifteen times, which is way too repetitious for even the youngest viewer. Overall, this isn't terrible, but it is far from the best Sesame Street has to offer.",3.0
This DVD was very advanced for my 18-month old. In Kids favorite Songs there is a lot of counting backwards from 10 to 1 which my kid loves too mimick (he still doesn't say much that can be understood) so I thought he would love this DVD. There is too much talking in the intro and it bores my kid as soon as it starts plus there is no Elmo. My kid loves Elmo and expects to see Elmo on Sesame Street. We are keeping this DVD for later when he is about 3 he might appreciate it then. Right now he has no interest in it whatsoever.,3.0
I've been disappointed with this video.  The bunny is a bit over the top for me and I don't think this video's story line flows as well.  I'm sure their are MUCH better counting videos out there...,3.0
"my 2 year old won't watch this video. i bought it about 6 months ago, and she watched it maybe a half a dozen times then, but if i suggest it now I get an emphatic NO. she loves counting books and activities, so my guess is the Furry Arms, the monster couple that run it, and benny the bunny just don't resonate with her, because she typically loves ernie. I wish i'd gotten the count's counting DVD instead.",3.0
"My daughter is 19 months old and loves Sesame Street. But we were disappointed that she didn't like this DVD. She found the rabbit/bellhop character annoying and a little scary. He's kind of ugly and mean, and unfortunately he's the main character after Ernie. And her favorite character, Elmo, is only in one vignette. It was also too slow to hold her attention without more of her favorites like Elmo or Cookie Monster in it. She's learning to count just great without it anyway, so we'll probably just give it to someone else.",3.0
"I have to say I had higher hopes for this video; Sesame Street has such a wonderful stable of number clips, and I was hoping to see better ones.
So, for the first time, I'm recommending the between-clip footage over the clips!  The opening song ""That's How The Numbers Go"" could easily become the numerical version of the ABC song; its jazzy and singable and goes all the way to twenty.  The setup is that Ernie stops by the Furry Arms Hotel to return a lost room key, where he shows bumbling hotel owners Humphrey and Ingrid that things (like room keys) can be organized with numbers.  I also like that this video isn't scrubbed clean of any conflict - the much-maligned bellhop, Benny the Bunny, is one of Kevin Clash's best characters, and he's terrific in this video; he and Ernie show how to return a sour face with a smile (and some innocent teasing!)
Although there is one good clip - ""Martian Beauty #9,"" unfortunately, this doesn't include some of the ingenious and artistic number clips from Sesame Street past:  no bakers falling down stairs, no pinball machine, no counting marble machines.  Instead, you get the lukewarm ""#11 rap,"" which shows pictures of 11 things, and ""Five Jive with Elmo Hammer,"" which is already on too many Sesame Street videos as it is.  Yawn.",3.0
"Yep, despite that voice change, this is a truly engaging disc. Sesame Street is still as entertaining to me as an adult as it was when I was a kid, and my kid is now enjoying this too.
But I must take a minute and criticize the sound quality of this disc (and 'Do The Alphabet' as well). In normal operation, I will run my TV volume at 19, 26 for VHS, 23 for DVD. This DVD requires  the volume turned up to an unbelievable 37 before it's decently audible. But when I pop in the 'Kids Favorite Songs 1'  DVD, I have to turn the volume DOWN to 14.

"I give this product three stars because it was good.  It is pretty basic.  There are good lessons here for fundamentals.  There are a couple of interesting arpeggio ideas, but really nothing to write home about.

"I have been playing forms of rock/metal for a few years, but never really tried my hand at leads so I figured I would give this vid a shot.  I watched the video through a few times and obviously Paul is very good at what he teaches, but I got left in the dust right off the bat.  I eventually decided to focus on some of the easier patterns, memorize them and run though them everytime i pick up my guitar.  I am a lot faster now than before I started, but still nothing close to paul---even on the simple ones.  I would say this video is more for someone that can already play fairly fast and is either looking for more licks or wants to play faster.  Don't get me wrong it is a good vid, i just wish I were more up to speed when i bought it.",3.0
"I read good reviews about this guy and this video. I even saw some clips of him on youtube and that convinced me to buy this. However when I got it and watched it, I noticed he went too fast in his instruction for me to keep up. My biggest gripe is that he does not teach you the rudimentary techniques such as how to hold the pick so that you can pick as fast as he is. I found myself pausing the video a lot just to get the lick. The DVD comes with a printable PDF booklet (13 pgs). This is def not for beginners. It would have been better if he started out showing you how to use a metronome in shredding and subdividing notes. The included sample vid with John Petrucci (he shows you shredding with a metronome) was what this video should have been.",3.0

"Made on the heels of the success of Superman (1978) and not afraid to drop names, this is not quite a superhero film. It is more akin to a 007 spy film, even if at times it resembles the Pink Panther films, being filmed in several European locations and even with music by Henry Mancini. A better photographer and a better director could have done wonders with just that.

The first event in an Istanbul cafe is quite close to a Clouseau movie, but it quickly distances itself from that feel.

The film was quite ambitious for that Disney period, with lots of potentially exciting chases (which never quite get there,) we get custom spy cars & a Rolls-Royce chase, laser shooting speedboats, a sky lift escape, a helicopter and a mechanical wing contraption, which sometimes works and sometimes does not.

Oliver Reed as the villain is an absolute mess, but the two male leads (Michael Crawford and James Hampton) have a quirky relationship that brings to mind The Greatest American Hero (also 1981) down to even having a toothy lead with curly blond hair. Too bad there is no chemistry with Barbara Carrera.

While the description might superficially resemble Kick-Ass (2010), the movie features a comic book artist living out his heroic fantasies, one has really nothing to do with the other.

The animated title sequence is by Richard Williams? The DVD has no end credits.",3.0

"Let's get one thing straight: Condorman is not a great movie.  It's mindless camp, something you watch for fun, not for believability.  With that in mind, I absolutely love it.  It's one of the guilty pleasures of my childhood, when I didn't understand what made a movie ""good"" or ""bad""; I just enjoyed watching them.

I rented it the other day to show my son because I wanted him to experience the same joy that I did when I was not much older than him, and I was not disappointed: he had a great time and asked to see it again.  I just wish it were available on Netflix, but Disney's pretty stingy about what services it lets its movies be streamed on.

I enjoy the cheesy car and boat chases, with spontaneous explosions everywhere.  I love the villain, Krokov, and his over the top acting.  I wince at the inherent sexism of the ""guy rescues girl"" plot.  I laugh at the simplistic special effects of the Condorman suit, and Woody's insane audacity in confronting the entire KGB security apparatus for his Laser Lady.  It's just plain mindless fun.",3.0

"This movie is OK for $5, but not for $20. This movie does not have  the exceptional-Disney charm of excellent Disney-movies like, ""Swiss Family Robinson"", ""Summer Magic"", ""That Darn Cat old-version"", or good Disney movies like ""Toby Tyler"".

If you are rich or can find it for $5; it holds your attention, a little humor, but not exceptional humor, filmed on locations, some interesting gadgets but nothing you have not seen before, moves at a decent pace.

If you pay too much for this film; you will not enjoy it, because you are not buying that charm of a bygone era. This film is simply an OK film on a modern theme.

- The picture quality is not much better than the 1981 version. Therefore, my eyes are just as content to watch the 1981 version, which develops the characters much better (even if it drags on at times.)

- This production does not develop Orick's character, or Estella's character early in the production. In fact, Mr. Pumblechook and other characters are also not as developed as I would have wished.

- Dickens' novel drags on in the middle. This production greatly contracts the plot in the central half of the novel. For example, Bentley Drummel and Matthew Pocket's characters are not developed very well in the middle part of this work. Matthew's father is nearly eliminated.

- This words spoken in this production have been updated from the 1981 adaptation and the novel. In fact, the 1974 adaptation is more accurate than this 1999 production as pertains to including famous quotes from the novel.

One positive of this adaptation is that the mood (the psychology) of this adaptation is better than the 1981 version or any other version I have seen. A second positive is that the acting is this production is just as good as the 1981 adaptation.

In summary:
I prefer the 1981 version best (even though I would only give it a 4 star). However, this production is better than the 1974 Michael York/Sarah Miles adaptation, which completely eliminates the character of Orlick.

For people who want a film to watch for pleasure (rather than to prepare for a major content examination), this adaptation may be the most interesting and best choice. Otherwise, I would recommend the much longer 1981 adaptation.",3.0
"This latest version of Dickens' sprawling novel of love, jealousy, betrayal, and redemption is a faithful (or as much as possible, even in a 3-hr production) rendering.  It is well cast, with Ioan Gruffudd as the most handsome Pip on film, and Charlotte Rampling giving her usual regal performance as Miss Havisham.

Production design is good, with grim revisionist views of 18th century London typical of modern adaptations.  Photography is first rate.

What is unacceptable is that the DVD is, apparently, recorded straight off the PBS broadcast -- just as if you recorded it yourself -- complete with all the ads for Mobil, lugubrious intoductions by the pedantic host of Masterpiece Theatre, and PBS icons lingering for 30 seconds at a time throughout the film.  Distracting, annoying, and unacceptable.

Order the Region 2 disc from the BBC if you can play it.  One should not pay a high price for a DVD that one could record off the air, and is little more than an ad for Mobil and PBS.",3.0
"I bought this DVD to see a very true interpretation of my favorite Dickens' novel. The movie itself is special and makes the wonderful mood. But this DVD contains the advertising - the big emblem which appeares every 15 minutes in the right bottom corner of your screen. It overlaps the picture and what is worse - you can't dip into the motion. It appeares twelve times all throughout the movie and is always very disturbing. I felt that I spent my money not well, because of this stupid interupting advertising. I was disappointed. But in the rest of things it is a wonderful movie.",3.0
"This is a Master Theatre Version made in 1999, of Dickens' oft-filmed book which comes with stunningly beautiful photography and most strange decision about adapting the original book.  As if to resist the Americanized version starring Ethan Hawke made the year before, this film version, as far as I know, is the least romantic one ever made.  Whether or not you like the film solely depends on this aspect, so let me tell you about it first.
The story is comparatively faithfiul, spending about 3 hours to cover the story of Pip, an apprentice of blacksmith who unwisely perhaps, falls in love with cold-hearted Estella.  But the film, as I said, gives more stress on darker side of the book, so the love theme is not explored as deep as other versions such as David Lean's or Alfonso Cuaron's.  Rather, the newer version seems to give more emphasis on the Pip's guilty feelings deep rooted in his contact with the runaway convict Magwitch, and the film's way of shooting the famous opening of the book, which relates their encounter on the graveyard in the marshes, gives us no time for savoring Dickensian humor.  The film uses the technique of flash-back, in order to express Pip's fear, which, I am afraid, is overdone for its own sake.
I do not follow every details of the story (you probably have read the book), but I have to say this; like I said, this film is endowed with least amount of humor and romance.  Sure, you see Wemmick's most casual wedding; you see Biddy, Joe, Herbert (not all Pockets however), but you cannot expect to find any humorous scnes, one of Dickens' trademarks.  So, when Pip recounts how he met Miss Havisham before his sister and Pumblechook, he is literally forced to talk.  As you know, this is one of the humourous scenes of the original -- even though the humor is downplayed -- where we can see Pip makes up his own story, which gets more and more outrageous as he goes on.  But the director here didn't seem to see that way, depicting the whole incident as simply terrifying one for Pip, who must receive as much scolding and harsh words from them, as if in a tortune.
Justine Waddle, often cast in costume dramas, is good as grown-up Estella, but before she could show something, the film goes on to follow the story of Pip, who must face bravely several darker moments of life (you know what I mean -- Orlick and Themes River), thus making least use of romance between Pip and her.  Actually, the film shows more of mud (of London and Pip's village) and decay, so the first thing Pip sees in London is the butchered cattles hanging on the hook.  It is true that Dickens' original book tells how Pip, arriveing in London for the first time in his life, wanders around Smithfield, then an open-sir cattle market, but ... do we need to know that?
The portrayal of Gruffudd's grown-up Pip is so-so, but the most disappointed thing about the film is Charlotte Rampling's Miss Havisham.  Not that her acting is bad, but her Havisham simply does not convince me, being too weak in her gestures.  She should be more authentic as this witch-like woman often found in fairy tales, who commands people, not just talks.  If she does not follow the flamboyant acting of Anne Bancroft, that is OK.  I just need more enticing mystery in this enigmatic, willful woman, Havisham.
Overall not bad if you look for bleak atmosphere in Dickens.  But for those who seeks for humor and romance in him, this is not the one to see.",3.0
"We just got done watching this movie in my literature class because we read the book. I must say that when I started the book I didn`t have a very open mind; the very beginning of the story seems a little trivial and is certainly not the most exciting point of the story. When I`d been through about six chapters I wasn`t enjoying it, though I`d read worse. But we watched the first forty minutes of this movie and I was fascinated by the eerie, dark mood it portrayed. Watching this version definitely helped me to enjoy the book from then on. Dickens really did do an excellent job of setting the mood and the dark atmospere in ""Great Expectations"", and whoever made this movie knew the right way to show the same mood on film. I think the creators of this movie also knew the book genuinely inside and out, which is what I infer from the phenomenal choice of cast members. The actors chosen to play both the young and older Pip, Abel Magwitch, Miss Havisham, Jaggers, and Wemmick were all simply perfect for the roles. In fact, all the actors were extremely fitting, except the one actress who played Estella - she wasn`t neccesarily the way I`d imagined the grown-up Estella to be like, at least, but she did carry out the part well enough. There is some dialogue and a few scenes at the end that stray a little far from the book, but the ending was the one thing I wasn`t neccesarily satisfied with in the book anyway. I think I even like the ending in this movie better.",3.0
"This movie is decent, but takes many liberties with Dickens' story, and changes a lot about the characters.  Charlotte Rampling's Miss Havisham is much too lucid, young, and sane - not to mention clean (this woman is supposed to have worn the same outfit for decades).  There is a lot of footage of nature, which is silly, considering that so much of what was in the book had to be cut.  Several specific incidents from the book are completely changed.",3.0
"BOTTOM LINE: IF you're a fan of big screen toughguy Lee Marvin, director John (DELIVERANCE) Boorman, or legendary Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune, then you may enjoy this. The slipshod script is the real villain of this WWII-flavored take on THE DEFIANT ONES. If nothing else, the gorgeous South Seas location scenery is worth gawking at. Some solid bonus content adds value. The nice hi-def transfer helps make this a marginal recommend. 3 STAR film, 4 STAR Blu-ray

THOUGHTS: With a couple of top-notch stars like this film has, it should have been a singular masterpiece. Instead, the scattershot screenplay has so many inconsistencies and head-scratching lapses in logic that it makes what otherwise could have been a great motion picture merely an interesting diversion. For instance: these guys spend how many months/years together, and yet neither one bothers to learn at least some of the other fellow's language? Basic communication is essential to increase the odds of survival and/or rescue, not to mention simply making their co-existence more bearable. Instead, they spend the film's entire running time screaming at one another in their native tongue. For cryin' out loud, they never even bother to learn each other's names! Really?!? Sorry, not buying it. Totally unrealistic. There's also a very unfocused transition as they go from enemies who first try and kill each other, then just try to annoy each other, then capture one another and torture the other guy... to just suddenly being too exhausted to fight, so they become tolerant acquaintances. Huh??? The downbeat ending is a nice try at poignant irony, but also falls flat in its execution. (The alternate ending, equally as depressing, isn't much better.) Again, I blame ALL of this film's problems on its script, which should've had another two or three passes, at the minimum, in order to eliminate the annoying incongruities and make the narrative flow better. Both actors are excellent, the direction is steady & solid, the cinematography is outstanding and the minimalist musical score is good. However, none of that can overcome a bad script and HELL IN THE PACIFIC has a muddling, mediocre script - at best.

THE BLU-RAY: Now the good news for fans of this film. The hi-def release of HELL IN THE PACIFIC sports a really nice transfer. The picture is crisp & clean, with solid blacks, strong mid-tones, and not much in the way of artifacting, pixelation or crush (video noise). The original film grain is also wonderfully evident, (no DNR tampering/overscrubbing!). The audio portion is clear and the soundmix is level. There are a half dozen or so bonus features, including interviews with the director and the art director, and a full-length audio commentary track, which help make this Blu-ray a solid bargain. If you love this film, this Blu-ray is a must-own. Casual viewers will still find much to admire, and lots of beautiful scenery to hold their attention. A nice hi-def effort from the crew at Kino Lorber.",3.0

"British director John Boorman's 1968 consideration of the  tremendously vicious hemispheric Pacific conflict of WW II is a brief, but unfortunately unsatisfying examination of the here leaderless, very dirty hand-to-hand combat that was island-hopping in the war.  Both Lee Marvin (who actually served as a Marine during the war in his youth) , and Mifune, a Japanese ""star"" of quite respectable dramatic stature give fine, necessarily muted performances.  But the plot sort of drifts lazily back and forth in the Pacific Palau, in a dreamy would-be interpretation of individual land-ops which one-on-one combat most assuredly should not  (cinematically) at least) be.  To do Boorman credit, Marvin does eventually bring the subject of the (Christian) God into the confrontation, but it's pretty much too late, and the audience leaves with the somewhat dull effect of having watched a war fought between business boardrooms, one democratic and one fascist, and who really needs that kind of history, if only merely dramatic?  Sadly, once again, ""Old men start wars...young men finish them.""",3.0

"Woody Allen's uneven crime mockumentary marked his directorial debut. Despite its rough-edged quality, ""Take the Money and Run"" (1969) maintains a steady flow of visual and verbal humor.

"Very dated (late '60's type of humor) but still worth watching if you absolutely love Woody Allen's sense of comedy and his self-loathing study in cinematic pathos. I purchased a used copy and don't feel cheated. Perhaps a Woody Allen diehard fan's must have, but for the average person, this might be one of those you don't really need to own - or view. I watched it expecting more, but realized I've become overly sophisticated in my appreciation for comedy over the last four decades.  It's paced like a television movie-of-the-week, and there are long pauses throughout. The narrative theme is 40's years pass, but interesting for anyone who remembers ""Tenspeed and Brownshoe"" growing up...",3.0
"For a 60's era movie, this is funny, hip, daring, topical, and satirical...traits that are commonplace today but not that common when this daring film was made.

One of the reasons that I'm not a fan of Woody Allen (besides that the sicko impregnated his adopted daughter) is that I don't appreciate the whole nebbishy, neurotic, lack of physicality,  Jewish stereotype. I'm Jewish (albeit a ""big"" Jew)  and that persona does nobody any good.

However, in 1969, when this movie was made, that negative caricature, was not really utilized in the movies. Taking that stereotype and coupling it with that of a ruthless and bold criminal was unique. The notion that the viewer saw the caricature as always failing, yet the charactor himself did not perceive himself that way, was a refreshing way of telling a story. The story and narrative was so odd that I find the movie [still] refreshingly funny.

Favorite scene...when Virgil is frisked at the prison and cracks up because he's ticklish.",3.0
"HELL IN THE PACIFIC is a curiosity.  Telling the story of two pilots, one Japanese (Toshiro Mifune) and one American (Lee Marvin), stranded on a small, deserted tropical island during World War II it's at once fascinating and somewhat flat.  Mifune and Marvin are two of my favorite actors.  Their plight on the island, coveting or guarding precious limited resources against the `enemy', more or less drives home the point that war is a futile exercise.  Of course the question arises as to whether we can conquer our distrust before we conquer, or are conquered by, our enemy.  HELL IN THE PACIFIC is thought-provoking and beautifully photographed by master cinematographer Conrad Hall.

  After a while, though, with all the attacks and counter-attacks, I got the feeling that I was in the middle of a Road Runner cartoon with no exit.  This feeling was exacerbated by such scenes as Marvin trying to teach captive Mifune (the balance of power changes a number of times) to fetch a stick like a dog.  It was an ill-conceived scene, brutishly funny if the intent was humor, but added onto the ridiculous ending HELL IN THE PACIFIC seems to have expended its creative energy well before the final credits run.  By the way, I strongly recommend watching the `Alternate Ending' in the Special Features after watching the movie.  It's the right ending for the movie, and it's a mystery why it's the `alternate' one.",3.0
"Similiarities to the Enemy Mine movie could be made here. Perhaps the Enemy Mine writer got the idea from this story. Two men stranded on a Island rather than a planet in this case. As WWII rages a Japanese and American soldier are stranded on the same small island. They try to kill each other at first. As time goes by they realize their very survival depends on a truce. Eventually they work together and build a raft. After days on the Pacific Ocean they find another larger group of islands. The uneasy truce becomes shaky again when they find remnants of Japanese and American occupation on the main island. Up to this point an excellent movie. In fact I was say close to flawless movie since the acting, sets, scenery, music, directing and all the rest are incredible. SPOILER ALERT: Now the reason I didn't give it four or five stars is because they kill them off with a single stray artillery shell in the original ending. You will be enthralled with the wonderful acting and really care for these two characters. Then to suddenly watch their lifes snuffed out just so some writer or director could make their point that war is bad didn't impress me. If someone didn't think we get that point long before the ending of this movie, they don't give much credit to the audience. Why they didn't use the alternate ending with the soldiers walking off their separate ways is beyond me. Be sure to look at the alternate ending and see if you agree this should have been the original ending. Still well worth owning.",3.0

"This is an early film (his first) of comedian /actor/director Woody Allen starring himself in the lead as Virgil Starkwell a bungling wannabe bank robber whose hijinks land him in prisons, in bed with a lovely girl and the halls of academia as an expert on crime. In this film we can see the outlines of Woody's seemingly endless love affair with early black and white crime and film noir classics. There is a little more use of sight gags here than in latter films but through it all Woody is still the funny bumbling New York Jewish kid that a long series of films will explore in greater detail. The use of an old time newsreel announcer to describe and set the framework of the film and detail the action is an interesting twist. Not the best Woody Allen film but a good look at the niche that he created for himself in American urban comedy/ social commentary cinema.",3.0
"Long before Christopher Guest mastered the genre, Woody Allen made a comic mockumentary of the life of a failed bank robber named Virgil Starkwell complete with newsreel footage, excerpts from interviews with people in his life (including his embarrassed parents in Groucho Marx masks) and a stentorian voiceover narration by Jackson Beck. This fitfully funny 1969 comedy marks Allen's feature film debut as a triple threat - director, writer (with early partner Mickey Rose) and star, and it shows the earmarks of his later visual style even if the laughs are not always there.

Lacking an actual storyline, the movie takes us through Starkwell's life from shoplifting bubblegum machines as a youngster to bank robberies to finding the ideal woman to prison and so on and so on. This is Allen at his purest with focus on often hilarious sight gags and self-deprecating one-liners without his later forays into the complexities of the human condition. In fact, this is probably the only time that Allen has played a screen character without any intellectual pretensions. The closest he comes is pretending to be a cellist with the Philharmonic to the girl of his dreams, a pretty laundress named Louise. The best gags are probably the prison shirt-folding machine, the bank robbery where Starkwell's badly handwritten note is passed around the staff to interpret, the escaped chain gang coming into the old woman's house, the prison vaccine experiment that turns Starkwell into a Hassidic rabbi, and my favorite, the totally impossible scene where he drives a car inside a blackmailing woman's house chasing her around.

Of less interest is the romance between Starkwell and Louise, who is portrayed as self-conscious and rather mealy-mouthed. Allen's usual generosity with actresses has not yet developed at this point, and Janet Margolin is forced to play Louise quite passively despite her beauty. For a movie that is supposed to take place between the 1940's through the early 1960's, it certainly looks and feels like hippie-era 1969, especially with the Austin Powers-style music over the chase scenes. Allen's first wife Louise Lasser (yes, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman) has a funny cameo as an early girlfriend. There are no extras with the 2004 MGM DVD package.",3.0
"This early Woody Allen comedy is often quite a bit of fun.  Check out some of the other reviews here, which recount a few of the better sight gags and funny scenarios to see what I mean.  Just be warned, though, that Woody still had a way to go before the jokes got really sharp and the storylines moved with supreme smoothness.  I don't want to overstate the criticism, as ""Take the Money and Run"" never sinks to boredom, or choppiness in the story telling.  It's just that Woody's best period was still three or four films ahead of him at this point and a certain lack of polish is still evident.  But the movie is still definitely worth a look, even though I'm not as big a fan of it as some other folks.

Unfortunately, the full-frame version of ""Take the Money and Run"" is the one most easily available on DVD in this country.  On the plus side, however, I noticed no obvious and offensive cropping of the image while I watched the movie (though I guess something must have been cropped somewhere to create the full-frame image).  Also on the plus side, the print is sharp, clear, and bright.

But, alas, like most DVDs of Woody's films, there are basically no extras, just a trailer.  But we've come to expect that from Mr. Allen, haven't we?  To his credit, the man doesn't like to go on and on about his movies, preferring to let them speak for themselves.",3.0
"From around this early time, before Allen truly crystallized his peculiar brand of a nebbish neurotic New York man, I had enjoyed Bananas and Sleeper for their sheer creativity and comic pizzazz. I thought Take the Money and Run would be in a similar league but unfortunately it's not.
A prescient newsreel style voiceover constitutes the narrative device of choice, putting its personal spin on events as it recounts the life of our doozy criminal, Virgil, a nerd turn notorious gangster. It is this wry commentary that lends the film its pseudo-documentary flavor, and the plot is pretty much a patchwork of such clips and thus not exactly awash with consistent humor. Certain scenes are pretty funny though, e.g., the protagonist's escape attempt at the prison that involved a bar of soap and some shoe polish, or a bizarre incident with a chain gang, etc.
For Allen fans, it's a no brainer: you'll see it anyway. For the rest of the viewers, I'd recommend giving other more polished comedies from Allen a try before you get to this erratic early-in-the-game cameo. It simply hasn't stood the test of time.",3.0
"""Take the Money and Run"" will not entertain or humour those of us familiar with the rest of Woody Allen's sparkling oeuvre. Its only real value is as a curiosity.
This is Woody establishing his template for later movies, i.e., nebbishy loser, a failure at his chosen occupation, acquires an impossibly beautiful girlfriend, and tries to do right.
The mockumentary style he chooses to utilize for the most part works nicely. At times, though, its tone feels uneven, floating from documentary to narrative fiction and back to documentary. If he had stuck to one style the power of the satire would be much stronger. And now that I think of it, choosing to do an obviously mannered genre parody with your first film is somewhat dubious. It sent him on a path that would lead to the well-meaning but uneven films ""Bananas"" and ""Sleeper"". Not till ""Love and Death"" would he make a film where the parody serves the story rather than the story serving the parody.
While most of the jokes feel forced, there are some truly hilarious proto-Woody moments. The marching band scene (with Woody gamely trying to keep up while tugging along his cello and a chair) knocked me down flat with laughter. And a moment late in the film, with Woody trying to conduct a substantive interview with a rambling subject (Woody keeps saying ""Get to the point"" from behind the camera), is a most effective moment in terms of parodying the documentary form. But other than these, and few others, I was disappointed by the humour. A running gag, where Woody's glasses repeatedly get stomped on by authority figures, was flat the first time I saw it and got flatter each subsequent time.
This film is definitely at the bottom of my personal list of favourite Woody Allen movies. It may be because I prefer his dexterous verbal wit to the juvenile sight gags and physical humour he employs here, or that he had yet to find his footing with this, his first outing. Either way, if you take a pass on ""Take the Money and Run"", you won't be missing too much.",3.0
"'Take the Money and Run' is the first film directed, written by, and starring Woody Allen.  While nowhere near the debute of Orson Welles, Allen shows considerable comic promise as he attempts to translate his wierd and wild though shyly neurotic stage act onto the silver screen.
First of all, this movie is hilarious.  No doubt about it, Allen's mockumentary about a looser con is top-notch comedy.  Allen's use of gags are endless (re. glasses, rabbis, soap gun, etc).  They are well-deployed and brilliant.  Allen's dialogue is equally funny, the best line in the film being, ""After twenty minutes, I had decided I wanted to spend my entire life with her.  And after a half hour, I'd given up the idea of takin her purse"".
Yet, in his first film our schlemiel of a director is bound to run into difficulties.  At times it appears he is trying to hard to be funny.  Forced humor never works, and it works even less in Allen's case.  Some jokes just seem overdone.  Then the movie itself goes on for about a half hour too long.
Nevertheless, despite its flaws, this is a great movie of good comedic quality, and should not be dismissed merely because it lacks the artistic brilliance of Allen's later works.",3.0

"I approached The Avengers with some trepidation, courtesy of several negative reviews, including one Australian critic who proclaimed it the worst movie he had ever seen. Having been one of just 42 people in the  cinema when I saw the film, I was wondering just how bad it was going to  be. My fears were unfounded. It was entertaining, amusing and suitably  peculiar. I say suitably peculiar as, being a fan of the 60's TV series,  any deviation from the concept would have been totally unsatisfactory. The  movie, set in the sixties, was not a nostalgia trip (something which would  have been a distraction) but still managed to capture the essence of that  period. The plot was as silly as any in the TV series, thank goodness, and  the villain (Sean Connery) was appropriately unbelievable. It wasn't one of  Connery's best performances but he obviously enjoyed hamming it up  outrageously. You have to enjoy it for that alone. Don't fall into the trap  of comparing Uma Thurman and Ralph Feines with Diana Rigg and Patrick  Macnee. They play their parts differently, not better or worse, just  different. The comparison is irrelevant. The cinematography is excellent,  as are the special effects. Overall, a highly enjoyable film that should  appeal to fans of the genre, and Avengers fan specifically. Not a great  movie, but a good production. Its lack of success is unfortunate, and the  bad press overdone. It's likely to attain some degree of cult status within  a couple of years.",3.0

Definitely not up to the standards of the TV series. Ralph Fiennes is a second rate John Steed. Uma Thurman is a little better as Emma Peele but making her an expert in every science is a little much. Having two people running the agency is too much. Having the man code named Mother and the woman code named Father is too cute by far.,3.0

"This movie has been thouroughly torpedoed by critics and audiences alike - fuelled, no doubt, by the severe lashings Mr. Connery himself doled out during post-production. But while there's plenty reason to dislike it (a plot petering out in an insipid ending, misuse of Mr. Fiennes' acting qualities, discontinuities in the filming, etc etc), there's even more to enjoy, in a camp sort of way.
The scene with Connery in teddybear-disguise is a hilarious spoof of James Bond's Spectre-meetings, some of the Dali-esque setpieces are intruiging and in general the whole film is so outrageously ridiculous that you won't gain anything by missing it, to say the least. Comparisons with the original, authentic, masterly Avengers-tv-series (with Patrick MacNee and Diana Rigg) shouldn't be made - the film doesn't stand up to it and if it purports to do so, it's its major weakness. It's just entertaining - more than the weaker entries in the Bond-saga, of which there are several. Particularly neglected (in my opinion) are the hallucinatory opening credits in which Joel McNeely's music blends exceedingly well.",3.0

"The 60s' Brit TV show was never one of my faves. It was a low-budget James Bond spoof, which Bond itself was as a spoof of Cold War spies in general,, though not low-budget. Here, despite three big name stars, the film never quite takes off, seeming instead like nothing so much as a, well, high-budget TV show. In the 60s, the sexual tension between agent John Steed and Mrs. Peel was highly suggestive stuff. Today, it seems quaint, almost literary. Never mind the plot here. It's a mishmash of more Bond crossed with Lord of the Rings special effects. Some mumbojumbo about a megalomaniac controlling the weather. The whole point of this movie is archness. Sometimes it works and often it's just tedium. Watch if there is nothing else.",3.0

"In an age of director's cuts and extended additions, the irony is that the films that need restoration the most are the very ones that never get it. Thus the Weinsteins chose not to restore The Fall of the Roman Empire, MGM/UA chose not only to ignore the existing four-hour rough-cut version of Tony Richardson's The Charge of the Light Brigade but actually put out a cut version of the theatrical version and the much-troubled 1998 movie version of The Avengers will never be seen as it was originally intended. It's not the catastrophe its often portrayed, but the studio only had themselves to blame for the over-reaction by violating the quid-pro-quo relationship with the press by not screening it for the critics, a public relations disaster that lead to many publications imposing a blacklist on articles about their films for months after and picking it as their turkey of the year.

Warner Bros. 75th anniversary year was certainly not good one, with flop after flop turning their planned celebrations into commiserations. Perhaps in any other year there would have been less pressure on trying to turn an always optimistically surreal cult item into a blockbuster despite increasingly bad word of mouth, but by the time it emerged from lengthy post-production, the film was covered from head to toe in self-inflicted wounds. What had started out with a two-hour plus running time went to a 101-minute compromise cut to a released version that ran only 81 minutes without credits with Michael Kamen's original score replaced by a quickie effort from Joel McNeely as they tried to unsuccessfully make it more conventional to an audience unfamiliar with the series while alienating the original fans. It's just a surprise they didn't try to edit it down further to the length of a TV episode - even the troubled movie version of The Saint only lost its last 20 minutes. In the process they simply turned an interesting misfire into a much shorter, more confusing misfire and ended up with something too surreal for mainstream audiences, and too mainstream for Avengers fans. (The BFI was offered the chance to screen and preserve the original cut in 1999, but all too typically blew it by not bothering to return the studio's calls!)

The loss of the original (and heavily trailered) opening was certainly a huge mistake. Instead of seeing Mrs Peel (or is it?) breaking into and destroying a weather station, something that triggers the plot (a variation on both the original show's A Surfeit of H20 and Our Man Flint with a weather-controlling eccentric millionaire holding the world to ransom), the film now opens with Steed taking on policemen, milkmen and machine-gun toting nannies with only his bowler and brolly - an enjoyable enough introductory scene but not as essential to understanding what's going on. That's just the first of many plot holes the film is left with, but they're still the least of the film's problems.

On the plus side, Ralph Fiennes wisely doesn't attempt a Patrick McNee impersonation as Steed, opting for a more formal, slightly reserved approach that lacks Macnee's effortless bonhomie but works well enough on its own terms. Jim Broadbent makes a good `Mother' and Eileen Atkins (in a cameo originally intended for Diana Rigg) effortlessly steals her few scenes. But if they're all on good form, just about everyone else isn't. Indeed, there's miscasting on an epic scale here - Fiona Shaw overacting for England yet again as `Father,' Eddie Izzard exuding all the menace of a fluffy kitten and Uma Thurman delivering a turn bad enough to make you sorry they didn't cast Elizabeth Hurley as Mrs Peel instead. You feel almost sorry for her and wonder how she ever got another job after this - she can't do comedy, she can't do the accent, she can't do sophisticated, she can't do the banter and most of her action scenes hit the cutting room floor, which reduces her to not much more than a clotheshorse. That there's absolutely no chemistry between her and Fiennes is just another nail in the coffin.

Sadly it's a performance more than matched by what originally seemed the film's great casting coup. Sean Connery, once again showing the keen commercial instinct that led him to turn down X-Men, Lord of the Rings and The Mask of Zorro, gives a career-worst performance in his first role as a villain since 1959's Tarzan's Greatest Adventure and 1984's Sword of the Valiant. Looking like Windsor Davies playing a dirty old man but without the restraint, his introductory single-entendre scene with Thurman is painful to watch as she flounders and he mistimes every line - it's the kind of thing you'd expect in a Robbie Moffat film where amateur actors only get one take and it goes in the picture whether they fluff it or not. It cannot be stressed enough just how absolutely awful he is for much of the film, and considering how often Connery's double stood in for him Peter Sellers-style even on non-action scenes because of the star's feuds with the director and producer (shades of LXG) you find yourself wondering if his better moments may not even be him.

There's a lot about it that's good - the teddy bear scene is spot on and worthy of the original show while Patrick McNee's cameo non-appearance is fun - and a lot that isn't - Roger Pratt's dour photography overcompensates for the primary colors of Stuart Craig's production design and Anthony Powell's costumes. Yet while it's a mess that often stops making sense thanks to the unsubtle re-editing, it's still surprisingly watchable, with just enough moments that do work and give a hint of what could have been to keep you soldiering on through the patches that fall flat. It's just a shame we'll probably never see the film the way it was originally intended to judge it on its own merits rather than the studio's second-guessing.

"If you have the 20th Century Fox double-sided DVD's from years ago, keep them and DO NOT buy this set as a replacement for seaasons 1-4. Another reviewer has suggested that the new Shout seasons 1-4 have ""video quality beyond superior to those awful two-sided discs"". They DO NOT! I have both sets (bought this set on that reviewer's comments) and compared several episodes from each season 1-4 on a side-by-side basis. They are IDENTICAL in video quality.

In fact, of great disappointment are Shout's seasons 5 and 6, which are noticeably poorer in video quality as compared to seasons 1-4. It looks as though Shout simply took the 20th Century Fox two-sided DVD's and duplicated them while slapping some old VHS recordings of seasons 5 and 6 onto their new DVD's. Shout, clearly, does not want to spend any money doing digital remastering. Additionally, this new Shout version has no subtitles in any of the seasons, unlike the original 20th Century Fox release.

Still, it's better than not having seasons 5 and 6, so I gave Shout 3 stars for releasing seasons 5 and 6, but Shout is not the high quality organization claimed to be. The seasons 5 and 6 are being released separately. Buy them instead of duplicating your seasons 1-4 with this complete series offering. Of course, if you don't have any seasons, then buy this complete series.",3.0
"I agree with the other reviewers here in that this film does not represent the best work of its stars, and the movie as a whole probably fell short of its aims. But there are too many good (and highly original) scenes too write it off altogether. (eg. the optical illusion looking down on Emma Peel as she tries to escape down a staircase yet ends up on the same floor).

Also, the romantic restraint of the two lead characters makes a refreshing change from the contemporary norm, which is either based on tease & innuendo, or can't-wait-to-rip-each-others-clothes-off.

As for the teddy bears scene that has been so blasted, I found it so unexpected & bizarre that I had to laugh. And surely that was the intention of the film...

Anyway, I enjoyed it. Just watch it with an open mind and, for God's sake, don't take it seriously. I especially recommend this film if you are a fan of English architecture (there are some great shots of interiors & exteriors of both modern & historical), or a sucker for Uma Thurman's stylish warmth (like me :))",3.0
"I have pretty high standards when it comes to movies...AND TV shows, and I can't, for the life of me, see what is so gawrsh-awful about this movie. Granted, the superfeminine Diana Rigg isn't playing Mrs. Peel...and yes, dapper, veddy British Patrick McNee isn't parlaying Steed, but they did pretty well with what they had, and had a plotline that you were actually able to FOLLOW, to boot! This is something I remember the TV show NOT having...most of the stories were just platforms for Emma to be stylish in, with no clues, no O. Henry, no real DISCERNIBLE plot thread to speak of...just the barest of storylines....

The story involves Steed first MEETING Emma, (again!) and Emma being a major renaissance woman...doctor, meteorologist, psychologist, etc....the woman holds more degrees than a Kelvin thermometer!! The film opens up with Steed being tested for reflexes and skills as he strolls through a mockup of a British village. Pram-pushing nannies throw knives, pub drinkers try to run him over, bobbies attack him unbidden...he comes through with flying colors. Switch to Emma Peel's fabulous flat in London...she gets the call from the elite arm of the BSS that Steed works for after it's discovered that she, or a double of her, has sabotaged her own project.

What follows are chase scenes from hell; some VERY mannered acting; Sean Connery chewing the scenery as a megalomaniac meteorologist and businessman who wants to, what else, RULE THE WORLD...by controlling the weather. Steed and Emma go after him when it's discovered, unequivocally, that it IS a double of Emma sabotaging her project...and in fact, attempting to kill the original Mrs. Peel!

The cinematography and art direction for this film is EXCELLENT. The music, however, except for the lifts from the series, seems somewhat inappropriate and overly ponderous. There are some hair-raising chase scenes in the film, one with a fleet of mechanical, anti-personnel hornets, and Connery's acting is perfect for his role. The style of the series is recaptured nicely, especially with the villians' confab scene in teddy bear mufti in the middle of the film, and Emma wandering through what looks like M.C. Escher's summer home.

All in all, the phlegmatic bearing of Fiennes and Thurman in the face of it all remind you an AWFUL lot of the original Steed and Emma, and the climax between Steed, Emma, Connery, Eddie Izzard, Fiona Shaw, as the very teutonic-looking ""Father"", (supposedly one of the GOOD guys,) and Connery's henchmen is fairly entertaining.

While it may never win a spot on AFI's top 100, it IS diverting. My one complaint is...why did they have to pick UMA THURMAN...Ms. Box Office Poison herself, to play Emma? Was Nicole Kidman busy? Emma Thompson? Miranda Richardson? WHY A YANK??!! And ESPECIALLY her?? Didn't ""Batman & Robin"" tell them ANYTHING??!!",3.0
"I never saw the orginal Avengers series, but judging by the reviews, I think I ought to.  I love Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes which is why I bought the movie, and they did a heck of job styling up their characters in post-60s mod.  But The plot was completely crap and disjointed.  Someone on the editting floor was not paying attention to what they were doing.

Nonetheless, entertaining enough to pass a boring day.",3.0
"This film is absolutely amazing.  Watch it and simply stare in awe at how terrible it really is.  Hollywood still hasn't got the hint that you do not make movies out of old tv shows.  Interestingly enough, The Avengers is a more enteraining film than Hollywood sludge like Charlie's Angels, which is 100% Grade-A Crrrrrrrap.  Why?  Because it is so bad that it actually becomes amusing, unlike Charlie's Angels or Starsky & Hutch which are just plain bad with no amusement at all.  My fascination with the Avengers is just wondering A.) What was the director thinking?  B). What were the stars thinking when they signed on for this film?  The director must be a terrific salesman, coz I don't think Sean Connery is a moron.  C).  Who gave the stamp of approval that allowed this film to be released into our neighborhood theaters?  I mean, this film had to be viewed and approved by the producers.  It was probably shown to a test audience.  How did it slip through all these cracks and make it's way out?  I think of these things as I watch this film.  You wanna see Sean Connery and his band of criminals dressed as giant teddy bears?  You wanna see America's rather shallow view of the English?(tea dispenser in car, lame attempts at British dry humor)  You want to see ZERO chemistry between the leading man and woman?  You wanna see an invisible man?  You wanna see Ralph Fiennes, normally a very good actor, trying to be cool, but actually looking and acting like a total schmuck(this goes for Uma as well)? Wanna see some of the most unexciting action sequences ever filmed?  You wanna see a 90 minute film that feels like twice the length?  Basically, do you want a 90 minute instructional video to all film students about what not to do, and at the same time chuckle a few times?  Then you can't go wrong with The Avengers.",3.0
"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay back in 1966, I was in the 6th grade and discovered Steed and Emma on TV, and I adored them. So when this film was released, I never expected it to ""live up to"" the originals.

"This big screen productio based on the tv series took alot of hits from the critics-some of it justisfied. However i found this movie to have some redeeming qualities. First of all you had several high quality actors such as Uma Thurman,Sean Connery and Ralph Fiennes. They seemed to be doing a pretty good job but were asked to work with a pretty weak script. I found the special effects and cinematography to be pretty good also. The character interaction was very weak with very little attention given to the reason that Sean Connerys character for instance had such an infacuation with Mrs Peele-that is just one of many weaknesses i found in this film. As stated by film critics one of the main selling points was a chance for Uma Thurman to have her own fashion show(which in itself is not a bad thing).Others critcize it for being so campish and the constant silly banter going on between Mrs. Peel and John Steed. However, give it some credit for trying to stick to the formula that won the original tv series its loyal following. Anyone that follows those episodes will probably agree that this movie more or less stayed along those lines. Anyway,this is another of those movies that i can't really say why but something keeps me popping it back in the dvd player and watching over and over again.",3.0
"Though an ultimate disappointment to AVENGERS fans, and especially to viewers being first introduced to the AVENGERS mythos, the film at least takes a while to show its bad side.  The opening 45 minutes is  smashing-which is perhaps why the ending is so frustrating.
The main  reason for this let-down is not the ridiculousness of the plot. MISSION  IMPOSSIBLE, most Bond films, and even JURASSIC PARK have all had commercial  success with plots that weren't much better than this.  Rather, the failure  of this film comes in my mind from Sean Connery.  If this were the only  example of his acting one had ever seen, one would have difficulty seeing  how the man ever won an Oscar (R).  His performance is truly abysmal.  Yes,  the situations he's placed in and the lines themselves have a certain  hollowness to them, but all meglomaniacs in all action films are, well,  silly.  Though I do think one or two scenes exploring a bit more of de  Wynter's character might've been in order, films have been more satisfying  with less-scripted villains.  The glaring difficulty is that Connery  obviously doesn't *believe* in his character.  It's absolutely obvious that  he's not having fun-even with the good lines.  As a result, we don't  either.
By contrast, Fiennes and Thurman are having the time of their  lives, playing roles that seem to have been tailor-made for them, despite  having originated with other actors.  There are really no scenes which  their presence doesn't immediately help, and one can't help but feel that  if the movie had simply had a different actor cast as the villain, their  chemistry would've gone better appreciated by the viewing public.
(DVD  notes: There are really no additional features on the DVD, which is  surprising.  The production team were all huge fans of the TV show and  spent years trying to bring this puppy to screen.  One would've thought  they'd have been absolutely passionate about trying to explain what had  been a big part of their lives for years.)",3.0

E.g., Good Emma and Bad Emma are obviously ""enhanced""  clones created by de Wynter, whose wife was the template--her huge portrait  hangs in his mansion. (This is not to claim that I've untangled all of the  film's apparent flaws.) I also enjoyed the pervasive umbrella imagery,  'cause brollies are neat.

"I was a fan of the original TV series when the A&E network aired it back in the early 1990's.  I waited with much anticapation when I started to see photos of the film.  Then came the trailer.  WOW!  I couldn't wait  to see the film.  But to find out that the folks at Warner Bros. didn't let  advanced sneak peek for critics to see this, you knew something was wrong.  So there I was waiting to see this and found out how horrible the reviews  were.  When I finally saw the movie I thought scenes were missing.  What  does this mean?  We were jipped!  False advertising from the WB!  The  movie to my mind is OK, but all the missing scenes were in the darn  trailer!  There were really absurd moments (the Teddy Bears were the  funniest to the audience at the theater).  I thought the worst was the lack  of explanation for Bad Emma.  How did she come to be?  The original Steed,  Patrick Macnee reduced to being invisible?  It'd been great to see the two  Steeds side by side.  Uma was OK but sure looked uncomfortable doing a  British accent.  She looked great in the leather outfit though!  Ralph as  Steed I thought was the best acting in film.  Seemed a more silent, maybe  dark Steed?  Connery as the villain was OK but his objections should've  been more realistic.  The Alice character seemed to me the highlight of  this film for something that worked.  The movie did seem to be a combined  mixture of a couple Avenger episodes. But to adapt it as the 1960's was  wrong. They should've put it into the 1990's.  The movie is OK and for that  it ain't so bad.  The missing scenes are needed.  Mrs Peel, we're needed to  find the complete film print edition!",3.0

"This is a film to watch for the sheer audacity. It has the merit of being extremely unpredictable, and bizarre. Patrick MacNee makes an interesting cameo in one bit. Fiennes and Thurman look positively glum throughout,  thinking they'll make a lot of money and run. The set pieces and special  effects, however, are fine, especially Big Ben exploding(ha ha!). Sean  Connery makes an entertaining villain . . . although he can make almost any  film he does watchable, that guy is a REAL actor. But on the whole, if you  want to see a film featuring everything from baddies in teddy bear costumes  to mechanical wasps(that's right) to Uma Thurman in a cat suit(it looks  nice on her actually) and an equally daft and strange plot, then this film  is for you. Total mind candy, but at least it's enjoyable in its own way.",3.0
"I watched the original series with MacNee and Rigg (and even caught Honor Blackman in it). It was cheeky, weird and campy. All these elements make the transition to the big screen version. What's missing is the soul of the  television series.
I'm not sure, though, that the original would play  well today without some updating. Like many things from the 60's, it was  something very much of its time. Look at the Connery Bond films...they  wouldn't be as accepted today as they were then.
The time frame within  gives us a context. Without the context, the material doesn't always work.  The original series for all of the well written episodes had episodes that  were poorly plotted messes. Like the Star Trek series of films, the past  seems to add an luster to these dramas that they don't always  deserve.
Still, the original series was always a cut above the average  American television programs. It was always witty and the cast, more often  than not, could pull off the show precisely because of their charm. This  along with the bizarre elements that would crop up in the scripts made The  Avengers always good fun. The film doesn't completely pull it off, but  there are moments that work as well as the original series.
Fiennes  brings his own intrepetation to Steed. To have expected him to play it like  MacNee is pretty unrealistic and it probably wouldn't have worked. The same  goes for Thurman. However, for me she's the weak link in the  cast.
Connery plays his part over the top. It works precisely because it  worked in the original series. Expectations can be daunting and this film  had too many expectations. Time will soften the blow...",3.0
actors not well matched; tone not like that of book,3.0
"Imagine having your favorite book cast by two of your favorite actors for film. To me Hinds and Morton had exactly the right look for the characters. I've enjoyed the depth of their acting in other projects. They are both wonderfully talented. I anticipated this version with eagerness.

Alas reader,  the screenplay. What were they thinking? The spirit of the piece was way, way off in key scenes.  Jane is rolling her eyes at times and they both speak so abusively to each other for a lot of it. The first meeting was like that, very nasty to each other there.

But what really was off was Hines  yelling  all the time.  I heard his radio take on Rochester and his characterization was much calmer with more control. This Rochester is more bombastic than likeable. Seriously, I cant see what attracts Jane to him! These yelling torrents ruin key moments like that first meeting for example.  However, the stay with me scene (after the aborted wedding) was the worst. He was actually horribly bullying and abusive here. He throws things, he hurts her. He blames Jane for not excepting his view. He excuses himself with a ""What was I supposed to do, tell you the truth?"" kind of attitude. As she leaves he's calling out ""That's right leave, its just like you."" WHAT is he talking about?? Rochester is supposed to be heartbroken  NOT hateful. It was hard to watch such a total bolt away from the novel here!  And what's with all the open mouthed ""kissing"" when he proposes? (By the way, he yells here too!)

But there were scenes I really liked.  His confession of his past life to Jane is well staged and poignant. Watching the sunrise together was nice. When she just returns to Thornfield from visiting the aunt (that we never get to see-one moment she leaves the next she returns). The scenery and sets are all very pleasing. I especially loved the camera work during the party scene where Jane is remembering Blanche and Rochester singing. Bertha was a hoot. Shopping at Milcott was good, except for the insertion of Blanche there, Rochester is actually nice to Adel at times. Also, the ending, though the dialog is not exactly from the book, was extremely touching. They are both excellent in this scene. And a postscript scene with children and voice over was a nice touch. These are excellent actors. It would, I feel, been first rate to have these truly talented people in a better adaptation.",3.0
"A lot of reviews of this set were great, especially the episode that related to picture (Queen of Sin). I've been an Avengers fan since its original airings, & I've always found Miss Peel right attractive, but Queen of Sin is the worst episode I've looked at on DVD so far. Her outfit is not really that sexy, & the story to that episode was absolutely lousy (& loud). If you're buying individual sets & not the whole Emma Peel megaset, then skip this set; don't let the cover fool you. The rest of the episodes in this set are better however, so if you're making complete year purchases, then buy this set too....you decide.",3.0

Ciaran's eyes were worth watching it, that's all I've left to say.",3.0
"I am puzzled as to why the director, producers, and writers of this so-called adaptation of Jane Eyre decided to stray so far from the actual novel by Charlotte Bront. Not only were several key scenes deleted, they chose to put in words and scenes that were never in the book. So why did I give it a three-star rating? Well, this is because of the wonderful acting by the main characters.

Samantha Morton, whose luminous beauty is portrayed subtly here, plays plain Jane Eyre, whose intellect and high moral character is wonderfully and credibly depicted here. Mr. Rochester is played by the consummate Ciaran Hinds who first impressed me in his performance as the lead character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mayor-of-Casterbridge/dp/B0000AQS3P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mayor of Casterbridge</a>&nbsp;and who delivered a finely nuanced performance as the once thwarted in love Captain Frederick Wentworth in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Persuasion/dp/B001DUDKEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Persuasion</a>. Both actors deliver credible, compelling performances and the age gap is certainly true to the novel, though many of the dialogue and scenes may not. The chemistry is believable, though not the best of all the adaptations.

If you watch closely, you'll recognize several other familiar faces in British period drama. The wonderful Gemma Jones from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Duchess-of-Duke-Street-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B001ADXWYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Duchess of Duke Street - The Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sense-And-Sensibility/dp/B0019TYQ38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sense And Sensibility</a>&nbsp;as Mrs. Fairfax, Elizabeth Garvie from 1980's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-and-Prejudice-The-Complete-BBC-Miniseries-VHS/dp/B00004WG2X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride and Prejudice: The Complete BBC Miniseries [VHS</a>] as Diana Rivers, and Rupert Penry-Jones of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Chapel-The-Ripper-Returns/dp/B005G172Q8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Chapel: The Ripper Returns</a>as St. John Rivers.

The cinematography is beautiful enough though the score is forgettable, and ultimately, I would rate this as one of the weakest adaptations of Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre. That being said, I would still recommend watching it if you're a fan of Hinds and Morton and also if only to do some comparisons with other adaptations.",3.0
"The essence of my rant:  Samantha Morton good, Ciaran Hinds bad. Adaptation so-so. Pacing of film too hurried.

Although this is a more technically faithful adaptation than some I've seen, it was more of a gothic cartoon than a Monet impression of Bronte's novel. A good screenplay of a classic is deft in its choices of what passages to highlight and what to skip, what dialogue will be the best tribute to the original work but bring the characters to life;  what will illuminate the spirit of the novel. This lingered too long on some scenes and skipped over others, so that anyone who has not read the book might wonder what just happened, and it went too hard on some characters and too soft on others, making it harder to grasp their places in the story.

Samantha Morton is a fine choice for Jane--she played it in a mousy, understated way, with a few glimmers of a suppressed personality that was a decent depiction of the character.  And she looked nineteen, which is nice.  However, this served to highlight the creepiness factor when Ciaran Hinds as Edward Rochester comes growling and cussing into the story, acting more deranged and dangerous than his imprisoned wife.  The Hitleresque mustache, looming posture and unblinking stare make him more menacing than sad and brooding.  He barks and snarls his lines with no hint of the intended facetious humor and vulnerability that make Rochester a redeemable character.  When he does make romantic overtures toward Jane, it feels repellent and lecherous.  Not sexy at all.  It seems like Jane needs an intervention rather than finds the love of her life.

Want a better, more lush, fleshed-out, warm-hearted version?  Although he does not answer the Rochester character in looks as well as Hinds, Tobey Stephens in the Masterpiece Theatre production is way, way better:  rude and gruff by turns, guilty over his inability to be kind to Adele, with a tortured sense of duty to Bertha, his expressions and manner soften, his banter with Jane is amusing and the pivotal romantic scene is tender, fulfilling in the way it should be. Wilson is lovely, plain one moment and a shining pearl the next--perfect casting there.  Basically, you can picture Ruth Wilson and Stephens making love, and the thought does not make you shudder.  There you have it:  this should be a love story.",3.0
"Jane is an orphan who first becomes a teacher at the rather grim school for orphans where she was raised, then takes a job as governess for a little french girl who is the natural child of a cranky Mr. Rochester. She can't help loving him, and eventually he is equally in love with her, in spite of the attempts of a wealthy neighbor to hook him. They plan to wed, and are at the altar when a man gallops up to the church and announces that the wedding must not take place.

From there you have to either read the book or see the movie; I've told you enough already. Modern audiences will be shouting at her not to be such a prude, but this is Victorian era, after all. And the girl has guts, which finally serves her well. The movie is well done, but it's a pretty bleak story.",3.0
"On a scale of 1-10, this Jane Eyre is a 5, maybe 6.

While Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton are talented performers, this version is just overall lacking. Ciaran Hinds come off as a little too brutish for my taste and certain parts are rushed through.

While one cannot expect a 2 hour movie to encompass every detail of a novel, it is expected that the production team keeps to original novel to a certain degree, which is not the case with this one.

A better JE is the 1974 Michael Jayston/Sorcha Cusick JE, the 1983 Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clark JE or even the 2006 Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson JE.",3.0
"although poorly directed, the casting is good.  I was certain Mr Hind could be a good Rochester from his understated performance in Persuasion.

However the characters as protrayed in this version of Jane Eyre badly need more ""understatement"" .  Emotional restraint does not seem to have been demanded of them... or perhaps the director thought this film could be called Jane Eyre with no need to be at all true to the  tone of the book.  Such in-your-face emoting simply turns the film into a sloppy pot boiler. And probably embarasses even the well chosen cast",3.0
"I'm a big Jane Eyre fan, and the book is one of my favorites; thus, I've seen most of the different versions of this famous classic. I loved Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke (I thought the dialogues and Dalton's portrayal of Rochester were unforgettable) and Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson (I loved the chemistry between them) versions. I was hoping that this adaptation was also great especially with Ciaran Hinds in it. However, I was somewhat disappointed. I understand that this version is much shorter than above mentioned adaptations, but still not showing such important scenes like aunt Reed deathbed confession or not giving any explanation who St. John and his sisters (in this version only one sister) are to Jane were disappointing. Also I thought that the scene with Jane and Rochester meeting Blanche while on the way to shopping was useless. However, if you are not familiar with the novel or other adaptations you might like this one. It's basically poor governess falling in love with a master of the house. I gave it 3 stars because of the beautiful scenery, costumes, and settings, and also I thought that Jane and Rochester's age difference was more appropriately portrayed than in other versions. If you're not familiar with Jane Eyre story, I would recommend that you pick up the book or watch Dalton/Clarke version (it's most faithful to the novel) before watching this movie.",3.0
"Having read Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte in high school and having viewed many version of Jane Eyre, I believe this version is not the best or even the second best - and hence, not worth a person's time or money.

My reasons are as follows:
(1) The film is too short, leaving out too much of the novel. For instance, it completely skips Jane's conversation with her Aunt Reed when her aunt is on her deathbed.

(2) The acting is not as good as might be desired. The actors playing Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester just do not have the correct chemisty. (Disclaimer: I must admit that I always liked Timothy Dalton's performance in the 1983 BBC version, so my judgement might be impaired)

(3) The film does not develop the relationship between Jane and St. John Rivers nearly as much as it should have. Hence, it might be difficult for the viewer who has not read the novel to realize what a difficult choice Jane must make when she decides to refuse St. John's offer.

I recommend the following:

(1) Jane Eyre (1983) with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke - a BBC production totaling 311 minutes

(2) Jane Eyre (2006) with Ruth Wilson (II); Toby Stephens - a Masterpiece Theatre production totaling 228 minutes

Note:
However, I enjoyed this version more than the Jane Eyre (2003) Miramax production with  William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg.",3.0
"This version is bad in so many ways. First of all the movie is too short to relay the entire Jane Eyre novel and to touch on all of the key elements of the book. Jane herself is boring and emotionless, asks too many questions and incredibly bossy. Rochester is alright, except his barking tone in several scenes and his somewhat lusty attitude towards Jane.
Rochester's and Jane's romance develops too suddenly without giving it the proper time to build up, thus they have little to no chemistry.
Many important things are not included in the book such as Jane learning of her rich uncle and receiving her inheritance after meeting the Rivers.  New and rediculous scenes are created such as Rochester and Jane running into Blanche Ingram in town while shopping for their wedding. Blanche herself is unattractive and too nice.
Most of the people in this movie act out of character. Seems like the writers and directors forgot to read the book or decided to create their own story of Jane Eyre.
Skip this and watch the 2006 version.",3.0
"It is beyond me how anyone can say this is the best version of Bronte's novel.  Beyond the highly truncated screenplay which makes little attempt to be faithful to the novel, both Morton and Hinds are horribly miscast.  I love both these actors and was initially excited to see them in these roles -- until I sat down to watch it.  Hinds made a wonderful Capt. Wentworth (and many other roles) but as Rochester all he does is shout and bellow his way thru the story.  His Rochester is entirely one-note, a very shallow performance on his part -- there's no dimension, no spark, no inner life.  He seems to have viewed the role as just a cliched cartoonish gothic hero - he doesn't approach the character with any seriousness.  Morton is equally shallow in the role - neither actor seems to have taken their characters seriously.  There are good production values and Morton and Hinds are good enuf that some good moments come thru.  This certainly is superior to the William Hurt/Zeffereli version, but then that's not too difficult.  Even the recent flawed Toby Stephens version is superior to this one as well.  Best versions: 1983 Dalton/Clarke, 1973 Jayston/Cusack, 1970s Scott/York, 1940 Welles/Fontaine",3.0
"I have this version of ""Jane Eyre"" on VHS, and I like it, but can't understand all words, which is why I'm wanting it on DVD.  I agree with one reviewer who disliked Ciaran Hinds' overacting as Mr. Rochester.  However, I'm interested in this version because of him, and Samantha Morton.

Samantha is amazing to me here, as she, if you can believe it, also plays timid little Harriet Smith in Jane Austen's ""Emma"" (A&E version).  What a difference in personality and character!!  And so convincing!

And Ciaran Hinds plays Wentworth in Jane Austen's ""Persuasion"" with Amanda Root as Anne, and of course, he's nothing like Mr. Rochester.

Both ""Emma"" and ""Persuasion"" mentioned above have sub-titles.  I haven't checked yet to see if this version on DVD of ""Jane Eyre"" offers sub-titles, but if it doesn't, I'll be terribly disappointed, and will not purchase it.",3.0
"i've seen my share of adaptations of this great story and i'm convinced that there is just too much going on to be able to fit it into 108 minutes of film. still this is pleasurable and i would give it 3.5 stars if allowed.

if given a longer production and more loyalty to the book, i could imagine this would have been a particularly wonderful adaptation. ciaran hinds and samantha morton are wonderful as rochester and jane. i really enjoy watching their performances. i can feel their frustrations and passions. their conversations are powerful although condensed. hinds is an amazing actor, and i enjoyed his portrayal. morton - although hindered by a short script/movie - was excellent. i am convinced morton's portrayal of jane eyre is the best out of all the adaptations i have seen. this makes it particularly disappointing that she (and hinds) were not allowed to fully incorporate all the details of the book, spread out over hours of film. ah yes indeedy, that would be sweet.

so i think the only 'problem' i have with this adaptation is the length and the resulting lack of true-to-book dialogue and story-lines somewhat external to the rochester/jane focus, such as her prolonged visit to her dying aunt, and the real way she met up with mr. rivers and his sisters, and how she inherited a fortune from her uncle. of these ommited or condensed things, i especially miss the grand debates between jane and edward. it doesnt allow the viewer to fully experience the chase, to savor their growing desperate love and passion. (the dalton/clarke 1983 version and the jayston/cusack 1973 version both are long features which follow the book much more closely, if that is what you are looking for.)

however, the condensed story and deviations from the book do not take away from the actor's performances. for example, i found the final scene particularly wonderful. when she finds him a broken man, and he tries to cast her off for her own good, she refuses, and he cries for all his past pains and and present joys. hinds, as i said, is amazing.",3.0
"This is a so so adaptation of the novel into a film. I suppose they had to cut certain plot elements out while creating a motion picture screenplay and I appreciate that. This is a MOVIE not a book in moving pictures. But still, there were a few things that could have made the film even more fantastic and wonderful:

1.) The replacement of Mr. Brockelhurst as head of Lowood school would have been a happy incident in this dark film. It would have satisfied the desire for such a wicked man to get his just desserts.

2.) There was no point changing the character of St. John Rivers who is supposed to be stoic and unemotional to this engaging, flirtatious character in the film. It only made her rejection of him bittersweet since he had been nothing but kind to her from the beginninig.

3.) Why couldn't they show her coming into the 20,000 pounds from her uncle. This happy coincidence is something that can only happen in a film and they should have taken advantage of it. She can end up RICH AND HAPPY.

The plus side is that I suppose JAne's suffering is not as prolonged as it is in the book. There's just enough suffering to not make it insipid. Also, the actors who play Mr. Rochester and Jane do a really good job as do the rest of the cast. There is a lot of using the eyes and body to act not just words. I adored the music which made the whole thing really melodramatic and everything such a novel from such a literary period in such an adaptation should be.",3.0
"With two such fine performers as Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton, and with Charlotte Bronte's masterful story, I could not believe that this version of Jane Eyre would be anything but enjoyable.  Sadly, I was disappointed.  I think the problem lies with the screenplay. A complex story was reduced to 2 hours, which meant that key plot and character development had to be sacrificed.  Hinds and Morton just did not have enough to work with.  Stick with the Timothy Dalton version, it is far better.",3.0
"Started off slowly but with more location shots getting better.  It gets confusing sometimes because  the same writer does not write all the episodes - same for the director - it breaks up the continuity,  But, I missed this series when it was first broadcast and so enjoying it now  - a little better with each season.",3.0
"I wish someone could comment on the picture quality of the DVD.  I have purchased about 20 DVD movies and rented countless more, and I thought all of them looked just fine.  This is the first one I have come across whose picture resolution/sharpness resembles that of a slightly worn-out VHS tape.
As for the movie, Samantha Morton was a wonderful Jane Eyre and Ciaran Hinds was a pretty good Mr. Rochester. Knowing what I know now about the DVD, I might still have bought it because I love this version of Jane Eyre and don't have it on videotape.",3.0
"I recently caught this on cable and was excited to see it; after all, ""Jane Eyre"" is one of my favorite books of all time.
While Samantha Morton made an excellent Jane, I thought Ciaran Hinds was terrible as Mr. Rochester. He was far more blustery than smoldering, and the scene at which he screamed at Jane while she drove away disturbed me. He seemed more like an abusive boyfriend than a man overwhelmed with pain and passion.
Also, some of my favorite scenes were cut. Where was the scene where Jane went home to visit her family? She left and then came back again; we saw no part of her interaction with the Reeds, which was one of the best parts in the book. She also never learned of the inheritance left to her by her uncle in Madeira. And I agree with the reviewer who said that the part with St. John and Diana might have been left out for all the weight this movie gave it.
Overall, this is not an awful movie. However, it is inferior by far to other productions, notably the version with Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt.",3.0
"Jane Eyre is my absolute fav book, but I thought this make of the book was WAY too melodramatic. I don't believe the portrayal of Mr. Rochester was all that great in this movie.

I've read it countless times and never get tired of it.",3.0
"I haven't seen this movie, but I have read the book. I'd just like to say, for those who complain that Jane wasn't ""beautiful"" in the movie and those that say ""How could Rochester fall in love with her?"", that Bronte's whole point was that neither Jane nor Rochester were beautiful. Both were plain and some could say that Rochester was even ugly. The point is that their love was based on something higher and less superficial than beauty alone. Those who think that you have to be beautiful for someone to love you are just downright shallow.",3.0
"I am a firm believer that one should not judge a movie too harshly based on the book from which it came.  I fully understand that it is very difficult to fit a 400 page book into a 2-hour slot.  Plot adjustments will always have to be made.  One thing that I cannot stand, however, is misrepresentation of characters.  While this version (A&E's) of ""Jane Eyre"" sticks to the basic plot, much better than the William Hurt version does, the screenwriters got the characters all wrong.  In this version, Jane is much too forceful; she never would have spoken rudely to her employer as she does in this movie.  She could barely look him in the eye, much less call him a liar to his face, as she basically does.
After seeing A&E's ""Pride and Prejudice,"" which was absolutley wonderful, I really would have expected more from them.  Shame on you, A&E!",3.0
"I chose this version to see the portrayal of Mr Rochester by Mr Hinds & in that I was pleased. I think Mr Hinds did an excellent job despite all the shouting and there were several times in the film when he was able to bring out Mr Rochester's more tender side & this all seemed to work well for the character. I was very disappointed in the way Jane seemed unable, for all her passionate words to actually kiss the man. I have seen Samantha Morton in other films & have liked her work immensely. In much of the dialog she shows true passion in her speaking but it seems that she could never really bring herself to kiss Mr Rochester on the lips, cheek-yes, lips-no, not really. If they weren't meant to kiss then the film could have done without the close-up camera views that made this so obvious to me. It seemed, to me, that a real kiss was avoided at every embrace. Even near the end of the movie when they were reunited with no impediments between them, professing their undying love, there was not one real kiss. The book was not portrayed true to form which so often happens when novels are made into movies but if you are going to film a passionate embrace & kiss to demonstrate a passionate love, shouldn't it be a real kiss?",3.0

"This version is my second favorite version behind the Dalton/Clark version.  The Dalton/Clark version is by far the ""best"" and most thorough version and though Dalton, IMO, is too handsome to play Rochester,  Dalton's performance is outstanding, as is Clarke's as Jane.  Hinds and  Morton are my second favorites.  This version is missing vital pieces of  the story, but the performances of Morton and Hinds are quite acceptable  and good.  I like the comic aspect they added (the scene where Jane returns  from visiting w/her dying aunt) and Rochester is seated on the wall outside  Thornfield and he complains to her about her not having written to him.  Hinds melted my heart in this scene and I have been a fan ever since.  Morton is good as Jane and delivered her lines perfectly.  This is an  entertaining version, again, not as thorough as the Dalton/Clarke version,  but it is enjoyable and is worth the viewing.",3.0
"This is probably my least favorite adaptation.  It includes dialogue and scenes that weren't even in the book. Where do people get off re-writing one of the greatest books in history?  Still, though, I must say that at  least they got the characters right. Mr. Rochester was an absolute bear at  first, which is what he should be.  Jane Eyre actually looked the right  age, although I thought she was more aggressive than in the book. The book  really has too much to be done within a 90 minute format. I wish people  would stop trying to squeeze months or years into hours. It just doesn't  work!  It does capture some of the spirit of the story, but not enough to  make it interesting. Skip it.",3.0

This is due to the variety of fairly thick British, Irish, and Scots accents. At least one episode -- I think it's titled ""The Swedish Tiger"" -- left me scratching my head trying to figure out exactly what had gone on. The plot was convoluted enough that understanding everything that was said was necessary to grasp more than the basics of the action, and I think I may have gotten every fifth word.

"My wife and I love this series. We were young and I was in the USAF stationed in England during 3 of the years that UPSTAIRS-DOWNSTAIRS aired on live TV and so perhaps that's part of why we love it.

It's not action-based and it's not comedy-based. It explores the complex relationships of a wealthy family and the people who serve them as well as the complex and changing times in which they live, and it's very well done. Neither group is villainous but neither group is perfect. They all have their good points and all have their faults but that's what makes it so interesting to watch. And inevitably, what goes on UPSTAIRS or DOWNSTAIRS affects the other group, either directly or indirectly. It's so well done that you may have to pinch yourself to remember that these people are just actors, plus make sure to watch the 25th anniversary show about making of the series.

In the 1970s the quality of British TV video was superior to the quality of US TV because they used more lines per screen. However, the quality of the audio and video of this product is awful, just awful. It's even poor by low-def standards. It's very grainy and has wavy lines in it at times. It looks as though someone made copies from a VHS tape and you got copy number 1000.

And there are various other video flaws. Furthermore, the audio is poor - lots of extraneous noise, sometimes a sound like a movie projector running, etc. If you want a cheap complete Upstairs Downstairs with the complete Thomas and Sarah, for cheap, regardless of picture quality, this is worth it.

At least the first 6 episodes were recorded originally in black and white because there was a technicians strike which demanded more for recording in colour.  Episode 1 was re-written and re-recorded in colour to connect with the first colour episode - thus making international sales possible.

So, do they wait to start work on the series when all the techs are back OR do they just go ahead and film the thing in B&W with poor sound etc etc ....

Yup you guessed it .. they started the series in B&W cause the execs at BBC never really expected this series to take off.

This may have been very good and well back in the 1970's but they should have explained it to the buyers of the DVD set that the first few DVD's of this box set are in B&W and really really bad production... It took  me a while checking my equipment and the disks to realize what they did .. menu in colour and movie in B&W ... thanks!

I sort of expected the DVD set to improve after disk three when it switched to colour but, trust me you could clearly see a substandard production of the 1970's .... I guess for the purists they did nothing to fix the production with today's modern sound, video enhancement programs/computers  ... What you saw is what you got ....

OK so I am really bugged out because I bought the box sets of 'The Forsythe Saga' and of 'Horatio Hornblower' series that were produced and published by the same BBC and A&E people, so you can probably understand why I was so so disappointed with this 'megaset' .....

The three star rating on this set is certainly deserved by the writing, scriting, casting and most certainly the acting ... the directors and the producers though should be punished....",3.0
Good enough for some WWII info and best of all it is closed captioned.  I have many other older WWII documentaries and most are not closed captioned.  Big deal it my world.  This was one of the main reasons I bought this DVD.,3.0
"A good overall look at the available color footage during the war. The commentary is quite good as well. Unfortunately, much of the footage is not as good as it could be. The first program on the first disc has a disappointing black level, and as a result, much of the footage looks too bright and washed out. While the next two programs improve on this, other DVDs such as ""The Third Reich in Color"" have presented color European theatre and Third Reich footage more carefully. However, none can compete all at once with this two disc set.
The color footage shot during actual battles and preperation for D-Day are high points, as well as the seven minutes or so of Eva Braun home movies on the end of the disc. Pacific theatre buffs will feel shortchanged; I'd say 80 to 85% of the material concerns Europe. This DVD set is certainly worthwhile if you wish to see a large quantity of period color footage with informative commentary. It succeeds in bringing the war and the period to life.",3.0

"The history protrade was amazing, but the actor playing Washington did not fit my view of him.  At first it was frustrating to watch him until I started focusing on the history that was being shown and then it was unbeliveable what they went through to accomplish what they did.  Also, my understanding of Washington was that he was a very God fearing man and would retreat into the woods or pirvate places to ask for guidance from God.  None of this was protrade.  With out divine intervention the victory would never have happened.",3.0
"I am a bit of an American War Of Independance buff and this movie at least attempted to address one fault shared by most films on the subject, the Rebels themselves or Patriots is perhaps a better word were not all naturalised Yankee Accented Americans. Apart from Al Pacino's messy film, Revolution, every film i had seen until this one had the usual upper class Brit accent for the Redcoats and Traditional American drawl for the Patriots. The ranks of the Continental army included Ex-British soldiers and officers of the French Indian war,outraged by the policies and taxes levied by King George. Imagine the anger these men must have felt at having fought the French to protect King Georges interests in America, only then to be asked to pay for the pleasure through unfair and extortianate taxes. Add to this British settlers equally outraged at not being allowed to be represented in Parliament, plus naturalised Americans, Irish, Scots, Dutch, French and German settlers. Two contrasting scenes show the divisions within the American Colonies. When George Washington tells the owner of the boats he is borrowing them, the boat owner protests and tells the Continental Army that they are all mad and will hang. Contrast this with the Englishman who offers George Washington and his Officers the use of his house for shelter and food. Whilst i enjoyed this movie, particularly the portrayal of Washingtons officers having varying American,English,Scottish and Irish accents, i thought one scene was absolutely unescessary and it is fictional. Horatio Gates was as as British as they come, but he did join the fight against his King and became a celebrated though sometimes controversial figure of the Revolution. Most of the controversy is based on his opposition to George Washingtons military tactics, Gates favoured Guerilla tactics in the early stages as he was of the opinion, and its a well founded one, that the Continental Army at this stage was neither strong enough or equipped to fight Redcoats or Hessians head on. Of course we know that on this occasion he was proved wrong, but the scene where he is ordered out of the camp under threat of being shot is pure fiction. Gates left of his own accord but i got the feeling that the Director or screenwriter realised that they hadn't show a stereotyped bad-guy Brit in the movie and decided to add this scene to address that. Portraying Gates as a pompous snob was off the mark and an insult to a man who distinguished himself during the war. Still I just hope that one day someone will produce at last a decent movie or mini-series which accurately portrays a defining point in World history. But most of all a film needs to be made which pays tribute to the men and women of that period in history who suffered so much to give birth to a new nation, it needs to show that Americans were born of a variety of peoples and nations within the former colonies. Perhaps another thing which should be looked at is the effect on the Revolution on both sides of the Atlantic, in England the Colonists had provoked a lot of sympathy amongst the working class and even Fifth columnists had formed to oppose King George, so much about this conflict remains unexplored on film and its a shame. It was all of these things, a struggle for human rights, equality, freedom. greed,ambition and even as suggested by many historians, a civil war. Probably the most complex and fascinating War or Conflict in history, surely one day filmakers will do it justice ?",3.0
"Overall, I was very impressed with this production focusing on a single and important event in a long, hard war.

In this movie, none of Washington's men were lost. In ""Washington the Warrior"", 6 of his men were lost. Which is correct? I think the latter. Despite the creative licence taken by the producers and writers, there is still much about this that is factual and the performances were impressive. I bought this as part of the History Channel Founding of America box set and I'm still working my way through the DVDs.

This and Washington the Warrior were very well done,  but  do  not  waste  your  time  on the ""founding fathers"" and ""founding brothers"" History Channel DVDs. I don't think the Karl Marx fan club could have made a worse presentation of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. It was a ridiculous assault disguised in the form of a historical production. Seriously biased against small government Jefferson and Madison and drooooling over big government, American Monarchy advocating Hamilton. Garbage.",3.0
"I enjoyed this DVD to a degree.  Yes, there are some factual errors (I won't regurgitate the reviews of others); but the visual history is presented very well.  My biggest issue with this film is Jeff Daniels' acting.  His crossing from comedy to drama is not as smooth as Washington's across the Delaware.  It's not that I dislike Daniels; I think he is very good in certain roles.  But in his portrayal of George Washington, I am left unconvinced.",3.0
"Good for 8th and 11th grade students to watch when discussing the American Revolution. Some factual information regarding Washington is wrong, especially the way he is shown toward his troops.  There is definitely artistic license and some more conservative historians might take offense, so when teaching this movie with the Revolution so definitely, even though not rated, be sure to present the conservative view and get parent sign off due to the language and content.  Excellent movie to show the hardships and nuances of Revolutionary era.",3.0

"This movie was well made, but had too much swearing in it. I understand that they were soldiers, but George Washington was a Christian and would not have spoken with so many profane words. We were only interested in the historical content of the film, but would only watch it once.",3.0
"I think this film is great for its entertainment value.  Jeff Daniels puts forth an excellent performance as General Washington, and the direction and editing do an excellent job of building suspense during the crossing of the Delaware River.  Even though I knew the outcome, I found myself concerned about the ultimate success of the mission.  That being said, the portrayal of Henry Knox does a diservice to the father of American artillery.  While John Glover and his men did yeomens'work during the crossing, Knox commanded the operation.  It was through his efforts as a leader, working in concert with Glover, that the Americans succeeded in their task. The movie disparages his achievement for comedic effect.  Overall, I recommend this film, but watch it after reading David Hackett Fischer's ""Washington's Crossing"" or David McCullough's ""1776"".",3.0
"Overall, I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in American history.  Nevertheless, a few of the liberties taken with the characters and historical inaccuracies are too much to warrant a  5-star rating.
Here are just three examples:
1. Washington's Language -  Although Jeff Daniels's portrayal of Washington as a hot-tempered,  foul-mouthed, flawed hero appeals to our modern cynicism and desire to  debunk the myths behind our heroes, there are some serious questions as to  the film's accuracy on this front.  George Washington did have a volcanic  temper, but he had learned to control it - and that was part of the  strength of his character.  The movie depicts him as being almost  constantly frustrated and bordering on an outburst.  This does not reflect  the truth as can be evidenced by the reaction many of Washington's  subordinates had on those RARE occasions when Washington did lose his cool.  Were he as temperamental as Daniels portrays him, the outbursts Washington  DID have wouldn't have been as significant to those around him as they  were.  In addition, the language attributed to Washington in this film is  in direct contrast with Washington's own orders against cursing.  I don't  question the fact that a few words may have slipped now and then, but it's  very inconsistent with the historical record to portray Washington as  foul-mouthed as this film does.
2. Alexander Hamilton was not  Washington's aide at the Battle of Trenton.  He was an artillery captain.  He did not come into Washington's service until later.
3. The exchange  between Horatio Gates and Washington was clearly overblown for dramatic  effect.  It's no secret that the two didn't like each other, but there's no  evidence to support the film's contention that Washington threatened to  have Gates shot.
I don't want my criticisms to make it seem like the  movie had no merit.  Howard Fast and the film's production team do an  outstanding job in showing just how desperate the American situation was  prior to Trenton.  For this alone, the movie is well worth watching.",3.0
"this film has not the promised subtitles. I saw it years ago with german subtitles and it was an impressive experience, but only with a few lines every 2-4 minutes you cannot follow the movie, only if you are a spanish speaker.

This is a good action movie.  Terrorists highjack the Presidents plane with the President still on it.  He is a former marine and fights back.  HarrisonFord iis excellent as always.  Gary Oldman as the head villain is as well.  If you like action movies you will like this.,3.0
"If you believe that people can fire hundreds of bullets from automatic weapons in the pressurized cabin of a 747 jetliner and not have any problem with, say, dying from hypoxia; if you believe that dealing with terrorists is as simple as saying: ""We won't let you get away with this"" when civilians are kidnapped and/or killed (right: they won't get away with it because they wore explosive vests);  if you think that people can sneak around in Air Force One by sticking their heads around a corner and then ducking back out of sight AFTER the bad guy looks your way--and that this works for avoiding bullets, also; THEN THIS IS THE FILM FOR YOU!  Comic book patriotism and combat!  And Harrison Ford pulls out all stops and uses both of his expressions.  Doesn't get any better than this.",3.0
"Very good action, but stretches the willing suspension of disbelief to the breaking point in my opinion. The idea that all those trained secret service agents could fire so many bullets in such close quarters and not even stop one hijacker is pretty unlikely. The agents were not very good at taking cover either.  Plus, even though it is just a movie, seeing all those guys get shot in the takeover scene is hard to watch.",3.0

"Die Hard on Air Force One with the President of the United States as John McClane?  This one has easily one of the most ludicrous high concepts of any high concept action movie from the past 30 years.  When it played in theaters I hated it--and I'm a huge fan of action pictures, although not of star Harrison Ford.  At that time I would have given Air Force One a one star review.

In light of the fact that the screenplay was by Andrew W Marlowe, the creator of Castle I decided to give the movie another shot and I have a slightly different take on it now.  Given the cheeky tone of his television show, which takes nothing, least of all murder seriously, I'm inclined to think that the script for Air Force One was written as a tongue-in-cheek commentary on dumb Hollywood action pictures rather than an actual dumb Hollywood action picture.

The problem is that native German director Wolfgang Peterson (Das Boot, The Perfect Storm) while tremendously talented is not known for his sense of humor or light touch.  He has an uncommonly good eye for widescreen visuals and old-style you-can-clearly-see-everything-that's-happening approach to his action scenes but he directs Air Force One with way too much gravity, making whatever humor that manages to survive seem campy and unintentional.  It's hard to ultimately made the action set-pieces in Air Force One exciting given Wolfgang Peterson's approach since it's simply not possible to take any of them as seriously as he apparently does.

I'm not suggesting that Air Force One should have been directed as a comedy but there's a lighter approach in the films of fellow countryman Roland Emmerich (Independence Day; 2012; White House Down) that would have been perfect here.  Emmerich knows how to direct ridiculous material in a way that allows it to be silly and fun but still exciting--he knows he's making silly pulp films and embraces the humor of the ridiculous cliffhangers while allowing the audience to laugh without guilt and still enjoy the action and suspense.

For a practical example of what I'm talking about assume you are in the mood for a disaster movie--would you rather watch Wolfgang Peterson's technically well-made and lavish but dull Poseidon or Roland Emmerick's deliriously ludicrous but exciting and funny 2012?  The choice is obvious for me--but I was also a big fan of Emmerich's White House Down which I couldn't even get any of my friends to even watch, so what do I know?",3.0

"An enjoyable, if not too substantial, action thriller with Harrison Ford playing a mashup of every possible positive attribute anyone could want in a President and Gary Oldman taking a villainous turn. I like Goldman's work as a whole, and he doesn't disappoint here, either. While Ford's character isn't all that believable, it's not the actor's fault - the script just doesn't ascend to the actor's capabilities.
I like the premise of the hijacking of Air Force One, and watching the bad guys' execution of their plan was cool, but the plot starts a long spiral of improbability from there. I'm glad I watched, but I won't be seeking it out again for a while.",3.0
"This movie is of the kind that used to be known as a ""star vehicle"" back in Hollywood's Golden Age. Harrison Ford is such a likable movie star, and one that audiences can always put their faith in. It's as if his sole reason for getting up in the morning is to entertain, and this he has been doing like no one else for 40 years.

""Air Force One"" (1997) is just a classic action adventure movie. Ford is the President, flying from Moscow aboard the presidential airplane back to Washington, along with his family and many staffers. The plane has not been in the air long when Gary Oldman, (excellent as always), pops up as the leader of a gang of Russian terrorists who hijack the plane, hellbent on having the President release a hostage who is a general and folk hero. Of course, the US does not negotiate with terrorists -- or does it?

The Oldman-led terrorists are vicious, but not brilliant. They completely lose track of the president, and he manages to escape into the belly of the plane. His family and staff don't know where he is, either. He manages to use his cell phone to call the White House -- whether that would work or not, I don't know. In any case, he and everyone in the Situation Room devise a plan to neutralize the bad guys and rescue the good guys. It may be far-fetched, yet clichd, predictable stuff, but a good cast, entertaining story and pretty good dialogue make it seem less so.

Ford mutters to himself better than any actor, and he gets to do a good bit of that while he's below decks. He is always a step ahead of the terrorists, and he and Oldman face off well. There are some nice little twists and turns.

Don't expect a tremendous amount from ""Air Force One."" and it won't disappoint. The most startling difference in movies like this made in the late 1990s and those made in the mid-2010s is in the special effects. CGI has completely changed the look of movies, and allows for much greater suspension of disbelief. The action sequences in ""Air Force One"" would have benefited from the now-ubiquitous process, but you can't work with what you don't have.",3.0

"AIR FORCE ONE is a fun movie. It's the kind of action movie where you can suspend your disbelief and just sit back and enjoy. And at the same time this film depicts a President that many of us really wish we actually had in the Oval Office: a politician who can literally kick some ass. Harrison Ford demonstrates that he is still a really good action hero, and is also a great actor. That acting talent goes for the opposite side of the coin in Gary Oldman. Both actors make their performances believable in this movie. Good action movies have to have a great villain. And Oldman definitely provides that in his role.

After the successful capture of Radek: a rogue Russian General who has committed genocide on his country's people, U.S. President James Marshall announces to the world in Moscow that America will not tolerate any terrorist organizations. ""It's your turn to live in fear,"" he says to the world. His National Security Advisor (Tom Everett), and Chief of Staff (Paul Guilfoyle) are not happy with this change of policy, but the president doesn't back down. Fortunately, his wife (Wendy Crewson), and his daughter (Liesel Matthews) stand by him on this belief.

Air Force One takes off from Moscow, heading back to Washington. On board is a Russian news crew who were invited on the trip. But then, everything turns to hell when one of the Secret Service agents (Xander Berkeley) kills his fellow men and unlocks a weapons cache. The news crew reveal themselves to be terrorists and quickly hijack the plane. The Secret Service manage to get the President down to an escape pod, which is jettisoned from the plane before they are killed. The terrorists believe that Marshall had escaped in the pod, and then reveal what they want. They tell the Vice President (Glenn Close) to release Radek, or the hostages will be slaughtered one by one.

It turns out that President Marshall released the pod himself and hid himself away. He understands that it is up to him to save the day. And he fights back against the terrorists one by one. Yes, at this point, AIR FORCE ONE has recycled the same plot as CON AIR, DIE HARD, and UNDER SEIGE: terrorists overpower everyone in a specific place, except for one man, who has to save the day. On top of that, it also borrows from the old AIRPORT disaster films of the 70's: something goes wrong, and now we have to get the plane back on the ground.

These kind of plots are certainly a cliche. That is true. Done wrong, they can be so incredibly ridiculous as to invite the MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 style wise-cracks. But it's not what kind of plot you use for a movie, it's what you do with it. With AIR FORCE ONE, director Wolfgang Peterson brings in a cast of very gifted actors. Harrison Ford is a great choice as the president. Gary Oldman is not only believable as a villain, he is even given some dialogue that expands on this character. After he shoots a hostage and is called a cold-blooded murderer, he retorts back with this quote: ""You murdered 100,000 Iraqis just so that you could save on a gallon of gas, and you call me a murderer?"" It's also a delight to watch Glenn Close as Vice President Bennett in the Situation Room, along with the great character-actors Dean Stockwell as the Secretary of Defense, and Philip Baker Hall as an Attorney General who advices them on what the Constitution says on the issue.

Wolfgang Peterson was determined to make the film as realistic as possible. The other terrorists are played by real Russian actors. I recognized one of them: Elya Baskin, from MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON. In that film he was the fellow circus performer and best friend to Robin Williams. (You may also remember him in the SPIDER MAN movies as Peter Parker's landlord.) In the production notes of AIR FORCE ONE the director, production designer, and Harrison Ford all went on a tour of the real plane. This film depicts the jet in almost complete accuracy. Some creative liberties were taken, of course. But for the most part, we can believe that this is what Air Force One looks like. And on top of this, Harrison Ford does all of his own stunts. He was in his mid-fifties when this film came out in 1997, but he was still in great shape. The United States Air Force actually gave full co-operation in making this film, since it's a very positive kind of movie for this military branch.

As I said before in the beginning of my review, AIR FORCE ONE is a fun movie. Then-president Bill Clinton loved it. He actually encouraged Glenn Close to play the Vice President before she was cast. I like her, and the other performances. Could such a scenario actually occur on Air Force One? I seriously doubt it. The plane does not have an emergency pod or parachutes in the back. These parts of the film are almost laughable, but it still makes for good entertainment. After seeing this movie, I began to wonder, what if we elected a war hero and Medal Of Honor winner as the President, and ended up with a beautiful woman as The Vice President?",3.0
"... whether you view it as a serious film or a comedy. As a serious film, one star. As a comedy, 5. For me, it's definitely a comedy.

See the President of the United States engaging in mortal, hand-to-hand combat with armed terrorists! Sure, he's clearly in his fifties, and going up against young, strong, trained combatants; but he's a Fighting President! And nobody, but nobody, is going to take over his plane! (He makes it clear at one point that it's ""my plane!"". Funny, I thought the plane, and the White House, etc., belonged to the people. Guess that's an outdated concept).

Meanwhile, watch the determined Vice President get off the helicopter (not sure why she was flying around in it in the first place) and whirl into action, issuing orders and taking command of the situation. Because she's a Fighting Vice President! Oh, we have a minute or two of the obligatory scene where she and the Secretary of Defense argue about who is in charge, but that's just for show. In the next scene, the Fighting Vice President is still running the show. And doing so brilliantly! Because she's not a figurehead VP, as most are; no, it's made clear that she and the president are good friends and close partners (yep -- that's realistic). Also, she looks exactly like George Washington, so she has that added gravitas. (Don't know what I'm talking about? Go to google images and enter ""glenn close air force one"". Find the picture where she's standing in front of the ""White House"" logo in the press room. Put it next to the image of Washington from a dollar bill. Compare the hair, the eyes, the nose, the lips. They could be twins).

To fully appreciate the absurdity of this movie, imagine it with our real president and veep. Look, I'll be non-partisan about it -- imagine either Obama or Bush in hand-to-hand combat with armed terrorists and killing them. My own choice would be Clinton and Gore, who were in office when the movie was made. I think ""Air Force One"" is a great comedy; but if someone would use CGI to replace Harrison Ford and Glenn Close with computer-generated Bill Clinton and Al Gore, and dub their voices in -- well, that would be, by far, the greatest comedy film of all time.",3.0
"Pssst.  Quiet.  The whispering President (Harrison Ford) has spoken.  Upon boarding Air Force One, with the hope of catching a few precious hours to himself and his T.V., the whispering President comes under attack in an attempted hijacking by Russian strong men (led by superb actor Gary Oldman).  The plot thickens as Air Force One is taken by force and makes a remarkable series of 20 wheel drifts through Rammstein Air Base Slalom Course in West Germany.  Shortly thereafter, the George Washington hair-doed Vice President (Glenn Close- I always get her mixed up with Merryl Streep!) tries to negotiate with the hijackers, but to no avail.  Since no other man will step up to the job (bloody wimps), the rubbery-faced President has to defeat the hijackers on his own.

Despite constantly looking dazed and confused, especially after kissing his robust secretary in exchange for sending a FAX, the whispering President manages to usurp the hijackers and kill their esteemed leader.  I was saddened to see the former German U-boat commander, now a General by the name of Radek, die only footsteps from freedom from a Russian prison.  William H. Macy offers to upgrade the exterior of Air Force One with a nice Tru-Coat, but Wade doesn't think it's a good deal.  But hey, it's a good action flick and is worth a watch.  Over and out.",3.0
"*** SPOILER in the 2nd paragraph ***

I'll be honest: I didn't expect a whole lot out of this save-the-president film; though I like Harrison Ford well enough, I won't say I'm exactly a fan, and the plot seemed really hackneyed.  Why'd I watch it, then?  I guess I was in the mood for this kind of techno-thriller, in which the President's plane is hijacked by terrorists, and our middle-aged President (Ford) who was formerly a Vietnam combat pilot gets to play hero and almost single-handedly take out the Russian bad guys headed up by nasty psycho Gary Oldman and prevent them from returning evil commie Jurgen Prochnow back to power in Kazakhstan.  Complications include the President's wife and daughter being on board, and disagreements between principal cabinet members (chiefly Glenn Close as the VP and Dean Stockwell as the Secretary of Defense) on how best to handle the situation on the ground; the latter element never builds up to anything convincingly suspenseful.

Like a great many of these kinds of films, AIR FORCE ONE started out pretty well and went downhill both in believability and interest in the second half, but it never fell apart completely despite one really annoying plot hole that apparently the producers, screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe and/or director Wolfgang Petersen thought we'd be too stupid to think about:  namely that there's a spy on board in the form of a Secret Service agent, we know about him and the people on the ground know about him, but very little if any effort is made to clue the President in about him - and he basically gets ignored by both the terrorists and everyone else until the very end.  And his motives are never mentioned at all - he just turns rogue because, uh, he thought it would be fun, perhaps?  Not good enough, sorry.

Still, this was more lively and intelligent than it could have been; Ford is OK and the rest of the cast is game enough, if not quite enthusiastic except for the always manic Oldman - who is playing basically the same role he's played a dozen times now.  Worth a watch if you like these sorts of things; better than DIE HARD 2 or 4, EXECUTIVE DECISION, or the UNDER SIEGE films, I'd say, to name some movies with comparable plots from the era.  Petersen is never IMO less than a competent director, and he keeps things moving along OK.  The ra-ra patriotic Jerry Goldsmith score got old and pretty overbearing after a half hour.

A time waster, then, but a reasonably enjoyable one.  The standard DVD doesn't have too much in the way of extras, nothing really of substance besides the director's commentary, which I haven't listened to.",3.0
this movie is definitely not as awesome as i thought it was in middle school.,3.0
"Air Force One (1997) Harrison Ford is the President of the United States. Gary Oldman is a hardliner Russian who has just hijacked the title vehicle, and off we go in the new thriller from director Wolfgang Petersen (In the Line of Fire). Although it obviously has echoes of a Die Hard movie, with ex-Special Forces Prez Ford playing cat and mouse throughout the plane with Oldman's minions, this one stays sharp, smart, and entertaining, thanks to a good script and sure footed direction. Also helping is a fantastic cast, including Glenn Close, Wendy Crewson, William H. Macy (Fargo), Xander Berkeley (Terminator 2: Judgment Day), Dean Stockwell (Blue Velvet), Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot) and Timothy Carhart (Beverly Hills Cop III). The action and suspense are plentiful, though it possibly goes on slightly too long, maybe sticking in one crisis too many before the end credits. Still in all, that's a minor quibble, and this is still a fine flick to check out!",3.0

"... USA was the only country in the world where this kind of story (although farfetched) could be happening. Especially when you remember the JFK's fighting history (maybe it's one of the reasons why he was assassinated). But now, when you see the Bush family history, the only war record of the grandfather (at the same time JFK was patrolling in the Pacific) shows his best achievement was building the family's fortune by catering for the Third Reich's financial needs. And I can imagine the present Bush pounding Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on the head with a bible (to show him it's better than the coran), and telling him ""Get out of my world"". As well, USA lost all credibility when he got RE-elected : One mistake might be understandable, but, as the Romans said ""Errare humanum est, sed perseverare diabolicum"" (to err is human, but to persist is diabolical).",3.0
I loved this movie growing up so I thought I would buy it on DVD. When I got the package today and opened it I was disheartened to find that the case was smashed. I don't believe this was a delivery error because the package it came in was in perfect condition. Thankfully the disk was unharmed.,3.0
"Marshall is the kind of President alluded to a change in the U.S. foreign policy... He took a great risk when he stated that America will no longer tolerate any terrorist government... His policy is soon put in practice when he boards his plane on his way home...

Once 'Air Force One' is in the sky, it is hijacked and currently controlled by Russian radicals who ask for the release of their leader or they'll execute the hostages on board...

While in Washington the vice president and the president's advisers, deliberate how to answer to the terrorists' demands, the president apparently is deployed in an emergency pod, but, in reality, he's determined to bravely confront the hijackers and retake his plane...

Harrison Ford plays with courage and charisma the commander in chief who has already played his cards, there's no turning back...

Gary Oldman who steals the show as the evil Ivan Korshunov, reminds the President that he is holding 'his wife, his daughter, his chief of staff, his national security adviser, his classified papers and his baseball glove!'

Beautifully shot by cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, Petersen builds the challenge with nice sequences from every compartment of 'Air Force One' to the White House contingent in Washington...",3.0
"I'm not going to write a review for the movie itself, just the Superbit DVD vs. the original one. With the Superbit DVD you get a slightly better picture image but not anything drastic, at least not that I noticed. It also produces very clear sound, but again, hardly more noticeable than a standard DVD. The downside to this was that the special features were taken off which dissapointed me greatly since I am a fan of commentaries. With the two different DVD's out now you have a choice between special features and better quality so when making your purchase just be aware of the differences.",3.0
"I really enjoyed this movie when I first saw it, and although I do still like it, my subsequent viewings have found my love of this movie diminishing. Why? It has become too violent for me. I do like action movies like Die Hard, Braveheart, and Under Siege, but for some reason I find some of the violence disturbing and a bit gratuitous and that is not entertaining. Maybe Gary Oldman plays his character too well! There are too many scenes of summary executions and the unfairness of which leave me feeling a bit angry. The best example of that is when the President's Deputy Press Secretary Melanie Mitchel, played by Donna Bullock, is killed in cold blood in front of the Presidents wife and daughter. It is a very disturbing scene and a bit too much.

Despite the violence the movie was a summer popcorn type of film that takes you on an adrenaline filled roller coaster ride of thrills and terror, and in that way it does succeed. Harrison Ford is excellent as the action-hero President. He is a strong yet human character who responds in heroic fashion under extraordinary circumstances. Gary Oldman plays the evil Ivan Korshunov only too well. The one performance that I find annoying is Dean Stockwell's portrayal of Defense Secretary Walter Dean. He doesn't come across as authoritative but rather almost childishly whinny. The movie does also go on a bit too long when the ending rescue is dragged out. Despite its flaws it is still a good action movie made even better by the performance of Harrison Ford.",3.0
"But despite that, I have to say I loved this film, and if the ending hadn't kept going on & on, I would have definitely given this movie four stars. It's an amazing film, and I was practically sitting on the edge of my seat, talking (yes, I was) to the TV, saying ""don't do that"" and other such nonsense.

I've never been a big fan of Harrison Ford, but I'm not sure why. Gary Oldman also gives me the creeps! But I find that films on planes are always filled with suspense, and lots of action. It's probably cos it's all filmed in a confined space. Hey I like these kinda films. And I have to say that Gary Oldman did brilliantly speaking in Russian. He probably wasn't speaking what was coming up on the screen in the subtitles ;) but it didn't come across as forced, or unrealistic, like some actors would do an accent.

My problem with this was the ending. It's one of those films, where just as you think it's about to end, something else happens, and by the very end, it was starting to feel a bit dragged out, and just a bit OTT.

I did find the movie quite realistic in a way, as with Harrison Ford playing the president, and not knowing the number to phone through to the White House (someone else must do all this stuff for the presidents.) And it was good stuff having the vice president as a women. Very un-Hollywood. And they also had Glenn Close not bowing under pressure as her character, when she was being pressured to do other things, give in to the Russians etc.

This soundtrack is really good, and the main theme is a really feel good theme. Although I didn't recognise the theme being played to me straight afterwards - I thought that was just too easy! Randy Newman's score was cut late in post-production by director Wolfgang Petersen for being ""too loud and blatty."" Jerry Goldsmith was brought in to do the score in TWO weeks. Can you imagine doing a score in two weeks? He was so daunted by the amount of time he had to write the score that he began requesting that his assignments be given to him months in advance of the finishing of a film's final cut.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film, despite the drawn-out ending, and would most likely watch it again. Gary Oldman still scares me however.",3.0

"This is a film that really will only be enjoyed by kids who grew up loving the Spice Girls.

My daughter is still thrilled to be able to watch this with her friends at college though, so I'm glad I did order it.",3.0
"This film is so over the top it's hilarious, this is POTUS as super hero, you almost wonder why he needs the plane I'm assuming the only reason he didn't reveal his true identity of US PRESIDENT MAN the masked avenger is that he couldn't find a convenient phone booth to change into his star spangled leotard. I enjoyed the film, but I feel a little dash of realism would have made it much better, just a bit believable maybe.",3.0
"If you like the Spice Girls, and you don't mind movies with poor story lines, then you'll probably enjoy this.

However, if you try to follow the storyline, which I did, it will give you a headache, like it gave me. There are way too many bad guys in the film, who are plotting various things for the Spice Girls. In the end, we realize they're all good people, and this movie all leads up to a live concert, which is somewhat ironic, because the biggest thing I wondered after watching this film is if the Spice Girls actually recorded any of their own music.  Why do they sound like heavy smokers when they're talking, but that completely goes away when they're singing?

Pros:
+Fun, jovial movie
+It has the Spice Girls
+It has almost all of the Spice Girls' songs
+It kind of indirectly hints at the origins of the Spice Girls' nicknames

Cons:
-They lip sync all of their songs, and it really shows
-Bad sound editing
-The tour bus is about three times wider on the inside than on the outside, and since they spend so much time in here, it's really distracting
-Way too many extra bad guy story lines going on in the background",3.0
"Well, I remember this being my favorite show when I was 11 or 12. Couldn't believe they have this movie on DVD so I had to buy it.  It's pretty much a joke of a movie but because I still have some love for the Spice Girls I was glad I'm able to have this for my collection.  It's one of those movies that you get a bunch of your girlfriends together and remember the hype of the Spice Girl era and have a pretty good laugh.",3.0
"Ten years after they first become famous, the Spice Girls recently toured again. It's all over now until they start to run low again on funds, but with their tour came a re-release of Spice World, the movie. Now I can honestly say, this film is no classic. But hey, it's good classic fun, with lots of British celebrity cameos, and bad acting (from all the Spice Girls but especially from Victoria), but it provides a few laughs.

The story is quite complicated, cos it seems to jump around quite a bit, and is extremely jumbled. Basically every plot they could think about they threw in.

I was a Spice Girls fan. I wasn't broken hearted when they 'broke up', and followed Geri when she went solo, but they were still good poppy songs, and I had all their albums. I think I still do. This was done before Geri went skinny, blonder, and didn't want to be known as a former Spice Girl. Mel B was still loud & brash, Victoria was in the early beginnings of her romance with a certain footballer, before she would take over the world (it seems that way), and Emma & Mel C seemed to have stayed remarkably the same.

There's a whole host of famous British faces in this. Gary Glitter was supposed to have a cameo, but that was quickly cut from the film when he was arrested. (But they kept in the song ""Do You Want To Be In My Gang?"") Other famous faces are Michael Barrymore, Meatloaf, Elvis Costello, Alan Cumming, Neil Fox (in voice only thank God), Stephen Fry, Bob Geldof, Richard E Grant, Jools Holland, Bob Hoskins, Elton John, Hugh Laurie, Roger Moore, Naoko Mori (now in Torchwood), Richard O'Brien, Jonathan Ross, Jennifer Saunders ... Phew. I bet I've missed someone out.

Spice World is one of those films that you will be embarrassed to admit you own, but it's joined by many more in my DVD collection, so I'm not embarrassed in the slightest. It's harmless fun.",3.0
"This is a highly entertaining film in which Harrison Ford plays an American president who puts his money where his mouth his. Russian dissidents who believe in the old order seize control of Air Force One, hoping that the hostages will force the Americans to persuade the Russian premier to release a prominent Russian soldier. Once released, the threat of another cold war can only be the blink of an eye away.
While the White House ponders on how to deal with the situation, the president has remained on board Air Force One, determined to rescue the hostages.
This is a very good fil, well-paced and well acted. The commentary by Wolfgand Peterson reveals many interesting facts about the film including the professionalism of Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman.
My only complaint is about two sequences involving Air Force One - this is a personal thing. I hate action or stunt scenes which stretch credibility. The first scene, when Air Force One has just landed but the hijackers take off again is a little bit unbelievable. The second scene, at the end, is not only ridiculous and laughable, it is a very poor effect - looking as if the budget has just run out. Ironically, Wolfgang Peterson states that a lot of money was spent on this and he was impressed.
Still, if you enjoy a good action film which is also an edge-of-the-seat thriller, this is a good choice.",3.0
"This movie has an interesting, action-filled plot as well as a good, but it fizzles, perhaps because the screen time lavished on the action scenes robs screen time that could have been spent on character development.
Even so, in the small screen time they get, Glenn Close is convincing as the tight-jawed Vice President and Wendy Crewson scores points as a dignified First Lady, compassionate mother and loving wife.  Harrison Ford, appealingly macho as ever, occasionally distances himself from his character with a lapse into tongue-in-cheek line-readings or facial expression.  Otherwise, he is properly presidential.  As the first daughter, Liesel Matthews displays a range of emotion that many of the more seasoned supporting actors lack.
One viewing will probably be enough for most people.",3.0
"This action blockbuster is a pretty fun romp. It's a little far stretched, but who says it can't be?. Director Wolfgang Petersen delivers a top notch, high octane action film that will definitley please any action film fan. Harrison Ford stars as the President Of The United States whose plane, Air Force One, is taken over in mid-air by russian terrorists. The always excellent Gary Oldman plays the lead villain, and he does it with complete scene stealing bravado. Glenn Close co-stars as the Vice President who tries to communicate with Oldman from Washington D.C. headquarters. We've seen this before, but this is a million times better than most action films that involve hostages and planes. The action is pretty high once it gets going, and the violence is all over the place. Ford is, once again, cinema's leading hero. He can be a space pirate, adventurous professor, or the President. He can make it work every time. Even if the script doesn't always hold up to his excellence. This is one of those. If you realize that this is just pure 100% adrenaline fun, then you will have a grand time watching this fun ride. Afterwards, you'll definitley be thinking 'Harrison For President!'.",3.0
"...because he is one mean-old President when he gets his Irish up! When terrorists take over AirForce One, it's up to the President himself to subdue the enemy.

Notwithstanding that, just the kind of patriotic movie to fire up every red-blooded American.",3.0

"Harrison Ford has always & will be one of my favorite actors,but this film is not him, I mean could terrorist actually hijack Air Force One??, & if so, wouldn't the Secret Service take out half if not all of them??? this film makes the Secret Service look like idiots, I mean coming from the director of ""In the line of fire"" you would think they would at least kick a**, but they are taken out very quickly, & Ford who is the president has to fend for his self,this film is disturbing in that it comes off as a way to make the viewer think that Ford is one president who can take on terrorist by his self, despite that his wife & daughter are being held hostage, Glenn Close realisticly portrays the Vice President, but comes off as a reluctant leader, the only one who is the most convincing is Gary Oldman who gives a chilling performance as the lead terrorist who has an agenda & will kill without hesitation, Ford does his best with what he has to work with, but his president is tooo perfect, which makes this film unrealistic, there has never been a perfect president, & I not sure there will ever be, what is even more disturbing is that this film borrows to heavily on the first DIE HARD, I know many films have tried to repeat the success of DIE HARD, but this one does way toooo much, not a bad film, just a worn out concept & certainly not Ford's best work.",3.0
"If you want to see a fun movie, that has your favorite music group on it, go right ahead. Because on a regular movie list, this is nothing but stupidity. But on a fun level, it is way up there. Because i'm sure the producers knew it wasn't going to be a hit. I'm sure the Spice Girls knew it wasn't going to be a hit. But in a way it was a hit, because it just looked like the type of movie where the makers had fun making it. Overall, if you just want something to eat popcorn to and have a few laughs, go right ahead.",3.0
"Everybody has something that they enjoy and just can't explain.  They might even be a little embarassed to admit that they like it.  Well, I'm not embarassed to admit that the Spice Girls are one of my guilty pleasures.  Granted, their music may be a little hokey, but they sure are fun to listen to.  In ""Spice World,"" the girls take on a world tour with Bond-esque style.  This movie isn't fantastic, but it is fun enough for the whole family to watch.  It's silly, it's goofy, and, at times, it is brilliant.  You get a feel of what these ladies had to put up with on a daily basis, albeit in a grand and over-the-top style.  There are cameos abound in this flick as well.  The acting isn't that bad and the girls seemed to enjoy making the movie.
Funny moments abound in this flick, but some of my personal favorites are when the girls first get on their tour bus and they complain about how hot it is.  They say that they could use a fan and, in perfect British comedic style, a young, pre-teen girl comes through the door screaming with glee and then runs back out the door.  The girls sigh with comfortable relief.  Another funny moment is the expensive, special-effects laden tour-bus jumping a draw-bridge with Posh behind the wheel scene.  Finally, in the end credits, the girls ""interact"" with the audience. They remark on people making out, wonder why folks watching their video can't find anything good on the ""telly"" and audience member clothes.  The entire movie is just a fun little trip.
Alan Cumming(X-Men 2, Josey and the Pussycats) takes a turn as a reporter attempting to document the lives of these ladies.  George Wendt(Norm, of 'Cheers' fame)is a movie producer looking for a film to put the girls in and cash in on their fame.  Meatloaf is the bus driver for the girls.  Some of the better-known cameos that American audiences will recognize are Elton John, Bob Hoskins and Roger Moore.  If you're a die-hard fan of British film and television, you'll recognize many of the other cameos as well.
The only reason I'm giving this movie three stars is because,obviously, this movie isn't for everyone.  In fact, many people might think that this movie is just too silly to watch.  On my personal scale, I would give this flick four stars for the simple fact that I love to watch it and because the Spice Girls don't take themselves too seriously in the movie.
Overall, this is a silly, blatantly cheesy movie that lets you laugh at and with the Spice Girls.  They poke fun at themselves and have a good time doing it.  A good movie to watch when you have a little time to kill or just want to forget about the world(but not the 'Spice World') for awhile.",3.0
"To look at ""Air Force One"" at surface value would do it justice.  There is no deeper meaning, hidden emotion, political statement, or anything along the lines of what makes a movie great.  Above all, it is far  from showing the directing talent Peterson proved in ""Das Boot.""  AFO isn't a BAD movie.  It's just not a GOOD movie either.  ""Das  Boot"" was a classic.  ""In the Line of Fire"" was a pretty  good movie.  AFO comes in last.  The movie was filled with impressive  action sequences, but that is not the reason people go out to see movies  anymore.  Take ""Wild Wild West"" for a recent example.  On the  defense for the movie, Gary Oldman does a good job as a POed pro-Soviet  Russian idealist tyring to free a profound Soviet officer from a Russian  prison.  That part is not far fetched.  There are quite a few profound  pro-Soviet factions in Russia.  Many of them have high powers in the  government.  The idea that the next in command leader of one of them can  manage to hijack Air Force One with the mysterious help of the Secret  Service (hmm...maybe his reason for joining them will be in the Special  Edition) is where the plot becomes ridiculous.  As always, Harrison Ford  plays...Han Solo.  How he manages to be one of my favorite actors still  puts me at awe.  Despite its obvious flaws, AFO has its moments of  intensity and remains action-packed throughout.  I wouldn't rush out to buy  this one, but it is definitely a good rental.",3.0
"When a group that's the real flavour of the moment decides to make a movie, it'll either be a total success or a total flop, depending upon how universally-loved the group is.  The Beatles are hands down the most successful (Hard Day's Night, Help!) due to their immortalized status.  Others have not been so, e.g. Herman's Hermits, Bill Haley.  The Spice Girls kind of fall inbetween the two.
The primary influence is probably A Hard Day's Night.  Spiceworld is, after all, a day in the life of the Girls, and includes  musical numbers, an uptight manager, and a triumphant concert number.  Needless to say, it will never stand side-by-side with the Beatles' groundbreaking classic.
One credit in their favour is the scene where they parody their own personalities.  Victoria, for example, can't decide whether to wear the black Gucci dress, the black Gucci dress, or the black Gucci dress in her closet.  To which Emma successfully suggests, ""why don't you wear the black Gucci dress?""  Emma's baby-like innocence is also parodied.  And Geri's misquote on the Pope is a parody of what John Lennon said about Jesus.
They seem to have the most fun trying on different costumes in the ""Saturday Night Divas"" number.  Geri as Marilyn Monroe in The Seven Year Itch and Wonder Woman shines out in particular, as do Mel C. and Geri as Danny and Sandy from Grease, and Victoria as Honey Rider in Dr. No.  But the best is when some of them dress up as each other.
There are some subplots along the way, such as a documentary team following the Girls, the Girls' very pregnant friend Nicola who pops up every now and then, and a tabloid publisher who hates the girls so much, he hatches a plot to tarnish their image.  The tensions between the girls and their uptight manager Clifford, and an American film producer (George Wendt of Cheers) who consults Clifford to discuss a movie deal involving the girls.  Their Spice Force Five idea (think Spice Girls as Charlie's Angels) is actually a good segment.
There are amusing guest cameos from well-known British actors and singers, such as Richard Briers, Hugh Laurie (Wooster in Jeeves and Wooster), Stephen Fry (Jeeves in J and W), Bob Geldof, Elvis Costello, Elton John, and AbFab's Jennifer Saunders.
I doubt if Roger Moore would consider this movie as his best performance, but he seems to be enjoying himself as the Girls' behind-the-scenes handler, with some really hideous lines:  ""The drummer without sticks has no backbeat.""  Richard E. Grant though gets noteworthy mention as Clifford.  The scene of him having a real fit at seeing tabloid headlines bashing the girls is funny, but the girls laugh it off and even make fun of him, which makes him even madder.  Meat Loaf is Dennis, the Girls' loyal bus driver, and there's an in-joke when he's asked to add repairing the bus-toilet to his list of duties.  ""I love those girls.  I'll do anything for them, but I won't do that.""  Hint:  his last hit single.
The performances in this movie may depend upon which Spice Girl is your favourite.  In my case, it's Geri, Emma, and Mel C. in that order, but love or hate the movie, all the Spice Girls are still very charming and lovable.  Songs done in this movie in order:  ""Too Much"", ""Do It"", ""Say You Will Be There"", ""Mama"", ""Denying"", ""Saturday Night Divas"", ""Stop"", ""2 Become 1"", ""Leader Of The Gang"", ""Never Give Up On The Good Times"", ""My Boy Lollipop"", ""Wannabe"", ""Viva Forever"", ""Who Do You Think You Are"", ""Spice Up Your Life"", and ""The Lady Is A Vamp.""

If yes the movies for you.  Air Force one has all the action you need for a saturday night but it is just to cheesy.

The movie was great until then  and I'm thinkin (sarcastically) that's the best way to highlight a climax.  Let us face it, that is a cheesy line.
If you said no to the cheese  factor.  Its still a good movie that teaches an important lesson about  caring for your family more than anything (the spread of communism for  example). If you don't like sensitive messages then see it because it has  got some violence you will enjoy.",3.0

Well she do have charisma and good stage presence, she is an interesting person, I guess that mostly why she is in the Spice Girls, she is driven but she sure can't sing, I sing better then her and I think I sing bad.lol:)  Well like I said if you like the Spice Girls you may like this movie, it got funny part in it but it's not the movie of the year.",3.0

Spelled out clearly on the back of the VHS version's box was (more or less) how I wound up feeling after sitting through more than a lifetime's worth of Spice!  I gave the video 3 stars based off of Geri's clothing... nothing more.  Word to the wise...  ""Some spices are apt to give you gas.""  More true words have never been spoken.  Still the special effects were good.",3.0
"Air Force One!  Typical blockbuster movie with material that everyone would've seen one time or another.  The one thing that pulls it through however is the fact that they have Harrison Ford in the lead.  Unfortunately, this doesn't help the Devil's Own!
  Are we actually  meant to feel sorry for the plight of a terrorist?  Even though it's a  fellow country man, no-one would condone the killing of innocent people.  This appears to be what Harrison's character struggles with in this movie  as he has a dilema of wethering to kill Pitt or not.
  This movie may  go down well in America due to strong Irish roots, but in Britain, where  these acts of terrorism were faced on a weekly basis, it will bomb.
  This double pack is good value for money and I can see it going down really  well with Harrison Ford fans.  The sad fact is though, these two movies,  just like Seven Days, Seven Nights' are designed for the cinema.  Good on  the big screen, wouldn't want to own them though!",3.0
"Starring the British girl-power band formerly known as the Spice Girls, Spice World is better than anyone has any right to expect. Even the most hardened Spice-hater (of which I am definitely one) should find something to like.
The tongue-in-cheek approach taken by Spice World is what makes the movie work. The Spice Girls, while not Oscar-caliber actresses, do manage to pull off their roles with relative panache. (It helps that they're playing themselves.)
However, there are frequent musical numbers, which (unless you're a fan of the Spice Girls' music) are painful to listen to. Times like this are what the mute button is made for.
All in all, an amusing, if forgettable movie.",3.0

"Who cares if the plot made no sense, who cares if they couldn't act, what did you expect?  These are the Spice Girls!  No one ever nominated them for a Grammy, so why should you critize them for not trying to use millions  of dollars to get an Oscar nomination? It's sorta sick to see so many  movies try to break box office records and get Oscar noms. They just wanted  to make a movie in which you could just sit back and laugh. They didn't  expect to last forever as a band, or actresses. So get over it! I got this  movie over a year ago and I still watch it from time to time. It's just a  time capsule of how earth was durin the brief moment it was known as Spice  World. It would've been worse if these girls actually took themselves  seriously and tried to go off and act in 'real movies'. If you're a true  fan of these girls, you'll watch it.",3.0

I loved it when they sang the old Gary Glitter song.  They made fun of themselves a little, which is always a good thing.  They  may not be the most talented or gorgeous beings in the world, but at least  they don't make you want to die of sadness like a lot of acts today do  (well, depending on who you are!)

Spice girls was an okay movie I found myself liking it but not enough to buy it. It could have been better i think they needed a more comedy in it.  This is the kind of movie where you really have to be a fan of the spice  girls to really like it.,3.0
"If you are looking for a DVD movie with great sound, then this is one of them.  If you are looking for a great movie as well as great sound, get  something else.  Harrison Ford is my favorite actor and I looked forward  with great anticipation to seeing it for the first time.  But WOW, was I  disappointed.  I tried to use my imagination during this ridiculous movie,  but I was too busy constantly saying ""Awww, come on..."", ""No  way..."", or ""Gimmie a break!""  Harrison Ford was pretty  good, but Glenn Close and Dean Stockwell give miserable performances.  I  even gave it a fair, second chance and was equally disgusted as the first  time.  This may be one of the most unrealistic blockbuster movies of all  time.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the sound, otherwise  I give it 2 stars.",3.0
"Film boasts some of the best New Orleans scenery. For anyone who has visited this city, it creates nostalgia immediately. One of Gere's lesser works but has plenty action. Bassinger was there for her body. Service was great.",3.0
"Although the film is a bit dated, it is worth watching for Kim Basinger's performance as an illiterate bayou girl.  Compare this performance with the super smart callgirl in LA Confidential -- she does have range.

Buy it used at the cheapest price -- you won't be disappointed.",3.0
"Richard Gere is the tough Chicago cop who goes to the Big Easy to track down the killer of his partner. This killer is a much feared hood in New Orleans named Losado. While down there Gere runs into Kim Basinger, a ""slave"" of Losado's, and he becomes determined to free her as well as kill Losado. This is all very typical thriller fare, although it can be pretty suspenseful at times--especially in the bayous and, of course, the big ending where Gere gets his man in a nail-biting shoot out and fire. But after you've seen this, ask yourself the next day how much you can remember. Note: There's a scene in the picture that's stolen directly from Hitchcock's ""The 39 Steps"": Gere and Basinger are handcuffed together as they make their escape through the swamps.",3.0

"Review of ""Steel Magnolias""
Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017

There are so many reasons to watch Steel Magnolias, and once youve watched it, you can cross it off your classics to watch list and move on to the next one.

Youll appreciate the large cast (Shirley MacLaine, Dolly Parton, Olympia Dukakis, Sally Field, Daryl Hannah, Tom Skerritt, Sam Shepard, Dylan McDermott) and youll get a kick out seeing Julia Roberts in the movie just before she donned knee high boots for Pretty Woman. And yes, youll laugh and shed a tear, but then youll survive. This isn't Terms of Endearment.

Steel Magnolias will appeal to the Fried Green Tomatoes, Crimes of the Heart, and August: Osage County. In other words, its a movie about a bunch of Southern women muddling through life, with a little tragedy, a few chuckles, and a sweet tea or two. If you like those types of movies, add this to your weekend watch list and start popping that corn!",3.0

"I wanted to watch this with my sisters, since it seemed like a classic chick flick. We enjoyed it until about halfway through, during the football locker-room scene. The football players were shown nude (though only from the back), and by that time, we were also quite tired of hearing the word s**t, which peppers the dialogue very frequently.

Otherwise, probably a nice film, though we did not finish it.",3.0
"This is a question for all the critics of the film.
Can we all least agree that if you took the section of the movie where they played The Band's ""The Weight"" it would make one kickass 5 minute music video? That is the only part of the movie that I try to catch when I see it playing on tv.

Otherwise, even though I find the movie to have some redeeming qualities (at least it documented the aimlessness of the hippie/commune generation and the attitude of the mainstream toward them at that time) I agree that the plot is pointless (mirroring the aimlessness?).

Did anyone else recognize one of the commune leaders from Star Trek (TOS)? I believe he played a troubled teen named Charlie that had been raised by aliens that taught him the ability to use his mind to control humans. When the Enterprise picks him up to take him back to humans he has trouble adjusting and uses his powers negatively.",3.0
"An A-list cast and sleek Hollywood production values can't overcome the fact this film adaptation sucks a good deal of the life and feeling out of the play on which it is based.  Attempts to ""open up"" the story by leaving the beauty parlor set which was the location of the play and adding male characters only dilute the material.  The most egregious mistake is showing the death of one of the characters, rather than allowing us to experience it though the originally powerful final monologue of another character.  This makes that monologue (significantly cut) anticlimactic.  A tacked-on feel good ""the cycle of life continues"" coda  only makes the petering out of energy more pronounced.  Performances range from good (Sally Field) to phoned in (Olympia Dukakis) to perfectly dreadful (Shirley McLaine).  A good example of how ""the industry"" can botch good material.",3.0

"I saw this movie years ago, when it came out and remember loving it. This time it felt so dated and corny and melodramatic, I couldn't believe it! Even young Julia Roberts seemed like a mediocre actress, and Dolly Parton was off-the-charts hokey. Most of the jokes were simply not funny, and at least a third of the film should have been edited out. Instead the scenes went on and on and on....I guess our tastes  and sensibilities change, and apparently, I'd say for the better. It's not that the movie was terrible; it still had some nice features, and a few of the actors were convincing or entertaining. Shirley MacLaine and Olympia Dukakis, for example, were hilarious foils for each other. Sally Field was mostly really good, despite a questionable script. Scrap the rest, especially the contrived Louisiana ambience and fake accents. Not authentic, not colorful. Don't bother. I give it three stars for effort, a few touching scenes and a sweet/sad theme about self-sacrifice for someone you love.",3.0

"A bunch of women in Louisiana interact as one of their daughters is getting married. They continue to interact after the daughter dies. It is supposed to be one of those ""southern themed"" shows of the late 80s/90s that was pretty persistent in American culture then for whatever reason. Anyway, it was almost as if this movie tried to make being southern ""hip""/""cool"". They were portrayed as foul, immoral, eccentric air heads. Dunno. Maybe there was still some of the typical US socio-economic put down in there. Who knows? Anyway, the movie is over the top with this drama and sensationalism. I mean I have known people with diabetes before. Some who died from it as they had a horrific life with it--uncontrollable. But I have never seen any take a fit smacking at their new hair do like the Roberts character did. Just goofy. Kinda laugh out loud. Anyway, the one ""Christian"" in the movie was of course just an ""embarrassment annoyance"" designed to frame such people as such. We of course get to see Sally Field cry AGAIN. We get to see the tear jerking moment of when a husband signs away his wife's life by consenting to have her ""unplugged""--we humans sure do have such hard choices in life don't we--at least according to liberals.",3.0

"I recently watched the flick again after not seeing it for many years. I did see when it first came out. It was the movie to see if you were of a certain age. But I didn't like it much then, and I feel about the same now. However, I did like the scenes of the American southwest as it is my favorite place to vacation. But the central theme of the movie: freedom? Uh, no thanks. Living that kind of life is just as deadening as any traditional way of life you can think of. Constantly getting high and saying ""groovy man"" ? Sorry. And the two main characters, Wyatt and Billy, are actually criminal drug-smugglers. But of course to the geniuses at Rolling Stone and other leftist, counter-culture outlets, they were ""heroes"" who were thumbing their noses at  America and the man. The South really takes it on the chin with the climax of the movie and all the scenes in-between. Jack Nicholson's career was kick-started (ha, ha) by this flick, but his oft-quoted line about people hating Wyatt and Billy because they represented freedom is a crock. Most adults looked at hippies as drug-addled lunatics who were wasting their lives. Which they were. Another myth left over from the sixties is that most kids were hippies like the dolts in the commune. The fact is only a tiny percentage of kids (less than 5%) were hippies. So as an entertaining medium Easy Rider barely satisfies. It's interesting to me for reasons other than being a realistic movie. Which it isn't.  But as far as being a great flick...no way MAAAAAAAAN!!!",3.0
Sound on the disk was not good.,3.0
It was an okay film. I not mad that I watched it. I was a little surprised that so many people feel as though it is a classic. I felt that the production value was really kind of low and the editing was terrible. The story was interesting but  enough because it showed a glimpse of what the 60's counter culture was like. And I assume it was accurate because people that spent their formative years in the 60's seem to enjoy this film. Over all I can just say that it was just okay.,3.0
"I've never been able to watch this whole movie from start to finish. It just isn't much of a story, the two ""heroes"" aren't really heroic, because they have no cause, no challenge. Their only challenge is to try to live free and be stoned, and the world won't allow them to do it.
Before you go there, I am very much a child of that era and the sound track is fantastic. That's what I watch the movie for from time to time.",3.0
"This movie was originally released when I was around 12 years old, my parents took me to see it, back then I didn't really understand much of the movie, to this day, I kind of get the intended message, but in spite of a great cast of young actors it just sort of went about it's still semi-convoluted message of personal freedoms and generational conflict in a round about way.

Some of the music was awesome, the music really tied the scenes together, but seeing a young Jack Nicholson and Dennis Hopper was a rush.  Again, it's okay, maybe serious baby boomers and Vietnam era guys will have a different read than I do.

The music was great and some of the cinematography was good.  Honestly, the soundtrack was the best part for me, maybe I'm still that 12 year old kid looking at that era from the outside.",3.0

I was eager to see the movie again but time has not been kind to it.  Jack Nicholson's performance was still great and a lot of fun to watch but his time is brief in the movie.

"'Easy Rider' tells of two bikers (Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper) traveling through the Southwest and South set in the 1960s. Hippies and drug use are explored, as well as the general antagonism towards 'long-hairs.' Fonda dresses in a leather jacket with an American flag on the back, while Hopper wears Native American-style buckskin pants and shirts. Fonda is appreciative of others, while Hopper is often hostile and leery of outsiders. Money is provided from the sale of cocaine from Mexico in L.A.

The two are given some LSD after leaving a commune, and told to share it with 'the right people.' Jokingly riding within a small-town parade, the two are arrested and meet ACLU lawyer/local drunk Jack Nicholson who helps get them out of jail. Later the trio are beaten at night by locals; Nicholson is killed and the other two suffer minor injuries. The two then make it to Mardi Gras in New Orleans, and later Fonda realizes their 'freedom' isn't that rewarding.

The movie ends when two other rednecks spot them, decide to 'scare the hell out of them' with a shotgun, and end up killing both after Hopper gives the one the finger.

Overall, the dialogue is minimal, and the acting even worse - except for Nicholson. On the one hand, the movie was totally boring and centers around lifestyles I dislike. On the other hand, it does a fair job of depicting the counter-culture lifestyle. Regardless, Peter Fonda looks as much like a motorcyclist as I look like Mr. T.",3.0
good movie just thought it whould be better but i guess that it was great for its time 3 out of 5,3.0
"Iconic, but dull as ditch water. With actors hired on location, jump cuts, improvisation, tripping camera guys, rock soundtrack, this is a pothead's tribute to Godard, Kerouac, and those who pursued,and missed, the American Dream.  Captain America and Billy don't represent freedom so much as the alternative culture's imitation of Big Time Capitalism.  ""We blew it,"" Captain America says. Evidently, lots of cultures ""blow it"" in this film:  The Anasazis, farmers--the film is littered with the wreckage of lost cultures.  The commune where the guys grab lunch shows the perils of self-absorption.  Clearly, the living-off-the land thing ain't easy even if Captain America admires it.  There's lots of eco-porn here.  The camera gives us too many panoramic shots of purple mountains' majesty.  Woodstock is over; the Age of Aquarius offered little but grass-fueled talk about Porky Pig. Billy and CA, like Butch and Sundance, are relics of an age gone by. Not so much an age but an over-exposed blip on the screen.  The idealism of trust-fund hippies hasn't worked out. On to the 70s!  Fleetwood Mac, double-knit suits, disco and the Ford Pinto!  Mostly ER is a film about film-making; this doesn't make for edge-of-the-seat viewing though. Borrow your buddy's copy.",3.0
"What kind of capitalist plot is that?  Guess I'll wait for it to come around to pay-cable again!
BTW, the scene where they can't get a room at a motel?  It's not because they were long-haired hippy bikers, but because they were F**ING rude!",3.0
"I remember being blown away by this movie when it first came out in 1969. Just the bikers in the final scene, especially, left me breathless. I remember leaving the theater feeling depressed because the conflict between the hippy bikers and the rednecks who finally shoot them dead seemed so emblematic of the bigger divide in society then between the straights and the hippies. Of course, I was only 16 then. What did I know? Today, this film plays a little differently. You have to look at it in its own context. Yes, the dialogue is ridiculous. And there is really no plot, to speak of. The soundtrack, which was very cool and original in its day, has, of course, been superceeded many times over by newer films that make more sophisticated use of music. The New Orleans cemetery scene is the weakest section. It was shot out of context from the rest of the film, and was something done first as a way for the filmmakers to try to get some money to make this movie. Dennis Hopper was a Hollywood pariah at the time. No one wanted to work with him because of his crazed drugging and drinking. Jack Nicholson was largely unknown, then a star of many obscure B-movies. Peter Fonda was the big man then, ironic because today he is the most forgotten of the three, never having made much in the way of other hit movies. See this as a piece of history, and maybe even entertainment, if you are nostalgic for the 60s.",3.0
"Peter FONDA was never a good actor but one will still enjoy this old movie, not having seen it before i was startled at the ending",3.0
"Sitting in a USC screening room with Peter Fonda, I remember seeing this iconic film before it was released.  At the time, I was dealing with my application for Conscientious Objector status with the draft board.  I was also being hassled by the FBI as an outspoken critic of the Viet Nam war.

The movie poster of Fonda as Captain America with a flag-embossed jacket riding on a big bike with the caption ""A man went looking for American and couldn't find it anywhere"" resonated with me.

SPOILER ALERT: And at the end, when the redneck in the pickup with the bulging tumor shoots ""Billy"" and ""Wyatt (Fonda and Dennis Hopper)"" I was incensed.  I felt I was the victim! This was the same world I was in.  The same prejudice.  The same hate.  Reel life was real life. END SPOILER ALERT.

This film was the first big ""youth movie"" that perfectly targeted its already alienated audience.  It was a bulls-eye.  For me, it was a brave movie because I knew that the creative team of writer Terry Southern, director Dennis Hopper, actors Jack Nicholson and Peter Fonda truly believed what they put on the screen.  This movie empowered me.  I realized I was not alone in how I saw the world, the war and America.

As a film student, I was not just interested in film as propaganda, but also in how the film was shot.  I knew it was shot for cheap - less than $500K.  (Recently, I ran into Fonda and he told me the actual cost was $250,000!)  I liked ow the movie broke some cinematic rules, like the law of ""consistent screen direction"" by having the bikes go in all directions.  There was the innovative use of music I actually listened too.  Wow, the Electric Prunes!  How did they know?

I wondered if the dope they smoked on screen was real and I asked Fonda.  He smiled and said, ""Of course.""  I liked that.  I liked the stoned ""Freedom"" speech from Jack Nicholson.  I believed what Jack said.  Those were my words too!  This movie made Jack Nicholson a star, and with the perfect audience that identified with him from the start.

I still love the joyful, free, wide-angle moving shots of the bikes on the open road with Steppenwolf's ""Born to be Wild"" pulsating on the soundtrack.  ""Get your motor running...""  Oh yeah.

Watching the movie today with the hindsight of alleged maturity(?), I now see an amateurish film.  Indulgent and sloppy.  Silly in places.  But the core question of What Is America? rings truer than ever.

Look for ward-of-the-state, convicted murderer and former record producer Phil Spector as a dope dealer in the opening scenes.  (R, widescreen, 95 minutes)",3.0
"This is certainly the best independent film ever made and is also one of the best films ever.  This film succeeds in documenting the 60s counter-culture a.k.a. hippy generation very well and explores even deeper issues in addressing questions such as what is freedom and does it really exist in the ""land of the free and the home of the brave?""  Fonda and Hopper play a couple of bikers who ironically in trying to live a free life become hated by the mainstream who fear what this freedom represents.  This eventually results in their persecution and destruction.  I really enjoyed all the symbolism that inundates throughout the film from the insertion of the money into the gas tank painted with the Stars and Stripes symbolising how drug money obtained from drug pushing is effectively screwing the nation for example to the murderous scenes at the end symbolising the hypocrisy of a nation that espouses freedom that kills the very citizens that strive to practice it in its purest form.

Jack Nicholson is excellent here as the drunken lawyer who is sympathetic to the bikers at the ultimate personal cost although the entire cast I thought was very good.  This film also must contain what must be one of the best ever movie soundtracks which has been very well remastered into Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound quality.  The only unfortunate thing about this dvd version though is the poor picture quality which is full of imperfections such as white spots throughout.  Here's hoping the future Blu-ray release will address this issue.

Otherwise, this is an excellent film that attempts to hide nothing and to fully show life in a certain period of the 60s warts and all.  No film buff's dvd library should be without this title but wait for a properly restored version perhaps on Blu-ray to surface and give this version a miss.

Inspired film-making that rewards repeated viewing.

Updated 29 May 2011:

As Amazon will not allow me to review this separately the Blu-Ray version of this film is a little of a mixed bag as both the picture and sound qualities although an improvement over the dvd version are only slightly so.  As this was a low budget affair I suspect the 16 mm film can only look so much better even on 1080p without a proper restoration which hasn't been done here.  Still, if you haven't already got this film then this blu-ray version is the best there is to date but if you already have the dvd, it's tough to justify the double dip.  Maybe you will want to wait to see if a proper full-scale restoration is done on the picture quality for every frame and if they will provide a proper DTS HD MA 5.1 surround option as well as the Dolby True HD and PCM Surround options for some reason are not much better than the dvd version.",3.0
"Ok so in 35 years there is still no director's cut? I've heard that this version we all know and love of easy rider is only about 40% of what was the original director's cut. If someone is going to put out a special edition, then supposing we finally see a second disk with the 3 or so hours of deleted scenes? And I mean- a director's cut movie, not just a bunch of isolated deleted scenes. Also, if you're going to add bonus soundtrack items, how about including the Hendrix tune from the movie, which I think is about the only one i remember from the movie that is not in the original movie soundtrack lp. But.. besides me wanting to know what the other 3 hours was like, this movie is all time classic independent american cinema and highly recommended to anyone over 18. It has great performances by many folks down to the louisiana locals who were used to make the movie more authentic. The trip scene was bizare for its time and arguably even for today, but very relatable, if you are 'experienced'. The scenery is absolutely stunning (watch it in WIDEscreen). And it's a great look at a country polarized by cultures and an unpopular war (sound familiar?) Buy the movie but save on the 'extras' till the 'extras' means the whole 4+ hours movie.",3.0
"Despite an all star cast the main characters were not well developed, let alone the secondary ones and the story predictable.",3.0
"I was 11 years old when this came out. So of course I heard a lot about it but didn't see this movie. So when I had a chance to watch it I decided to see what the fuss was about. Well, considering the times it was made, it was a radical departure from the norm. Nudity, pot smoking and perhaps other no-nos of that period.

The story is kinda boring. Two motorcycle enthusiasts take a trip to New Orleans to go to Mardi Gras. There is tragedy because of prejudice and so there is a sad quality to this film. Still, it's not a great movie just ahead of it's time...maybe. Plus it introduced the great actor Jack Nicholson.",3.0
"I must say, this movie was interesting in how it carried itself. It reflected a nice idea of how the sub-culture of freedom was mashed with the majority of close-minded fools. It had some of the same ideals I tend to have about the mixing of beliefs.

The movie gave you plenty of images of how Wyatt and Billy's life could be. Buying their own farmland, living on a commune, or even catering to the majority and living in an all prejudice town. It even talks about the idea of perfect communism (Which is unachievable by man) in Jack Nickolson's UFO speech. You look at the lifestyles of the commune and the two bikers and see how redneck bigotism treats this change from the socially acceptable. There are plenty of subtle messages in this movie that you would have to think about to understand.

I bet almost anyone would tell you that Jack Nickolson portrayed George Hanson better than any being on earth. That's because it's true. Unless you are the redneck bigot as explained above, you can't help, but like George. Sure, he may be a drunkard, but he is the embodiment of activism for freedom and sanity in this world. He just wants everyone to get along. He also shows that even someone from the south does have common sense. This is perfect, considering many pre-judgements upon southern people. You just wish he didn't have to die, but because of how pro-freedom minds were treated, it was inevitable.

Although this movie has wonderful ideas and promotes a humanitarian view, it doesn't quite always get the ideas down well. I found the movie to be very plain in the beginning, because I found that to be one of the most boring drug runs I've ever seen on movie. I might have missed something with the planes going over the car, but that seemed like a waste of time to me. It trails you off until you reach the farm and start to see some ideas grow. Another part was Mardi Gras. I felt like that man could have done anything better than he did. It wasn't the drugs that bothered me. It was how they enacted self-demoralization, which I felt wasn't really important to what the movie was trying to say. I was so excited for Mardi Gras and a big let-down fell over me when I saw it. The prostitutes were fun, the idea of going out was amazing, and BAM! I already get proselytized enough. If these things were out of the movie, I would have enjoyed it more.

The ending couldn't have been more true. This was really the way it had to be, considering the time-frame they want to cover. It had all the things to leave you feeling cold inside. That's the way a strong tragedy ends. This ending was so good, it was covered by the Venture Brothers in the last episode of the first season where the two boys die.

To head onto the book, I found it almost pointless. It just seemed like a bunch of vanity rolled into ready made bong material. The book could have been perfect if it just had explained all the signs in the movie. No one cares about Fonda picking his nose. Unless you want to, of course.

The biggest failure of this movie is how corporate capitalism rips off the public with it's ""songtrack"". People want to watch the movie and if they like the music, listen to the full version soundtrack. If you want to buy this, get the non-special edition.

Overall it was worth watching and maybe more of a rentable than a buyable.",3.0
"The best part of this DVD is the bonus ""Making of Easy Rider"" documentary.  It unintentionally helps to deflate all the current bloated ideas about the significance of this movie.  Take this movie for what it is: a film with two hippies enjoying freedom by riding cool bikes through beautiful scenery with cool music.  Add to it some good acting by Jack Nicholson (which offsets Peter Fonda's atrocious acting) and some fairly good documentation of the zeitgeist, and it's certainly worth 90 minutes of your time.  But don't look to this as a profound comment on life and society, because it's too mixed up and/or lightweight.

Why was it mixed up?  Partially because everyone except the cinematographer was stoned all the time, including the director Dennis Hopper.  No one was really in charge.  Everyone had big ideas for how things should go, more than half the dialogue was improvised, and lots of other things were determined on the fly as well (after huge arguments). The funniest revelation in the ""Making Of"" documentary was the fact that Hopper's original cut of the movie was three hours long! He apparently thought he was making a huge statement with this thing, but it really just shows his lack of directorial judgement and clear concept of what he was trying to accomplish.

There's a lot of silly, amateurish symbolism in the film: the scene where Peter Fonda throws off his watch, the simultaneous horseshoeing and motorcycle tire-fixing, the ""Wyatt"" and ""Billy"" cowboy stuff, etc.  The ""Making Of"" documentary reveals that the guys thought they were packing the film with a lot of other symbolism as well, none of it very well done: the cemetary statue that Peter Fonda talks to is supposed to represent the Statue of Liberty; when the plastic tube full of drug money is being shoved inside Peter Fonda's Stars and Stripes gas tank, that's supposed to represent money screwing America; and so on.

When the guys producing/directing a film have no real focus,  are making it up as they go along, have no self-editing abilities to begin with, then aggravate that problem by staying stoned all the time, it's expecting too much for there to be a coherent end product.  What is the message of this movie anyway?  There's probably a little morality tale in there somewhere, something along the lines of ""freedom is good, prejudice is bad"", but to read much more than that into it is to wander into a thicket of half-constructed themes that aren't very well thought out or presented.

So, don't take it too seriously.  It's definitely better than the rest of the biker films of the era, because it doesn't rely on the scandalous antics of depraved Hell's Angels-types.",3.0
"This movie may not appeal to everyone, but it definitely lives up to the title.  It doesnt reach out and grab you and force you to pay attention, but it's not boring either.  It is pretty relaxing to watch.  There really isn't much of a story, but overall, the movie is interesting.",3.0

"It is an excellent experience to watch this DVD after all these years of being an X fan.  It was also very cool to watch this right after a repeated viewing of the DVD X--The Unheard Music (1985).  X still has every ounce of energy and connection it had back then. The only reason I gave it four stars is that John Doe's Bass is overshadowed in the mix.  But having said that, it is a DVD I will treasure for years to come.",4.0
"Just like volume 1, this is an excellent collection of Scripture songs with short explanations in between. Once you get past the late 80s/early 90s clothing and hair styles, the DVD is fun. I purchased this for my 3 year old as the whole family loves volume 1. Some observations:
1. Compared to Volume 1, the verse selection is a little weak but still profitable. Volume 1 verses are readily applicable to a young child and understood. Volume 2 verses are best understood with a little more context, so perhaps a slightly older child who already knows some Bible.
2. Vocal ranges: As a former music teacher, I tend to be very picky about vocal ranges for children. In general, D to D is best. This volume has multiple songs that go lower briefly. Still, it's not nearly as low as a lot of the children's music I hear coming out now.
3. Pitch: Several of the songs feature children who aren't quite on pitch. In the video, you see the child in context and it's cute. But on the CD, it jarring to my ears. If it were just at the end of a song as a cute touch, it wouldn't be bad, but having an out-of-tune singer lead a song is just painful. Now, this probably would not drive the average non-musician crazy at all, so take this comment with a grain of salt.
4. Song complexity: In volume 1, the song was first presented in its simplest form and then repeated with added complexity. In volume 2, the complexity is sometimes brought in at the beginning. This is just fine for a slightly older child.

Even with these critiques, I am pleased with this CD/DVD. My daughter loves it, and I love that she's getting God's truth engrained into her heart. If I didn't have volume 1 to compare it with, I probably would have given it 5 stars.",4.0

"Haters will say this is biased, that the founding fathers were not christians, or that they were deists...and maybe that's true for some of the ff. But this documentary is very informative.

"This video presents a very good capsular History of our country and its founding principles.  It the progresses on through the history of america and how the fabric of what once made her an unusual nation began to deteriorate.  America was founded through a war that broke the shackles of a tyrant King George and on the basis of religious freedom. Many were still not free and so a second war would ensue .  Family, Faith, personal responsibility, generosity, work, morality, integrity and freedom are all part of that legacy.  Oven the decades those have been eroded.  This is the story of how and when it happened.",4.0

"Henry Winkler proves his acting ability in this American version of the Dickens classic. One will actually forget that he was 'The FONZ' and will be amazed at his transformation from nice guy to mean guy back to nice guy. The general feel of this movie, though, is grey. That's the best way to describe it. But then, it was a bleak grey time in American history, with the Great Depression and all. When Dickens originally wrote the book, it was a grey time in England's history as well, so the subdued feeling one gets while watching this 'modern' version fits in well with the spirit of the original story.
A nice twist (sorry, Oliver!) to a true classic.
By the way, for my money, the finest original version out there is the George C. Scott version followed closely by Alistair Sim.",4.0
"Being a huge fan of this classic, I own dozens of versions and this one  adds a nice variety.

"This is your classic Christmas Carol with Henry Winkler playing Scrooge. He was actually fairly young when he played this part. They did a great job making him look like an old man.

"Nice drama- based on the original Christmas Carol movie.  This version stars Henry Winkler as Scrooge and takes place during the Depression in America.  Winkler plays Scrooge as a business owner who offers home furnishings to be paid off over time.  But most people can,t pay off the entire bill due to job scarcity - etc- and Winkler ends up repossessing much of what he has ""sold"".  Soon ""ghosts""- ( passed aquaintances in this version)- of Chistmas past, present, and future appear taking Winkler back through time and into the future showing him his past and what the future holds in store for one of his ""value system"" ,  Winkler realizes that he best become more kinder and more considerate of the needs of his town neighbors or risk dying a lonely and embittered man.  Dramatic with poignant scenes.  Held my attention throughout!",4.0
Winkler does a little over-the-top in his role as the scrooge character and the production values leave somewhat more to be desired but all-in-all a nice rendition for holiday viewing.,4.0

"The best thing about this movie is that its not much different than the Christmas Carols that came before it.

Seriously, the setting is changed, its moved to a small New England town during the Great Depression. This is the perefect setting, the time and place are quite reminiscent of Dickens' London, so you don't have the distraction from making major changes. Aside from the setting, you have a fairly typical Christmas Carol. Sure, Henry Winkler's Benedict Slade doesn't go around saying bah humbug, nor does he have a nephew, but he's no different than Ebeneezer Scrooge. Nor is he a boy growing up in a boarding school (tyical for England at the time) hated by his father for his mother dying in childbirth, instead he's an orphan. Same impact, but appropriate for the time and place.

As a TV movie, its a bit lacking compared to other versions, the budget is more visible than typical, but wise use of settings and lesser TV actors help. While many of the supporting cast are familiar, none are stars of any sort, just standard supporting actors. The play like use of three of Slade's debtors to represent the three spirits works very well, giving their parts more weight and saving the production money, ditto for the reuse of sets when they're not outside. The ghost of Christmas future is the greatest departure from the original, after all, in this movie he can talk, and we actually see what he looks like. And his very dated arrival is a bit funnier than was intended, but that journey still carries weight.

Over all, well done and believable without significantly rewriting a classic. I recommend this as the best of the alternates for those who like a bit of variety without a complete rewrite of the story.",4.0
"Not the best quality DVD, but it's a great story. I recommend it to all.",4.0
Since I was a child many years past I have been interested in Dickens Christmas Carol. When I saw this version it stood out amoung the many other versions out there. Henry Winkler plays a good scrooge charactor. The story itself is based on Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol and the story sticks very close to the original with a 1920s depiction of the American depression.,4.0

"A brilliant adaptation of Dickson's classic set in early 20th century New England.

You'll love it.",4.0
"Fun DVD and I always like the Christmas Carol, this is not quite up as high as others but I still watch it every year.",4.0
"This movie was made in 1979, when Henry Winkler was in his heyday of playing ""The Fonz"" on ""Happy Days"".  It was exciting back then to see what else he could do, and he came through admirably.

This movie hasn't played on TV in at least a decade that I remember, and it should be, for it's a fresh take on the old Dickens tale.

The setting is Concord, NH in 1933, and miserly Benedict Slade goes about repossessing people's furniture, stoves, radios - and even a piano from a children's orphanage! - on Christmas Eve.

Then come the visitations and, well, we know the rest of the story.

Pick it up for a treat for next Christmas.",4.0
"I loved this film when it was on tv when I was in High School; seeing it on DVD was an enjoyable experience, but I found an annoying problem in continuity: Winkler's character seems to be growing up in the 1890s, which is fine, but at one point we see him at a WWI War Bond Rally, and he seems to be in his early-thirties.  Yet just fifteen years later, during the Great Depression, he's a very old man.  So what's the deal?  It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around, so they decided to twist time around to fit the props.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution, then a young man during WWI, then a very old man during the Depression.  Very odd.

I have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available, they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact.  When Slade sees his gravestone, it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene, and in his mid-fifties in 1933, when the film is supposed to be taking place.  Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher, but this part always bugged me.  Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense, but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later. They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props,) making his age in 1933 more believable.  Oh well, great movie.",4.0
"This is my favorite rendition of the classic Dickens story ""A Christmas Carol.""  Although the versions with George C. Scott and Patrick McNee are also very good, and I watch them at least once every holiday season, they emphasize the British and Victorian aspects of the story.  I am fond of ""An American Christmas Carol"" because it is set during the Depression and shows aspects of American society during that period.  The primary element missing from this version of the story is that Scrooge's sister and, hence, her son (Scrooge's nephew) are missing from this version, presumably in order to fit the original version within a specific time frame.  As a result the story element where the nephew's friends ridicule Scrooge's miserliness, and the corresponding redemptive element after the visitations are missing.  I felt that Henry Winkler performed the role of Scrooge admirably, even though he was only 34 at the time.  Usually the role is performed by an actor of mature years.",4.0

"I actually love this movie and think it is well acted.  However, like another reviewer, I thought there were a couple of scenes about Potiphar's wife's attempts at seduction that were completely gratuitous and stretch what scripture says, hence only 4 stars.  The Bible isn't broken, don't try to fix it.  Every other part is quite wonderful.  I just fast-forward through the unnecessary parts.  Joseph is my favorite character in the Bible, after Jesus of course.",4.0
"The movie is one of my favorites out of the collection. Not cinematic equalvalence to perfection, but a timeless story that I am more than willing to watch over and over again. I had trouble with the DVD playing and returning to its previous main menu. And I wish the movie had bonus material. However, I am satisfied with the product, i just wish I knew exactly what I was buying to make a richer experience.",4.0
"The lengthy erotic scenes should be  done in better taste..too much!!  Though I realize Scriptures are full of real life encounters more explicit than this to see them in technicolor acted out is too much! In spite of this its an excellent movie Ben Kingsley is always exceptional!  Awesome movie!!! Can't watch this with the children though, of couse you could fast-forward past it.",4.0
"The price tripled from two weeks ago. It is a good movie, good actors, and acting,  and pretty true to the bible story of Joseph and his brothers. But  it is not right that they increase the price so much. So I will wait until it goes back down to get another one.",4.0

"Well should easily be a 5 star, but knowing Hollywood they had to make it just a touch resque when Potiphar's wife is temping Joseph.  If they had left that out, it wouldn't have hurt the movie a bit and would have been a clear 5 star and probably gotten the Dove seal. Still very good and accurate as well as detailed and entertaining.",4.0
A nice alternative to the classic. Can be used to get the point across but it is different that the Bible in some points,4.0
"Very well done.  Overall it's faithful to the Book of Genesis, which it portrays.  Only in a few details it contradicts Genesis, such as:  When Joseph first appears before Pharaoh, the book of Genesis says that he ""shaved,"" implying that he had had a beard before this.  The movie, however, has him clean-shaven throughout.  A serious flaw is that the movie has Joseph's brothers threaten to attack him with spears just before he reveals his identity to them.  Also, Joseph's servant cuts the brothers' grain sacks open, spilling the grain on the ground.  Rather, Genesis leads me to believe that he simply opened the sacks and looked inside.  Also, Genesis says that the brothers took chariots laden with provisions to tell Jacob of Joseph's position in Egypt.  The movie has them walking all the way, with no chariots.

The scene where Potiphar's wife tries to seduce Joseph is a little to racy.  He's clearly naked in a bath, and she touches him.  This could have been done better.

In spite of these and certain other flaws, I give the movie four stars, since it's well done and inspirational.",4.0
I enjoyed this much better than the movies Abraham or Jacob - this was pretty accurate although still some unnecessary additions but totally enjoyable as Joseph pictures Christ in over 60 references!!,4.0
"Though it's been a while, I recall this as being a rather excellent film.  Peter Chattaway tells us that ""disparate elements are woven into Joseph's story without sacrificing the film's dramatic unity; the result is unexpectedly coherent, even poignant....[It]is about as rich a three-hour epic as one could want from television: complex, challenging and convincing, it has enough emotional power to draw you into its world and enough realism to make you want to stay there (Review: The Bible Collection, Patheos(dot)com, 1996)",4.0
A believable re-telling of the story while respecting it. Exceptional performances by stellar cast. And all of it at a great price!,4.0
Love this movie! It came later than it said it would but worth the wait. Would recommend it to anyone.,4.0
"I liked this movie, except one scene where Potipher's wife is seducing Joseph, and he has a hard time resisting at first, whereas, Biblically, I think he was stronger than that.  I REALLY like the actor playing Potipher.  Because of the scene mentioned, I am hesitant to allow my younger children to view it. But, other than that, it was done excellently.",4.0
"I had originally bought the VHS version of the movie and I was delighted that I found it on DVD. There was a scene in the movie that was edited somewhat on the VHS version. That scene I wasn't happy with, and it detracted away from the wholesomeness of the movie, but overall I think it is a good movie and it depicts the biblical account of Joseph's life. It is a good movie, and worth buying and watching. Not likely to allow younger children under 10 to see it though (with out editing that graphic scene).",4.0
"This telling of the story of Joseph in the TNT Bible Collection is very good.  Although certain liberties were taken with the account as fleshed out in the Bible, these did not impact the overall telling of the story in keeping with what the Bible reveals.  The use of Joseph telling of his early history with his brothers and how he came to be a slave in Egypt was done as a flashback, which actually enhanced the dramatic telling of the story.  Very nicely done and mostly true to the Bible account.",4.0
"Overall, I enjoyed this movie, espescially its ending. The casting was great (Okay fine, Josephs former master was a white woman, so what? She played her part well I thought). Sexually explicit scenes? Give me a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes. There was a scene of Joseph in the bath being tempted by Potiphar's wife. This is no different from a man/woman dealing with sexual thoughts/temptations daily, and that powerful scene would give any Christian in the spirit a visual illustration of the pressure Joseph felt. I especially liked his line when he said to her ""please, you push the limits of my body to more than it can bear."" The other added scenes did not take anything away from the movie, but gave it dimension. I will take 1 star away only because I do not think that scene where the brother slept with the ""prostitute"" who turned out to be his other brothers wife or whatever was necessary. Besides one or two minor things, overall I thought it was a great film, and the reunion at the end was well acted.

To the critics harping on sexually explicit, blah blah, gimme a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes in the film. Everything was very ""PG-13"" if not lower. If you call that sexually explicit then you should be censoring Songs of Solomon in the Bible which gives some steamy accounts from Solomon to his ""lover,"" or better yet, you should censor Jesus Christs crucifixion, which was very R-rated (being beaten, flogged, and nailed to a cross seems R-rated to me). Christianity focuses on the heart before appearances so lets all appreciate this great adaptation of Joseph's life. Great film!",4.0
"This was an excellent video.  It was a bit too steamy in the scenes with Potiphar's wife trying to seduce Joseph (too much for kids). However that did not negate it scriptural accuracy of the story line.

The sets were a bit sparse feeling, however it did not take away from the fact that this was a well-directed and produced movie.

Enjoy!",4.0
"This was one of the best movie from a Old Testament Biblical story.  The only problem with this is the nude scene when ""Joseph"" was nude in the water.  I think  this could have been left out and the story would had been perfect.",4.0

"I truly enjoyed this film.  I think it was superbly done, however, I did not agree with the scene between Joseph and Potipher's wife. I think it was a bit too sexy and it was not necessary.  This scene does not make it suitable for younger audiences and I think that is a shame because it is such a great movie.  However, that was the only scene where I saw Hollywood getting carried away.",4.0
"This four hour video looks a the familiar ""Joseph"" story from the Bible but with a few wonderful twists.  First, it just jumps into the Egyptian setting.  Second most of the actors do a great job on their roles -- I want to say ""brava"" to Leslie Ann Warren for making Potiphar's wife engaging and even more scary than the original tale suggests.  Finally, the customs and backgrounds are the best yet that I've seen in a film version of the tale.  However, my ""four star"" rating refers to the ""flashback"" section of the film.  Yes, why it happens makes sense internally but did they need to spend so much time on it?  It very sad that Paul Mercurio's careers seems to have turned off onto the ""B"" grade track -- I think he is excellent in this movie and also in Exit to Eden.",4.0
"Of all the TNT movies, this one is actually the weakest. But it is still a good movie. The movie covers the period before Esau sold his birthright and blessing to Jacob through his time with Laban and finally his confrontation with Laban and later Esau.
The disappointment with this movie was its over-focus on him and Rachel. The lessons God was teaching him were kind of talked about, but not focused on. The non-Scriptural parts, though, were pretty consistent with early Near Eastern customs and not contrary to Scriptural understanding. In that way, it was very good.
If you choose to watch this movie, you won't find yourself wishing you hadn't. It is a good movie and well produced. Just be sure you don't base much theology on it. ;-)
The movie is a solid PG movie.",4.0

"I needed something Christian to keep my 1 year old daughter occupied while I worked, and this DVD has worked like a charm. She sits through the whole thing. She loves it when we sing the songs back to her when on a long drive or even when she's just generally cranky. Basically, the DVD has served the purpose for which it was chosen. We are very happy with the purchase. We recently bought another collection in the Cedarmont series that has 100 songs in it. Waiting to try it out.",4.0
"Our 20-month-old and 4.5-year-old love this video that contains many of the favorite Bible songs I remember from my childhood.  The music and singing is good quality, and the scenes behind the music are interesting -- children playing, acting out some of the words, like rock climbing during ""Climb up Sunshine Mountain"" -- even a farm full of animals during the Noah song.

Unfortunately, only a few of the songs feature all of the actions (hand motions and body movement) that make these songs favorites for children.  It's such a shame, because the primary reason I bought this DVD was to encourage full-body participation and movement instead of passive viewing.

Still, the production is good-quality (not overproduced and grating like the DVD of the same name by Golden Books).  When our kids leave it on and walk away, it actually makes decent background music, as children's music goes.

To be sure, this is the best children's music DVD we own (yes, even more popular with our kids than the Wiggles) -- that is, until we find a DVD of action Bible songs that actually features the actions.",4.0
"This film is taken right from the book of Luke which many believe to be the book of the Bible that gives the most complete and accurate picture of Jesus' life.  If you watch the movie with a Bible open to Luke you'll be able to follow right along.  Brian Deacon plays the most believable Jesus (other than Robert Powell in the 1977 mini-series ""Jesus of Nazareth) in any film, especially those done recently.  The only drawback to this film is that it is quite wordy and at times moves slowly.  The crucifiction scenes, however, are very, very powerful.  ""Jesus"" has been shown worldwide to over 1 billion people and it has been translated into over 400 different languages.  Until recently, this film has not been widely available and I'm thrilled that Amazon.com has made it more readily available.  I highly recommend ""Jesus"" to anyone who wants an accurate visual telling of the story of Jesus' life without the use of ""dramatic license"" as has been the trend recently.",4.0
"This film is a classic true story about the Son of God taken entirely from the Gospel of Luke. I also recommend a video called the Gospel of John, get the 3 hour version it is totally worth it! The Gospel of John is a 5 star film.",4.0

excellent movie that has changed millions of lives all over the world.  I highly recommend this movie if you want to know Jesus.,4.0
"The Visual Bible Matthew word for word was excellent as compared, but this complete message is great too.  This film invites a decision concerning Christ.",4.0
"Didn't know Brian  Deacon. Now I am a fan. My siblings and I grew up agreeing with Jesus of Nazareth as our favorite Jesus movie, esp because Robert Powell was the closest to how we think Jesus could've been like. His scrawny body would be how Jesus might've looked like from the physical mental spiritual exercises he had to go through. Robert Powell's soulful eyes and his acting was good. This movie on the other hand came off as a retro-ish 70's 80's kinda because of the hairstyle and the sound, and the accent was distinctly something else, but this surprisingly turned out to be REALLY good. The Jesus here is more spontaneous in his actions. He laughs. When he speaks, he teaches, it's like effortless. Yet the words are powerful. You could imagine Jesus. There are so many scenes and scripts in this movie that impressed on me. I have heard them before but hearing it the way the apostle had written (forgot which apostle, and I had lent this dvd to a new friend and hadn't gotten in back in a while so I had forgotten. AT the beginning of this movie it will tell you which apostle and now I too am a fan of his, too bad I had forgotten which one he was. :-)  made the story and the words have power again. Those who haven't seen this movie, I recommend it and you would know what I cannot describe. There is even a version for children which I didn't buy so I can't write my opinion about it. I love the scene with the children, and the one wherein the pharisees tried to trick him. And that before entering Jerusalem, many more. You have seen and heard them before but it's just different, powerful in its simple delivery. The scene where he was teaching in the forest and one follower asked something; oh, and that of the woman who had put coins for tithes, moving, many others in this movie. I have so many favorite scenes and verses from this film.

Oh, and btw, this can be played in different languages. That new friend i had mentioned is  married to a Japanese who is not Christian and the couple was able to watch this together and the friend said he liked it and his wife did, too.

Seller pay me for my endorsement! :-))",4.0

"Jesus is a 1979 film starring Brian Deacon in the role of Jesus. This version is based on the Gospel according to Luke. It is very accurate and if one reads the gospel along whilst watching the film one will see that they have done a great job. As with any film there are however problems. For instance, the music sounds on the cheap and sometimes the editing feels less then professionally done. Brian Deacon is very good in the role as Jesus and he plays the role with conviction. The ending is not that great and they could have left it out. Even so it was a quite good film. Recommended. 4/5.",4.0
It is very difficult to accurately reflect the vastness and moreover the authority of Jesus Christ in a single movie. But it is a start and could surely be used as the beginning of a much more intense study of the son of God and how he wants to relate to us and how he wants us to care for each other.,4.0
"Before I begin my review, I must state something: Having Been translated into over 700 languages, this film has been seen by more than 4 Billion people since its release in 1979 (over 60 Million who saw it have dedicated their lives to the blessed Savior).
THE REVIEW
This is a really good film. It has the power to truly change lives. Brian Deacon shines as Jesus. The things that detract from the film are mediocre acting by most of the supporting cast and some choppy editing. Other than this, a truly mesmerizing movie experience. But the best film version of the Gospels is the 2000 Miniseries version starring Jeremy Sisto (I also here that Mel Gibson's film ""The Passion"" is really good, but I won't decide until I see it this Easter).
Note: This is the 120 Minute Version. I own (and prefer) the 83 Minute Version of the film. Grade: B+",4.0
"This Jesus film is true to the Gospel of Luke.  That is good and bad.  It sticks very close to the Gospel of Luke and avoids the Hollywood straying which most Jesus films undertake.  However, because it is so closely tied to Luke, there is no crown of thorns on the head of Jesus (which is not mentioned in Luke).  Because I am a stickler for accuracy, I think this is the best Jesus film available, even without the crown of thorns.",4.0
"The stories of Jesus' conception and birth are recorded in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. This movie is based on Luke's account. The story begins with a prologue to summarize Jesus' life as a child and to bring the story into focus. John Heyman researched this film for five years and then filmed it in over 200 locations in the Holy Land.

Over one billion people have viewed this work and it has been translated into more than 425 languages and shown in more than 225 countries. The Epic story of the most controversial life in human history could barely be covered in one movie, so this is more of an overview of Jesus' life.

In 83 minutes, this story will make you want to know more about a man who walked the earth, knowing he would die to give man the ultimate gift - Eternal Life. Throughout the movie, Jesus speaks in parables to teach his followers truth. He calls his disciples and empowers them to convey God's messages to a wider audience.

Jesus' Miracles in this movie included the Feeding of the 5,000, Calming the Storm, Raising Jairus' Daughter, and giving site to the blind. The Last Supper is portrayed and then the Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus starts to make this movie more dramatic. This movie very briefly touches on all the trials and then draws you into the emotional aspects of Jesus' Crucifixion. When he triumphs over death and is raised from the dead he appears in bodily form to show that he is indeed alive.

The story ends with Jesus ascending into the clouds [....]

I recommend this movie to all who want to know how to leave this world alive. This movie left me with a feeling of love for Jesus Christ, who gave his life for us so we can spend an eternity in heaven with our Creator, God.

"I caught this on CBS back to back with the original Rankin Bass version. The original served to remind me why I loved it so much as a kid, and I better appreciated some of the story's depth than I could as a child. Leading into ""Frosty's Return,"" My stomach knotted with dread... not another vile sequel; or worse yet, a bargain-bin knockoff... But I was pleasantly surprised by a weird and surreal spin on the Frosty mythos. From the moment a tiny Jonathan Winters appears in the snow, I had to see what was going to happen next. This version plays on the innocent wittiness of ""old school"" classic specials, but has some nice weird touches, like tiny Jonathan Winters floating on a marshmallow in a cup of hot cocoa. There are some cute ""tip-o'-the-hat"" in-jokes on other animated specials, too, with some clever (not disrespectful) riffs on the Peanuts cartoons, among others. There are some delicious non-sequitors that had me laughing out loud, but it never takes on that awful, dated ""hipness"" that contemporary animated fare falls into (like Disney's ""Hercules"" ... blecch!)

Being a Heathen, I loved that this ""Frosty"" did not beat me over the head with yet another gloss of the Nativity tale. (Nor did the Rankin Bass original, for that matter.) There was a nice environmental message that wasn't overplayed, and even a reference to the ancient, pagan concept of Yule being a step in nature's cycle, with the promise of life's renewal.

Overall, weird and fun!",4.0
"As long as you know BEFORE you buy it that ""Frosty Returns"" is not the sequel to ""Frosty the Snowman"", you can see it without complaint. It is a different story, and has nothing to do with the original Frosty TV Special. First of all it is made by a different studio, with different animators, directors, and voices. The director is Bill Melendez, who directed all of the Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and Peanuts specials, so it looks like a Peanuts cartoon. Made in 1992. The voice acting features Jonathon Winters, and it has John Goodman as Frosty. The songs are original and pretty fun. The plot is centered on the folks in town that want clean streets in winter by getting all the snow removed. The kids and Frosty are in a panic and fight back or else they will lose all their snow fun - and snow men. If you approach this show knowing it is not the sequel and is from the team that made the Peanuts shows, you will be OK.

IF YOU ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE REAL SEQUEL: The studio that made the first hour long Frosty special that first aired on CBS television in 1969 is Rankin/Bass Productions, the kings of holiday specials. That show was based on the original song written in 1951 by Steve nelson and Jack Rollins. The studio made a terrific half hour sequel in 1976 for ABC television titled ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"".  That special starts right where the first one left off.  The basic premise of the story is that Frosty gets a wife named Crystal (played by Shelley Winters), and is sabotaged by the jealous Jack Frost. The character design was by Paul Coker Jr., who did the same work for the first special, so the visual continuity works very well and the characters have that classic Rankin/Bass 'look'. He also did the unique lettering for the credits in both specials. The famous voice actor Paul Frees stars as Jack Frost, and the policeman. Frees was a regular in studio productions and had also voiced the policeman, ticket seller, and Santa Claus in the original. Jackie Vernon voiced Frosty just like he did before. The writer for both Rankin/Bass shows was Romeo Muller, and Maury Laws returned as the musical director. Interestingly, while Rankin/Bassis known for the high quality of their original songs, they used Christmas standards in their sequel.  The major change in the sequel from the original is a big one, the narrator, and it can be unsettling if you watch them back to back.  While the first show was narrated and sung by Jimmy Durante, the second time we had the voice talents of Andy Griffith. Nothing against Andy, but it is a big change.

AND ANOTHER SEQUEL: Another sequel of sorts was made by Rankin/Bass with the same production team, it is a theatrical feature length movie released in 1979 titled ""Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July"".",4.0

"I was recently sent a set of Christmas specials in exchange for review, most of which I had never seen before.  One of them was the stop motion classic Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town.  Nope, I'd never even heard of it before, but I found it pretty fun.

As the special opens, we run into a mail man (voiced by Fred Astaire) who is delivering letters to Santa.  He decides to tell us all about Santa.

It starts many years ago when a baby was left in the care of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (Paul Frees).  Being the mean guy that he is, Burgermeister throws the baby out.  But he winds up in the care of a family of elves named Kringle who happen to be toy makers.

The baby grows into a man named Kris (Mickey Rooney) who decides to deliver the toys that his family makes to share the joy with kids everywhere.  But when he returns to his home village, he finds that the Burgermeister Meisterburger has outlawed all toys.  As a result of defying the ban, Kris becomes a wanted fugitive.  Can he find a way to bring joy to the kids of the village?  And what about the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn) who lives between the Kringles and the village?

To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this special, and I'm not quite sure why.  Maybe my low expectations were why this one surprised me so much.  I actually got quite caught up in the story even though I had most of it figured out early.  The characters were so great, too, from Kris to his adopted family and his love interest Jessica (Robie Lester) on the good side to the villain you love to hate, Burgermeister Meisterburger.

I'm not a big fan of stop motion animation.  It looks too jerky to me most of the time.  That was certainly the case here, but I actually found it charming.  Maybe I'm softening in my old age.

One drawback to this short is the music.  Outside of the title song (which Fred Astaire sings so well), all the songs were unfamiliar to me.  Frankly, they didn't add much.  In fact, I found myself wanting to fast forward through them to get back to the story.

Not helping at all was how dated the musical segments were.  This special was released in 1970, and it shows.  I got a definite flower power vibe off the animation during the songs.  There were a couple of other times I felt a bit of that crept into the story.  You might also describe it as psychedelic.  My roommate found this aspect even more annoying than I did; I was mostly able to ignore it and get lost in the story again when it was over.

Kids, the target audience, won't notice how dated this is.  In fact, they'll find the 50 minutes over all too quickly.  Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town, and he's doing it with plenty of charm to entertain for years to come.",4.0

"I love how all of these Rankin/Bass classics from the 60s and 70s get classic old Hollywood and Broadway stars to provide voice talents; lends a certain seriousness to the occasion.  Here we have Fred Astaire narrating and singing a couple of songs in this 1970 stop-motion retelling of the origins of Santa Claus.  Fred's a mailman delivering letters from kids to Santa, and he stops to answer some questions in the charming opening credits sequence which quotes most of the musical themes from the 50 minute TV special, first broadcast when I was 5.  Santa was an orphan left on the doorstep of the mean Burgermeister Meisterburger (I still love that name) in Sombretown (ok that's a little corny) with merely the word ""Claus"" on a chain around his neck.  The Burgermeister is a mean old dude and doesn't want him, and through mysterious, fortuitous circumstances he ends up with the Kringle elves in the Mountains of the Whispering Winds.  He grows up learning to make toys, befriends all the animals of the forest, and goes back to Sombretown to give toys to the kids - but is met by the Burgermeister's opposition.  Along the way the reasons for the red suit, the flying reindeer, the belly laugh, etc, are all explained, with the voices of kids breaking into Astaire's narration at times to ask him to verify that this was, in fact, how it happened.  Kinda cool even for this adult.

This was along with RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER my favorite holiday special as a kid, though it has faded for me somewhat over the years; I guess I remember the romance between Santa and schoolteacher Jessica (Mrs Claus eventually, of course) as more mawkish and sappy than it was, and I'd forgotten that the fairly dreadful ""My World is Beginning Today"" is full of cool 60s hippie/flower people imagery.  The early parts of the story are really fairly dark and bleak, and it's interesting that, though the Burgermeister has a moment where he harks back to childhood, he never reforms and we leave him still villainous, like Potter in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  The story - original to this film I think - seems a bit influenced by L. Frank Baum's ""The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus"" in the pagan/natural nature of Santa as we see him early on; but at the end a specifically Christian element enters the picture.  Apart from the love song I already mentioned, the rest of the music is pretty good, with ""Put One Foot In Front of the Other"" probably the most memorable; it still gives me a lump in my throat.

In addition to Astaire, the voice talents include Keenan Wynn as Winter, the magician who rules the mountains and tries to stop Claus but is quickly befriended by him; professional voice actor Paul Frees as the Burgermeister and others; and Mickey Rooney as Kringle/Santa Claus, a role he would repeat in THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS.  All are very solid, especially Wynn, an underrated actor and a great vocal talent.  Overall this was definitely more fun than I remembered it from my last viewing, probably a decade ago - though RUDOLPH I suspect will always rule my inner child's heart.",4.0
"This is a vintage children's classic, even the adults can still enjoy.  Very creative and well put-together.",4.0
"This is an enjoyable telling of how Santa Claus became who he is today. Keep in mind that this story is completely fabricated by the minds of Rankin/Bass, not the real history of how the myth of Santa Claus evolved. With that in mind, it is quite inventive.

Where did he get his red suit?
Why does he go down the Chimney?
What about his reindeer and his ""Ho Ho Ho""?

These questions and others are all answered as a young boy grows to manhood while a despotic mayor forbids toys of every kind in his town.

It's not quite the same storytelling level as Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, but it is done well enough.",4.0
I love this movie - it takes me back to my childhood watching it.  DVD is great!,4.0
"I watched this with my son's and now they have sons.  I especially appreciated that there were CHRIST-mas references in this video, such as the wedding with the cross on the holiest night of the year and reference  to the Lord.  It still could be fun, moving and include the real meaning of  Christmas.",4.0
very good,4.0
Great interesting teaching but it's to get past the camera work.  I used it in midweek services and got complaints every single week.,4.0
"First of all, there is the historical background (filmed from the Holy Land) informing the viewer of why Jesus would use a particular Parable and what it would have meant to His audience.  Then, each session has a different, respectable authority describing what the meaning of  Jesus' parable could have.
For our small group who has a myriad of Bible Studies between us, this has proven informative and interesting.  While a bit awkward at first with all the stops and starts, once everyone became used to the format, all went smoothly.
A good recommendation from us for anyone who either is just beginning to study the Word or anyone who is well versed in it.",4.0
"Used this DVD as a supplement to class I led using William Barclay's excellent book ""The Parables of Jesus"".  Class thought the presentations were interesting and added to our understanding of the parables.",4.0
The book and DVD program will take you to a whole new level of understanding of Jesus' word and how it does apply to today.,4.0
"I just concluded my church small group using this video/book and both my class members and myself thought this was very well done.  I advised my group of the quirkiness based on other Amazon reviews, but that didn't dampen my group's response to the videos.  Each of us thought they were well done and very infomrative.  We all agreed some were better presented than others, videos number 2 and 6 stand out as being quite exceptional, but overall every one of the segments had merit.

The viewer must get used to the format.  Each videos starts out with the host appearing soewhere in the holy land.  Then they transition to a biblical scholar based somewhere in the US.  The host only appears for a couple of minutes at the start of each lesson then plasy no further role.  Once we break away from the host, theme music runs again as if we're beginning something new.  After the second set of theme music the video will cite the Biblical reference then transition to the presenter.  While this all seems a bit odd, it really doesn't detract from the overall presentation.

I recommend this for any Bible study class.  My church offered this as an adult education opportunity but now I've learned it is considering other uses.  I do believe this has many options for general church education.  Once my class ended, people were left wanting more.  Since there are many more parables to consider, perhaps a volume two will be forthcoming.",4.0
Can't go there?  then this is next best,4.0
Good for men and women,4.0
We have bible study study class and we are on the 5th woman from this teaching. Our group is blessed by the study and the discussions we have after the video. Some revelations from some of the woman happen to be quite amazing and scary. But the study is encouraging the bible study group to share which is a blessing.,4.0
I chose this rating because I liked the subject matter for our small group Bible study.  We desired something that would take Biblical ideals and use them in today's life.,4.0

"I think we originally saw this on the TV one Christmas years ago. Our cable provider listed out Holiday shows in the Kids Section during the Season and I found it one year so I got the family together and we watched it. I ended up purchasing it on DVD since it wasn't on the following Christmas and I didn't have Prime at that time. Anyway, on to the review ...

The show has a couple musical numbers in it which is not a normal feature of the kid's series. They're cute and provide a nice touch. The usual cast of characters are there and we learn a little more about each of them and what they do during their own Holiday celebrations. Every Holiday is covered which has become the norm for many Christmas shows; making sure no one feels left out. As such, you'll learn a little bit about each of those Holidays throughout the vignette of the storyline. Sadly, they keep Christmas focused on the commercial end of it and do not touch upon the sacred core about Christ's birth. But, that isn't distracting or forced, it just is. Arthur's dad does insert a nod to Biblical times when he decides to ditch the usual turkey and taters for first century foods. Neither are the other Holiday celebrations forced into the storyline. They flow naturally and overall the whole show highlights themes such sacrifice, friendship, love, togetherness, etc.

Marc Brown's characters are true-to-life in that he does a fine job having them mirror how kids act in the real world. As such, their reactions provide lots of opportunities to talk to your kids about what is happening during the show. At least, that's how we watch shows. : )

Final analysis, enjoyable Holiday fare; fun for the whole family.",4.0
"My little one has always enjoyed watching Arthur. So when he came across Arthur's Perfect Christmas, he had to watch it. I really enjoy, that I am able to watch my Amazon Prime shows on my iPad.",4.0
"Since discovering Arthur on my iPad, my 5 year old granddaughter has asked to watch it at least once a day. Too much screen time for her, but I know she would give you a big thumbs up! I hope you can continue to offer more educational, fun PBS programs for intelligent children. Thanks, I guess, for Arthur!",4.0
Arthur is always on the top of my child's list. Never naughty and always nice.this one bring joy to us all and to all a good night,4.0
"Bought this for my daughter and she really likes it, she saw it prior to purchase so new it would be a hit",4.0
LOVE this movie!  All time family favorite since the kids were small...we watch it every year.  glad to find it on dvd.,4.0
"I choose this rating because it's ""Authur"" a very wholesome cartoon for this generation of children.  The only reason as to why it did not receive 5 stars was because the voices are different...I'm not one for changing character voices although I realize Authur can't stay eight years old forever.  I just like the focus being in the everyday life of a little boy who's dealing with growing pains lol.  I would recommend it however don't depend on the episode to put you in the Christmas spirit alone... :)",4.0
"Love Athur, and love this movie.  I am so glad I added it to my collection of Holiday favorites.",4.0
"I'm a fourteen year old guy and I still love this show as does my older brother who is nineteen. The jokes in the tv episodes go way over some kids heads and even over some adult's and when you catch them you wanna pee your pants. In this movie its less of the adult jokes, more random funny stuff. You have to love the way that in this movie (and alot of the episodes) they have a great way of ripping on toys/movies/books...Its awesome. With how cheap you can get this I would have to say...Watch the show first then go for it.",4.0
Good exercises for pelvic flood,4.0
"Works well, just wish I stuck with it more",4.0
"The animations were helpful for understanding the musculature involved in the exercises, which made a big difference in how I was doing them and my success in strengthening my pelvic floor. I used this video regularly for a couple months. During the same time, I used pelvic weights. I think both were helpful and I met my goals. This video would benefit from an update. Also, the short version cut some transition time between exercises and was hard to keep up with, but the long version wasn't needed after the first couple times through.",4.0
I would have given it 5 stars if the quality of the actual video had been better.  I am hopeful that this video will help strengthen my pelvic wall and help my uterine prolapse. I will write more as I continue to us it as to whether it helps or not.,4.0
So far so good!,4.0
This helped me understand the benefits,4.0

"Not the most well-filmed workout video, but it's clear and it works! Which is really all that's important after giving birth to 2 babies.",4.0
"I have a question-would this be helpful for a child with a bed wetting problem?  Sorry for asking a question in the review section, but there isn't a place for questions.  I did purchase this to help with prolapse.  While I just started using it, I can't say about results yet, but it is easy to use and very well guided and set up.  It has 4 separate workouts, you build up to each level.  I think it is helping so far.",4.0
"Simple but great video. Was very helpful to me in dealing with a prolapse issue. I like the feature whereas you can play a version of the exercises with complete instructions or you can choose to play a streamlined version without the longer explanations when you have become familiar with the routines. I do agree that this video should be  promoted by OB-GYNs - being told to ""go home and do Kegels"" just doesn't cut it.",4.0
"I am very happy to have found instruction that is both very informative, helpful and concise. I hope these exercises will help me regain my what is lost at the moment. I wish I had come across this much earlier.....like before surgery which did not help at all.",4.0
Liked the program.,4.0
"Not used by me...but, I hear its a great tool.",4.0
very important exercises are presented here. not just kegel but other such as squats. i think in general these are great to do on a regular basis.,4.0
"The exercises are pretty basic and easy for anyone who is already active. However, I just skipped to level 4 exercises.  The concept of strengthening all the muscles around your pelvis and hips is great.  The way she describes your pelvic floor as a basket is also great.  It really helps target the correct muscles.  I noticed after just a week or two of doing the exercises a difference.  I would recommend this to any woman.",4.0
This dvd is really great. The explanation of the exercises is clear and precise and easy to follow. Although I have only used it for 2 weeks I definitely can feel some improvements!,4.0
This dvd does a good job of explaining how to do exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor and it has more exercises than I have found in most other programs.,4.0
If you leak urine it might help you - I did not have that problem though and I returned it.,4.0
"I have been doing the excerises for about 3 wks. Easy to understand. The workout instructor is a licensed physical therapist. Which is why I chose the video. My insurance company didn't cover any pelvic floor therapy so this was my next best option. She gives clear instructions and encouraging words to help motivate. Once you have mastered the workouts, there is a time saver option. I would recommend this dvd.",4.0
I am yet to really get into it but I tried the first step in the process and it did seem to help almost immediately.,4.0
"Just about 4 weeks into the exercises and feeling good about them. PT today said I am doing them correctly, nice to have a PT say that. Tasha does a great job of explaining and talking us through the exercises.",4.0
"I have received the product. It appears to be as described. Now, I just have to commit to using it as directed, but I do anticpate good results.",4.0
I don't have any medical issues.  I just was looking for something to help strengthen me.  I think this is a very informative video to help strengthen the PC muscles.  I hadn't realized there was more to remaining in tact then just kegels.  The instructions are clear with good pictures and explanations.  I do additional squats with the video after learning how important squats are for the PC muscles as well.,4.0
"I bought this after I had my baby and had a cystocele (bladder prolapse). Tara thoroughly describes the exercises and why they help, and she's very easy to understand and listen to. However, it's not just kegels. It's also abdominal, back, and upper leg workouts, which all help more than just kegels alone. However, the workouts take a long time (the shortest one is 8 minutes, and that's AFTER you've mastered the moves first) and I just do not have time to do these with a toddler running around and my busy schedule. If I had plenty of free time or was a stay-at-home-mom, I would do these every day because I know they'd help and it has great reviews. But unfortunately I don't have the time.",4.0
"The program on the DVD itself is excellent.  Both DVDs that I received from Amazon have been scratched, but the second one plays okay.  Hopefully it keeps playing in the future.",4.0
"I have noticed a difference after just a few rounds, but the routines take about 20 minutes each, plus the time to set up the dvd, and I have a hard time doing them regularly. This is of course my fault, not the program's, which is an excellent program, easy to do and easy to follow. But if you have a busy schedule, you might prefer a kegel excersizer, which does't require a DVD and set amount of time.",4.0
"At first I was a little skeptical that the DVD combined english with mandarin because I thought that a total immersion DVD is the best way to go.  I was persuaded to buy this set after reading the reviews and giving it a shot.  To my pleasant surprise, after a few minutes of watching it with my daughter (who was riveted), I could see how helpful it was to provide a background of english for those who are being thrown into mandarin with no prior exposure to it.  It puts it into context and understanding.  The repetition and practicing of the phrases allow her to get a number of concepts / words under her belt without being overwhelmed or losing interest because she cannot understand anything going on.  After watching the story of Guang, there's a Making Dumplings with real kids, followed by a section of songs and more practicing.

What is particularly helpful is the audio CD.  We have that in the car and she loves to listen to the story and sing the songs.  This reinforces what she's learned through purely audible means and I think it's very effective.  I especially like that the songs are set to tunes that she is already familiar with.  She loves the songs and can sing all the words to them!!

I know that it might be a little pricey but like the other reviewers said, it also comes with a book, audio CD, flash cards and reference book for parents.  The reinforcement of the words through various mediums is effective.  It helps that I incorporate words into our day by saying ""ni hao"" ""wo jiao ___"" and ""xie xie"" (I just learned these for the first time through Guang!). The entire package is worth the $49.95.  I understand that Volume Two is coming out and we are going to buy that as well.",4.0
"As an Adventist, I enjoyed viewing this DVD.  It was fair and informative.  Seventh Day Adventists are portrayed as the thinking individuals that we are. While most of the information will be familiar to us, there were things that I learned from watching this film.

Time is given to our history and faith.  Attention is called to our health message and personal lifestyle.  However the lion's share of the film was devoted to our health institutions and professionals.  If I had one wish, it would have been to see more of the personal aspect of being an Adventist.

I recommend this DVD to Adventists and anyone who wants to know more about us and our vision.",4.0
"Though I have a few friends of the Adventist faith I was unaware of the specifics of this religion.  This film uncovers the origin and modern practices of the Adventists.  I was interested most in the emphasis this religion puts on both the spiritual and physical bodies in regards to total wellness.  I would recommend this film to friends and family of all faiths looking to learn more about this religion and its impact on living longer, healthier lives.",4.0
"A dynamic and thought-provoking representation of the Adventists. A surprise cinematic gem. Not to be missed, especially if you enjoyed the first one.",4.0
"Ok, so I never saw ""Shakespeare in Love"".  After watching this 10 minute Star Wars/Shakespeare spoof, I'm not sure I want to.  I'm sure it's a fine movie, but what ""George Lucas in Love"" accomplished in only 10 minutes surely can't be improved over the course of a 2-hour movie (perhaps I'm also still bitter that it beat ""Saving Private Ryan"" for best picture of 1998.. grrrrr).  That little rant aside, Star Wars is probably the most frequently spoofed movie or cultural phenomenon of all time (with Star Trek running a close second).  This current incarnation takes its inspiration from ""Shakespeare in Love"" and finds a college-age George Lucas struggling to find his inspiration to write an 'agricultural space opera' for his final project.  As he walks across campus to meet with his advisor, you see many quirky schoolmates who seem to have inspired different characters and plots in Star Wars, from Han Solo to Jabba the Hutt.  Even his advisor engages in the backward speak that defines Yoda.  George finds his inspiration in the form of an attractive co-ed who's hairstyle seems vaguely familiar.  There is even a little twist that romance that I dare not mention.  This is a hilarious send up of two very successful movies and definitely worth the 9 minutes you will spend watching it.",4.0
"This was extremely entertaining for me as I am a huge Star Wars fan, but beware it is only 9 minutes in length.  As long as you go in with that expectation, I'm sure you will find this to be an enjoyable short film.  You also get 3 other shorts on the disc, but they are all less than 10 minutes in length.  Evil Hill was far less entertaining than I had hoped.",4.0
"This was an excellent film.  Gosh, if only it could have been longer!  The commentary and the making-of pieces are equally as entertaining.
The other shorts on the DVD version leave a little to be desired.  But Lucas is great!",4.0
"Just received my DVD of ""Lucas"" and the other films and thought that Lucas looked much better on the DVD than on the internet.  I especially liked ""Swingblade"" but how come no comments from those guys?  Also, Film Club was good but I didn't get all the references.  All in all a great group of films!",4.0
"I saw this film in English class a couple days ago because my eccentric and wonderful sophmore english teacher had Dowling, a creator of the film, a couple years ago.  His sister is currently at Wellesley High School.  This film is very creative, and quite humorous to even non Star Wars fans.  I was surprised to find it here...it is reasonably steep for a 9 minute spoof.  However, for star wars buffs, or people who want to share it with friends, this is a worthwhile purchase.",4.0
"This is a very enjoyable 9-minute movie, and you don't have to be a diehard Star Wars fanatic to enjoy it.  You just have to have seen the 3 initial movies.  The price is a bit high ($12 including shipping), but  worth it if you'll split the price with some friends.  After all,  Blockbuster doesn't have it.
BUT, don't look at the box or talk with  people about it before watching it.  Remember, it's only 9-minutes long.  There are lots of scenes on the box that you'll find quite funny in the  movie if you're NOT already anticipating them.  Don't lose the fun of half  the movie by seeing half the jokes beforehand.",4.0
"Saw this orginally online and it spread like wildfire aroundthe office. Hysterical, with brilliant references and parodies. If itwas any more expensive I'd say pass but [at this price] you can't even buy a paperback. You get a few hours of fun as you play for every uninitiated person who visits your house.",4.0

"Caught this on PBS earlier this year and thought that this would be a perfect christmas gift for my mother who hasn't been back to Korea since we left a couple months after I was born. My mom did make fun of Marja from time to time when they went back to her kitchen in new york and tried to make the dishes, but she really did like it when they were in Korea and touring around the food markets and what not. For me, it was nice to see the bevy of different dishes she used to make for us when I was child (the seaweed soup was my favorite along with kimchi of course). She really enjoyed it b/c she lives with my dad nowadays in a place where there aren't any korean people and it was something that allowed her to see homeland which she really liked.",4.0
"Hi...My mother first got this when i was about 14. I was touched on how good this was done by the actors. I am now 20 years old and i am living on my own, and this is a MUST HAVE. Too bad it's sold out on here becuase i would have bought this on here. Bruce has touched my life in many ways, and so has this film.

"A group of ladies from church are having this Women's Bible study in our home. The facilitators purchased the study guide, and DVD set, and book for each of them. The rest of the ladies just are either using the book or ebook version for the study.  This is a group of 8-11 women who are using it as a summer study and reading a few chapters each week, watching the video, and then discussion from the study guide has helped the group to grow closer to God and each other.
  The DVD has been pretty good, but the audio quality is sometimes lacking.  I would recommend this for those who want to say Yes to God.",4.0
"I liked this video.  However, if ones intentions for buying it were to see/hear uncensored aspects of show (nudity/swearing)- you will be really disappointed.  It is very censored.  But if you are interested in seeing  some hysterically amusing previously unseen on tv parts of the show (What  was it really like?  What did they think of this?  What was really going  on with those two?  etc) - I think the video will be worth the price.  Basically, after watching the tape, I felt like I understood more about  what was going on and I was rolling on the floor laughing at the same time.",4.0
"My son is 23 months old and LOVES Oscar the Grouch.  I searched through the Sesame Street videos to find one in which Oscar was the primary character (my son also really likes Telly monster)- and this one features  both.  The ""movies"" that are reviewed by Oscar and Telly are not  some of 'Sesame Street's' greatest, but on the whole, it's a cute video,  and good for some laughs from the little people.",4.0
"I never saw this special during my childhood, which in retrospect was really too bad. Now that I have a four year old son, I love finding ""pre-Elmo"" Sesame Street productions for him to watch. This is a fun special - In a nutshell, thanks to Big Bird, the Sesame Street folks find themselves locked overnight in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At this point, various characters start having their own adventures: Oscar becomes enamored with the museum's collection of ancient Greek statues, believing them to be beautiful ""trash"" because they are missing limbs, noses, heads, etc.; Bob is forced to thwart Cookie Monster's desire to eat a painting by Paul Cezanne and other works of art; Super Grover tries to make friends with a suit of armor, thinking that it's a real person; and Big Bird along with Mr. Snuffleupagus help a 4006 and one-half year old, cursed Egyptian boy (who presumably lives by day as a mummy in the museum) solve an ancient riddle so that he can transform into a star and live with his parents in the night sky.
Admittedly, the Egyptian portion of the special is a bit odd; they continually make reference to the ""demon"" (played by actor James Mason) that arrives at stroke of midnight to pose the riddle's question to the Egyptian boy, as well as Osiris (the god of the underworld) who poses the final challenge to the boy's ascension. I thought this segment was great, but I never thought I would hear the word ""demon"" uttered by Big Bird - Maybe they should start having him call Elmo a ""little red demon!"" (Just Kidding).
As with nearly everyone else who reviewed this special, I really wish that it was available on DVD. However, if I must purchase a used VHS copy, I will do so.",4.0
"I looked up a description of this set at Barnes and Noble.com, and as it turns out this set is just a compliation of three other sets: Elmopalooza, Do the Alphabet, and The Best of Elmo (telling me that apparently the best of Sesame Street is very Elmo-centric).  Personally I was trying to find some of those classic comedy routines I remember from when I was a kid, like Ernie calling to the fish (Here fishy fishy fishy). But I'm giving it four stars since I'm sure the material on here is perfectly good, even if I'm not personally interested.",4.0
"I wish CTV would consider reissuing ""Sesame Street"" as a chronological series, starting with ""Season One,"" and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast, not with a few select bits chopped up into the new, modern mix.  The old shows were so wonderful... and that awful, whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen!",4.0
"Parents,
I have not watched this tape that much but on Sesame Street Grover wants to be someone else. So all Grovers friends on Sesame Street cheer him up and show him how good he is. This is a great video for you and friends to watch.",4.0
"The best way to help your child learn the alphabet or numbers is to work with them one on one with books and letter shapes.  However, these videos are a fun way to reinforce what you're teaching them.
My two-year-old son will easily watch one of these videos all the way through, dancing and ""singing"" along.  He can almost make it through both of them back to back, which is quite high praise for a video from a toddler!
I must admit that Baby Bear has never been one of my favorite Sesame Street characters.  He *seems* older than a little baby, and his ""mispwonunciations"" a la Elmer Fudd grate on my ears.  But he is the character who is being taught the alphabet in ""A,B,C"", not the one doing the teaching, so he doesn't bother me as much.  He goes to Big Bird for help learning the alphabet.  Big Bird is the teacher who uses various cartoon clips and live action bits to illustrate the entire alphabet and most of the letters individually.  Please note I say ""most""--Baby Bear already knows A, B, and C, for instance, so although they are mentioned in passing they are not featured.  Also, a lot of verbs are used for illustration (J is for Jiggling, Jumping, and Jogging, for instance).  Because children usually learn nouns before verbs this makes some letters a bit less meaningful than others.  But don't get me wrong--there is plenty of singing and dancing and the entire alphabet is repeated multiple times.  My son loves to hear the Sesame Street gang sing the ABCs!
""1,2,3"" is the video that inspired me to buy this tape.  My son saw it at a friend's house and was captivated.  In this case, each number between one and twenty is featured in at least a small sketch or song.  The plot focuses on Ernie who finds a hotel room key and then proceeds to teach the managers how counting can help them do their jobs.  It, too, is great fun.
In short, buy the video for your preschooler, but don't rely on it alone to team him or her the alphabet or numbers.",4.0
"My son is four and in Pre-K 4.  His teacher told me he was falling behind because he couldn't recognize the numbers.  Well,  I started searching around for learning tools for counting and I found this set of tapes.  I got them and started playing them for my son and they are really catchy tunes.  He has improved 100%.",4.0

"We've seen virtually every Sesame Street video - some once, some many times.  This one is one of the most enjoyable.  We owned it for a long time, then my kids outgrew it - or so we thought!  They've asked to see it several times since we gave away our copy, so we keep getting it out of the library.  My kids are 7 and 10 now, and still asking!  We are particularly fond of 'Telly's Lunch' and the skit with Grover.  This is one of the really good Sesame Street videos - definitely worth the $ - only wish we'd kept our copy when we had a chance!  Four stars because nothing is better than Elmo's Sing Along Guessing Game, but this is VERY close.",4.0
"Like many parents, I purchased this with the belief that it would be far better than other programs, and also serve as a good educational vehicle -  and we were not disappointed.  Our daughter adores the characters, and her  comprehension for counting continues to grow.  The difference between  Barney stuff (entertainment) vs. Sesame street (edu-tainment) is amazing.
As an adult, I find myself humming along to the tunes.  Okay, so I  happen to be a big kid.  In any case, your kids will enjoy it, and as a  parent, you will have a guilt free conscience about your kids consuming too  much TV.",4.0

"Our two-and-a-half year old really got into this, but didn't like ""learning about numbers"" at all, except for one little sequence that show 2 girls playing with a dollhouse. the two dvds are actually quite different: this one features elmo and ernie and feels very much geared toward children while ""learning about numbers"" actually seems like they were trying to entertain children and adults at the same time by adopting a mock talk show format where big bird is supposed to be some kind of jay leno standup. plus there is a lot of ""The Count"" in that LAN, and our toddler didn't like him at all!  Much better choice, I think, for toddlers. Only weakness is that they give short shrift or even skip over certain numbers between 1-20. Some kind of brainless editing decision by somebody who didn't get enought sleep, no doubt.",4.0

Its pretty good. It took a while for my son to watch more than 5mins but now i just go to the songs and he watches the dvd. It has really helped with his counting. He just turned 2 on feb. 24th 2007. I would advise buying it if your kid is around his age for the counting part.,4.0

I would prefer if they made an effort to display or encourage good manners as well as  teach about academic things, like Barney tends to do.",4.0
"The Sesame Street - 123 Count with Me pulls together a neat theme that holds the attention of my grandchildren.  Its hard to compete with all the wild cartoons going on that bombard children today, but my 3 and 2 year old grandchildren are mesmerized by it and they've watched it twice so far.  I felt like it was worth buying.  I'm glad I have it.",4.0
"This works well as a teaching aid if you are wanting to teach your child/children how to count. I like the fact that my daughter learns a lot quicker and easier instead of just having me sit there and go over the numbers and it can get boring. It provides some songs and dances here and there and my kid seems to enjoy watching it. I recommend this to families that are looking to teach their kids, and just want a little extra to help them along.",4.0

"Educational DVDs should be cheaper (at least USD 6.00) & it'll help all education-concious parents to buy them. Besides, their DVD running time is approximately 40 minutes. My 12-month-old niece is into cartoon in the first place. My sister-in-law's mistake. Cartoon offers her entertainment. And my wife told her younger sister that Sesame Street DVD can be a good tool for babies/kids to learn & promised her it'll be a birthday gift for her daughter. Sadly, we can't find any Sesame Street DVD in Malaysia & if there is any, the price will be around RM 80 (USD 20.00). That's when I logged on to Amazon.com & purchased it. Now she has gradually developed big interest in watching the DVD. The only dissatisfaction I have is that the captioning doesn't appear (only the subtitle appears). The captioning is good for impaired-hearing people & kids to learn about reference to situation (eg. ""chattering"", ""laughing""). I've bought few DVDs from Amazon before (eg. American Me) & the captioning appears as just fine on my region-all DVD player. Regards, Irwan Shah from Malaysia.",4.0
"We rented this from Netflix first and it's a current favorite.  Both my 2 year old and my 3.5 year old like it and the 3 year old has learned to count from it, to 10 easily and is working on up to 20 pretty well so far.  I like several of the songs (and as a musician I'm picky) and the Sesame Street characters are generally appealing (although I can live without Elmo doing Rap).  A bonus was that I remember the ""number nine martian cutie"" song from my youth! :-)",4.0
"We love this DVD.  My son enjoys and asks for it frequently.  Highly recommend...my son loves to count things now!
HOWEVER, I do have just one small complaint.  The ""chapters"" are not clean...if you go to the chapter on the number 3 you get the tail end of 2; chapter 5 closes with the beginning of the next number.  This is annoying...especially when you want to go to a number and you have to sit thru the end of the previous chapter and all the while La Petite Prince is chanting 3 3 3 3 3 3 3.
I have noticed that the SS DVD's (like Follow that Bird for example) don't have logical clean chapters....why?  It doesn't seem like rocket science to me...",4.0
"This is a nice video, gives a chance to learn the numbers, but the Sesame Street Learning About Letters cassette was much better. I'm not sure the plot is so easily understood and it would have been nice to have the numbers run through more frequently or more songs and less of standing around and talking. Nevertheless it is a very good cassette and is recommended over the age of 2.",4.0
"My 14-month old daughter has watched this several dozen times already, and she still picks this one out when given a choice between this or another Sesame Street video. She loves Ernie and Elmo, both of whom appear regularly in the show, and while she still isn't saying her numbers, I'm pretty sure she's getting the concepts figured out. I also make sure to interact with her to help reinforce the concepts and help keep her focused.
Even though I've watched it with her for at least half of those viewings, I generally enjoy watching it with her. Part of the reason is the different segments are well-done and actually have the occassional bit of adult humor (e.g., the ""counting crows"" who sing about 3 -- supposedly the source for the band's name), and also for the things that happen in the background as Ernie interacts with Benny and the Dinger (for instance, when Ernie dings the Dinger for the first time, watch the action in the background -- it's quite funny, and definitely targeted for the adults who are watching along!).",4.0

"I liked this video. I had it on my ""wish list"" for quite a while and decided to get it. It is a family video and a christian themed video. I thought the actors were superb with Ruby Dee, Julie Harris among others. The story line of a man returning to his grandmother's house after she has suffered a stroke and he has suffered the suicide of his pregnant wife is sad but interesting as the viewer follows the characters to their respective ends. Without giving too much away, there is a sort of redemption for all characters, one way or another. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I felt that the video kind of left the story unfinished (at least in my opinion). You get the feeling that the main character will eventually return for good to his roots but you really do not know that and I felt sort of left at ""loose ends.""

Honestly , It still can be very Dusky and even a little old world blurry at times with the pops and grain clearly visible. There is no behind the scenes footage at all simply a Laser-disc like menu and the movie. Don't let that statemnet fool you , this definitly is a quality transfer for the times and not a laserdisc bootleg by any stretch.

"CONDORMAN was a childhood favorite of mine, and, brother, I have been waiting impatiently for a Region 1 DVD to get my mitts on. So it's about time (but now I'm cheesed with the DVD's lack of special features). I find it really hard to be objective with CONDORMAN, this film being such a cherished memory. Having seen it again very recently, I can't help but note the datedness, the laughably rendered laser beam effects, and that hokey theme song and the cheesy cartoon Condorman in the opening credits. But mostly I happen to think that the film does stand the test of time, in terms of its watchability, its humor, and its sense of wonder and adventure.

Some SPOILERS now, peppered throughout.

A conscientious comic book artist, Woody Wilkins won't put anything in his comics which his characters couldn't do in real life. As such, the movie opens in Paris with Woody gigged out in full Condorman regalia and leaping off the Eiffel Tower to test his Condorman wings. It sucks for him that the wings malfunction and he ends up diving into the Seine river. So right away you get a sense of what this cat is like: an adventurous dreamer.

Woody thinks that his friend Harry's job in the CIA is fraught with excitement and skullduggery, even as Harry insists that he's merely a file clerk. But when Harry is tasked with finding a civilian to handle a simple courier assignment in Istanbul, he taps Woody for the mission. In Istanbul Woody meets the mysterious Natalia and impresses her when, in a pretty hilarious scene, he inadvertently takes out several enemy agents.

Cut to some time later, and we finally get to the central plot. The CIA learns that a Soviet KGB operative codenamed the Bear wants to defect, but that the Bear wants only the agent known as Condorman to act as the primary facilitator. Woody is initially reluctant, but caves when he learns that the Bear is actually Natalia (who's mistaken Woody for a top agent) and that the CIA has agreed to bring his comic book designs to life. The rest of the film treats us to more globetrotting exploits, zany secret agent and superhero antics, and a whiff of romance.

So, if you're a kid at heart, CONDORMAN should be right up your alley. One of its strongest points is that it does a good job of massaging your sense of wish fulfillment. Because who hasn't daydreamed of accomplishing daring deeds, of coming out the hero and winning that girl? CONDORMAN is awesomely nerdtacular.

Michael Crawford, if you remember him at all, is more famous for stuff like HELLO, DOLLY and for playing the Phantom of the Opera on stage (for which, to give him his just due, he garnered massive props). Crawford is skinny, gangly, boasts a non-heroic voice, and isn't who you first think of when drawing up the prototypical intrepid man of action. But he's good as the comic book creator/nerd with aspirations of derring-do. This is a Disney flick, so, it's certainly wholesome enough and its sensibilities lean toward the youngsters. A  film like this can get away with a character like Woody Wilkins, a ""foolish dreamer who draws comic books"" who then takes on the identity of one of his creations.

It helps that Condorman has a supporting cast who mostly plays it straight, notably Oliver Reed as the sinister Russian masterspy Krakov, Barbara Carrera as the exotic femme fatale Natalia, and James Hampton who plays Woody's amiable pal and CIA contact Harry Oslo. Jean-Pierre Kalfon, the sorta scary one-eyed Russian hitman Morovich, does it over-the-top, but, really, what else can you do when you're sporting a menacing glass eye and tearing down the Yugoslavian roads in an intimidating black Porsche? And, man, watching this film again just brings back those good old days, when the Iron Curtain was still up and the U.S. and the USSR were still kicking it Cold War. The prevailing thought back then was that the Russian Bear would be a superpower forever...

CONDORMAN is loosely based on Robert Sheckley's novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Game-of-X/dp/0441273084/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Game of X</a>, which I haven't read but have just now ordered online because I hear good things about it. Catering to Woody's intent that Condorman be an international crime fighter, his plan to help Natalia defect involves their navigating a circuitous route, from Yugoslavia to the Swiss Alps to a final showdown in Monte Carlo. Considering that they end up running a gauntlet of enemy operatives in all their stops, they might as well have taken a direct flight home. But where's the fun in that, right? I thought it a perfect touch that Krakov is able to anticipate Condorman and Natalia's itinerary simply by reading Woody's comic books.

When I saw this as a kid, I was totally enthralled by the James Bond-type gadgetry. Even now, I still get a kick out of watching the sluggish Gypsy conveyance transform into the sleek Condormobile and then into a hovercraft. The laser guns, however, sucketh big. Note that CONDORMAN is more a lighthearted spy thriller than a superhero caper. Woody as Condorman appears briefly in the opening sequence and then in the last act. And, as Condorman, he doesn't really indulge in hands on fighty fights but instead settles for foiling the bad guys from a distance, soaring on wings from above and then firing off missiles at them from his Condorboat. I dug the costume, though, and as an L.A. Dodger fan, I'm glad the film closes out in Dodgers stadium, even as Woody receives his next cloak & dagger assignment. I wish, though, that we'd seen something of Woody's other creations. I can't help being intrigued by the likes of Gopher Boy, Bazooka Boy, and Laser Girl. Where oh where can I get me some of those fun Zowie Comics?",4.0
It is a great movie. I really enjoyed it. It has some humorous parts too. I think it is a movie everyone could enjoy.,4.0
"I remember watching an interview a few years back like ""This is your life"" with Michael Crawford, and they went through his career of TV, movies and plays etc.. and I kept waiting for them to mention Condorman, but they never did :( and they should, as it's a very underrated movie.

When I was a kid, this was one of my favorite movies. About Woody (Crawford) who is a comic book writer who's best friend Harry (Michael J Fox's father in Teen Wolf/Longest Yard (original) guy who dies) is a file clerk for a spy company, who when left in charge to send a civilian to Istanbul to deliver some spy papers, he bumbled his way into making a top KGB agent (Natalia) believe he is a top agent and she later wishes to have him help her defect to America.

Woody takes on the challenge and finds himself being chased by Natalia's boss/lover or whatever and his team of henchmen while Woody pulls out all his toys and gadgets to help aid their escape, in the fashion of Woody bringing his comic book super hero character to life.

Seeing this again many years later, I can see why it is more of a cult classic then a very popular action/adventure comedy. But, it is still a lot better then most of the **** that floods the shelves these days, and this one is very underrated as a b grade comedy.

The character of Woody reminds me of Maxwell Smart, a bumbling secret agent who doesn't always escape by skill or outsmarting the bad guys, but by unintentional luck, but gets the girl in the end. Just try to imagine Maxwell Smart wants to be Batman at the same time, and that is about what Condorman is.

A lot of humor, zany antics, car chases and star wars lasers.. all blended in for a fun ride.

Ignore anyone selling this second hand on amazon or anywhere else for over 20 bucks... they are ripping you off hard. The DVD quality is not that great, it kind of looks like it was done straight from an old VHS to DVD without bothering to clean it up. And there is no bonus features. This DVD deserves more respect then this, and I hope Disney decide to do a special edition of it someday.

Oh yeah, not to forget, the second hand sellers are selling the out of print region 1 version... the DVD is still in print in region 4 for about 10 bucks, and includes another film with it too. And don't worry about the region stuff, they play in any old computers DVD player. So I'd recommend doing the smart thing and finding the ones still in print and pay a whole heap less then these clowns prices.

and to the person who is selling it for 500 bucks, BWUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH, you have a b grade movie there, not the holey grail.",4.0
"This is one of those movies that would have been a massive hit if it had had a star in it. However it is still a great movie with fantastic action set pieces and pretty good jokes. If you want to ask Disney to let you know when it's re-released use the link on the Disney DVD website and then follow instructions to be 'emailed when it is available'. (Can't post the link here on Amazon as it's a no no to include web addresses so do a search for Condorman on the Disney DVD site).

"I was in middle school when this movie came out. It was 1981 and I had saved up my pocket money to pay for the bus ride into the city and the admission for a matinee to a movie that seemed so exciting and lively to me.

I had read the book 'The Game of X' by Robert Sheckley as well as the adaptation of the movie by Heather Simon and imagined every scene in my head as I had gone through it. The movie was everything a young boy could have hoped for - a rollicking, comedic adventure with a very beautiful female Russian agent (Carrera) and a sinister KGB chief (played by Oliver Reed).

The only problem I have with this movie is the miscasting of Michael Crawford as Woody Wilkins, the cartoonist who helps out a friend of his at the CIA office in Paris. Englishman Crawford puts on the most exaggerated American accent imagineable, although admittedly he has the brilliant comedic timing necessary to pull off this role.

The CIA in France has a problem. They need a civilian to act as a courier to Istanbul. Of course Woody gets the job, but right from the start it's obvious he is taking his role just a little too seriously. By the time he arrives to meet his KGB contact in Turkey he has fully assumed the role of his cartoon creation - top CIA agent and superhero Condorman.

Barbara Carrera (who two years later would get to play a Bond girl - the very movies this one attempts to lampoon) plays KGB agent Natalia. Later, when she makes the decision to defect, the impressive Condorman comes to mind as the only CIA agent she will trust to handle her defection.

The only problem is the CIA does not have an agent with the codename Condorman.

What follows is an adventure filled race across Europe with enough gadgets to fill several Bond movies. There is some great car chases (performed by legendary French stunt driver Remy Julienne and his 16-man crew of drivers and mechanics), boat chases and along the way Crawford sports some of the most outrageous disguises in cinema history. It's all great fun and it's executed perfectly.

For high flying escapist entertainment they don't come much more downright enjoyable than this. The DVD is a disappointment with no special features to speak off except a rather slim production notes section in the inside cover booklet. It's 2 pages of notes on the making of the movie, with sections on 'The Story,' 'The Setting,' 'Gadgetry' and 'Stunts and Special Effects,' but it's all very slim pickings.

But, I've had this movie in my DVD collection for over two years and on those quiet rainy Saturday's it's a particular favorite (along with 1980s FLASH GORDON) to put in my DVD player and sit back and remember a more innocent time in my life.

Recommended for all dreamers.",4.0
"As a kid, this was my favorite movie for quite some time.  I never thought I'd see them re-release it (as Disney would probably like to forget it ever existed) but I'm pleased none the less. Condorman is sort of a cross  between James Bond and Batman with some Pink Panther ineptitude thrown in  for laughs.  While it is not by any means a masterpiece, it's still pretty  fun and quite worthwhile.  It's got lots of high tech spy gear, including  cool cars, speedboats, lazers and other gadgets, humor, romance, an evil  villain, and a likable hero who comes out on top.  I've read some pretty  bad reviews of the film, complaining that there's no plot to it.  I don't  know what movie they were watching, but the film makes pretty good sense to  someone willing to just listen to the dialogue.  It makes a great deal more  sense than the plots of some other spy movies I could mention... Maybe  Condorman IS mostly for the kids, but if you have an attention span and  give it a chance, Ithink you'll find it's not nearly as bad as you may  have heard.",4.0
"Taking Charles Dickens' 521 page novel and turning it into a film is no easy matter, but this version seems to do a good job, following the life of Pip, the poor-turned-rich-turned-poor again young man who wants to become a gentleman.  Although this version doesn't offer many radical elements from the director, it does show chaos and darkness in the seeking of fortunes and offers a look into the neurotic behaviors lurking in our lives.  These expectations may not be great, but they certainly are worth watching.",4.0
"I enjoyed this movie very much.  After just finishing the novel I bought  this movie.  I was really happy to see how close they stayed to the actual  book.  Most other movies take advantage of it.  This is a must! The camera  work done in the film is also really great.  I especially loved the way  that they ended it.  Ioan is fabulous and Charlotte shines as  Miss. Havisham.  Orlick was amazing!!  In fact everything about this movie  was!
A VERY VERY MUST!!!",4.0
"I originally only watched this movie because Ioan Gruffudd, my favorite actor is in it.  I saw him in Horatio Hornblower (which I reccomend you see also) and he was breathtaking.  So I figured that Great Expectations would  be just as wonderful.  It was very good, but not as interesting as HH.  Ioan, again, played his part with an enormous amount of emotion.  But I can  see why Horatio Hornblower won and the Emmy and not Great Expectations.  Don't get me wrong, it certainly held my interest, I watched it both nights  on PBS that it was on.  But it was slightly strange.  I can't see why it  ended the way it did.  (You'll have to see it to understand what I'm  talking about!)  But I did enjoy it, and reccomend it to anyone who likes  Charles Dickons and period pieces.",4.0
"This stripped down version might not please the purists, but it's compelling and gripping nonetheless.  Beautifully acted by a stellar cast.  Ioan Gruffudd shines as Pip.  Pip undergoes profound change throughout the  story, and there's not a false moment in Gruffudd's performance.  Ian  McDiarmid as Pip's creepy guardian Mr. Jaggers and Charlotte Rampling as  the creepy Miss Havisham also excel.  Another superb BBC production.",4.0
"My mother came to visit me recently and she wanted to know what movie I had for her to watch. I showed her and my aunt this movie and they were completely captivated. It is a good story especially if you are a romantic. However I was not so keen on the ending. It seemed like there should have been something more. Something more dramatic. Also at some points in the movie things got a little slow and it took patience to get past the scenes. I did think Charlotte Rampling was a perfect Miss Havisham and Justine Waddell was perfect as Estella. Ioan Gruffudd also expressed his emotions very well in each scene without being overly dramatic. This film portrays jealousy and love very well. It is a classic after all.

~The Rebecca Review",4.0
"I wish someone would change the pic - it is misleading, and I hesitated to buy or not to buy the movie... In the end I'm glad I did, this movie is probably the closest version to the book. As expected with any BBC production, excellent performances, nice costumes, and a great re-creation of the book's atmosphere.",4.0
"I agree with the previous reviewer that the preview is stupid; it's actually the first 2 mins and credits of the film.  However, I have seen the full movie several times and I think this is an outstanding version of ""Great Expectations."" The final scene really packed an emotional wallop for me, unlike some of the other versions. Good cast, classy production.",4.0
This movie follows the book pretty well.  My 8th grade students enjoyed it.  We watched the movie before we read the book since sometimes the book can be hard to follow with the English flavoring in the language and the many  characters.  I would reccommend this movie.,4.0
"This is a well done version and follows the book with just a few minor changes.  Ioan Gruffudd and Justine Waddell certainly make an attractive Pip and Estella.  Charlotte Rampling as Miss Havisham is younger, more beautiful and a bit more sane than she is usually portrayed but the part is well acted.  The actors playing Joe Gargory, Magwich, Remmick, Orlick and Jaggers are all well suited to their parts and do admirable jobs.  The movie has quite a dark and sinister mood and a lot of the characters that provide comic relief in the book including Pumblechook, Wopsle, the Pocket family, and Clara's father are eliminated or have the humorous aspect's of their characters trimmed leaving us nothing to laugh at.  A brooding musical score and lots of scenes of the desolate marshlands, dirty London and the decay of Miss Havisham's house also contribute to the somber mood.",4.0
"There is a definitive modern flavor to this classic by Dickens, yet the handling of the story is very dignified and seems to translate to film almost perfect. Mobile Masterpiece Theatre's telling of Great Expectations accounts for many of the most important parts of the story, and those who have never read the book (or, those who chose not to read it in high school), will have an easy time understanding the story of Pip's rise and fall in both love and status. Certainly this is not some cheesy modern remake that tries to be hip and cool; instead it modernizes the tale in a way that is very ""Dickenseque.""

One of the greatest strengths of the film is characterization. Some may see Estella and Miss Havisham as being a little more ""sensitive and kind"" in this version compared to the novel, but overall they fit their roles well. Ioan Gruffudd does a superb job of Pip as an adult, who learns of his great expectations and tries to use these to gain a better status in life .Abel Magwitch, who is the convict who helps Pip earn a better life, is also played very similar to the character in the novel. I also felt that Joe was depicted essentially as the character in the book, and he really brings to life his love for Pip despite the fact that Pip at times resents him. Some of the other minor characters are also fun to watch: Mr. Jaggers, Mr. Wemmick, Mr. Pumblechook, Herbert Pocket, Biddy. The great thing about Dickens' characters is that they are unique and, at times, eccentric and, as a viewer, you can readily identify those characteristics as they come up in the film.

Another aspect of the film that was refreshing was just the scenery. The scene at the beginning with Pip encountering the convict in the cemetery, the grassland scene at the beginning and the end of the movie, and the dreariness of London (as Pip first arrives) all seem to be very illustrative of the attitude of the film.

One disappointing aspect of the film was that, at times, it was too obvious and blatant. It's almost as if the director decided that people were ""too lazy"" to understand certain parts, so they just thought they'd have a character ""fill in"" exactly what happened  rather than trying to let you decide on your own or show the scene the way it was intended. One example of this is the conflicts between Pip and Orlick.

Approximately 3 hours in length, this film still manages to cut quite a bit from the book and seem relatively short in length. I highly recommend this version, and it is much better than the Ethan Hawke/ Gwyneth Paltrow version of Great Expectations, which is very loose in its translation.

If you are looking for a modernized version of a great classic by Dickens, this is it. This film also works well for any teachers who want to do a comparison between the film and the book.

4  stars",4.0
"First let me say that I adore Ioan Gruffud and Justine Waddell, and their work, in this and in other films. And therein lies my (mild) dissatisfaction with this movie: there really are not a lot of scenes with the two together, focussing on their thwarted love. In particular, there is not a lot of development of Estella, so that her actions seem a bit difficult to understand. Why is she marrying that thug of a suitor? Is it an act of will on her part, and is she really so desparate to get any from Miss. Havisham? And if so, why not marry Pip, or anyone else for that matter? Pip confronts Miss. Havisham with the stated fact that Estella is suffering badly; however, we don't SEE this. A cardinal sin in moviemaking is to TELL instead of SHOW. And there are disappointingly few scenes, as I said, developing the love story, which tends to distance the viewer from Pip's pain. In particular, there is a dearth of scenes with Justine Waddell in them, which is quite hard to take, if you are a fan of hers, like myself. I was a little appeased that Ioan Gruffud was in practically every scene, hence my decision to give it four stars. Bernard Hill also was impressively protean as the initially threatening, but ultimately paternal Maggwitch. Charlotte Rampling was her usual luminous self, creating a peculiarly attractive Miss. Havisham. One wonders how her fiance could ever have abandoned her. To conclude, I was a little disappointed, but the film was worth the time and money I spent. I would highly recommend that Waddell fans search out her other work. She has been much better used in other vehicles, such as Tess of the D'urbervilles and Wives and Daughters (both are Mobile Masterpiece Theater productions, I believe). She also starred in a movise made in the U.K., ""The One and Only"", unfortunately not available in the U.S. yet.",4.0

"Great Expectations is easily my favorite of the Dickens classics.  With that being said, normally when you translate a book into a movie, something is lost in the shuffle.  Mobile Masterpiece Theater has done a marvelous job, though capturing the heart of the tale.
Iaon Gruffuddd, of A&E's spectacular Horatio Hornblower series, does a good job as an adult Pip, however in his days working as Joe's apprentice I did not really feel that he adequately conveyed Pip's disatisfaction at being there very well or appearing embarrassed once he does come into his fortune and Joe visits.
Joe, on the other hand, is portrayed perfectly, as is Pip's aunt Miss Havisham and Estella.  The plot is followed accurately, though at a breakneck speed, which causes the story to feel a bit rushed.  All in all, though, it is a fairly good interpretation that anyone who enjoys the story would do well to pick up.",4.0

"Quite a strange movie actually, at once appearing simple but also complex, and the nihilist ending will not please many.

Strictly a ""two-hander"", (Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune), the latter speaking only Japanese throughout...no subtitles. You have to rely on Marvin's dialogue, and Mifune's expression. Now this is not as hard as it may sound.

It's also burdened with what has to be the weirdest selection of music as the soundtrack, varying from full church organ, loud discordant atonal concrete music and what surely has to be the sounds of air being allowed to escape from the stretched neck of a rubber balloon at one stage!

A basic story on the surface, just the two men from opposing armies, enemies marooned on an otherwise deserted Pacific island, struggling not only to survive, but hold each other at bay.
At first the motivations seem to be to kill, but gradually that changes to a power play for dominance over and degradation of the other.
The upper hand changes, but gradually realisation sets in that they will have to work together to survive, or even just get along.
The astute may note that as the two are gradually stripped of the trappings of civilisation, they in fact eventually become more ""civilized"", ....and when later some of the outward comforts of the civilised world are available to them,such as clean clothes, shaving and alcohol/cigarettes/magazines, they then fall back into barbarism.
Performances are good, ....although Marvin is perhaps a little too old for the character he's playing. The settings are genuine and their misery well-portrayed as they fight off thirst, starvation and the elements, ...even the sheer boredom.
There is a somewhat odd scene where Marvin tries to teach Mifune to retrieve a stick as a dog would....Mifune is tied most uncomfortably to some sort of a large branch at the time as well as  being hobbled.
Just who is teaching whom is open to interpretation as Mifune refuses and remains mute and impassive.....while Marvin continually demonstrates the demeaning task.
Realising that no one is coming to rescue them, eventually the two begin to tolerate each other, then go further to co-operate enough to build a raft substantial enough to get over the surrounding reef.
This being achieved, they sail off on the open ocean in search of rescue.
A plane is heard, but when Marvin tries to use an old whistle to attract attention, Mifune grabs it and throws it into the water. Just why he does this is unclear.
Eventually the raft drifts to some islands and upon coming ashore the two discover what seems to be a large abandoned military fortified gun emplacement. There are tense moments trying to discover whether it is Japanese or American, and tellingly, Marvin becomes concerned that the eagerly exploring Mifune may be shot by some American forces due to his being Japanese.
Marvin repeatedly cries out ""Don't shoot...don't shoot....he's my FRIEND!""
Mifune appears suddenly from the debris, frightening Marvin who exclaims ""Oh I thought you were a Japanese!""
The point being that although he IS Japanese, Marvin has begun to think of him as something more than just a racial type with whom his country is at war.

It becomes clear that the base is now abandoned after what must have been some heavy fighting, but the two find clothes and saki to salvage, and also clean themselves up, then begin to enjoy some camaraderie over a few drinks.

Another weird scene ensues with Marvin drunkenly asking Mifune why the Japanese don't believe in God.
Marvin himself, (the actor) appears very ill-at-ease performing this bit and it's not entirely successful.
Nor is the reason for this uncomfortable scene at all clear.
Then the pair suddenly become estranged again as Mifune sees some very graphic pictures of slain Japanese in an old Life magazine and wartime hatreds emerge once more.
Then, ...just as you think we will see if their hard-won friendship from the island and the raft journey will last or they will once again become sworn enemies......BANG! That nihilistic ending I previously mentioned happens and that's it.

Many will feel they have sat through a long movie where not a lot of action has happened, only to be denied a proper denouement.
I must admit it looked to me like they didn't quite know how to end it, and so went with the Apocalypse.
You may of course feel differently, but the movie as it stands remains largely a psychological study of two men, rather than any war-action piece.

WARNING: Do NOT watch if the title has you hoping to see some Audie Murphy/John Wayne heroics, with intense battle scenes.
You will be MAJORLY disappointed!

I enjoyed it for the power struggle and the humanity emerging over the nationalism, along with the performances, but must admit to finding the ending far too sudden and a most unsatisfactory way to dispose of two characters you have come to know over such a long movie.
Does it all count for nothing?
I wanted to see what they would do back in a world at war. Would they remain friends, or return to the roles that the war demanded they perform?
I believe some copies include an alternate ending. Mine does not but it is available on You-Tube, and is only about a minute long.
It too is enigmatic, not really telling you all that much about what happened next.

Four stars overall for me. (One off definitely for the ending.)

"I saw this film when it was released and went to see it again and it had the alternate ending. That really blew my mind! I remember standing up in the theater and yelling, ""WHAT?"" People looked at me like I was nuts! I asked the theater manager how the heck can this be and he had no clue.
So, now searching for a blu ray edition of this great Lee Marvin flick to no avail. I sure wish they'd release a nice blu ray version. I love this movie.
I've had the DVD for years now and it's a good version but with these new flat screen OLED (LG has them and this year Panasonic will too) sets that are out now, even a 4K version would be really cool. Watching good movies is a great pass time and with all this new technology in HD, it's just like going back in time and having these great works of art alive and living right in your own home! Don't forget the surround sound!

"What is it about Robson Green that makes him so compelling? Is it his piercing blue eyes, or the sense that, no matter how inscrutable his expression, there's so much more going on inside his head that we're not privy to? Green is in no way what one might consider a Hollywood-type leading man--he appears small, his hairline is receding, and he's not conventionally handsome--but the man commands the screen like nobody's business.
I found ""Touching Evil"" to be a fantastic series, so when ""TE 2"" became available, I grabbed it. Unfortunately, it took me some time to watch all the episodes. Perhaps this was because I was so impressed with the first series that I had high expectations. Maybe it was ""sophomore slump."" Ah, it was probably that the story arc of the first series was just plain more interesting. It is often the case that when the original creators of a series relinquish creative control to others, the quality suffers. This is also true of ""TE 2,"" which sometimes seems like a pale reflection of the original. What it still has going for it, however, is the characters. I very much appreciate the circularity of the stories, bringing characters--like Creegan's wife and kids--in and out of the story at various points throughout the series. Shaun Dingwall alternately impresses and annoys with his portrayal of the unsteady DI Rivers, and Nicola Walker--another unconventional look but undeniably powerful--just knocks my socks off when she takes Creegan to task every so often. Maybe that's the key to why I enjoy the world of ""Touching Evil"" so much: It feels like family.
And although I would love to see Robson Green in more visible projects, I sort of hope Hollywood never finds out about him. They just wouldn't know what to do with him.",4.0

"this is not the first movie in which woody allen starred.  however, it was the first movie which would form the pattern for the rest of his movie making life. ergo, he scripted it, directed it and starred in it.  if you followed his earlier standup act, this first movie captures the shtick he established with that act.  he is a character who can do nothing right yet he wants to be a criminal mastermind, especially with robbing banks.  he has some great comic moments in this film. in one he attempts to play a cello in a marching band.  in another he tries to escape prison using a gun he carved out of soap but it rains. these are great comic set ups and sketches.

the romance he sets up involves the female archtype we see in every woody allen movie. she is young, good looking, bright and, most importantly, not Jewish. his pursuit of the ultimate shiksa will continue in virtually every subsequent film. he gets better at this when he starts using Diane Keaton, followed by Mia Farrow.

many people would have liked woody allen to continue making comic movies like this one for the rest of his life. instead of continuing with this broad farce style, he would develop his own blend of combining comedy with tragedy instead.

i liked this film and laughed a lot but i'm glad he did not spend over forty years making variations of it. one of allen's biggest inspirations, the Marx Brothers, especially Groucho, did slight variations of the same comedic shtick over their entire professional lives.  allen took much bigger artistic risks by not sticking to these broad comedic setup gags.

"Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune are the only characters in this rather unique film.  Sworn World War II enemies, they find themselves marooned on a desert island together.  The story moves along, as the American and the Japanese gradually learn to mistrust one another less and less.  Even though neither can make himself fully understood to the other, they finally manage to construct a raft together and sail to a different island, formerly occupied by Japanese military, but now abandoned.

Unless the viewer happens to understand Japanese, the only person whose dialogue can be followed is Marvin's.  This is no matter, because one can get the jist of each situation quite easily.  Dubbing in subtitles would have been utterly stupid, not being needed at all.

What this amounts to is a low key anti-war story.  It also features two alternative endings, the first tragic, the second much the opposite.  It's worth watching.",4.0

One of the few films I can name with only two actors, Hell in the Pacific takes two of the world's most forceful actors (Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune) and casts them as enemies stranded on the same island in the Pacific with no idea of the other's language; something like the Twilight Zone episode ""Two"" without the romance, Hell in the Pacific is an interesting and unique film.",4.0

"I greatly enjoyed 'Hell in the Pacific' and it was more than I expected. I watched this movie the other night and got a lot out of it.

It's a very involving story set during WWII about an American pilot (the great Lee Marvin) and his Japanese counterpart (the equally great Toshiro Mifune) at odds with each other after they are both unknowingly stranded on the same small, uninhabited island in the vast South Pacific Ocean. They fight and quarrel for a good first half of the movie, but ------ realizing that they are both going to have to rely on the other to get out of their situation or to even survive ------ they gradually form an uneasy alliance.

I thoroughly appreciated John Boorman's obvious commitment to realism on this movie. As the film opens up, it just jumps into the story right away, beginning immediately with the image of Toshiro Mifune sitting alone near the beach and Lee Marvin in the jungle, likely just recently dropped in by parachute. The movie wastes no time with set-up or any explanation as to how they both got there. We don't know and don't need to. The editing is done at a smooth, flowing, non-hurried pace which gives the movie a definite real-time feel to it. The scenery and cinematography of the authentic Palau locations is simply stunning and I'm rather amazed by how good this movie looks for its age. The picture quality and clarity of this film is jaw-dropping for a 40 year-old movie.
The performances from the sole two actors in the entire film are passionate, inspired and thoroughly believable. The setting and plot is almost enough to make one forget for a moment that the two are sworn wartime enemies and we almost immediately empathize with both characters.

There are no subtitles. It puts us more inside the two's struggle since neither can understand what the other is saying. Even though those of us who don't speak Japanese can't understand what Toshiro Mifune's character is saying, we know EXACTLY what he is feeling and thinking through actions, body language, and forcefulness of expression. Watch for the scene when Toshiro Mifune's character catches a real, giant clam and proceeds to crack it open to get to the real, soft mollusk inside just for the sake of a meal. After they are finally able to put aside their differences for the sake of their mutual survival, they collaborate to build a rather impressive wooden and bamboo raft to escape the confines of the island.

My only grievance with this movie was its ending. I will not spoil it, but I will say that I did feel it was inconclusive and didn't provide me with adequate closure for the two characters' ultimate fates. Even the alternate ending still left me feeling a bit unfulfilled but I will leave it up to each individual viewer to decide for themself. The ending just didn't quite work for me and was the only element that prevented me from giving this film the full five stars.

Overall though, this is still an excellent and vastly underrated 1968 gem from one of the best directors of all time, John Boorman. A unique cinematic experience in the fact that it features two prolific, unparalled actors each playing anonymous characters who are the only two in the entire movie in such a huge, isolated setting. A fasinating encapsulation of a very human story set against the backdrop of the WWII-era campaign in the Pacific.

17 years later in 1985, this film would be reimagined with a science-fiction twist as 'Enemy Mine'.",4.0
"I find Boorman's direction to be fantastic. As others note two military officers from opposite sides recognize each other. Mifune especially seeks with all his cunning to kill Marvin while the latter struggles very hard just to fill his canteen with drinking water. The tensions, very strong at the beginning slowly dissipate as both realize taking out each
other might be very difficult but via cooperation--even despite the language barriers--two heads can equal the results of three. Mifune shows
his tenderness first. But both play outstanding roles. While trying to develop the peace, Marvin reads a military manual that mandates troops always to kill the enemy.  Their keen attention to the nonverbals, even as both seem not to be observing is a case study for those intererested
in interpersonal communication.  Marvin brings in new vitality once he
recognizes there is bamboo on the island.  Yielding to each other in
a collaborative manner, the raft is built and launched.  Then I got the impression they had to fight high waves without food on the ocean for perhaps four days. Both are exhausted. Discovering the new island is a
dream, that neither perhaps thought would occur.  They forage through
the deserted military hospital, each finding things of special interest  and then dressed neatly as military professionals toast each other
countlessly with a big bottle of booze.  I wasn't ready for the end but
tried to foresee possibilities.  For those who can take a movie with very
limited dialogue, scores of nonverbals and two superb actors, this movie
is a must. Those who enjoy more group drama or romantic entertainment would be bored.  I am glad to have found this movie in my collection. The VHS version plays very well.",4.0
"this is the JOHN BOORMAN i love . the director of ""DELIVERANCE"" and ""THE EMERALD FOREST"" in addition to this excellent and haunting film . in his twin outstanding lead actors , a very thoughtful screenplay and breathtaking photography and direction , it all comes together for me . i withhold the fifth star as i am conflicted about the ending . that was john's artistic choice though . i don't do alternate endings .",4.0
"Anyone who wants to make a film would be served well to watch this movie, repeatedly.  Boorman achieves what few filmmakers ever dare: an almost nonverbal story about rivals who learn, somewhat reluctantly, that the humanity they share cannot be abandoned.  Yes, it's a product of the 70's, and the visual style embraces that, but the acting is superb.  These were two of the best actors of their generation, and the collaboration must have been an actor's dream for both.  No more spoilers.  If you're a fan of Boorman, Mifune or Marvin, enjoy.",4.0
"This is both a serious movie and a parable.  Toshir Mifune plays Captain Tsuruhiko
Kuroda, a proud Japanese Naval officer and Lee Marvin plays a downed American Pilot.  They both end up on a deserted small island.  They are mortal enemies, but somehow when you are both staring death in the face, it is easier to make common cause against it.  The story of the movie is how they overcome their hatred for each other (in the generic - wartime sense) to find a way to be found, signal for help, or get off the island somehow, someway.  Both actors are superb.

The parable is appropriate for a world ravaged by two-world wars the previous sixty years and now facing nuclear annihilation.  We need to pull together or we will die at each other's through for no good reason.  While I don't want to reveal what happens, it is instructive how vanishing cooperation and friendship are once the immediate threat seems to be past.

As I watched the movie, I could see how the Cast Away  and Enemy Mine both seemed to learn and use things from this film.

I think it is a pretty good film that should be seen yet today.

"In real life, Lee Marvin is a Marine that received a purple heart after being shot in the buttox during the battle for Saipan. Now here he is afterwards making movies where he is confronting his adversary and being the representative for the American side of the WWII GI psyche. His opposite is a Japanese soldier who equally does a splendid job to bring one up to speed with his culture. Both different and somehow the same. United together by a common goal of survival, yet on a hair trigger to let their warrior spirit flare. Interesting concept for a movie. Well done, appropriately cast.",4.0
"Except for a few brief love scenes, this is a fairly good movie to watch with kids from 6 and up.  There are lots of big laughs and obvious physical comedy and lots of other more subtle turns.  The actual bank hold-up is a classic scene, as is the escape of the prison gang.  This version could be watched in Korean with subtitles, but just set it to English without subtitles and enjoy.",4.0
"For a 1968 Hollywood-bankrolled war movie, HELL IN THE PACIFIC was almost right up there with the best of ""foreign"" films of the Sixties. Featuring only two characters throughout---a Japanese officer and an American officer marooned together on a otherwise unpopulated Pacific island in 1944---the film puts us immediately into the difficulties facing the two men, who are enemies by their circumstances and literally cannot understand each other. The story of how they deal with their plight unfolds in ways that make perfect sense, and both Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune as the two exiles give performances that are both believable and affecting. In fact, the only thing that keeps this from being a five-star movie for me is the very end, which, as I suspected, was grafted on at the behest of the studio heads [cf, director John Boorman's autobiography, ADVENTURES OF A SUBURBAN BOY]. The original ending, included on this DVD release as a special feature, makes much more sense and would have been better. But up until then you're watching one of the best war movies ever made.",4.0
"This is a quirkey and unique little movie. Definitely not perfect, but different, rewarding, and thought prevoking on several levels. I am not a Lee Marvin fan but I thought he and Toshiro Mifune did an excellent out-of-the-box acting job in this movie. If you liked the  ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" movies you will probably like ""Hell in the Pacific"".",4.0
"I am surprised that this movie is not more well known. I just happened to borrow a copy on VHS from my aunt, and the movie simply blew my mind. It shows another side of WW2 and really blasts apart the stereotypes of the Japanese soldier portrayed in American propaganda films and also the American soldier as many Japanese were led to believe. The movie pretty much goes like this : Lee Marvin crashes into the ocean somewhere in the pacific and ends up on an island with the enemy, a Japanese soldier. Their fears and angers are played out as they both struggle to capture one another. They fight back and forth and also play mind games with one another in order to gain the upper hand. Finally, they learn that in order to survive they must put aside their animosity and work together. They slowly become friends and grow to trust one another and work together to build a small raft to escape the island. The Cinematography and acting in the movie are top notch, the only complaint I have was the original ending, but I have heard the DVD comes with alternate endings. I was also pleasantly surprised that John Boorman directed this film. SEE THIS MOVIE!",4.0
"My fiance got me the DVD as a present to me on his birthday.  It sat for a month and then we finally watched it together.  I was amazed that there was no dialogue... really.  Very little.  And when we were watching the DVD, we did not choose the option for subtitles and only realized that option after we'd seen the film.  Overall it is a film to watch -- really watch.  After you see it once without the subtitles, watch it again with them.  Makes it a totally different experience.  The acting and directing is incredible and one is left wondering, what the screenplay of this film actually looked like.  Not too many special features but there is an alternate ending that is interesting.",4.0
"Lee Marvin... a war veteran for real, so when Boorman decided to make him an even bigger star than he already was, he knew he was dealing with iconic material that needed to contrast with an equally fiery temper of a quite different kind. So he put another icon from the east opposite him, the king of the Samurai films, and made his first subversive feature. Hey, where else do you get to see Lee Marvin take a leak on Toshiro Mifune's head? Not in any other American cinema of the period, that's for sure!
This should've been the war movie to end all war movies, because it just lays the whole absurdity out in such a hilarious laboratory test of extremes, no one who sees it ever forgets its almost ""Naked and the Dead"" type absurdist, thoroughly anti-war point of view, which is effective ONLY BECAUSE it makes the existence of evil an undeniable fact that needs to be checked and transcended by humans ALL THE TIME.
Fans of idiotic, pointless 'WAR' dramas that senimentalize the 'mettle-testing' horrifically absurd experience called by that neanderthal-grunt-friendly three letter word into some kind of 'heroism' to justify the 'freedom-saving' lunacy for the poor dupes who went through it (the fantastically crafted but artistically mediocre ""Saving Private Ryan,"" for one) need not apply, but anyone else looking for confrontational cinema in the humans-shooting-projectiles-at-other-humans-wearing-different-clothes genre would do well to start with ""Hell in the Pacific,"" then move on to Anthony Mann's ""Men in War,"" Sam Fuller's ""Steel Helmet,"" and Bertrand Tavernier's ""Capitaine Conan.""  Peace Out Y'all, and remember to solve all your peace-time problems with a gun, as Tony Soprano would.",4.0
"""Hell in the Pacific"" is a fairly early film in the career of  John Boorman, a sort of stealth director whose name rarely occurs to you  right away as one of the greats but who has done excellent work over many  decades.  ""Deliverance"" was four years off, ""Excalibur""  and ""Hope and Glory"" further out, and the clean and sharp  ""The General"" a full three decades away.
Lee Marvin is an  American pilot washed up on the shore of a small Pacific island in the  waning days of World War II -- only to find the one other inhabitant is a  Japanese officer played by the awesome Toshiro Mifune.  Although they carry  on the larger war between them for a time, they gradually realize the only  way either is going to survive and get off the island is if they work  together. But can they do it?
Mifune's dialogue is all in Japanese and  not subtitled, so he is as mysterious and threatening to the viewer as he  is to the Marvin character, but we can tell by his actions, self-built  fortifications, and survival schemes that he's a smarter, more disciplined  man than the American. For a time, all the Marvin character can think to do  is pick away at the former's elaborate survival arrangements, and there is  quite a bit of humor in that.
Leonard Maltin and the other Amazon  reviewers complain about the ending, which comes as an abrupt and  dissatisfying shock, but I think it offers the viewer a choice of  interpretations. It could be taken straight, as the objective fate of our  two heroes, or it could suggest a metaphor for their (and our) inability to  get along together, an image of humanity's potential ultimate fate --  something more in the characters' heads than on the ground....
Anyway, a  fine, tight little movie.",4.0
Although it may not have been the BEST ending to this otherwise fascinating look at the humanity of war. Nonetheless this is a very enjoyable and intriging look at an awkward turn of events for two enemies forced to confront their foe on solitary terms. The ending was war itself.  Irony. Tragedy. Ending.,4.0
"The Bottom Line:

A free-wheeling comedy by Allen, made before Annie Hall ushered in his more serious phase, Take the Money and Run offers a lot of laughs in a short period of time; its humor is not always sophisticated, but it should crack you up quite a bit.",4.0
"This is one of the funniest Woody Allen films. I don't know why it was released in full screen and that is why I deduct one star. One of Woody's less complex comedies, but still one of my favorites. The DVD transfer looks good, but a widescreen version should have been included.",4.0
"Woody Allen has a delightful way of seeing the ridiculous, the silly, the ambiguous side of life and portrays it perfectly in his many movies.  Take the Money and Run was one of his earlier movies and I laugh every time I watch it.",4.0
"Woody Allen stars and directs for the first time, and what a success it turns out to be. There are many great sight gags as well as the usual number of quality one-liners. The film is done in a documentary style, telling the story of Virgil Starkwell, an incompentent petty criminal, played by Woody of course.

To pick a favourite moment out is difficult. However, if forced to pick one I'd go for the scene where Virgil tries to rob a bank, and fails because he hands over a note where the word gun can easily be mistaken for gub. Consequently the entire bank staff and customers are all arguing whether the word is gun or gub. Woody insists its gun; everybody else thinks its gub...

This is definitely one of Woody's early funny ones!",4.0
"Take the Money and Run, is a film hilarius and funny. Woody Allen in the great moment.",4.0
"Allen's directorial debut is a joy from beginning to end. By no means does it have the depth and sophistication of his later work, but it's consistently funny, with one gag running into the next, and there are teasing moments of that blur between fantasy and reality that characterized his films.

The story concerns one Virgil Starkwell, a bespectacled failure who resorts to crime for a living, and can't even be a success at that. He tries to stage a bank robbery, but it flops when the tellers start arguing over whether his handwritten note says ""I have a gub"" or ""I have a gun"". It's told partly in a spoof-documentary style that foreshadows Allen's later full-blown mockumentary, Zelig (1983).",4.0
"Simply put, this movie is hilarious. If you like movies with a bunch of ridiculous (and unexpected) scenes to laugh at, as well as hilarious lines to repeat to your friends later (""... and for marrying a horse.""), this movie is for you. Its sort of like a 1969 version of ""The Naked Gun"" mixed with ""Spinal Tap"" and something else that is more intelligent than both. Check it out.",4.0
"Not many can see Woody Allen as a thief, if even a simple pick-pocket, but yes, he has been one. I have no doubt in my mind that this is the best movie he has ever done. It has so many scenes that I have loved, but to mention my favorite would lead to sheer chaos. So I will.
Woody Allens character needs money desperately, and so, in a short thought attempt, he jimmies open a gumball machine and gets away with pockets and pockets of quarters.
I have not much to say about this film other than I wouldn't recommend buying it, but you at least have to see it,",4.0
"Take The Money & Run is the first film that featured the Woody Allen triple threat of writing, directing and starring.  The film is set as a documentary on the life of the worst criminal of all-time, Virgil Starkwell, who never pulled off a successful crime in his life.  The film is a fast-paced and sharply written.  It sets up the Woody Allen persona, the likable loser, that he would portray in most of his subsequent films.  Take The Money & Run is an excellent start to a movie legend's fabled career.",4.0
"This Woody Allen movie, not often viewed, is an old gem, just like Bananas and Sleeper. The humor is a little bit childish at times, but it's still Woody Allen humor.

"NOTE:  This review applies to the version of this DVD published in 2000.  It may not apply to newer versions.  If you are buying this DVD new, IGNORE THIS REVIEW.  If you're buying it used, well then...

This is a review of the Take the Money and Run --  not the movie, but the DVD itself.  The movie  is a classic comedy that is appropriate  for kids of 10 and over, as well as adults.  If you've never seen it, the humor is a  riot even though it's over 30 years old.

The DVD was just released and  is a brilliant example of film restoration.  The color is  perfect, the  grain is almost invisible, and you couldn't hope for a better print.  The  two-sided disk has TV-format on one side and letterbox on the other, but  as the film was originally shot for TV the images are nearly identical.  There are a couple of extra items that you can access after the end of the  film, but they're typical stuff.

The sound of the first edition (printed 2000), however, leaves a lot to be  desired. It's essentially mono, which is what you'd expect for a late-60's  TV movie, but there are long intervals of noticeable hum.  If you have a  high-quality audio system, the 60-Hz hum sections are really annoying.  In  addition, there are a couple of key scenes where the voices have been so  severely  filtered that they sound quite unnatural. In a bizarre twist, the  defects are more noticeable on better speakers...and almost imperceptible  on a cheap TV speaker.  So, listen to this one on your crummiest TV and you  won't feel compelled to write reviews like this one!",4.0
"This is the best of Woody Allen's strictly-for-laughs movies.  The interview segments which he uses for both comedic and dramatic purposes in many of his films are probably the most fun here, particularly his  ""parents"" who wear disguises.  The gags are much better than in  his ""Bananas"" and the more than slightly silly plot doesn't bog  down as in his ""Sleeper"".  There are no big moral soapboxes, this  movie is just funny.",4.0
"A wonderful parody of crime movies, this mock-documentary tells the story of the worlds most unlikely (and unlucky) criminal - Allen's Virgil Starkwell. This movie goes purely for laughs and is most often successful.  Allen's gift of tapping into the absurd has never been displayed better.  Film is full of gems : Allen being punished by being sent into a hole with  an insurance salesman, his humiliated parents wearing Groucho Marx masks to  disguise themselves and Allen's deadpan backhanded compliment to his  girlfriend: ""That's a nice hat...I see them all over town....Yeah,  they're on sale...in those big bins...millions of them."" A delicious  comedy. If you loved ""Play It Again Sam"" or ""Sleeper""  you'll love this one.",4.0
"I purchased the DVD for my 2 yr old and she loves it. Even though she no longer watches the movie she still sings the song when she flushes the toilet.  People said it's repetitive, but it has to be for little kids to get it. Some people said it was too long, but I disagree,  it's fine. I let my daughter watch the DVD many many times before having her try to potty, and we put the potty out so she could do  what the movie shows. When we removed the diaper about a week later she used it and never had any accidents, and she was trained that same day. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they should have gotten someone who sounds younger to do the little girls voice......people were right about that.  I will save the DVD for my younger daughter and hope it has the same effect. Good luck!!",4.0

"This is probably my favorite of the potty training dvds we have watched. The illustrations are cute and the show moves fast enough to keep the attention of our two year olds. It's somewhat repetitive with scenes being shown multiple times but that's okay. Most of the focus is on being a ""big kid"" and what big kids do. The going potty section is pretty brief, and only slightly longer than all the other things ""big kids do"". But overall it's a cute show, with terms that match the ones we use and it's nice to have it be little girl specific. I'm glad I bought it.",4.0

I generally dislike any focusing in on death, war, primitive medicine practices, etc as they make me feel queasy or really sad, but this season I really enjoyed despite the focus on the war.  I found it fascinating how they told the stories of the upstairs family and the downstairs family, how the war impacted them personally and how they were able to triumph over some of the awfulness that war brings.
