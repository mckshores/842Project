WAS IN VERY BAD SHAPE.!! WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN!!,2.0
"the ""What Everyone Needs to Know"" part of the title is totally off the mark. This book amounts to a very long answer to the simple question, ""What is
Social Entrepreneurism"" without getting even to level 101. Dumbed down. No footholds, no building blocks, no meaty chunks to chew on here.",2.0
"While the colors are great, this is more of a daily diary than a purse-sized appointment book. There is one page with twelve tiny monthly calendars, but no space to make an entry or see a month at a glance. Not what I needed.",2.0
Way too big for the large print life application bible.,2.0
"IT was returned, it would not work well for the left handed to be able to write.",2.0
"The case has several pockets, which is nice, and seems to be made of a material that will last.  But it is very flimsy and should only be used at a desk or table.  If you are planning on using this at church or small group meeting where you don't have a table, it can be very cumbersome.  Also, the outside pocket does not have a zipper closure like the photo representation. It is just a loose open pocket.  Whatever you put in there falls out as soon as you open the case.  This also happens to the items stored in the inside pocket on the opposite side of that 3rd flap. Additionally, the pen holders that are kept inside of the zippered Bible enclosure area are difficult to get your pen into. I will probably be getting a different case if I can't figure out a way to jerry-rig it to work better.",2.0
It's the same one from the book store,2.0
"It fits my bible, I'm just not happy with the quality",2.0
This Bible cover did not fit the Keystone Bible as well as it claimed.,2.0
"It's a cute cover with a nice handle. I gave it two stars because the front or back covers of the Adventure Bible I bought for it constantly slide out. The pockets to put the Bible covers in need to be about an inch bigger. I've had it for two months (past the return window) and one front pocket is ripped. It's a great idea, but a bit lacking.",2.0
"The zipper doesn't work very well, and does not hold the bible in place",2.0
"Just gave to my son for a camping trip starting next week. The seams / stitching is failing and the netting has a rip in it at the opening. He takes care of his things, he will continue to use it but he is disappointed, and so am I.
Hit or miss.",2.0
This cover is not fitted for the Bible...really bad design,2.0
"Sadly, this cover is not designed for ""adventure"" or even weekly traveling to church.  I bought it for my oldest son and loved the look and extra storage pockets.  It matches well with his NIV Adventure Bible.  Unfortunately, after two times to church the handle ripped off (and couldn't even be re-sewn since the cover where it was attached ripped completely off with the handle).  So disappointing!!!  I sent it back and it was replaced.  I chalked it up to a defect on that particular cover and went ahead and ordered the other colored cover for my next son.  Unfortunately, the replaced cover and the new cover both have lost their straps (again in a matter of weeks/months- we were more careful)  Since I foolishly didn't retain the receipts to return them, the boys now just carry them as a book and not by the handle...  bummer they can't fix this ""issue"" as the look and pockets are still really neat!",2.0
"Our children love the Adventure Bible, but the Adventure Bible cover was very disappointing.  Two of our children chose a different cover for their Bible & those have held up for 5 years.  Our third child chose the Adventure Bible cover and the handle ripped off after less than a year of use (and he only carries it on Sunday).  The fabric for this cover is good for cleaning, but it is not sturdy enough to hold up with use.",2.0
"The organizer is adequate in size for any size bible, but the Inside wrap (which attaches to the inside of the organizer and holds the bible in place) limits the size bible you can use. My bible is 9 5/8 x 6 7/8 -- a standard size for a study bible. Zondervan does not make a larger wrap. So either you forego the wrap & get a soft protective cover and carry it loose in the organizer or get a smaller bible. For $31, it didn't meet my needs, so I returned it.",2.0
"I had just purchased a new bible that measures 9.25"" x 7.25"" so since the measurements for this bible cover are advertised as 11"" x 8.7"" I thought it would be perfect.  When the bible cover finally arrived (6 weeks later) the tag for the bible cover says it measures 6 7/8"" x 9 5/8"".  Needless to say it is way too small for my bible.  Had they advertised the actual measurements from the tag, instead of the incorrect measurements they listed, I never would have bought this bible cover.  It looks very nice, but definitely not big enough for my needs.  Wish they would've been honest in their advertisement of this product.",2.0
The quality was fine but my Bible wouldn't stay in it. It just didn't fit right.,2.0
"I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 because of the cover itself. The cover is awesome. I'm sure it will hold up for a long time. Think material and a stout zipper. However I bouth an XL based on reviews. It was to big. I needed the large. Asked the company unlimitedbooks123 if I could exchange it for a large. They said no, and there is a 15% restocking fee on books and a 20% restocking fee on everything else. All this hassle for an exchange. bible cover, awesome. Unlimitedbooks123, not at all.",2.0
"Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  It is of good quality but ordinarily, if I had known in advance, I would not have ordered it.",2.0
"First off - the color is *NOT* as shown, and it's the most aggressively ugly color I've ever seen. Ghastly. I took one star off for the color, and because it's pictured very differently.

The pockets and mesh on the outside are merely annoying and useless, and make that side of the case all bumpy when I am reading my book. The pockets are to small for a cellphone, which might have been a practical idea, and they're too loose for change. The mesh might hold a pen, but there's already a loop for that inside the case.

On the inside, the zipper is exposed, and it's big and a bit rough. I can't imagine anyone actually using this for a Bible.

On the good side, the material is sturdy. The inside is lined. The size is perfect -- big enough for a larger paperback text I'm reading.",2.0
Too big for most bibles. I know the description states it is XL and that is correct. But don't know why someone would carry a bible big enough to use in this case,2.0
"I recently bought the new Zondervan NIV Study Bible and looked to get a case for it.  Zondervan advertises this to fit the new study Bible but it certainly does not fit it well.  It does meet the height and length dimensions but it does not fit the thickness of the study Bible.  After opening it I could easily tell the thickness of the spine was much bigger than what the cover could fit.  I did manage to fit in but the zipper area is stretched to the max!  It feels like I could drum on it.  I'm not upset that it simply doesn't fit; that should be my fault.  What I'm disappointed about is that Zondervan advertises this cover to fit the new study Bible, put out by the same company nonetheless, when the two definitely are not compatible.  My only hope is that the material will stretch enough, but I am thinking about returning it.",2.0
"While this cover does look nice and holds a bible and other papers/pens well, it's quality is just not there.  The zipper strap didn't last too long but that wasn't a huge deal.  Then just this weekend, the handle strap broke on one end.  Now the cover looks terrible and is not easy to carry.  This did not last long at all.",2.0
"Says leather bound, no leather only vinyl and cheap plastic lining.",2.0
Well made but bulky and far to large for my bible,2.0
"thought it was a good quality bible cover, but after 1 year the handle ripped off,  Not at the stitching, but the material itself frayed.  I thought it should last longer than a year",2.0
"enormous, bulky, returned it",2.0
"The cover looks great, but is a little small.  The bible is too wide for the cover to fit right.  The bible has to lay inside without tucking in the sides on the cover.  Even after measuring the bible, itself, before ordering it, the cover is just to small. I was very disappointed..",2.0
Looks great.  Broke in 1 week.,2.0
"Price was there but quality is less than aduequate.  Should have saved up for a higher quality genuine leather one.  However, it will work...may have to replace the zipper tab like I did.",2.0
Only have had this several month and the handle has already broke.  Don't waste your money,2.0
"About 15 months ago I bought a MacArthur Study Bible and this cover to protect it.  I really liked the size and style and the ""bomber jacket"" look.  It was more than roomy enough for the Bible and all the stuff that collects in an all occasion Bible.

After using it a few times weekly for about six months one end of the handle tore lose.  The stitching at the base of the handle loop acted like the dotted line on tear off paper products. The particular line of stitching is decorative and is unnecessary for the function of the cover.  I glued it back together and it lasted several more months and the other end let go which caused the repair to also fail leaving me holding the handle and the Bible, well protected mind you, laying on the ground.

It looks great, is roomy, protects a Bible well, but it has that one serious design flaw.  If you buy it, don't hold it by the handle, it is sure to eventually fail.",2.0
The zipper pulls broke and fell off after less than a week.  The product is exceptionally large (and i have a large Bible) but not what I would choose a second time.,2.0
My bible is  9.5 x 6.6 x 1.4 inches will it fit?,2.0
The size of the cover was much larger than an average children's Bible.  This item is also NOT microfiber.  It is actually more of a vinyl.,2.0
"After only a couple days of use the inside started tearing.  We've returned it for a replacement.  We'll see how the replacement works out.

Update 10/6/2013-got a replacement shortly after and it has held up much better.",2.0
"I really like the picture and was very disappointed that the item does not look the same.
The item looks really cheap and not as glossy as the picture.

I am very disappointed.",2.0
"Even though this product was described as Reptile Leather, it obviously is not.  The handles have cracked after one year's use.  It is not even used on a daily basis because I remove the Bible from its cover when I am not taking it to church on Sundays and Wednesdays, the handles have cracked on the inside.  It is a very inferior handle made of a product that  is not durable.  Not recommended, even though it looks very nice when you get it.  Save your money and just buy a fake leather one that you can replace every year.",2.0
Bought for gift and too small for the size bible. It's really pretty tho.. No room to carry a notebook.,2.0
Pretty but not functional. This is nothing more than a bible cover. There is no pocket on the inside to even store a pen! Would not recommend! A waste of money! A paper bag could be fitted to serve the same purpose!,2.0
"This looks and feels very cheap, the handles do feel sturdy though..  I should return it.  My old one was imitation prayer too, but much sturdier.  I truly regret purchasing this item.",2.0
"I purchased this to safeguard my NIV large print study bible.  It does not fit.  I should have checked it sooner, as now I am outside of the return date.
Hope this helps others who are considering it.",2.0
Cover is nice looking but expensive for the quality. Picture is prettier than item.,2.0
It was way too small for my Zondervan Study Bible - I had to return it.,2.0
Was not leather as advertised.,2.0
I was disappointed with the quality.,2.0
"The Bible cover does not look as good as the picture, What do I expect for the price. The second week the handle broke and I cannot fix it. I would have sent it back but it would cost more to return that what I paid for it. Very Cheap looking! I would not recommend anyone to purchase this item",2.0
Looking at the product it looks like a sturdy bible case. It fits my study bible well however after having it for a little over 2 months the stap started to rip from the seam. I had to take my bible out and put the cover down.,2.0
"Love the cover and will use it on another bible that I have. However, this cover does not fit the large print bible that it is featured with as a package. Please review this and correct the size. I now have to purchase an additional cover that will fit the large print bible. This is most unfortunate and inappropriate. Please correct this issue.",2.0
coming apart,2.0
"I had this same bible cover in lime green and it wore out after about 10 yrs. I decided to get another one, this one is cheaply made.  The material is nothing like my green one.  Definitely disappointed.  The color is beautiful...",2.0
"OK cover, definitely does not fit the Zondervan NIV large print study bible as the description claimed.  Had to return it.",2.0
"Quality is excellent but to small for my study bible. In must struggle zipping it up each time.  Needs to be a little bigger then it would be perfect.  Not sure who I need to contact with this problem but I need a bible cover that fits,  please give me feedback on a Bible cover that fits.  Please if. U Say it fits it needs to fit.  I am disabled or I would have sent it back.  Please make it right.",2.0
This looks lovely.  I didn't buy it.  I'm stuck at the incongruency of a reptile BIble cover.,2.0
Dosen't have outside pockets for storing programs,2.0
"I knew it was going to have ""light wear"" but this book feel apart almost immediately and I'm afraid I'm going to loose pages",2.0
"this book is dull as heck sometimes, but I suppose it's important to read important things by important people. I only bought this book because it was a required textbook for a class. THE 9TH EDITION IS NOT THE SAME AS THE 10TH!!!!",2.0
large an expensive.  rent instead,2.0
Some of the chapters in the book were missing and my daughter had trouble finishing her assignment.  I don't think I would buy another used book again.,2.0
"I like this book and enjoy reading it. However as I approached half of the book, i realized that about the whole section 5 is missing. I wrote to the seller and heard nothing from them now. I am talking about more than 100 pages missing and no one has gotten back to me!!! Seriously!!! Amazon certainly has to keep close eyes to this kind of sellers. What a shame.....",2.0
Bought this for class. It worked well. The professor could have chosen a better book. It is well-written in an easy manner with explanations at the bottom of some words. There are better books for literature. Glad to have bought this product and recommend this. @eplusq,2.0
"This book arrived in less than a week. Thank You, Amazon!! Great service, again! Taking a Lit. course for college and this is the book they chose for us to ""study"".(?) One of the reviews, here, by Patricia did an excellent job.
The books author, Micheal Meyers, has tried to introduce the various literary forms using authors that will galvanize a VERY liberalistic agenda. The stories exemplify, portray; human tragedy, racism, moral decay, selfish impetance, and blasphemously raw vulgarities that SHOULD NOT be patronized by educational institutions for higher learning. The subject matter for many of the stories collected for this text, capitalize on pervertual sexualisms, eroticisms, boy-love, murder, and a disdain for Godliness and moral responsibilties.
A better ""literary education"" could ONLY come from reading the restroom walls of a penitentiary or a filthy truck stop!! Hence, this textbook ALMOST complies with the standard of, ""Digging in a trash can for a better education!""",2.0
"My least favorite literature book of all time. We barely used this, and for a good reason; its terrible.",2.0
"this book is in horrible conditions marked all over the place, and the pages are ripped the spine is falling apart and corners are bent.",2.0
"We've used this book for three years to teach college business communications, but it may be time to hunt another book. The book is too expensive at $100.  Also, the publisher has issued three new editions in the past three years.  That makes it impossible for students to re-sale used books and is frustrating to students and instructors.  If the book were a better value, we probably would continue to use it; as it is, we can find something cheaper for our students.",2.0
"I used both the previous edition and current edition of this text to teach college students.  Both editions were full of errors and contradictory statements.  In particular, you cannot rely on the instructor materials- there are many test questions that have answers that are contradicted in the text.  Also, the grammar exercises are too difficult for an introductory text- they test students on advanced grammar concepts that are not even covered by the book!  There is a grammar reference section at the end of the text but it does not cover the majority of concepts tested in the end-of-chapter grammar exercises. So, my students were continually frustrated.  Many of the examples in the book are also very strange- for example, instead of PowerPoint, they speak of ""computer generated slides"".",2.0
Not what I expected,2.0
"I loved how much this came with,  but it was very flimsy so I ended up spending a whole afternoon covering it with contact paper and adding velcro dots. It took up half of the wall when I was done, and the pieces got ruined easily. When we moved to a new home I didn't want to bother with it, so I threw it away and bought the much smaller, much more durable, magnetic one by Melissa and Doug.  Not worth the small savings.",2.0
"So I should have read reviews: I saw an overall high rating so I thought this would be great!

THINK AGAIN!

It's terrible; very flimsy and doesn't meet my standards of even decent. I bought a couple posters at the Dollar Store (2 for $1) that were of better paper quality than this item. It's very very flimsy and wouldn't last in my opinion. I homeschool and bough this thinking I would save $5 from buying this vs an actual pocket calendar... PAY THE EXTRA 5 bucks. Trust me!

I ended up buying stuff to laminate this thing and ended up paying far more than the difference to laminate than to just get the actual pocket calendar. I would not buy this again, ever!

It doesn't have a 'today' marker for the calendar and also doesn't include simple holidays like Mother's/Father's Day but does have grandparents day... very odd!

I typically can see the good in most but this isn't something I am happy with. Also if you didn't laminate and didn't want to post with a million tacks it would fall to pieces with tape or sticky tack. It's not real big but too big to fit on a regular (big walmart size) cork board....

too much work to keep this looking decent let alone expecting it to last. Buy the pocket calendar and be done with it with less headache.",2.0
"This is not coated in plastic as the description indicates.  It is very thin cardboard.  It is not a durable product and therefore I don't believe very useful for use around children.  I also thought there would be some way to attach the numbers, days, etc. and there is not.  I guess you would need to laminate this and then attach something to the backs to make them stick to a board (which again is not included).  It is just a bunch of punch outs, including the calendar portion which is in two pieces.",2.0
I would like this if it did not arrive bent and torn. Torn right where it says Today's weather. Not packaged well. Very disappointing.,2.0
I was under the impression this would come put together or at least have the required parts.  It requires a brad to attach the arrow.  Since these aren't something I normally keep around I will have to purchase these.  Typically they do not come in packs of 1 so likely I will be purchasing a pack.  Just one more thing to do for an already busy parent.,2.0
Cannot read stories well. The text is too small and when held sideways it cuts off the book. It's very annoying and I wouldn't spend my money on it again.,2.0
The quality or substance of the material is dense.,2.0
"I was fool for the picture on thinking this was going to be a nice hardcover book but no, is like a magazine.",2.0
was picked out by a 3-yr old....just fine,2.0
Way too expensive for what it is.,2.0
This book isn't what I thought it would be.  It only has a few pages.  Disappointed.,2.0
Book arrived ripped back cover,2.0
"I gave this book 2 stars simply because it is a cute book about trains that my 2 year old son seems to enjoy.  However, the dinosaur is supposed to be a model headed to a museum then the dinosaur seems to be alive.  I was confused, my son just seemed happy to see a train and a dinosaur together.  Also, it is a little boring.",2.0
"The calendar will be alright after i get it laminated, but the calendar came in two pieces!  i have to tape it together and try to get it to stay together while i laminate it.",2.0
Not what I expected- this product is meant to be installed with tacks- there is no double stick backing and each piece is separate. Not usable for my daughters pay classroom environment.,2.0
They are just ok. They can break easily since it is made out of paper on stick. My daughter likes to play with it when she plays teacher,2.0
"This is a great concept for any classroom, however it is a very flimsy product.  The least they could have done was laminate the thin cardboard signs and use a longer more durable holder.  These could fall apart and tear with the least amount of use especially in the younger classrooms.  Improve durability and it would be a great product.",2.0
"The songs are clever, but many of the ditties do not repeat the given letter's sound  frequently enough.  Also, the singing is so super fast, that the theme / lesson is probably completely lost in the blur.  As an adult, just listening in, I had trouble hearing what the singers were singing, so I could tell a child would also miss a great deal of the potential.  Lastly, the songs are very short, and only sung through twice.  A two-second introduction to the sound the child was supposed to listen for, might mean the idea 'sticks'.  Glad other people were impressed.  I am an experienced mom, and have taught our other five children to read. Can not say this book and CD set is a useful tool.",2.0
Was a bit disappointed. It's especially difficult to remove the dry race marker from the board. If you buy it make sure you erase any writing immediately. Otherwise the board remains stained.,2.0
Used dry erase marker on it once and it will not wipe off completely. Disappointed in this purchase. Magnetic letters stick on well.,2.0
It breaks easy. My little boy broke right away.,2.0
"When we first got this easel, I really liked it! It was so compact and easy to move around, which is a relief when you live in a small home filled to the brim with kids toys! As opposed to most large easels that require large amounts of floor space even when not in use, I really loved that this one could be folded up into a small size and stored away in an instant. However... within 3 months of receiving it, this product was literally falling apart at the seams. Now normally when a baby toy falls apart after a few months of use, I think ""well, yes, that's why I buy inexpensive toys - kids break them, duh!"" - except, my son was only 9 months old when this broke beyond repair, and had never physically manipulated this product at all! The only us this easel had gotten was from me taking it out about once a week and showing him some magnets while he gazed at it with interest before we fairly quickly moved on to the next activity, at which point I'd fold it up as directed and put it away until next week. Yet every time I folded up and unfolded this easel I noticed the seams were becoming flimsier and flimsier, the boards were seemingly tearing apart... but I still never expected to open it up one afternoon just to see one board finally break free and fall to the ground! All of this from an adult gently using this product for a few minutes, once a week? Yeah, in that case it was pretty disappointing!

I must add that I love leaving reviews here as reading others' reviews helps me so much and I try to give back the same way. And maybe I'm just a really positive person in general, or perhaps I've just had good luck, but the fact remains that I virtually NEVER leave negative reviews for products, ever. I've written hundreds  of reviews here on Amazon and am quite sure this is only the 5th product, if that, that I've given less than 3 stars. I still can't bring myself to give it only 1 star as it WASN'T expensive, so I don't expect that much by way of quality and am not  exactly HORRIFIED that it fell apart, but I am certainly surprised that a few months of occasionally opening up, briefly using, and then properly storing away this little easel was enough to just... destroy it. Bizarre! And since I only owned one of these, I didn't try buying a second, I can't say with certainty that mine wasn't a rare defective one as there are certainly plenty of positive reviews on here... but I still wanted to share my experience because I know that many times people leave reviews after just receiving a product, or certainly within a few weeks of using it, and may not update those reviews later on. So perhaps if more reviews were left after several months of owning and using the product, there would be more experiences like mine... all I know for sure is that I try to be very reasonable with my expectations, and nothing short of a piece completely falling apart after gentle use would cause me to leave a negative review, so to anyone who's looking for an easel that will last them a long time, this may not be the one for you! However, if you just need this for a short period of time and don't want to shell out a fortune for it than this might meed your needs just fine. I do hope this review helps others make an informed choice! - Amy",2.0
Magnetic part is fine. Does not work as dry erase board.,2.0
I thought this would be great for my small group but it doesn't erase well and always leaves marker behind.,2.0
Not what I had expected for quality. It is very hard to erase white board markers off of it. Making it almost unusable.,2.0
Doesn't clean very well.,2.0
"The description  stated the writing surface was 12""32"".  The package states the true size 12.5""16"".  It is sturdy and magnetic so I am going to see if I can make it work for me. If not, I'm sending it back.",2.0
Every marker stains this board. I have to scrub it clean every day.,2.0
"I bought this but rarely use it because it doesn't erase. It does stand up easily, is magnetic, and is easy to store.",2.0
"I do not recommend this product. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because it actually does hold magnets. It's VERY small and my 2 year old is unable to use it effectively. I should have sent it back. Again, not recommended.",2.0
"I opened the package and was very excited to have this for my daycare. We learned about lions that day and I drew a picture of a lion on the board, letting the kids take guesses at what animal I was drawing as I went along. After finishing, I left my picture on the board for the remainder of the day. 5hrs later, after the kids left, I tried washing the picture off the board. First I used the Expo Eraser and no luck at all. Then I tried the Expo Dry Eraser Board cleaner and that didn't work either. Then I tried an alcohol pad and that didn't work either. My picture was stained on the board and there was no getting it off. I contacted Amazon and was given a full refund, after returning the product. Don't waste your money. Buy an Expo board... This is meant for magnets and definitely not as a dry erase board.

PS. I used Expo Dry Erase Markers.",2.0
"From the pictures, it looks like a decent size easel. It was my mistake that I didn't pay attention to the measurements. It's smaller than what I had expected and you should pay attention to the measurements.",2.0
"This was a textbook, so it was required.  I had no problem with the content, but I bought this as  Kindle edition, and it stopped working just about three weeks after I bought it.  I was never able to get it resolved, but I was able to download it to my computer using the Kindle App, so it wasn't a total loss, but I was disappointed not to have the mobility of having it on my Kindle.",2.0

great quality notebook for price, compared to problems with cheap notebooks.",2.0

Little small,2.0
"It was very pretty but very, very tiny. You can't write much in it...",2.0
Much smaller than I thought.  Not worth $2.  Pages are not lined and quality is cheap.  Disappointed.  Should have trusted other reviews that said it is smaller than you think.  Should have got out a ruler and measured - not just thought in my mind what the measurements were.,2.0
good,2.0
it is very very small - the size of a postcard,2.0
Too small,2.0
"The product has cute butterflies on it, but that is all it has going for it in my opinion. It is very small, smaller than expected. It is also blank pages and not writing pages. Its cute but It isn't something I would buy again for the price. If the price was lower than I would say it was worth it but I'm going to stick to it not being worth $2 mainly because of the size.

I'm not able to use it for what I had planned to so its disappointing it that factor. My seven year old is going to use it to color, and draw and write so its great for him and probably other children his age.",2.0
Smaller than expected and very cheaply made. Pages are very thin and binding is coming apart. Don't waste your money.,2.0

It is a pretty little notebook. It's a nice size. It's easy to fit in your purse. Makes a nice little gift.,2.0
I guess I should have read the reviews better. It's not a notebook...should be called a note pad..It's tiny! And the price is printed on the back. Lame,2.0
"I expected an actual notebook.  Instead this was a small address book sized, no lined pad of paper.  Good for jotting down a number or something, but not at all what i had expected.  It was on clearence so not the worst $1.50 I ever spent. lol.  pretty though.",2.0
"It is small and has no lined pages,and does not have very much paper. I got it for school and plan on not being able to use it.",2.0

"THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND UP FRONT! The Kindle version does not have page numbers, so if you are a student, like me, who is intending to use this book for a course and needs to read certain pages, this book will definitely not work for you.  I was extremely discouraged when I purchased this on rental only to discover I could never keep track of where my classmates were reading.

Aside from that, the content is good and Goldstein does a stand-up job writing about the intricacies of sensation and perception.  I definitely recommend the text, just not the Kindle format!",2.0
"Dear Sir or Maam,
I found the work of this book to be perplexing and difficult to understand.  While I am happy with the supplemental web-site, which holds most aspects of the CD-ROM, I am not very happy with the way that the author presents the material.  In fact, I find the readings of this book so frustrating that I often want to scream expletives or cry myself to sleep.

No, I am not just saying this to be mean spirited.  I would happily pay another 60 dollars if the author would lead his paragraphs with 1) a subject definition 2) link the same principle in the next sentence and 3) end with a conclusion.  The language might flow better by placing sentence subjects near an action verb.  I don't want to wait 20 lines to find out what the ""study"" ... ... ... .... ... ... ... ""finds.""

I found this book to be incredibly obtuse and highly technical, and I study economics.  In other words, I am quite used to reading the most dense stuff imaginable.  As you might be able to tell from my profile, this is my first bad book review on Amazon.  Save your money, and your students money by not ordering this book.

(Lastly, an apology to the author if he reads this.  Dr. Goldstein should blame his editors, not some idiot like me on Amazon.  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.  Your CD-ROM and website are very nice.)
~Bill",2.0
"Okay so I ordered the book from Amazon and it shipped from Amazon, not some second company. The book arrives...NO CD!!! I am so upset. I ordered this book from Amazon for the pure reason that it was cheaper and now I don't know what I'm going to do. I have to have the CD for my course. I have never had any other problems but this one is HUGE!!!",2.0
The map came crumpled,2.0
"Hard to read - not enough contrast between print and state colors on the map. Colors of states are bland. Very few roads identified. Paper quality okay. Not possible to plan any cross-country or multi-state driving with this. Product was packaged well. If you're just looking for the basics, this will work fine.",2.0
It wasn't what I really wanted. It is a good map but didn't have the info I was looking for.,2.0

It's whatever,2.0
"Got it for my little 6 years old kid. He was very exited about getting a big map! And I was happy with it too. But some time after when I looked at it closer (didn't really payed much attention before) noticed that some geographic names are not correct or spelled wrong! The map isn't bad but, guys, you should really look closer and pay more attention before printing anything that claims to be a world map...",2.0
It is a very big map. But it is also very weak. Will tear when unfolding if u are not extremely delicate. I expected that map to b a lil stronger. Its good for putting it on a wall. Just keep away from from children. I would definitely not purchase this again or recommend it.,2.0
"The actual map was exactly what I was looking for, however it was rolled so tightly that there were creases across the entire thing.  Then it was dented on the ends and in the middle which caused even more creases.  Was not happy, ended up sending back because I could not get the lines out.",2.0
"Came with a crease and slightly damaged.

Very cheap paper.",2.0
We were hoping for a map that had the freeway/highways on it.,2.0
The product was what I was looking for but when it came to me it was folded in the middle which ruined the center of my map. Not worth the shipping cost to have it replaced.,2.0
"I was expecting thicker paper than this map is, but it will serve its purpose.  Also, the packaging was very disappointing, and this is the first time I've ever said that about Amazon! But this map was rolled & packaged then it was shipped in a tall, rectangular box. However the box wasn't tall enough, so the map had to be bent to fit. The map is still serving our needs here, but it isn't what I'm used to from Amazon.",2.0
"It is a nice map as it is laminated and colorful.  But, as others have mentioned, it comes rolled up with creases in it.",2.0
"Our Dear Leader, President Obama, the smartest man ever in all of history according to the media (and why would they lie?) said we have 57 states; this map only shows 50 yet purports to completely represent the current composition of the United States. Obviously Amazon is selling an old map as current in order to get rid of outdated merchandise.

I would also point out that this map shows Jacksonville, FL; Savannah, GA and Charleston, SC on the Atlantic Ocean! Not only is the map outdated, it's defective! President Obama (see above, smartest man etc) says these ports are in the Gulf of Mexico, and he should know because he's super-duper, extra smart, millions of Kool-Aid drinking political naifs agree.

Stupid Amazon, they probably think that the Austrians speak German!",2.0
"First of all, this appears to be the exact same map as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rand-McNally-U-S-A-Wall-Map/dp/0528002279/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rand McNally U.S.A Wall Map</a>.  However, the linked map is only $5.95 (and still available for free shipping with prime).  It's pretty infuriating when Amazon lists two identical products, shipped from the same place (Amazon), at very different prices.

My biggest gripe, however, is this: I searched ""US Road Map"" to find this map.  I need a map to hang on the wall and trace routes with pins and strings.  The roads on this map are extremely faint... almost the same color as the background.  Seriously.  You can BARELY see the roads.

After receiving this sub par map, I have since re-searched and hope that the Michelin map (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michelin-Map-USA-Political-14761-p-Rolled-Maps-Wall-Michelin/dp/2061011306/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michelin Map USA Political  14761  (p, Rolled) (Maps/Wall (Michelin))</a>) or perhaps the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/United-States-Executive-Wall-Map-tubed/dp/0792293207/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">United States Executive Wall Map (tubed)</a>&nbsp;will have better representation of US roads and highways.

Since it's not really cost effective to return the map (shipping is more than the ten dollar purchase price), I would burn the map in frustration, but it is lightly coated in plastic --not thick enough to prevent creases and wrinkles, but thick enough to create toxic smoke.

=========Further complaints about Amazon (so not necessarily complaints about the product)

On top of this, the map was shipped in a HUGE rectangular box.  Again and again amazon customers complain about Amazon's horrible packing methods... yet they continue to do this!  Not only THAT, but I also ordered two boxes of tacks at the exact same time.  ALL THREE arrived in separate (HUGE) boxes!!!",2.0
"The map itself is quite nice, which is the only thing keeping me from giving this a one-star rating.  Two things really stand out, and most other reviewers have already noted these:

- this product is shipped in an envelope, not a cardboard tube like the world map from swiftmap that I ordered (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006I59E8/ref=oss_product).  Officemap really needs to fix this because my map arrived with all sorts of crinkles in it.  If it weren't such a hassle, I would return the map.

- the lamination is not true lamination -- it's more like what you get when you buy inexpensive glossy photo paper for your inkjet printer, if not thinner.  I won't be using any dry-erase markers on this map unless I cover it with plexiglass or some other laminate.",2.0
"Swiftmap sent us their map which is quite different from Rand McNally maps. It is not as brightly colored, sharp or comprehensive in information (Barbados missing, significant cities not shown, ocean topography shown but land topography poor) Ironically, we found the Rand McNally World map we wanted at a local office supply store for $3 less than the Swiftmap knock-off. To Swiftmap's credit, they did refund us without any hassles.",2.0
"I bought this map so that I could track all the places that I have been. After getting it mounted on foam board, laminated and framed, I was very surprised that when I went to insert a map tack into Barbados, there was no Barbados on the map. Then, I realised that other islands were also missing. Given the size of the map and the fact that other even smaller islands were included, I was most disappointed!

The seller did however dispatch the product very quickly and in a sturdy canister.",2.0
"I bought a similar Rand McNally ""classic edition"" map of the U.S. from a local office supply store.  It looked really nice, so I ordered this map of the world.  The one I received looks like an ink jet printout from an engineering roll printer on cheaper paper.  It's not horrible, but it's not as attractive as the U.S. map I bought from a local office supply store.",2.0
Map was really wrinkled when I received it. Otherwise everything was ok.,2.0
"Buy it locally, the map arrived damaged and it doesn't look like there is anything you can do about it.  Oh well, lesson learned",2.0
"This is not a folded map, but it arrives with 20 folds in it since it is rolled and put in a saran wrap sleeve. Once it is stacked in between boxes in shipping, that causes a crease every 2"" all the way across the map. The lamination is not what one expects. It can still be torn easily, as mine arrived with a small chunk notched out of the top border. I bought a cheaper poster, and it came in a cardboard tube. This product is a disappointment.",2.0
The map was not protected it came bent and wrinkled. I was not pleased with its condition I feel the map should have had casing.,2.0
"I did not like the coloring - I thought the map in general and particularly the Middle East looked 'washed out'.
I was very disappointed.
I had purchased another wall map from Rand McNally a few months ago and it was much, much better. I had expected the same when I ordered again - very disappointing.",2.0
"The map itself is fine, especially given the price. The ""lamination"" is a thin, waxy coating that hardly qualifies. But no matter.

Main problem: the map is delivered in a flimsy, plain plastic bag--not even a sheath or pliable paper tube. The map was badly creased and dented on delivery, so it went back promptly. The shipping oversight here baffles me, and the UPS guys who picked the map up for return looked at me incredulously when I tried to convince them that it was indeed the original packaging.",2.0
I purchased the map quite sometime ago and made the mistake not to check it thoroughly.  There was damage to the laminate in the center and it is still sitting in a closet waiting for possible repair.,2.0
"I was very excited for this product to come and today when I received it the whole middle was bent. This created a huge crease down the middle of the map which made it look used and tacky. It should have been shipped in a more stable box to prevent this from happening. Also for the price that you pay, it doesn't give you the quality that I was expecting.",2.0
The laminate matrial was thin and very easily wrinkled. It is also not very durable. This is not the quality i expected.,2.0
"This poster is glossed, not laminated and will definitely not pass pass the test of time in a class room...",2.0
"The map arrived rolled up. That would have been fine it wasn't also totally smashed. The end result was a map that was all rippled and, had I actually needed it for more than one night, I would have returned it. Not sure who's bright idea it was to roll a map without using a tube on the inside or the outside.",2.0
"The map is the size that they said. But it's not the greatest quality. It was rolled up but someone must hAve squashed it cause it has creases in it that won't come out so it won't lay flat. Also it says it comes with hangers and there are only two and they are cheap plastic and won't hold it up.

On the better side. The colors are nice and portrays the world well.",2.0
"Well the map is great, but it came in a big box, that the delivery company didn't bother to care about, so it was folded and bent and wrinkled. I almost felt like returning it but i am going out of the country too soon.",2.0
"Upon receiving this item, I was sadly impressed at how flimsy the paper and lamination were.  It seemed that even a gentle touch put a visible crease in the map.  I liked the graphics (colors, etc.) but, unless hanging it on a wall permanently, regular use of this map would wear it out way to soon for me.",2.0
I read the reviews and thought that with all of the comments Amazon would have improved shipping of this map... but NO they HAVE NOT! My map arrived in a triangular package with multiple creases as others have mentioned (July 2009). Based on other comments I likely won't return it just to wait for another creased map.... but SHAME ON YOU Amazon! Usually I'm so pleased with your service. This is a disappointment.,2.0
"The quality of the map is fine, however the clamps that hold the map up are not very good.  It keeps falling of the wall.  Finally I just threw away the hangers and nailed it straight to the wall.",2.0
Clicked the wrong star on the last review...this is a good map!  Good size and the price is right.  Good enough for erasable markers.,2.0
Tears easily! Not as big as what I thought it'd be in terms of actually being able to see & read the cities.,2.0
The map was not rolled correctly and it has folds in some places.,2.0
The quality of the map is fine.,2.0
Really flimsy lamination,2.0
If you can find this at a local retailer get it there.  Otherwise it will arrive in a plastic bag all creased and bent.  This supplier seriously needs to invest in those plan tubes that are more rigid and offer more protection.  Will not be buying from them again.,2.0
"this map may be good enough for a second grade class room, but it is unattractive and has very little detail other than some silly little icons (like penguins at the South pole). Very disappointing.",2.0
"The pictures provided for the months and the special days are great, they are realistic and pretty. The pocket chart is great for primary classrooms as well. Problem was that it was way late (received it DAYS before school started) and it was bent and broken. The box was hardly recognizable! I couldn't return it and have what could have been a beautiful calendar but instead is bent and looks used :(",2.0
"The chart is fine, but the cards are pretty specific and don't portray things that most preschool classes do often.",2.0
overpriced; too narrow of pockets,2.0
This pocket chart does not have a label holder. It is made of a material that crinkles.,2.0
Extremely flimsy.,2.0
I ordered this item. Received an email notification about a week later that the item is no longer available and order will not be filled. Why is it still listed for sale?,2.0
"Not always wide enough to fit what I want to put, or deep enough pockets for visually help to new readers...",2.0
Not as pictured seller sends random things and thinks can get awaybwith it,2.0
"For this price, I was expecting the pocket chart too! Note: schedule cards only, pocket chart sold separately. Would not recommend.",2.0
I had another counting caddy and liked it so much better than this one.  Everything is great other than the low clear slot for the numbers that are changed daily.  I would also suggest to run the numbers through the laminator since they are very thin.,2.0
GOOD QUALITY BUT IT'S TOO SMALL IT IS LIKE THE HALF OF AN ANCHOR CHART. YOU MAY ONLY USE IT FOR  THE WALL OF YOUR TEACHER LED GROUP BECAUSE IS TOO SMALL.,2.0
"It gets the job done but is thin and flimsy. Like most I've found it isn't a very good quality. I've recently found some that are teacher created pocket charts here on Amazon that even come in colors and designed cute that will eventually replace all of my pocket charts but for now this will have to do. I recommend you spend the extra $10 and purchase those to begin with but if your tight on money this one is ok. The blue part is as thin as paper. It crinkles every time you touch it. If you bump into it the cards get all messed up or worse start falling out. The clear slots are thin. I wanted this to use for sight words instead of making a word wall this year but I can only add about 4 3x5 cards before the clear part starts sagging and hanging open. It's a big pocket chart which is the reason I purchased it but if I can't use the entire thing because it will not hold more than a few cards then the size is of no benefit. So, it's just usable enough to keep from trashing it but I recommend finding a stronger, more durable pocket chart.",2.0
need one without rods inside so I can put it in a suitcase,2.0
I failed to consider the measurements when I purchased this and it is way too big for my playroom. I will be giving it to my church for a sunday school room.,2.0
Should be only $2 too expensive for quality,2.0
"This poster is colorful and appropriate for all ages. It came damaged.  The lamination is only on one side and clearly not of high quality.  The poster does not feel any thicker than another poster I purchased without lamination.  I will be returning this product for it is not work what I paid.  With its cost, I was thinking the poster would have had a very good quality lamination- this poster is not worth more than $2.50.  Even had it not come damaged, I would return it.",2.0
"We ordered two sets to make a border in our sons room where we have the two different colors of paint meeting. These are not symmetrical, every 2 foot strip is aligned slightly different. Also, there is no adhesive back or wallpaper style paper. They are basically just strips of construction paper with a pattern on them. We used border glue from home depot but once we stuck them down we could not adjust them or they would rip.

We did end up with a border, but after having to spend more money on glue and materials, it still did not turn out as well as a wallpaper strip border. The description is very vague.

These might be useful if you are going to make some abstract patterns and not going to line them up end to end, and also if you intend to tape or staple them to the wall. Otherwise, keep looking.",2.0
"The product is okay,but the description of the product is not. It's my own fault for not reading the description part correctly,but another reviewer mentioned the same thing. This product has three sets of dates,not two as it states directly under the picture. I THOUGHT the months of the year cards were included.(Shows them in the picture.) I Just checked again,and the description says,TWO COLORED SETS of DATES.So that would be 62 pieces,and there are supposed to be over 100 pieces. I figured the rest were the ""add ons"" (their words)After all,it comes with over 100 pieces,so the rest must be days of the week and months of the year(Pictured in set.)  Nope...there are three sets of numbers/dates. NO days of the week. NO months of the year. So READ CAREFULLY.I think Scholastic should add that the months of the year strips are not included. Phooey,I could have bought a few sets of numbers cheaper,plus the number cards are way too big for what I wanted. Now I still have to buy smaller numbers,and months of the year strips. The product is okay,but you have to cut each number block out with scissors. Not looking forward to that. Packaging and delivery were excellent,however.",2.0
"You only get the cards, which I didn't realize when I purchased it. But on top of the fact that your only paying for the cards they don't even come perforated... All around I wouldn't order this product.",2.0
"Was not happy with this item.  I returned it. Would not buy it again!  Was not what I wanted, would have been good if the numbers came with it.",2.0
"I didn't read the reviews, I was shopping for something specific (the pocket chart) and ended up with nothing but calendar date numbers that I have to cut apart myself. :(

I gave 2 stars for the quality of the numbers and the fact that you get 3 sets in different colors.

I deducted one for the price for what you get, deducted one for misleading listing and deducted one for the fact that you have to cut them apart yourself.

Don't waste your money. I'll keep them as our pocket calendar numbers are getting kinda ragged and it'd not be worth it to send them back...but it was not what I expected according to the listing.",2.0
I was also surprised that the set did not include the actual pocket chart. I would have made a different purchase had I realized that...,2.0
you only get the cards.,2.0
"not good ,, did not like the information given it was elusive.",2.0
I too was unhappy when I received this product. I wasn't expecting the pocket chart because the price was too low to include it all. However I was expecting labeled cards. When I received BLANK very small cards I wanted to return. Not the best schedule card out there but it will work with some extra effort.,2.0
"Didn't realize that the actual pocket chart was not included....also, should come with illustrations for young students or students with special needs",2.0
I don't really like it. very small. its hard to find folder and can't really see it. I still have in the envelop tell now.,2.0
"It is only the cards, NOT the pocket chart!  Why would I expect the picture to ONLY show the cards?!  If you are going to sell just the cards, but include a photo of the chart, could you please post a disclaimer?  Chart not included. FYI the cards look great, but I didn't need 3 sets, I needed 3 charts!!  I am giving this a rating of 3 stars because I felt I was misled, but IF anyone just wants the cards, it is fine.  And yes, once again, I neglected to read all the reviews.

Updated review:  The cards are blank; the photo is doubly misleading.  I changed my rating to 2 stars.",2.0
"I guess its fine enough if you want something to get by with/questionable quality.  When I received it I checked the package to make sure it was the one I ordered, technically by item number it is, however it is not as advertised, there are no dowels stitched into each pocket for extra durability. In fact, there are no dowels at all, and the material feels cheap, like once I hang it, and fill it, I don't know how long it'll last before ripping, and frankly, I don't want to take that chance.  There were at least two others I was looking at, but the amount of pockets, and the dowels and material for durability were this items bet selling points, for which it has failed to deliver.  I'm very disappointed and plan to go through the inconvenient process of returning it.",2.0
Nothing to hang it with,2.0
"Yes, quality is really poor. I like that there is a rod at the bottom and grommets at the top to hang on hooks. The quality though, is very flimsy. It feels cheapy and even sounds kinda crinkly when you unroll it. Not planning on lasting more than a few years, if that. I only purchased because I have no access to teacher stores in Hawaii and this included free shipping. Also, as another downside, they listed it $1.50 less a week later.",2.0
The pockets are crooked!! Boo!,2.0
Not sure what everyone is talking about when they say that this is such a great product.  I moved classrooms and needed to replace a pocket chart that I had left behind for the new teacher.  This purchase was a disappointment.  My old blue chart was thick and heavy weight.  This is thin and light - hardly worth the price paid.,2.0
No rhinestones on the shoe.,2.0
It's so cute.  Too bad it broke after falling on the ground. Poorly made ,2.0
Before I ordered this I was a carabiner guy.  I will continue to order carabiner type key chains. I thought I'd try something new. Bad decision. The hook loop on this is small and I have trouble hooking it to my belt loop when I'm in a hurry.,2.0
It is very small.  Don't waste your money,2.0
"I was surprised when I received these - if I had just seen them in a store on the shelf, I would have never paid so much for them.  This buy was a real mistake for the price.  The variety of cards is good, but a few of the images are not to my taste and will go unused.",2.0
Pen leaked in a day. And the refills didn't fit. Had to modify the pen slightly to fit a Parker refill. After the modification the pen is great. I just wish it was designed with standard pen refills.,2.0
It was tarnished and had oil or something on it.,2.0
Has fallen apart after 2 months of use but with the mission of this company who can be really mad at them?,2.0
"This did not work for me, not yet anyway.  I know because it was purchased over 2 months ago and every time I opened it I was overwhelmed.  So it sits on the shelf - reminding me I'm a woosie - every time I glance its way.  I needed to start with something much more simple and maybe work my way up to this journal.
On a road trip through Salida, CO I found a Journal called 2018 Daily Musings Journal - a creative logbook by a 'mountain mermaid' named Lisa F DeYoung, MountainMermaidStudios.com. This I can do.  However, I do not 'doodle' or 'depict my moods or activities' with drawings.  The words 'be creative' sends me into shivers.  But I do like the easy blocks with 7 days on 2 pages, I like the spiral binding, I like the whole month calendar in the front with the full moon marked each month.  Simple, Clean. Color me happy - cause this one I actually use.",2.0
Didn't even realize I spent nearly $40 for this?? A late night impulse buy that I definitely regret. The contents and ideas of habit building aren't bad but the graphic design on the pages is awful (would have been a deal breaker for me had I known) and every other page is the same exact worksheet.,2.0
"Way overpriced. I found only two things good about this thing.  The first phase was the most helpful. The second bit I liked was the daily accountability. The rest of the content, not so helpful. This journal is aimed more at corporate men than for everyone (which is what they would like you to think). Oh, are you not one of those? Congrats, you've already realized the biggest problem with this book. After all, only entrepreneurs wake up early and then head off to the office to conquer the world. Also a lot of their advice they keep repeating in different ways and then pretend like they haven't given it to you yet. It got old. Fast.  Some ""tips"" also would have made more sense for the first week or two than mid way through the book. Basically, a great gift for your obnoxiously arrogant nephew who's heading to silicon valley. As for me and my husband, we'll just buy Amazon's productivity planner for $25 next time. Other than helping you wake up earlier, it does the exact same thing and looks like you get more bang for your buck.",2.0
Too shallow in my opinion for any value over a blank journal. Note its really only an evening review.,2.0
"My main issue with this is that it only has 66 days worth of journal pages. I get the science aspect behind the number of days, but for the same price there are gratitude and planning journals with a full years worth of days.

Additionally, it's not much of a journal with reflection. You record your wake and sleep times, plan your next days routine, and record if anything ""magical"" happened in the current day. There is some reflection on the gratitude part, but expanding it to why was this moment ""magical"" would be a bit more engaging for me.

I plan to see it through to the end, but not because I think it's particularly useful, but because I paid 26 bucks for it...",2.0
"Out of the 100 postcards, there are about 15-20 that I'm actually interested in. Many of them are just boring. Not as good as I had hoped.",2.0
"This was a really disappointing box of postcards. I would not buy them again. They are nice and big, and they are loose in the box (that is, not bound in a book) but that's about all they have going for them.

"I bought this postcard box because I thought all 100 postcards would be unique and creative.

If you like his works then this item is perfect for you, but as for me, I couldn't care less. Over-sized cards are shiny and look sort of cheesy, the paintings (?) are simple and abstract. When I saw the package image with typed letters I thought this would be perfect for my collection, but I was wrong... the worse thing is that a friend of mine also bought this boring card box and sends those cards to me! I was so annoyed when she sent me a card with countless short black lines saying ""my dog's fur"" or something. Even I can draw that!",2.0
"I can't believe this.  I'm in college and don't want to spend money unless I have to.  And my teacher requires the class to buy theses i>clickers for in-class response questions.  Whatever happened to raising your hand?  Although it has the benefit of making people say ""I don't know"" when they really don't, it seems like a waste of $35 to me.  I've used it for a full semester and as a teaching aid, it is not worth $35, that's for sure.",2.0
"Would not recommend.

It would flash red and green at random when I clicked a button. I missed, at MOST, 4 classes (those were my fault, I forgot the clicker in my car). Clicker said I missed 8. I had no evidence that I brought it in those days, so my professor couldn't give me those points back.
Soooo the remote came with bad batteries. Fine. I change it out, and surprise! D button doesn't work. Clicker became useless, but luckily I had a very understanding professor who loaned me a clicker.",2.0
"The high cost of this product is not justified by how simple and featureless it is. There are far too many alternatives to this product that fulfill the same purpose, but better.

When I did use it on occasion, it appeared to work fine, so functionality-wise, it seems to do what it's supposed to do. But, the thing it's supposed to do just isn't worth the price.",2.0
The code was nearly impossible to read.,2.0
The clicker works fine but the code on the back was scratched off and it did not come with a slip of paper telling me it which wasnt't very handy. Luckily I was able to work out with my professor on the computer on which code was mine in her log in thing but it made it more difficult.,2.0

"My professor made us buy one of these and I don't believe it was worth it.  It has very limited functionality and, for the price, I don't think it adds much to the classroom experience.

Perhaps there's a teacher out there who has found a cunning use for this guy, but I'm hard pressed to believe that since it can do so little.  I think it's a sham to ask students to shell out for one of these on top of books and everything else we have to get for school.

I'm not giving it one star because, as a product, it does actually excel at its task.  I was able to answer the multiple choice quizzes we had in lecture.  My low rating is more because of its few capabilities and limited application in the classroom.",2.0
This was necessary for class. I hate this product and think any instructor who uses it could make better decisions in life. My D button quit working the first month.,2.0
"I received it in a torn up used package with the tape not even sealing it. Also it wasn't even wrapped up correctly inside the package. All you did was wrap the packaging slip around it and taped the directions for it. The clicker looks severely worn, nothing ""minimal"" about it, it looks like it was left in a wet environment and rusted over time, would not be too big of a deal if I didn't pay only $10 less than the original price for it.",2.0
"My iClicker works correctly, but the registration number on the back is worn away so that it is not readable. However, my instructor was able to resolve this problem. Also, the buttons sometimes make a sound that new clickers don't make. This leads me to believe that they are not in good condition either.",2.0

When looking at the product on-line the appearance of the product was that it was like the old type address books where you move a cursor to the letter on the address book etc.and look up a number,what is actually on the product is a PICTURE of an old style phone dial,my fault for assuming that it was an actual dial,i'm sure that I am not the only one who bought the product thinking that it was an actual dial.",2.0

This year however, I noticed that they removed all the Sunday comics, thereby reducing the calendar from 365 days to 313 days, obviously saving them money as they charge the same amount for a cheaper product. I wish that I had an alternative, it is so frustrating when companies think they can make more money by doing something like this. Shame on the publisher and manufacturer.",2.0
"My daughter loves ME's calenders, and this one is nice, but just not as good as her art in the past. The charm and coziness of her art is lost in these ""save the earth"" macro quotes bordering on preachy and political. Two quotes by Rachel Carson, really? I just think her art and style is better suited to smaller wonders that really create that awe of nature and think those types of illustrations would have been more effective. And I hate the quotations, not in and of themselves but the political context of them.",2.0
"I have bought the peanuts calendar for many years now and always loved this calendar and recommended it to my family and all my friends but this year for the first time I am disappointed. The face and body of Snoopy does not really look like Snoopy and also the faces of Charlie Brown, Linus, Sally do not look like themselves.
It looks like they fired everybody who was responsible for the calendar in the previous years...I still hope this is a fake calendar and the real calendar with Snoopy and Woodstock is somewhere out there...",2.0
"I have been a loyal daily reader of the Dilbert desktop calendar for many years now. My wife gets it for me every year and I look forward to it.

However this year some pointy-haired publishing boss decided it would be a great idea to cut the Sunday strips from the calendar. How utterly ironic.

""I want my unwarranted optimism back.""",2.0
"As quite a few others have mentioned, this calender is a disappointment and is very poorly constructed.

Mr. Adams and the publisher have decided to dismiss the loyal fans by removing the features that made the Dilbert calendars almost unique in the industry - separate pages for Saturday and Sunday.  Gone, now.

The decision to further cheapen the product by dropping the back-of-the page content that livened up the 2010 calendar is one more example of their disdain for the public that buys their calendar every year.

But the final insult is the drastically cheaper construction --  mine fell off the plastic stand when I pulled off the first page.  Glue and tape fixed it, but it shouldn't have been necessary to repair a new product.

Sorry, Mr. Adams.  You're creative and funny as ever, but you can keep your 2012 calendar - I won't be buying it.",2.0
"I have gotten the Dilbert calendar every year for at least 7-8 years if not longer.

Last year (2010)was the best.  Color pages, fun stuff on the back.  This year is a HUGE step backwards.  NO SUNDAY COMICS????  Those the hte best ones of the week, and they are completely eiminated.

I will still read it each day and it will bring a smile, but it is missing (IMO) the best comic of the week.  Is also missing the fun stuff on the back which I know is not needed but was still enjoyable.",2.0
"I have got the Dilbert day-to-day calendar every year for the last 5 years or so. This is the first year that Saturday and Sunday are combined, but the price is the same. This is 14% (or 52) fewer comics than last year. I find this very disappointing.",2.0
"I have to say, this is the first year I am disappointed with the Dilbert Calendar. First, the calendar arrived damaged. The glue had come loose and pages had fallen off. They had very cheap and poorly done manufacturing this year.  Beyond that, they took away the individual Sunday on the calendar. They combined Saturday and sunday on the same strip. So no where on the calendar do we get the Sunday 6 or 8 panel strips. It's all 3 panel dailies.  That sucks.  Paid the same price as last year for poor manufacturing and 52 less calendar pages. That is horrible.",2.0
I get this every year for Christmas and love it but as other reviewers mentioned the 2011 calendar combines the weekend days.  They cheated us out of 52 cartoons this year plus the double day is only a 3 panel cartoon.  The top binding also seems to be coming apart just from ripping off the cover.,2.0
"I love Dilbert!  But just like the Peanuts calendar this same publisher has removed 52 days of Sunday comics to reduce the calendar to 313 days for the same price as 365 last year. Shame on them, I wish that I had an alternative to buy the real 365 day version. And shame on Scott Adams for selling out to these guys.",2.0
"Losing the Sunday comic really puts a damper on the calendar.  When I had the Mondays, I really enjoyed the extra long Sunday comic to catch up on during my dreadful Mondays at the office.  To make it worse, there is nothing on the back.  While the Notes and the Checklists of things to buy were kind of lame, the games, cheesy jokes, and random facts gave a real good kick to jump start the work day.  Also, when I pulled it out of the box, the top cardboard part that the pages are glued to fell apart.  Is this a symbol of the bad economy?  I gave two stars because I still like the comics, but I am disappointed in the presentation this year.",2.0
I am very disappointed due to the 52 missing sundays. It must be the decision of the pointy haired boss to downsize the calendar.,2.0
"The Sunday double panel strip is gone; they're packing Saturday and Sunday together with just one cartoon.  ""Bah""; I'm going to be disappointed for the next few Mondays.  Also used to enjoy the little extras on the back of each of the 2010 pages.  Gone.

I'm going to look for a different calendar next year.  Probably be ""Non Sequiter"". Sorry, Wally...",2.0
"This calendar has been excellent over the years, but this year as other reviewers have said, it does not have the Sunday editions of the comic and also left out all the bonus stuff (puzzles, factoids, etc) from the previous years. All in all, a bit disappointing.",2.0
"We're gotten this version of the Dilbert calendar for several years. This year, the publisher decided to get cheap. Sundays are left out, with one daily strip serving for both Saturday and Sunday, a 14 percent reduction in the quantity of Dilberts -- assuming Sunday strip are only deemed equal in terms of quantity, despite being 2-3 times as long.",2.0
"Well, the pointy haired boss strikes again!
I really enjoyed the 2010 Dilbert day-to-day calendar. And it really was a page per day.
Now I have opened the 2011 new-and-improved calendar and it has 52 fewer pages! The Saturday and Sunday dates are combined AND the weekend comic is a three panel strip, not the eight panel Sunday comic like the 2010 calendar had. So the Andrews McMeel executives won't give up any of their bonus money but we have to settle for less product, printed in China to boot!
After reading other reviews here I'm now aware that Amazon has lumped all the calendar years together so we really don't get a clear ratings picture of this specific 2011 calendar but it looks like there are many more complaints about the current 2011 issue.
I'd call in a complaint to Andrews McMeel but Dogbert would put me on hold until I die of dehydration!",2.0
"Love the 7 minute book. I was unaware that the planner was only 3 months when I bought it. I don't want to waste my time re-writing the lists, notes and remaining year calendar each quarter.  Started creating my 2011 plan, realized it was 3 months and am on amazon finding something different.",2.0
"I was so excited to get this planner and try out the new system.  It comes with blank spaces for dates and days so you must fill that out.  That was daunting, but I sat down and got started.  However, the book is not very long.  I am a teacher and I prep one semester at a time, and there are not enough ""days"" for a semester.  Basically, the planner is a waste for me, and I only found this out after spending what seemed like along time writing the days and dates for each page.  I have not actually tried to use it, but I bet it is really good- for someone who can plan their schedule 2 months at a time.",2.0

The spiral blind is also of low quality.  If you try to flip through the pages, they easily get caught and rip.  The product is so cheap that it calls into the question the integrity of the author, who is clearly just trying to make a buck.",2.0
"I was looking forward to using this tool as a guide to kick start my college semester and work. Just like the book, it's too confusing and jumbled to know what to do. Mainly only talks about her life and not much on helping the customer.",2.0
"While this planner had some great ideas embodying the ""7-Minute Life"" planning concepts, and I did benefit a little from starting these pages, I just could not keep filling out a planner by hand.

It is impractical and difficult to use a planner that requires you to fill in every day/date, copy tasks and goals over and over again (this reminds me of the Franklin-Covey system, a bit). And then start all over again in three months!  It may be the breakthrough that some users need, but to me it was a tedious use of time; more restrictive than freeing.

I gave this to a friend who was very interested in the system, and returned to a favorite paper-based system, backed up by my iPhone.",2.0

"I bought this album when it was newly released on vinyl. I had the mono version and later got the album in stereo. I listened to it countless times on equipment ranging from low- to high-quality. I also owned the cassette version. My comments about the remastered version of this album apply to all the remastered Beatles albums I've heard.

I feel sorry for younger people who have never heard, and probably will never hear, these songs as George Martin produced them. The remasters are awful. I could go into great detail explaining why that's the case, but no amount of description would convey the reality. I don't know why classic recordings from the sixties and seventies are subjected to disfigurement, but it's a damned shame. It seems to be consistent with a trend that applies to a lot of things. In the name of progress, vegetables are rendered tasteless, movies become glorified video games, and conversation is reduced to ""tweets."" Whatever you want to call these remasters, if you've heard the originals, you can't seriously call these audial deformities improvements. I won't give the remastered album a single star, out of respect for the quality of the compositions. It's quite possible that the very nature of digital recording precludes reproducing the balance and coherence of the originals. If this is the only version of these songs you'll ever hear, it's certainly better than never hearing them at all. But I have to feel sorry for you, that you've been deprived of the masterpiece that George Martin created.",2.0

"First off the zero stars is for the crappy vinyl pressing I got.  Five stars for the beautiful cover and inserts.  FIVE STARS for a fantastic music on this album (does not help the two star rating).  The disrespect given to the Beatles with these absolutely horrible pressings is like a slap in the face.  Whoever is responsible for these poor pressing in 2012 should have been fired from their high paying job.  Oh yea and the record is warped also.  I bought two of these 2012 vinyls, Help and Beatles For Sale.  Both were bad pressings, evening skipping on first play.  Pops ticks and over all sounding like a used record picked up for $3 at a record store.  Well I took another chance and bought SGT Pepper. Oh my does it look cool, the cover, inserts, inner sleeve, extra nice insert with liner notes, WOW it looks good but then I made the mistake of playing it, what was I thinking.  Right out of the gate there is a scuff sound right when the crowd noise comes in for the title track, wow you have got to be kidding.  I did not even get five seconds into the record.  I should Have Known Better.  Maybe I will clean it and we are good to go.  Silly me not so fast Einstein that will not get rid of a SCRATCH!!  Then I hold the record up to a bright light and what is this, a BIG scuff/scratch not even where I heard the  scratch sound but later in the title track.  I run my finger over it and I can feel it.  Looks like someone dropped something on the vinyl, or dropped the vinyl and it hit something.  Then I flip the record to try out side two and same thing in the quiet start of Within You Without You there it is again, a BIG noisy scratch sound.  And to top off my little experiment I play A Day In The Life and when they hit that final piano cord at the end and it is fading all I can hear are pops and ticks, WOW!!  What a fool I must be to think that the passage of time had corrected this problem.  And shame on Amazon for still selling these defective records.  Come on people!  That is it for me and the 2012 vinyl, I will be returning this for a refund, not exchange but refund.  I am so unhappy with the way this entire vinyl release was handled.  The greatest band in rock n roll gets treated like this?!?!  I just hope someone got fired from their over paid job.  Amazon stop selling these crappy vinyl records.  Everybody just get out your 40 year old vinyl and play that.  Mine bought in about 1974 sounds great still and if it has pops or ticks and even skips then that is OK since they were my fault from the million times I played it.  Thanks for letting me vent.  Later.",2.0
"I'm not here to talk about the contents of the album, I'll leave that to music historians, etc.

But the album cover is too ridiculous to even be funny.  From the song listing on the back cover ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely HERATS Club"".  To the inner liner text ""Strawberry Fields FOREBER"".  The color separation is also dismal.  Really, this is the quality I would expect buying the CD from a sketchy guy with a table at the flea market.",2.0
I can not believe that a new pressing can skip- I have bought loads of used records that are of great quality.,2.0
"The Beatles have gotten so much praise over the years of being one,if not the greatest band ever,and in NO WAY do they deserve that much credit. What made THEM so great??They didin't sound ANY better then anybody else that was out during that time. The Beatles were just a mediocre band at best. There were so many other bands,that were a million times better then The Beatles ever were,and those bands were overlooked,because everybody's attention were on The Beatles. I also wanna point out that The Beatles were Satanists,and very much admired the teachings of Aleister Crowley...An evil,child molesting,perverted,drug addicted maniac. Don't believe me?Take a REAL good look at the album cover. Look in the upper left hand corner. You will see their lovely ""hero"" Aleister Crowley's picture. The Beatles even said that they wanted their heroes on this album cover. The Beatles were talented,but nowhere near as great as people make them out to be,and their obession with Crowley's wicked teachings,make me like them even less.",2.0
"The vinyl pressing is defective and of a very poor quality. There are too many scuffs, scratches, clicks and pops! It's really sad, when you consider there are pressing plants, in the world today, devoted to producing superior quality vinyl records. Clearly, EMI/Apple, for reasons unknown to me, have chosen a pressing plant with quality control issues.  I am very disappointed with the overall quality of the vinyl. I can only hope EMI/Apple may produce a second run of pressings and team up with a pressing plant devoted to quality control. Maybe someone like R.T.I. or Mobile fidelity sound labs could take control of the pressings.
In the world of `Beatles Box sets' many editions and/or pressings have been produced down thru the years. In my collection, I happen to own (1) the 1978 Parlophone Beatles BC 13 Blue box set, and (2) the 1982 Mobile Fidelity/EMI  box set pressed by the Victor company  in Japan on virgin vinyl.  If I were to put aside all questions, comments, criticisms and/or debates regarding the mastering of the recordings, and merely focus on the quality of the vinyl.  Well, it's easy...  The 1982 vinyl pressings are clearly the gold standard.  The 1978 pressings come in at second place. And the new 2012 pressings are dead last.. Again, I can only hope EMI/ Apple might consider a second run of pressings with a manufacturer  devoted to superior audiophile quality.",2.0
"I give this two stars for the quality of the audio and vinyl pressing, not because of the songs on the album itself. I ordered six of the new vinyl remasters and Sgt. Pepper was one of them. All of the others sounded absolutely amazing, but this one sounded atrocious. The bass won't come through without serious static, the highs sound like they're scratching on the way out of the speakers, and it just sounds horrible. Now, I don't think that all of the new Sgt. Pepper albums will sound this bad, this was just a problem with my particular copy. Buyers should beware that there have been some fairly widespread issues with the quality of these new vinyl pressings. Open and play them as soon as you get them so you don't way too long to get an exchange or refund if you happened to get a bad copy.",2.0

"So I bought the mono box set and heard this album for the first time in its entirety.  I was prepared to be disappointed and was still disappointed.  With this box set I've gained a new respect for the early albums while later work is hit or miss and this album misses for the most part.  Little help from my friends is a good song that Joe Cocker made fairly great.  LSD is a great song don't get me wrong but the only other one I like is a Day in the Life so I can't give this more than 2 stars despite all the hoopla.  I've listened to Rubber Soul for the first time also and it is really a great album though I still think Revolver is better, Revolver being a stunning work in my opinion.  Magical Mystery Tour is actually (much) better than Sgt Peppers but it came out after so doesn't get groundbreaking credit... or something.  I just find the Sgt Pepper songs lacking, self-indulgent with little redeeming value.",2.0
"This is a great CD - the sound is crisp and clean. If you have an older CD, then this is the one to get.

EXCEPT.

Whomever decided to save a few bucks by replacing a jewel case with a cardboard sleeve should be taken out back. The point of the case is to PROTECT THE CD. A cardboard sleeve not only doesn't protect it, but it actually damages it. Wherever there's a seam in the sleeve, the CD will get scratched. Wherever the seam is glued, glue will leak out onto the CD when the package sits in a hot delivery truck.

This is what happened to me. The CD arrived scratched and covered in glue. Fortunately, the damage was on the data track, so I had a chance to listen to the music before I had to return it.

I will avoid buying any CD/DVD/BluRay that comes in a non-jewel case like the plague. Sure, it is eco-hostile (plastic never goes away, it just floats in the great garbage patch forever), but there's no point in buying a plastic disk only to have to return it.",2.0

"The only thing I cared about when I picked up the new remastered version of Sgt. Pepper was getting to the reprise and finding out if someone finally had the sense to restore the missing elements of the reprise lost since the original mono LP release. They didn't.
The reprise of ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" is supposed to be the great rock and roll lead-in to our huge finale, and it is absolutely essential to have - in fact, the whole effect hinges upon - Paul McCartney yelling his head off at the end. With that missing, the song is ruined and it remains so.
I haven't found out yet on these ""remasters"" if they've restored the missing harmonica on ""Thank You Girl"" or thrown out that horrid dry guitar on ""I Feel Fine"" and ""She's a Woman""....if not, we'll have to rely on those otherwise unnecessary Capitol version CD releases, but as for Sgt. Pepper...no salvation.",2.0
"42 years later and Sgt. Pepper is as brilliant as ever...enough said, further accolades superfluous. However, how can anybody justify the sale of such an iconic cd in a cardboard envelope? Shame on you Amazon and E.M.I.! Would a simple, elegant crystal cover have cut that much into the bottom line?",2.0
"This is a general problem I have with the entire Beatles catalouge; hardly anything holds up for me. In the case of this and the White album in particular I've realised it's not as much to do with my repeated listening as it is with the quality of the songs. Every once in awhile it's neccessary to dust something off and listen to it with fresh ears. Otherwise all you have is the endless hype from people chiming away with their minds switched off.

It's the critics who are to blame and a horde of fans as well for the perpetuation of the Sgt. Pepper is a classic, and the best album ever scam. Part of the evidence of this is provided by the Amazon critic on this page who like all critics wants to whitewash all evidence to the contrary to prove the indestructability of the Beatles and others. No one thought of music as art? This writer was almost certainly in knee pants in 67 and probably took his music history lesson from other people who started the myth. Art and concept albums certainly did exist before then. And the Moody Blues put out a great concept album the same year. Sgt. Pepper by John's admission isn't even a real concept album. This and the 'blindingly inventive' idea of using cutouts of figures add to the hype behind this album. How can adults be so immature and excited over this? The truly clever people like Frank Zappa for instance knew right away that this was nothing special. He was even right about it being a trend. And that trend lives on today, in the nostalgia for psychedelic swirly fonts and videos. Put these tracks on another album by another band and they will be called out for the average tripe it is at best: Sgt Pepper, Rita, Good morning, Sgt. Pepper reprise.

Let's face it, these songs have been 'classic' for awhile and with that, their quality has come beyond criticism. That's not fair at all. Most of these songs have turned into a massive sing-a-long for most people. If a song is catchy, gets sung by inebriated people at bars and events, has long since passed into the culture, then it's achieved its mythic status. That's the case with this album. I've heard LSD, With a little help too many times to care anymore - they are anything but fresh. Harrison did a much better job at using eastern influences on Love you to on Revolver, this sounds far more plain and gimmicky. It's not an inventive melody in the least. The melody of Mr. Kite is a bit like It's only love from Help. Even otherwise this does not say 'classic.' This just plods along, like the rest of the album.

She's leaving home is the one redeeming song for me, the only one I hear anymore.

A day in the life - the epic. It was a huge production, has many of the ingredients of a classic. All these years later, it's a chore to listen to. I can't even say why. I just know I don't listen to it. Could it be that the Beatles stuff isn't that fresh all these years later after all? Scary thought isn't it? Nah... the critics say it's good. And Sgt. Pepper is great even though there's other music that holds up better and I would actually like listening to more if I freed up my mind.",2.0
"Let me start by stating the obvious.

Amazon reviews (such as the one you're reading right now) are not written by professional critics. They're not in-depth essays, they're not artistic appreciations, they're not swiftly-worded polemics, and they're certainly not  works of music criticism (or literary criticism, or film criticism, or wicker furniture criticism, or whatever it is that you happen to be shopping for). They are tools intended to help potential customers make buying decisions. A good Amazon review suggests an answer to the question ""should I spend my hard-earned dough on this product?"" Four and five star reviews say ""yes,"" three star reviews say ""maybe"" and one and two star reviews say ""no.""

When you consider purchasing a product, you are essentially asking yourself the following question: ""Does the amount of happiness I stand to receive from this item equal or exceed, when translated into dollar terms, the amount of money I'd spend on it?"" Happiness being a subjective quality, this isn't an easy question to answer. Reviews allow consumers to estimate their potential gains.

Now, music is art, but there's no reason why we shouldn't think of art as a simple commodity. Everything that we buy, we buy because we hope that it'll improve (or maintain) the quality of our lives. In that sense, art fulfills the same function as a toaster. Which is to say that when you buy an album, you're in the market for music that will make you happy (here I'm using ""happy"" in a very loose sense, and I'm referring more to, uh, ""spiritual fulfillment"" 'n' junk than the capacity to induce a smile. The works of Leonard Cohen don't exactly put a spring in my step, but at some very profound level, they make me happy, even as they break my heart). In other words, you're in the market for music that you'll enjoy listening to (here I'm using ""enjoy"" in a very loose sense, blah blah blah). In still other words, you're in the market for a compact disc that, when inserted into a a CD player and set into motion, will produce sounds that are pleasing to the ear.

You are NOT, despite what you may think, shopping for ""historical significance."" An album is historically significant whether you buy it or not. Paying for it and receiving a physical copy of it will not make you appreciate its historical value any more than you already do. I don't need a scale model of the Battle of Waterloo to appreciate the collapse of Napoleon Bonaparte's grandiose ambition. Nor, I suspect, do you. By that same token, purchasing a historically significant album doesn't cause you to ""own a piece of history."" A signed  first-pressing (read: old vinyl) edition might, but it's hard to find that sort of thing on Amazon.

Nor should you consider buying an album because of its influence. Influence is a quality that is only directly of use to those artists that were influenced. Liking Scott Walker doesn't mean that you'll enjoy Jacques Brel simply because the latter influenced the former. Now, there's nothing wrong with thinking that you may enjoy the music on an album because a favorite artist tends to praise said album, as long as you recognize that this praise serves the same function as a good Amazon review. Influence is an occasionally useful indicator, not an intrinsically good quality that elevates a work of art independently of other factors.

Which brings us to this album.

Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is a cultural milestone, a quintessential snapshot of the Summer of Love, an epic juncture in the history of rock 'n' roll, a shot across the bow at those who don't believe in the artistic potential of pop music, the first album to include printed lyrics, a cathartic moment in the Beatles' increasingly hectic collective career, a reply to Pet Sounds, the number one entry on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time, and a critical sacred cow from the day of its release.

My review concerns itself with none of this.

See, all of the aforementioned qualities are completely extrinsic to whether or not you actually have a copy of this album. You shouldn't care what Rolling Stone thinks, and you shouldn't be reading about this album's historical impact from an Amazon review, because you're looking for an enjoyable listening experience, not a history lesson. Yes, the history is important and interesting, but there are whole books about that stuff.

All of which is my long, long, long prelude to one very simple statement: I don't like listening to this album. Most of the songs are worthless, stupid, dull, ponderous, grating, dated, and endlessly self-involved. ""When I'm Sixty-Four,"" ""Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite!,"" ""Lovely Rita,"" and ""Good Morning Good Morning"" are stuffed with transparent gimmickry and lazily disguised pretension. The title trick is a shambling, plodding rocker with phoned-in vocals. ""With A Little Help From My Friends"" and ""Getting Better"" are big 'n' famous, but to my ears they fall quite squarely into ""it's alright, I guess..."" territory. ""She's Leaving Home"" goes for emotional resonance but plays like dull melodrama. ""Fixing A Hole"" is catchy, but minor.

It's all so incredibly mundane. The Beatles were capable of so, so much more. Revolver is a masterpiece, and so is Rubber Soul. Heck, Magical Mystery Tour quite soundly defeats Sgt. Pepper's in the ""Beatles' psychedelic masterpiece"" sweeps. If MMT had ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"" and ""A Day In The Life"" on it instead of this record, then Sgt. Pepper's would have no business being in your music collection at all. As it stands, the two aforementioned songs are really the only reason that I'd want to recommend this thing on purely musical grounds.

In other words,  I really don't like listening to this album, and I don't think that you will either, and I hope that you don't spend, like, twenty bucks on it.",2.0
"In 2003, Rolling Stone declared ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band""  the best album ever made.  ""...Sgt. Pepper formally ushered in an unforgettable season of hope, upheaval and achievement: the late 1960s and, in particular, 1967's Summer of Love. In its iridescent instrumentation, lyric fantasias and eye-popping packaging, Sgt. Pepper defined the opulent revolutionary optimism of psychedelia and instantly spread the gospel of love, acid, Eastern spirituality and electric guitars around the globe.""

You know, that's a nice sentiment, but when you actually stop and listen to the songs, it's really a paeaen of conservativism.
notice:

-the very concept and first song (an old time  Salvation Army type band Paul's grandparents might've listened to with glee)
-""She's Leaving Home,""  a sad song about a runaway told from the abandoned parents' perspective --  are we actually sympathizing with parents whose kids are ony their way to San Francisco?
-When I'm sixty four, a terribly cute song about fidelity and suburban middle class life (whatever happened to Free Love?)
-Lovely Rita, a pop song about having a crush on a law enforcement officer - of all people!
-Good Morning Good Morning, which could be the theme song of a kids' 7AM cartoon show.

then there are other songs on the album, like ""Fixing a Hole,"" and ""Getting Better,""  which certainly aren't revolutionary, and just aren't that good.

And Within Without You, while it may add the Eastern Spirituality aspect of hippiedom to the album, is far from George Harrison's best sitar song.

In the end, I think the critics who praise this album so lavishly are really lost in nostalgia.  Sgt. Pepper has come to represent something it really isn't, an era, a feeling, a certain way of thinking and living and making music.

Still, I think the Beatles made the songs that represented the Summer of Love and hippiedom/psychedlia.  They are just scattered across several albums.  Let's pull them together, and call it, for lack of a better title,

Sgt. Pepper Remixed

1. Sgt. Pepper

2. With a Little Help from My Friends
we'll keep the first two songs, because they establish the whole band-being-another-band scheme, and there was something about hippiedom that said you could be someone totally different than who you'd always been.

3. Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds
aren't we being revolutionary?  We haven't changed the first three songs.  Maybe this is what the critics listen to, and then start writing and stop listening.  But what would the Summer of Love be without Lysergic acid diethylamide?

4. Instead of Getting Better, Across the Universe
I've always thought this is the song that's supposed to come after Lucy.

5. Instead of Fixing a Hole, I am the Walrus
Don't fix the hole, Paul, pass through it, like John did.

6. Instead of She's Leaving Home, Yellow Submarine
Stop mourning the runaway, and let's have some fun imagining a cool place we could live, with lots of other people.

7. Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite
this gets to stay, being such a wonderfully trippy mix of Victorian circus and pyschedelia.

8. Instead of Within Without You, Love You To
This is George's best sitar song.  Hands down.

9. Instead of When I'm Sixty-Four, Strawberry Fields Forever
SFF almost made the album, and is the natural counterpart to 64, as they are both nostaglic reflections on Liverpool.  That was Paul's, this is John's.

10. Instead of Lovely Rita,  Revolution
ditch the cop, and bring on the revolution.

11. Instead of Good Morning Good Morning, All You Need is Love
was there ever a more optimistic song?  And if you like that cacophany of barnyard animals at the end of ""Good Morning,""  All You Need"" has a simliar mess at the end.

12. Sgt. Pepper reprise
see #1's reason.

13. A Day in the Life
OK, this may be the best song to end an album ever.  And it is the right mood - the sendup of everyday, 9 to 5 life, the paranoia (was it Paul in the car?), the way one thing dissolves into another...  it's pretty much perfect.

Now, that just might be the best album (n)ever made.",2.0
"Dear oh dear, was this really what my parents were grooving to in '67 ? Must say that Rubber Soul, Revolver and also Abbey Road have stood the test of time much better than the mixed bag that is Sergeant Pepper's. I agree with one of my fellow reviewers that this album has been over-rated to quite a ridiculous extent. Songs like ""When I'm 64"", ""Fixing a hole"", ""Getting better"" really make for a rather embarrassing listen 30 years down the line. Guff is guff, even when it's produced by arguably the greatest pop group ever. And it's one of pop music's more enduring mysteries how the hell that guff ever ended up on an album that also features brilliant song writing like ""Lucy in the sky"" or ""A day in the life"".

The notion that Sergeant Pepper's was the first time ""a rock album was accepted as art"" is also nonsense of course. By 1967, Frank Zappa and/or The Mothers of Inventions had already produced Freak Out!, Absolutely Free and Lumpy Gravy. Surely these albums were a bit more than mere collections of songs...(and sure enough, they were recognised as such by the more perceptive people in and outside the music scene). In my opinion, Sergeant Pepper's denotes the point where the Beatles left the field where they were unsurpassed - writing first rate pop songs - and made their first attempt at something more ""arty"". 30 years down the line, that attempt certainly did not result in a masterpiece. At best, it resulted in a failed masterpiece.",2.0
"For many years 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' topped nearly every single magazine Best Album list, which amazed me since 'Revolver' and 'Rubber Soul' were far superior and were usually relegated to much lower positions on these lists. But lately, music critics have realized that this is, in fact, not even close to a top-ten album.

By Beatles standards, this is the second worst album they released (Abbey Road finishes dead last). While I admire the experimental recording techniques, the bulk of the songs are twee and silly. Plus, there are NO rockers on this album! At least the Stones indulged in some rock riffing on their own sub-standard psych record 'Their Satanic Majesties Request'.

For some GOOD psych, research The United States of America, Love, Silver Apples, Tomorrow, Red Crayola, Hollies, Amboy Dukes, The Creation, Smoke, The Move, The Action and West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band. These bands have what the Beatles failed to deliver.",2.0
"I bought this remembering what I thought about the Beetles and boy was it a disappointment.  My gosh they weren't very good were they; rather amateurish and just not very good musically.

The songs were good and I did enjoy revisiting the album which I hadn't heard in over 20 years.  But the one thought I came away with was that they weren't really very good and one wonders how they came to be what they became.",2.0
"Compared to most other Beatles albums, this album now sounds dated and does not show the Beatles at their best or most creative. I have to say it is one of my least favourite Beatles albums, and I would urge anyone not to make this their first purchase, try Rubber Soul or A Hard Day's Night instead.

Lucy In The Sky is a decent enough pop song, Fixing a Hole is quite good, but there's little else here of note. It's a bit of a sloppy album, and the Pepper concept is a little pathetic.

I'll get shot down in flames for stating these opinions I'm sure, but I stand by them, it's a heavily over-rated album. Ask a room full of Beatles fans what their favourite Beatles album is, and very few would say Pepper.",2.0
"The songs on here are really funky. they have the weirdest songs that nobody really likes. i think that they had potential for this cd but they wanted to do something different. they sure did and it turned out to be bad! sorry, just an opinion!

"Now I hope that you can agree with me that it's not really enjoyable to hear people talk about times before you were born, or have them play cds from their younger days, because it's impossible for us to relate to that stuff. Now me, I have a dad that will try to no end to get me to listen to old stuff that he deems as ""important"" and ""meant something"" to him ages ago. What he doesn't seem to realize is that it's foolish for him when he tells me I ""need to grow up"", when HE is still stuck in the era of hippys and be-boppers. YOU need to grow up, dad. Anyways, dad found out that I am building up some momentum as a professional review writer, and HE thinks I need to review some of the ""classics"" to gain more credebility. He handed me 3 dusty old records and said ""It would mean a lot to me if my son would listen to his father's three favorite albums"". Now in the past my dad's records were something I sneak out of the sleeves when he's at work and play frisbee with Morris (my dog). But his birtday is next week so I figured that my present to him would be to review them. It's the least I can do considering he bought me a Volkswagen Cabrio for my birthday last year.

These will not be your typical Tuttleman reviews, because since I simply cannot relate to the 50's and 60's and 70's, I have no personal experience to relate these to. Sorry guys, please bare with me. Ok, here it goes.

I'm putting it on the record player right now. It says ""mono"" so this must be a pre-stereo artifact LOL. Ok...crowd noise....Hmmm. There is a guitar now that sounds like motorcycle rock. I thought the Beatles were before motorcycle rock. Maybe it was ahead of it's time or something. Ok, i'm looking at the packaging while it's playing now.....Oh My God! There's a cardboard sheet where you can cut things out and one of them is a MUSTACHE! That would look hilarious on my dog Morris. Maybe later. Next song is kind of like Hillbilly music because of the guys voice. YEEE-Haw! Ok, next song is like weird drug music. Next one....kind of motorcyle rock mixed with drug rock. Now sort of soft drug rock. Hmmmm... the cover doesn't even say ""Beatles"" anywhere on it. We'll have to change that right now....God, they look like such deranged, doped-up hippys it's not even funny. This must be after Lennon died. Why would my dad ever listen to this when he swears that he never did drugs? Ok, just got done with a sad Disney style song....Weird! the next song is like..Circus clown music.

Alright, now I have to walk over and flip the record or whatever. What a dumb concept. Ok, now it's like uh...oriental music. This is taking forever. Ok, now what the heck is with this next one?! It's like a showtune or something, but with a really crappy horn! Whoever played the horn for the Beatles shoud have been thrown out of the band the second he pulled this crap. It sounds like he's killing the horn. Now it's an upbeat song with animal noises. Next, they play the first song over again (that's original). And the last one is like a slow song....no, now it's upbeat. Ok, at the end the symphony apparently got all doped up and had a swordfight with all of their instruments. Then there's a bonus track of noise that plays over, and over, and over, and over, until you can't take it anymore and throw the cardboard case at the record player like a frisbee.

In conclusion, this record makes me even more glad I wasn't born in the 50's or 60's or 70's, or whatever. The best part about it ended up being the cardboard mustache cut-out which looks really funny on a dog, but you will need to use masking tape or something. The record also has just about every instrument ever on it, but unless I missed it, they STILL couldn't find room for a single harmonica. So there you have it: Pre-motorcycle-hillbilly-circus-clown-oriental-showtune-animal-noise-drugged-out-hippy-rock, I guess you could call it. Happy Birthday, hippy. Stay tuned for the next 2 parts of the trilogy if I can make it through without my brain dying. Later.

"It's a bit funny how people still rave about one of the weakest pop albums ever released, after almost 40 years. To tell the truth, there are only 2 (yes, TWO) stand-out tracks on this record, out of 13 (She's Leaving Home and ADITL - they're not very original, clearly stolen from Brian Wilson, but still quite pleasant), all the others are nothing more than pale imitations of REALLY groundbreaking and amazing productions of the era (yes, Pet Sounds, yes, Freak Out). Lennon and McCartney are often praised as genius songwriters, but I don't think they were more talented than, say, those guys from Herman's Hermits. I mean, you smoke a lot of dope and bring in a 40 piece orchestra to the studio and then you automatically become a genius? NO. You have to write great songs too, pal. And these guys had totally forgotten to write good songs after about 1964. Ignore this overrated crpap, and go and buy Odessey and Oracle or Younger Then Yesterday if you want to hear the real sound and magic of 1967.",2.0
"The Beatles were good, no doubt. This has some interesting things, but the best thing about it is the innovations and the way it pointed to the rest of psychedelia, concept albums, album art, and frankly the use of noise in mainstream rock music. All those things were done better, and I mean MUCH better, by the likes of the Velvet Underground, Mothers of Invention, Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, The Godz, Hendrix, etc.. early Beatles, dated as they sound, are still a kick. Later stuff kept one foot in psychedlia, but backed the other one up into their rawer roots, and produced The White Album, with superior results. It's been hip to say Sgt. Pepper is the greatest album of all time for, uh, all time (it seems), and it was probably as influential as any album in rock History (with the noteable exceptions of ""Elvis Presley"" and ""Meet the Beatles""). 2 stars, but I can't entirely say it's a waste. The title track is good hard rock, and ""A Day in the Life"" while not the greatest song ever, has some really noisy moments. ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" recalls the teenage feel of the early Beatles, well, ALMOST. After that, it's a little dull, especially for the Beatles.",2.0
"I love music. I always give a new sound a good listen before I discard it and this album was no different. I was constantly surprised to see it voted ""Greatest album"" in all time lists and was intrigued to see what all the fuss was about. It turns out all the fuss was about nothing. It is a weak album by anyone's standards, let alone the Beatles who have created Revolver, The White album etc. A Day in the Life is an amazing song, everything the Beatles' music stands for... and most of the rest of the album? Utter widdle. ""When I'm 64""??? That is a poor excuse for a song if ever I've heard it. It makes sense listening to that how Paul could possible have put his name to that Frog Song. It's music for kids. It is NOT music for those of us who want an experience to come from our lyrics and sonic scapes.
I quite understand why many claim this to be the best ever; because many of those who do were around when this came out, and it reminds them of a time in their life when it was great to be a little cool and hippy. That's all well and good, we all love some stuff (that some people just don't ""get"") because it takes us back to a happy time. Well, for goodness sake keep it to yourselves. This is a supremely poor album, end of story. If you don't see passed the gimmick that this band was peddling at the time this was released you are blind.
Then again, I think the Beatles were generally somewhat overrated, certainly Lennon was. The Stones were much more ""real"", that much is clear, even to a 23 year old like myself. I don't claim to be the biggest Beatles fan, but they have written some absolute classics. This album contains one classic, a few good tunes and a whole lotta widdle. Avoid unless you wish to relive the '60's and all that was bad with music back then. There were so many classics from that era, try them instead; I suggest The Band, ""Music From Big Pink"" or ""The Band"".",2.0
"Rating this album as two stars may be heresy to most, but when the hype surrounding this record is stripped, we're left with an album that is no where near the best of the Fab 4's output. Allowances are often made due to the ""experimental"" nature of this album. How ground-breaking is Sgt. Pepper's, though? Pet Sounds made far more important advances in harmonic structure, and The Velvet Underground and Nico (recorded in 1966 but released in '67) was far more subversive and interesting in its textures and lyrical content. Frankly, this record contains many well-arranged pieces based on the repetition of forgettable melodies.
I find it interesting that when musicians are asked for their favorite Beatles Album, it is Revolver and Abbey Road that dominate. Why then do critics and casual listeners consistently rate Sgt. Peppers and The White Album #1? I believe that a lot of the ""breakthrough"" claims placed on these two albums rely heavily on the general populace's ignorance of lesser-known works that influence many musicians and artists.
In my opinion, the Beatles were at their best writing blues-derived pop and rock songs. To be fair, had they not made these ""experimental"" forays, we'd have had 30-odd years of ""Love Me Do"" cover bands. That said, the sixties are the nexus from which springs the dichotomy of american popular music-- artistic versus the business model of pop. Give the Beatles credit, they refused to sacrifice the former to the latter. But they did this from the beginning-- the change from pop to art happened not on the production side, but in the reception. Rock was not considered art because it did not conform to European concepts of art music. Sgt. Pepper's married strands of traditional European styles to the base of blues and rock that the Beatles loved so much. It's still a good album, in the grand scheme of things. It's just that among the Beatles other records, it stands as a pretty weak example of the ouvre. Buy this album, but only after you buy the records mentioned above.",2.0
"I bought this album in 1980. I was 14, and, at the time, quite a big fan of Paul McCartney. I had been listening to ""Wings Greatest"",""Back to the Egg"" and ""McCartney II"" over and over and over. I especially liked the charming, spontanic feel of ""McCartney II"". So of course, I knew I had to get a Beatles album. ""Sgt. Pepper"" seemed like an obvious choise. Boy oh boy was I disappointed. And rather confused. There had to be something wrong with my head, thinking that ""McCartneyII"" was a much better album than ""Sgt. Pepper"".
23 years later, even if I no longer dig ""McCartney II"" the way I did way back then, and even if few people will share my opinion, I still prefer ""McCartney II"" over ""Sgt. Pepper"" any day.
I must say ""Sgt. Pepper first of all leaves me empty. Even if there are good (and even great) ideas on the album, I really dislike the hammering monotony the music is performed with. A lot of the songs seem to go on for too long, like there is a verse/refrain being repeted at least one time too many. There isn't enough variation in the performances, the songs don't ""breathe"". Just listen to what Joe Cocker made out of ""With a little help from my friends"" and you will (hopefully) get the idea. Then you have the self-indulgent, hopelessly overambitious songs like ""Within You Without You"" and ""A Day In The Life"".
Summa summarum: The most overrated Beatles album along with ""Abbey Road"". Best song on the album: ""When I'm 64"" (which Paul wrote at a very young age).
1967's best album: ""Forever Changes"" by Love.
And for you clowns who say that The Beatles always made excellent, five stars material, even when you deep inside know that simply isnt't true: That has nothing to do with interest and taste for music. That's FETISHISM!",2.0
"Afmitedly, though I am a huge Beatles fan, this CD isn't my favorite.  In fact, I think it's really overrated (*Brooke ducks to avoid the tomatoes being pelted at her face*).  I think it must have been a blast to make, and I'm sure I would love it if I were one of the Beatles (and I'm obviously not).  I just think that the CD isn't as great as it's hyped up to be.  Certainly it contains some wonderful pieces of music.  George Harrison's ""Within You, Without You"" is a very entrancing song""Lucy in hte Sky With Diamonds"" is also a very bold, entertaining song.  However, I don't think that the CD as a whole flows very well; it seems very inconsistent.  The song list also is overly wacky.  I also remember reading somewhere that This album was Paul McCartney's response to the critical and commerical success of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, an amazing concept album that flowed rather beautifully.  McCartney may have been trying to hard.  Seargent Pepper sounds uneven nad pretentious.  I've always admired the musical versatility, intelligence, and wit of the Beatles.  The Beatles don't need to try so hard to amaze us with excessively smug humor.",2.0
"After all these years, I cannot understand how this recording can possibly be considered ""the greatest"" album of all time. The sad fact is this album was never any good, and time has not been at all kind to it.
Yes, there are one or two songs on it that still hold up: ""With a Little Help from My Friends"" and ""A Day in the Life."" But two songs don't make an album, much less a masterpiece. On the other hand, the overrated ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" is extremely low-key and I much prefer William Shatner's psychotic version. Most of the rest of it, however, seems to have been put together with a nail and a hammer. There's more filler here than probably any other Beatles album, and the filler should have best been left unreleased. The sound effects are abominable, and I have never heard a more disjointed ""concept"" album in my life.
The only explanation for this mess, other than drugs, is pure cynicism by the Beatles. Hailed by the media and many fans as geniuses after putting out a string of memorable albums and singles, they eventually believed their own p.r. Crucial to the Beatles as gods myth was the creation of a subspecies of humanity or subhuman species (depending on your viewpoint) called the rock music critic. These rebels in search of a cause analyzed every song and every word ever spoken by the Beatles as though it came down from Mt. Sinai. Naturally this idolization went to the band's collective heads. If critics, much less fans, couldn't tell the difference between trash and treasure, why should the Beatles have helped them? Hence this slipshod album. The tragedy of Sgt. Pepper is that not only was it wildly successful and overpraised, but it paved the way for the hideous psychedelia and art rock of the late 60s and early 70s (brilliantly satirized by the Stones in their underrated masterpiece Their Satanic Majesties Request).
Because of the two above mentioned songs and because of the album's undeniable influence on popular music, it is recommended as a curiosity piece and is of course essential for Beatles completists.",2.0
"Bought this album with the greatest expectations. What a lack of expectations ... Of course it is good. AFter all, the Beatles are playing it !!. But, playing what ?? The album is so confusing, so much overdubs, tre drums production is awful. It's no the beste Beatles album. So what for printed lyrics ?? THios does not necesarily turn all the songs in it into master pieces of pop !!",2.0
"The Beatles were great. In the greater scope of their work, I don't think this album is so much better or worse than the others. Much to the contrary, I don't like it. It has so much studios gimmick running around, we can't possibly know who is playing what in each track. Boring, indulgent and mindless album.",2.0
"Why so many people keep saying this album is so great ?? It's nothing more than the great Beatles playing around with studio techniques and, consequently, losing all their spontaneous creativity. The sound is very bad, RIngo Starr's drums are worse instead of better !!! Most of the songs try so hard to be great that they are boring most of the times ...I prefer even the album ""HELP"" or "" ABBEY ROAD"". I admit that the album opened up possibilities for rock.",2.0
"This receives 2 stars from me in the context of what The Beatles are capable of. Any other band recording this would receive 4 stars. As a young (21 yrs) Beatles fan, I have spent the last 3 years constantly listening to every Beatles album, and have to say that I can't see what all the fuss is over Sgt Peppers! This is the softest album they ever recorded (Paul's concept and execution primarily). A Day in the Life is undoubtedly one of The Beatles' finest songs and is possibly one of the best endings to an album ever (closely behind Tommorrow Never Knows). Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds is a dreamy, beautifully sung tune by John. With A Little Help From My Friends is OK (Joe Cocker's is much better though). Remove these three songs from the album, and you are left with some very average songs indeed. Also McCartney's vocals don't have the same range as John's and his added influence is not favourable on the music. Rubber Soul has many classics (Norwegian Wood, In My Life, Drive My Car, Nowhere Man), Revolver has some great electric songs (And Your Bird Can Sing, Taxman, She Said) Sgt Peppers definitely lacks a heart. Far from being the definitive Beatles work, I would place this well behind Rubber Soul, Revolver, Abbey Road and the White Album. For other young people considering a first album purchase of The Beatles, I would recommend Rubber Soul or Revolver. Or get Sgt Peppers if you are the sort of person who pretends to love Radiohead's 'Kid A' just to show how alternative and intellectual your musical tastes are.",2.0
"I remember buying this album and being confused.  This is supposed to be  the 'best album of all time', and i couldn't hear or see that.  I went on  feeling guilty for a month- no, i'm not joking.  The album starts out very  strong and ends with an epic song, but it is VERY boring in between those  two songs.  I've said before that the beatles music sounds mostly like  nursery rhymes and this is true here for ""with a little help from my  friends"", ""It's getting better"", ""for the benefit of mr  kite"", ""when i'm sixty four"", and ""good morning good  morning"".  As a matter of fact, Lennon himslef mentioned how much he  hates ""good morning good morning"".  It was a time when he had  nothing to say, but they had to record music anyway.  That's not the only  annoying song on the album, ""within you without you"", anyone?  This must be the worst song put to tape by a major band, EVER!  I can go on  with all the flaws in the album, but i'll stop here.  It's just too much  pain to think about these things. I gave whack pepper two stars for the  first and last songs which are okay but not great by any means.  I hope  people who haven't bought the album yet decide not to after reading this  review.  That's a good ten bucks saved, use themn to buy a zeppelin cd  instead.",2.0
"I love the Beatles.  I'll start with that.  And for years, I would mindlessly agree with those who said that ""Pepper"" was their greatest record, without really giving it much thought.  But in recent  years, I've noticed that while I've had most of the Beatles catalog for  about 10 years now, Sgt. Pepper is without a doubt the one I listen to the  least.  In fact, I can't remember the last time I listened to it at all.  I  just never seem to want to hear those songs.  Most of them sound boring and  dated, and many suffer from being so catchy, that after enough exposure,  you just get plain sick of it.  It just sounds like one big experiment that  didn't really work.  I read a review here saying that one of the reasons  it's so great is because it was the first album to print song titles on the  sleeve.  So what!  Maybe I'll put out the first album ever to be dubbed  and mixed entirely by a family of monkeys.  Will that make it great?  The  songs just aren't there.  I find myself going back consistently to the  White Album, Revolver, Rubber Soul, Abbey Road, and even Let it Be.  The  Beatles were at their best when they were just simply trying to make music,  not trying to out-do some other band or make some grandiose statement and  change everything as we know it.",2.0
"Almost the entire album is mediocre and not worth a purchase. The lyrics and melodies are infantile and grating, not to mention repetitive. When I hear songs like Lovely Rita, or Good Morning, Good Morning, I cant help but  think they are best suited for kindergardeners. The one exception to the  album is ""A Day in the Life"", one of my favorite songs of all  time. This song is brilliant beyond description or compare, and redeems  this album, making it a necessary purchase, unless you're willling to tape  that one song. Why this unbelievable mediocrity is so praised is beyond me.  When you hear it I'm sure you will agree.",2.0
Not enough explanations on how to do the work.,2.0
"I have successfully homeschooled two children through graduation, so I am familiar with a wide variety of programs. I bought this for my 11 year-old daughter.
She hated it. It is not presented in any logical order, the questions do not always seem to relate to the material presented, and its just boring in general. We kept it and used it half the school year until I could replace it. Her science is now integrated into a unit study program, where the science topics actually relate to other things we are doing.",2.0
"I know that children differ dramatically in ability and development, but my daughter and I found this product to be above her abilities, honestly.  It includes vocabulary words like psychology and hypothesis...and many others that require a great deal of adult help (at least for my child.) I also found that the text, when she read it, was above her comprehension level. I didn't think it was very clearly written for ANYONE, yet the questions require the child to be able to process the information.

When the child is asked to answer the questions it's not a simple matter of just re-reading the text and filling in the blank, but of extrapolating information. For example Lesson 1.1 asks what ""a scientist should always be...""  The answer is ""a careful observer,"" but the child is supposed to figure this out from a sentence in the text that reads, ""A carefully controlled experiment that is watched closely can provide a lot of information.""  I think this is too great a stretch for a 3rd grader. I'm really beginning to wonder about who writes these so-called ""standards,"" and if children are really able to ""learn"" them. I know, from working with other children this age at our church, that other children would definitely NOT be able to process information at this level.

This book might be useful for a gifted child, or one very advanced in reading, but for them I think there are better products available.",2.0
"We bought these books (Spectrum Science for grades 3 and 5) for our homeschool curriculum.  The books are very boring...mostly just ""reading comprehension"" sold under the guise of being a science workbook.  Each lesson has a few paragraphs to read followed by a list of questions-not a fun way to learn science in my opinion.",2.0

"If you have the 2009 calendar, you've pretty much seen the 2010, right down to the font. Each month has a large photo with three smaller inset photos. Here's the layout: January is Buffy, Feb is Xander with two vamp Xander pics that are too similar, Mar is Giles, April is Tara, May is Cordy - and the photo doesn't especially reflect the character, June is Anya with Xander because apparently a 1000 year old ex demon doesn't warrant her own month, July is Angel with Buffy, Aug is Spike (who gets his own large photo without Buffy), September is the core cast from the early seasons, Oct is the girls, November is Willow, and December is Dawn with no other characters and therefore a huge letdown. Riley Finn doesn't appear anywhere in the calendar although Adam does, so Marc Blucas fans will be disappointed. There is one inset of Kendra but no pictures of Faith. No Robin Wood. No Glory. No final fight nor any potentials at all. Overall it looks like someone picked a bunch of mostly early photos and made a calendar. It does not appear that person had a great appreciation for nor an understanding of the show. If you can find a better Buffy calendar, go with that one. If not, this is an ok substitute.",2.0
Cool calendar! Not actually glow in the dark very much though,2.0
"The photo part does not glow only the month name, writing, and numbers on the bottom. Would have preferred to see the picture glow.",2.0

"I ordered both the world and the U.S. maps, and must say that I would never have paid this much for them had I known how thin and flimsy they were going to be.  I would say they are worth about 5.00 each.  Definitely not the 14 each I paid.  Definitely disappointed.",2.0
I ordered two maps (U.S. and world map).  The plastic packaging sleeve showed them to be correct but when I opened them for my son I found I had two U.S. maps and no world map even though the packaging showed a world map.  We had delayed opening them until his room was finished and by then it was too late to return.  We're disappointed and it was not worth the money.,2.0
I'm very annoyed. I love the size but the reviews I read said it was laminated and this is not laminated. Plus I paid for one day shipping and it arrived in 3! Would have expected Amazon to be better.,2.0
"I had to dig into the product description (this information is not visible unless you click a link) to find out that the actual size is 43.5"" x 30.5"".  Not 4 feet by 6 feet as others have claimed!  Also, the map is not laminated, don't write on it!

The tube was slightly crushed due to my decision to order this along with a heavy item, which was shipped in the same box.  So the map is slightly crumpled in one area.

I've seen a much nicer and larger NatGeo map with a wooden frame around it, and its available on Amazon, but it is out of my price range.

I've gotten a larger (and laminated) US map from a different publisher that I like better, and its only slightly more expensive.",2.0
It was rolled up so tight I'll never flatten it out. Looks different than seen online...to me anyway.  Not a big deal but probably won't use it.,2.0
Good map. however i did not know that it was basically a wall paper that has to be plasted on the wall with heavy duty adhesive. Also another issue as the maps don't line up correctly so in order to get it to line up no the wall the large map looks crooked on the wall..,2.0
Very THIN lamenent. Colors are good. Size is ok.,2.0
"The map is beautiful, lots of detail, however I was disappointed to see that it arrived with chewed up edges. It arrived in a plastic poster tube within a box (well protected). Once I opened the box I could see through the tube that it was damaged. This is a gift and simply not enough time to order a new one for Xmas.",2.0
"Well, the map is very nice, I probably should have splurged on a laminated one.  It does come tubed, but I had to order a replacement and they both came with damages or bends.  I think a paper tube would really save the day on this product.  The Square tube it comes in is not packed with much else and the box is fragile.",2.0
A bit TOO busy for us. Makes it a LOT harder to find the National Parks.  That's the only reason why we bought it.  We need to find a better map.,2.0
Came wrinkled,2.0

I'm disappointed that I paid this much for a ruined product.",2.0
"Disappointed in this.  Not for someone who is planning a trip by highway.  Typeface(s) used were mice type, colors are too dark.  I liked the overall size and the laminate.  Might be better for a U.S. geography student.  I'll find one to give this to.",2.0

"I buy different items all of the time off of Amazon and have never been disappointed until I got this poster.
I did arrive in a tube and nothing seemed wrong until I pulled it out.  It had wrinkles in the MIDDLE and tears on the edges :(  It was for Christmas, so I had to deal and hope that once framed, it wouldn't be too obvious to my much older parents.  It doesn't look too awful framed, but it still should NOT have arrived in a tube in that condition.",2.0
The map came ripped.,2.0
"Nice map, but it was rolled too tight in a plastic sleeve, and put in a square box that got pushed into a diamond shape. It has ripples and creases in the laminate. Why isn't this in a triangular box or round tube? I'm not going to risk it again unless the package design changes.",2.0
Map was very nice and detailed. Exactly what you would expect from national geographic. But the map appeared to have gotten wet at some point during the shipping process. Also the protective tube the map was shipped in was crushed making the map useless to display. My recommendation would be to buy the map directly from national geographic NOT through amazon.,2.0

"Sure, the size is listed, but it is smaller than I was thinking and really doesn't meet my needs at all.",2.0
"The map is beautiful (potentially)  however it came with creases that pretty much ruins it. It looks as if it was crushed with something after being rolled. Now have to play the return game.

***update*** The second map arrived promptly but I got stuck on the return shipping for $17.  The second map had what I will call minor creases compared to the first one they sent, but i'm ultimately pleased with the product ...looks great on the wall.

"We were very excited to receive the map and by all accounts, it looks good.

This map is very thin and flimsy.  Not at all what I expected for the price.  Worth maybe 5.00.,2.0
"You can barely get this thing out of the tube without getting permanent creases, the material is very thin and easily wrinkled. I took it down from the wall because it looked bad.",2.0

If I had those services then I would probably have a home manager, personal assistant or accountant, and wouldn't need to buy a home planner.

THE GOOD
- colors are awesome and are a huge improvement over previous editions. I'm very thankful for this.
- the northern NH roads and roads in wild/remote areas have generally been significantly improved
- names of many streets have been added (although many were also removed - see below)

THE BAD AND AWFUL
- over 75% of the waterfalls listed in the previous editions have been removed (this makes no sense to me)
- more than 50% of the zoomed-in city/town maps of the  previous editions have been removed, including the busy tourist town of Manchester, Vermont (this was a huge disappointment)
- more than 50% of the small streams/brooks have had their names removed (this makes no sense to me)
- many major tourist attractions still are not listed (how on earth is Diana's Baths and Santa's Village STILL missing from these maps?)
- many small streets in rural areas have had their names removed (another huge disappointment)

I bought this lab book since I have multiple lab courses as student. The lab book was delivered on time but when I opened my packaged the lab book was worn and scratched looking The front cover had multiple moderate scratched the the back and side cover has the red color chipped/scratched off. For something that was bought new it looked like it was worn and used. The contents of the book are great but since it came to me in such poor quality I have to give it 2 stars. Such a bummer!,2.0

"This format is too rigid to customize to your needs. There are no blank pages, nowhere to break down your 3-5 major tasks into smaller tasks.

"This is great if you're an entrepreneur and need a system for tracking your daily workload. I have a fulltime job and honestly just do tasks when I have the time before or after work. Having an obligation to do daily time tracking and report on them every day gave me anxiety and made me feel less accomplished than before. I also don't like how the daily tasks don't tie to larger goals or objectives. Further, why are there 5 days in a week opposed to 7? Overall, not much I liked about it / not for me.",2.0
"I find that, contrary to the research on this method, 25 minutes for me as an instructional designer or when I'm working on authoring a book is not sufficient before I'm supposed to take a break. It's only 5 day a week planner, and that doesn't work for me, either. What it did do was help me establish the amount of time some of the routine tasks require. In some cases I had grossly underestimated, and others was far too generous.

For creative work, so many of us find the muse and are hesitant to tell her to ""go take a break"" just as we feel inspiration hit.

"The physical quality of the book is very good.  It appears that much more thought went into the look and feel of the book than the actual content on the pages.  The journal essentially has two pages, a ""day"" and ""night"".  It then has a few generic questions/statements with an area for you to wite.  Repeat for 99 days.  Every 10 days a new ""recap"" page will change the pace.  That is the Freedom Journal.

You could look a the photos posted of the two pages, make 99 copies and save yourself the money.  Considering that this is the most expensive journal that I have ever seen, I expected so much more content.  I expect some variety in the day to day pages.  I expect some more thought put into the generic questions.

The ONLY difference between the pages is the advertisement on the bottom of the page.  Yes, on each ""day"" page on the bottom you will see a ""recommended source"".  Many of these recommended sources are paid advertisers on the authors podcast.  So in addition to the steep price, you get a motivational journal full of advertisements.

"I thought the book was entertaining and cute, and an introduction to what goes on at a laundromat. However, I don't think I would get this book for a young todder (under 4) due to the fact that there was one scene where Corduroy is alone in the dark of laudromat, inside a wired laundry cart, and he looks terrified. The picture is very scary and sad. I think it's too much for a little kid. But overall, it's cute, and the ending is good.",3.0
"used more than I  like, but all there",3.0
"I really wanted to like this book. We rather enjoyed the original Corduroy. This one has fine pictures, as do all of Freeman's stories, but the story just seems... lacking.

Corduroy accompanies Lisa and her mother to the laundromat, and having overheard a conversation between Lisa and her mother decides a pocket is something he needs. He wanders off, ends up in a bag of wet laundry, goes for a spin in the dryer, tips a box of soap, and ends up trapped in a rolling laundry basket. Lisa finds him first thing the next day, and lovingly scolds him, saying she would be happy to make him a pocket.

The story has a bit of the obligatory alliteration that is often Don Freeman's trademark, but it feels a bit empty. It just doesn't have quite the sweetness and cleverness that so many of Don Freeman's stories have that make for an enduring book (ie. one you or your child will want to pull of the shelf time and time again).

I'm not disappointed we added this to our collection. It's alright for a once-in-a-while read. And it's probably a must-have for fans of Corduroy. But compared to the many, many wonderful books by Don Freeman, I just couldn't see awarding this one with more than three stars.",3.0
"In many ways, this is just a reprisal of the original book.

Corduroy is out and about, he hears a comment that makes him think is outfit is lacking in some way (this time, he doesn't have a pocket), he goes looking for it, he gets lost and stays the night away from his friend Lisa, he makes  a number of naive comments about his situation, he gets found, Lisa helps him with his outfit.

It's not a bad book, it's just not very original.",3.0

Nice case but my husband ended up not liking the trifold thing. I thought he would like to have a place for a notepad but he didn't. It was also too big for his bible even though I thought his bible would fit. I probably should have measured first though. That was my fault.,3.0
"I have a very large , large -print bible which won't fit in anything so tried this one but it is way way way too big",3.0
"Pros:
Well made.
The handle is not on the spine end of the Bible.
Reasonable price.

Cons:

A large book is heavy, so the fabric cover is bunched up when you carry it by the handle; putting stress on the bottom corners of the bag. My Bible exactly fits (a bit snug), so it's NOT because the bag's too big for it. (I have an HCSB Large Print Study Bible).

The fabric is like velcro, collecting white fuzz, even though I stopped putting it on beds or upholstery. Difficult to pull the fuzz off. A brush doesn't work. Looks terrible. It's not dust. I have no animals. Never had this happen to anything else.

The third flap that contains the paper tablet is awkward. If it try to fold that flap back to read, the paper on the tablet gets torn up. It's so awkward that I'd be happier just putting the paper in a pocket. That third section just isn't of much use.",3.0
"It fit my extra large print bible, which was good.  It has lots of pockets and zipper areas to store things, also good.  It looks nice for the price; however, it has no support.  It always feel very clumsy when handling it.  Even though it has lots of pockets things are always falling out of it.  I wish you offered a leather version or some type of stiffer material for this.  I also wish you offered it with a zipper.  I wouldn't recommend this to my friends, unless they are planning on only using their bible at a table.  It's hard to maneuver in a church pew when you're sitting elbow to elbow sometimes.",3.0
It was too small for my Dake Study Bible and too big for my current Bible but using it anyway,3.0

"Okay case for the Adventure Bible. Won't last long because of cheapness.

I bought this for my 7yo's adventure Bible to help keep it clean and protected. The material does seem a bit cheap, but it looks nice enough and he likes it. It's a very thin, weak feeling nylon. She LOVES all of the many pockets. There's always a place to keep whatever she gets at church that day.

The handle seems pretty secure, but I guess I could see that the material it's attached to could rip if it were treated casually. other reviewers have said it can fall off easily.

"My daughter picked this case, from a few I had chosen, and was SO excited when it arrived.  Unfortunately, her NKJV ""The Big Picture Interactive Bible"" does NOT fit nicely.

I knew that it might be tight but it is extremely tight and can not be closed in the case.  If I put the Bible in this case & try to close it, the zipper scratches the edges, the binding, of the Bible all the way around.  My little girl was quite sad that she couldn't use it to take her Bible to church on Sabbath.  Now I'm on the search again for a Bible carrying case.  Even though I think the size is too small, the handle seemed sturdy as well as the material.  I also liked the outside pockets and the two pen/pencil holders inside (one on each side.)",3.0
"Everything is great about this cover EXCEPT that it doesn't fit the leather Adventure Bible!  The Bible will fit in the cover, but it slips out very easily.

It is frustrating that there are so many great children's Bibles on the market, but very few options for covers designed for kids!",3.0

I just received it and my son has been using it for about 2 weeks now.  So far its worked out very well; holds his Bible and all of his sunday school papers.  The only reason it has not received the 5 stars is I want to see its durability.  I'm only working on 2 weeks of having it.,3.0

I guess isince it served me well for close to three years, I can't complain much.",3.0

"Prior to purchase, it was clear this book cover was not leather, but I was surprised to find the material extremely light weight to carry a book that needed this extra large size.  I like the extra pocket on the outside, and pen/pencil holders built into the inside.  I may weave something to add further support for the handle as the material feels too flimsy to last very long.",3.0
"When I first saw this, I perhaps bought it in haste, not realizing what I was really buying. I thought it was going to be the size of my bible, and it'd fit inside and open up with the handles. Turns out it's actually more like a small briefcase and it has a whole other bible case inside it (although it's just very simple with a snap-closure). There are a couple pockets inside for documents and a couple pen holders, as well as a little area to keep a notepad. It's cute and useful, and I don't regret buying it. It's already started to unravel along one edge ... it's not the highest quality product out there, but it's useful and a good price.

Overall I'd recommend it, although next time I might be willing to dish out some more money to get something a little more durable.",3.0
A little larger than expected,3.0
"Just received, leaving a review for appearance alone. Looks just like the pictures.",3.0
This is a lot bigger and heavier than I anticipated - it already has some weight to it so once you add a bible it's quite heavy. It also opens pretty wide which can be a problem if you have someone sitting next to you at church - it would be touching them.,3.0
"Very nice case but the actual Bible cover is a separate piece inside the zippered case, held in by Velcro strips. I had to detach the cover from the strips and keep pulling on the snap closer piece to get it to close over my Life Application Bible. The reason I chose this cover was so that I could be sure my Bible would fit. A little disappointed but will keep it and see how it works.",3.0
too big!,3.0
"I really like the style but again, it's listed as if it would fit a bible that is considered extra large, it doesn't.  This bag has an insert that fits a large bible.  The description should say that because it is hard buying products when the description isn't listed correctly.",3.0
"I have a paperback ""personal"" sized ESV study Bible and am having the hardest time finding a cover for it. It's a fat Bible, but shorter than the big hardback version and it's pages and covers are very flimsy. I bought this Bible cover because other reviewers mentioned an additional case on the inside. However, that case doesn't zip shut. It is merely flaps to cover the front and back (with pockets to tuck the covers of the book in) with a snap flap to close it. So, with a flimsy fat Bible like I have, it would just slide out the top or bottom and not be protected. The case itself has a lot of great features. However, it is SO large, that I would feel awkward taking it to Bible study or church every week because of how huge it is. It takes up a huge amount of space on a table. I'm just wanting something big enough to hold my fat Bible.",3.0

"I currently have this work in paperback form for my English composition class. It's a fantastic book - an excellent collection of essays, with useful notes in the margins and questions for the reader. I would recommend this book highly, not just to the college student, but to anyone diving into the world of literature in any serious way. This collection of works makes an excellent jumping off point for future readings.

So, why only 3 stars, instead of 4, or more? Because I own a Kindle. Not a Kindle Fire, and certainly not an iPad, but an actual Kindle Reader. For reasons unknown to me, the publisher has seen fit to ignore Kindle reader devices and only supplies this work for the Fire, or the iPad.

This book is not small. It's rather thick, and has some heft to it. I imagine, even in paperback form, if I launched it at someone I could do some bodily harm. It's no lighter in my knapsack, either, where I carry a variety of other books, a laptop, and the usual allotment of implements college students must lug all over campus (pens, stickies, cables, notebooks, folders, and of course, my Kindle). Trading the weight of this substantial work for just a bit more data on my Kindle would save some stress on my shoulders, further stress on the stitching of my book-bag, and result in a lot more rentals of this work by college students, who are more interested in reading the texts on their device than watching movies or playing Angry Birds.",3.0

"Even though this is the exact same copy and edition as the paperback version, no story/poem is on the same pages as in the paperback.

There is no Velcro attached so I had to use scotch tape. Which every time the month changes means pulling tape off of numbers and tearing them.,3.0
The box was bent. Everything was there. We use it everyday! I did not get a packing receipt to get reimbursed.,3.0
It was quite a lot bigger than I had anticipated. It does whatI wanted it to but I was hoping for something more professional looking. We have to use thumbtacks to get the pieces to stick and that looks tacky.,3.0
Would be nicer if there was clear envelopes/sleeves  to put cards In but overall it's a good product.,3.0

We love Peppa Pig in our house and have numerous books based on the show that we love.  This one is just alright.  The storyline from the show doesn't translate well into a book in this instance and I was a little disappointed about the quality of the paper of this book.  The illustrations are nice though and my daughter seems to enjoy it.  But if I would have seen this in person I would have probably passed on purchasing it.  There are better Peppa books out there.,3.0
"I am homeschooling my son for Kindergarten this year and I wanted this chart to help him see how to count by 5's and 10's. The description says it's layered with plastic so that you can write and wipe-away.

In reality, this product comes wrinkled, ripped, and in my particular case, some of the ink rubbed off of the word ""Counting"". While the chart does as it says in regards to the numbers, it is very poorly made.

I could have probably had a similar chart printed up at a professional printers for cheaper and with better material if I wasn't so busy. This item should be priced at half of what they are charging (it is currently $9 and some odd cents).

The back of this thin chart says ""Printed in China"" so I guess that explains the poor quality. I'm not usually one to spout off about ""Made in America"" but this is one product that has no reason to be made in China. I'm pretty sure we have the capabilities to produce this right here in our own country...

If you plan to purchase this, I recommend you prepare yourself for the sorry state it will arrive in. Maybe taking it to a place that can laminate it with the proper plastic would be best if you care to spend more money.",3.0
"It was sort of disappointing, my daughter thought there would be special class pictures (like the summary of the book claimed), but all of the pictures were just the exact scenes from the movies, like a quick overview, only not as well done. However, it did have exclusive ""signatures"" from the students of Ever After High and even cute little messages from them, so it made up for it.",3.0

I bought this book because our son likes the Chuggington TV show.  There were some reviews that talked about the dinosaur coming alive for no reason and I tend to agree with it.  The storyline is somewhat strange from an adult perspective but my son doesn't seem to notice or care.  He likes to read it and look at the pictures.,3.0
"I bought this tree for my students so I can put alphabets on the leaves then attach them to the tree. The whole thing worked fine, but I was disappointed that the whole thing was just thick paper. It was a slow job to detach the pieces and we tore a few. I would love to see this product done in nylon or laminated cardboard. I was hoping to reuse it next year, but I doubt that would be possible.",3.0
There is only 1 tree that COULD be made into either a small or large tree. I did not know this. I thought I was getting two trees which was a let down because I had planned for two but made it work with one. I made it into the larger tree by adding the middle trunk piece with the squirrels on it. The size looks about 4 feet. The picture seems to have more leaves of one color than you actually get but you can always make a few more out of paper and that would even add more interest maybe. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for there being only 1 tree when I thought I was getting 2 which is probably my fault for not reading closely.,3.0
"This tree along with the leaves served their purpose, but I wouldn't buy them again. It tore easily, when I tried to pop out the lea a few of them tore. Overall this product was just ok!",3.0
"It looks good but is a little flimsy. When i was trying to attach it to the wall, it ripped in one place. I had to tape it back. You may want to laminate it before displaying on your wall. I would look for an alternate in the future.",3.0

"I just found the materials it was made out of pretty flimsy and though it looks nice and has lots of elements to it, it won't really withstand a lot heavy duty use.",3.0
"I couldn't wait for this to come. My daughter was super excited to start using it as soon as the box came. However, I was disappointed that I had to find someway to hold the calendar's numbers and days of the week up. Guess, I should have looked into it more. I bought glue dots thinking that may work after I stuck the calendar to the wall with some packing tape. The glue dots did not work to keep anything up on the calendar. I am now thinking of buying velcro strips, or magnetic tape. Hopefully that may do the trick. I must say it is very colorful and fun to use with my 3 year old. She loved helping me set it up.",3.0
I got this as a gift for a child who likes to play pretend school. The shipping was very expensive for such a light weight item. It really is just cardboard on sticks. You can make it yourself. I give it a couple of stars because it's a good idea. There's not that many pretend school stuff out there. I was a little embarassed giving it as a gift. It didn't look like what it cost.,3.0

"Item is ok.  It really isn't what I was expecting, but it is decent for the price especially since it was quite a bit cheaper than what Scholastic offered it for.  It says it builds phonemic awareness, but I think that might be stretching it.  I guess I was expecting songs that reinforced the letter sounds.  They don't do that. Helps with letter awareness, but not sure it does much beyond that.  Each song is on a different track.  Some are rather short and then you need to start them over to play it several times for your child to get the hang of it.",3.0
My preschool class likes it but I think if they knew the song it would have been better.  I ordered this because the children can see the book great when sitting in circle time.,3.0
"The ideas are great and I look forward to using them, but the paper is so thin and cheap the opposite side of the page shows through the copy. So I'll have to recreate any of the ""reproducibles"" I'd like to use, which rather defeats the purpose.",3.0
I was hoping to find more activities in the book that I could immediately copy and use.  It was more of a specific organized plan for your centers.,3.0
I keep this board on top of the hallway table so that I can quickly write notes (which won't get lost until I erase them) and it folds down neatly so it's easy to hide when company calls.  I also like the size -- not too big and not too small.  Quality magnets hold pretty good but I use it mainly for notes. NOTE:  Children's alphabet letters don't hold very well - they tend to slide.,3.0
This is flimsy and won't get used at our house,3.0
"We loved this magnetic board at first, but within a few months the edges had started to rip apart. I liked that I could unfold the board for easy storage and that it has two sides, but the quality has not held up well.",3.0

The board size and mobility are a plus. However the market is so diffi hot to erase and I am using good dry erase markers.,3.0
"While I will use this at the table with my small groups, the whiteboard is really no more than the whiteboard covering with a sticky backing you can buy at office supply stores.  Had I realized this, I would have taken one of my used  Amazon boxes and covered it myself and just made one for much less money.  That being said, it is ok.  It does always not erase very well because it is not a real dry erase board.  PROS: It is light weight, I can easily carry it from room to room, it folds up nicely, it is a good size. And it is very steady on the table.",3.0
"I'll use it to make a scoreboard for our cornhole tournaments.  But, I thought it would be 32"" tall on each side.  Now I have to squeeze 21 pts onto 16 inches instead.  Looks like it will work anyway.",3.0
"The magnet isn't great, it sticks but not as well as one would expect.",3.0
Wears out too quickly. After using it a few times it became hard to erase. And then the creases started tearing.,3.0
Great product but a bit expensive.. but I liked it,3.0

the magnetic aspect could be stronger,3.0
"It works great as a magnetic board for working with magnetic letters. However, it is VERY hard to erase dry erase marker off of it. As a teacher, I am disappointed in Scholastic about this issue. I bought 2. One for my guided groups table and one for the kids to use in a center. I do like that they fold flat when not in use and they are pretty sturdy. I just wish we could ERASE the dry erase marker off of them without resorting to scrubbing.",3.0
It's ok. Tore within a year with minimal use. Velcro came off back.,3.0
Smaller than I thought but works fine. Would buy something bigger next time.,3.0

this is a nice magnetic board for the kids to carry around and play with the letter bought additional magnetic pieces from mellissa and doug to increase thier play time with them hope it works,3.0
"The board had to be put away for my 18 month old grand daughter and we used just the refrigerator for the alphabet intending to bring back the board when she got a little older. The wooden letters are not painted, but rather covered with a colored paper which becomes loose rather easily. Most of the letters lasted for about 2 months before I had to throw them all out. Fortunately she knows all her alphabet by name and we are using other means to teach her how to put them together into words. At age 2 she can now spell her name - Molly.",3.0
"This is just as I expected. It's not too sturdy but it stands up well. I'm not sure how long it will last, but my grandsons love plalying with it.",3.0
Hopefully I will have more use for it than 4 chapters. Seems far too expensive a text for the use.,3.0
"I suppose it has some good information, but I found this text to be ""thick.""  By that I mean, the chapters were wordy and it was hard to follow at times.",3.0

What little paper it contains is of a decent quality for taking notes or jotting down ideas. It fits conveniently in a purse or pocket. I feel that this butterfly notebook was worth the price, although I probably wouldn't be willing to pay any more for it.  I don't regret buying it, but I wonder if maybe a large, hard-cover journal might have been more useful, since I had originally considered using it for keeping track of my poetry ideas.",3.0

Bottom line is that the ""gold standard"" has become more and more streamlined.

In all fairness, the book is amazingly current, incorporating the latest research, e.g. decision making, neurocinematics, etc.

Sometimes, this comes at the cost of substance.

Biggest pet-peeve: The CD is somewhat useless. Where are the figures from the book?",3.0
"Text book.  Goes into detail about how you see, hear and so forth.  Was sort of a review of my high school biology class.  Would be good for someone who has not had honors biology.",3.0
"the book is fine, however the sellers title stated that it came with the virtual lab CD-ROM.  The CD is not necessary for my class but sometimes I like to use those things.  I am not happy that I was told I would receive it and didn't.",3.0
"Pros: All topics are covered in appropriate depth. There is very little arbitrary discussion.

Cons: Considering the book is about sensation and perception, there are two glaring errors that reduce the function of the book.

1. Put the diagrams on the same page as the reference in the text. Classically, it is traditional to put a diagram on the page after the text reference, but why? Think about what has to happen for a reader to connect the text with the figure. First I have to stop reading mid-paragraph, flip to the next page, find the diagram, and then flip back to the text and find where I stopped reading. This is inefficient.

2. The bolded terms are a dark blue very similar to the black. So if I'm flipping through the chapter looking for the definition of a term, I have to scrutinize the text harder than if the color was red or green, for example. Add to that the brightly colored diagrams which constitute an inhibitory field when trying to discriminate the dark blue text from the black, and you have a loss of efficiency without justification.",3.0

"This map was different than I had hoped for.  I'd hoped for a wall map which would show all the major interstates.  We have some foreign exchange students staying with us and I bought these to highlight the various places we've visited.  Unfortunately without the roads clearly marked, it was hard to do.

I ended up going to Barnes & Noble and buying (for the same price) the maps which work better for me.  The cost of postage makes it impractical to ship these back, so they still sit, new in the box, unused.",3.0

The map was just as the description listed however it is shipped in a cheap cardboard poster box and arrived crushed making it unusable for my intended use.  It has been relegated to the corner by my desk and will most likely become a donation or garage sale item.  Luckily it wasn't too expensive.,3.0
"This is a very nice map for the price.  Good clear text and all the major cities.  However, my only complaint is that it came flat in the mail.  So there are creases every inch or so that I cannot get out.  I suggest this should be shipped in a hard tube.  Take your chances.

"Folded like 8 times. Other than that it's good, should be rolled so it doesn't have crease marks. K bye",3.0
"I bought this and the mcnally USA wall map at the same time. I didn't really pay attention to the fact that one was coming folded and the other rolled. So I'm not counting stars off for my folly. However I did want to mention that if you are looking for a wall map get the rolled version. The folded version is a wonderful idea for a large map that could be gotten out to look at on the floor, then stored easily in a drawer or folder the rest of the time.

The stars off are for the quality. If you buy this do not spend over $5 on it (unfortunately I did). That is the top cost I feel is warrented for the quality of this. It is a good size. However it is basically printed on a large peice of cheap copy paper That's the thickness/durability and feel of the paper. There is absolutely no pretense at lamanation on this. I bought clear contact paper to put over it, which is a workable solution.

I bought this for our homeschool classroom, and while I appreciate having cost effective options, in hindsight I would have spent a bit more on a lamanated option that was rolled for our wall map choice.

This is still a nice choice for an easily stored, large world map- as long as the price point is met. I would not suggest the folded version for framing or otherwise displaying on the wall.",3.0
"Colorfull and complete but not large enough to use in a medium sized classroom, as difficult to see. Sturdy and informative. Good to have current country names.",3.0
It's smaller than I had pictured and folded quite a few times. For the price it's greatly detailed and I will be laminating it for my son to learn some geography. It is a very nice map.,3.0
The map was alot bigger than I expected but that's probably my fault for not paying attention to the size.  I still hung it up in my son's room with push pins but I guess the laminate is so thin that it is easily pulled away and torn from the push pin.  It will probably not be up much longer.  The map itself is good and good for young children.  It's just the size and quality of it I'm not happy with.,3.0

Damaged in shipping.  Looks as if pkg, was hastily and carelessly ""patched up"".  Map ended up creased.",3.0
"The size, color, clarity, shipping time, price are just great! BUT, this may be good if you have only grown-up children. The paper is so thin that your toddler may tear up or scribble on it and you cannot use it anymore! I wish I bought the laminated one. but come on...., the price is just double. so, I have to compromise....if you don't care about spending about 4,5 extra dollars, I would suggest you to go for the laminated one, though it is said to be very thin lamination.",3.0
Product itself was great. Packaging was awful and the map arrived extremely bent,3.0
With a thicker paper will be better,3.0
The tube was bent and the map had a bunch of creases.,3.0
"I'm having a hard time finding a frame for it, it is not a standard size.  Even for fun map I don't like to hang anything without a frame. So not really sure its for me but it is good quality and shipped supper fast.",3.0
It won't stay on wall unless you glue it.,3.0
Bought it for family reunion and didn't use it - no time.,3.0
I would have liked it better if the roads were in solid black.  This isn't a good map to decide cross country routes with.  Too hard to pick out the roads.,3.0
Has some major issues with tearing.,3.0
This map was a second option in my purchase along with the world one. It's good in information but it says it's covered in plastic to protect it as the other was and it wasn't. I have to be careful because it was for my kids to use it so that it won't break.,3.0
"This is a nice looking map, in a good size, easy to read.  But, the lamination is little thin. I not sure it will hold up with lots of moving around or use.",3.0
Its not mind blowing but good for the price. The only use of it that I see is to adorn my bedroom wall other than that its least useful.,3.0
Just an okay mediocre product.  Very thin paper and definitely very thin laminate.  Would not buy again but okay for now.  Better stuff out there.,3.0
"The map is rather bland, and some of the labels are too big and end up off the true location.  Seems to just be an older version reprinted.  Could use updating.",3.0
"I was expecting much more detail on national parks and landmarks.  Devils Tower and others are not shown on the map.  Also I really dislike the way highways are shown on the map.  Instead of being a thick blue line for interstates, the map shows two faint gray lines with the base color in between.  Bottom line...it it a step up from flipping pages on an atlas, I wouldn't recommend it, and I'm going to keep my eyes out for a better one.",3.0
"The details of the map were almost non-existent.  So I relied on what the reviewers said.  Mistake.
Reviews stated that you could write on it with a dry marker.  That the lamination was not the best quality, but satisfactory.  When the map arrived, I thought I received the wrong item.  There is no lamination at all!  Another of life's lessons learned.  The map would be nice under glass, but it is paper. Thin paper.",3.0
"THe map is great, however, the description on Amazon says Product Dimensions: 23 x 15.6 x 10.5 inches. Not exactly sure how a flat map has 3 dimensions so it is totally misleading. The map turns out to be 50""x32"", actually too large for what it wanted. I was hoping one of the two sets of dimensions would turn out to be right. Where they got that information, who knows?",3.0
"The map itself is a good map, just what I wanted.  The problem is the way it was shipped: rolled up without even a cardboard tube for support, then rolled up in a plastic mailing envelope.  There was nothing rigid in the packaging from Office Quarters at all to keep the map from getting crushed/bent, and indeed it was crushed/bent in one spot.  The map now has extra topographic features across the lower states, due to the wrinkles and creases.  Why not put it in a poster tube??",3.0
"We bought this map for our home classroom and it looks like it will be a perfect addition.  It's laminated, works great with dry erase or wet erase markers, but it WILL come damaged.  Many of the reviews comment on this point, but I decided to find out for myself.  Well, I got what I deserved.  The seller packages this map in a flat, rectangular cardboard package that creases the heck out of the map.  It's flimsy and so the post office seems to go out of its way to fold it every which way.  The map is functional, but I don't know if we'll ever get the creases out.  It's not the worst thing in the world except that it's so avoidable.  I can't understand why they wouldn't just ship it in a tube.  That would solve the issue entirely.  Buyer beware.  Note also that this map is shipped from a third party seller, and so it is not eligible for free shipping.  The fact that I PAID for them to ship it in a manner that was sure to damage the product also got my dander up.",3.0
"An inexpensive map for family room wall and used as a preliminary guide of directions, distance and points of interest. This map does not clearly highlight the major highways and cities that makes it less useful for travel planning.",3.0
Had wrinkles in it.,3.0
"Notice to anyone wanting a map the size listed...it is NOT 32 inches...it is 30 inches.  I purchased this product for a craft and had all of my materials to fit this particular size, only to be surprised when I went to put it all together.  The map was not the size listed.  The seller, in their defense, was quite apologetic and offered to work with me however they could.  They stated that they have asked Amazon to change it many times to no avail.  The map itself is beautiful and would have been wonderful for what I was planning to make.  I have since ordered a framed map from the same company and am hopeful that it will meet expectations.  The shipping was fast, and emails regarding the size, etc. were answered promptly and courteously, and despite the fact that I had already cut the map, they offered me a full refund.  I was very pleased with the company, just disappointed that the craft didn't work out because the size listed was incorrect.",3.0
"The map itself is beautiful, but at some point before reaching my house, the bottom part of the poster tube was crushed, which wrinkled the bottom of my map pretty badly.",3.0
"The map should be wrapped around a tube, as it was just rolled up in a plastic box inside of a cardboard box UPS flatten it. I was not happy. it is badly creased.",3.0
"Colorful and pleasing to the eye, yet has an ""aged"" look around the edges.  Would be gorgeous with a wooden frame.  very large (32""x50"").  Very good details on physical features like rivers, mountain ranges, lakes.  Paper is pretty thin.

Centered on Europe and Africa, with the Pacific Ocean split down the middle.  This makes more sense anyway.  Slight overlap (about 10degrees longitude) at the east and west edges of the map.  Europe and the Middle east get pretty crowded and there aren't as many labels there, but the terrain deatures are still there.

Concerning distortion--I don't know anything about cartography, but for $10 who cares.  You might want to consider the degree of distortion.

I posted this map right above kitchen table and use it very often, whenever a place gets mentioned that I'm not familiar with.  and it makes a perfect conversation piece.",3.0
If that's what they mean 'classic edition'... The paper looks as if decades old and ready to crack at any moment.,3.0
"The product arrived quickly, but like other reviewers said, it was simply wrapped in plastic and not protected at all. I was lucky that there were no problems with it. The whole experience is strange, as I accidentally ordered the non-laminated map earlier in the week and it came in a cardboard tube, fully protected as one might expect. Both maps from the same company.
I think Amazon.com needs to do a better job with their categorization and sorting. I shouldn't have been easily confused to ordering anon-laminated map when searching for a laminated one.",3.0
"I like the map, but expected that it would be shipped in a tube.  Instead it was just rolled and placed in a plastic sack and was crushed so there were lines.  I was expecting to place this on the wall in my sons room so it would look like art.",3.0
"The map itself is decent. Nice colors, good labeling. However, I did not expect plastic brackets on the top and bottom (to help with hanging and laying flat).

What really frustrated me was the shipping. It was shipped in two plastic bags, that's it. No tube or anything. I took it out of the plastic and it was very creased. Two large creases that will not smooth out running vertically and about twenty wrinkles which may or may not come out running horizontally. The sides that were on the end of the roll were also dinged up.

I will be returning this map to amazon.",3.0
Too big but a terrific map,3.0
I had expected more names of cities on the map.  It was not clear the criteyfir a city to be indicated on the map.,3.0
"The map is nice. I've enjoyed writing on it with dry erase markers. So far I've marked places I've been, places I want to visit, and random facts associated with that area. Basically whatever floats my boat for a month or so. I've also used it to help myself with world geography (a weak point of mine) and have used to teach my younger cousins (who I occasionally babysit) fun facts that the education system might never teach them.

Downside was how it arrived. Mine did show up a tube, so I just had to flatten it out, but the tube was a bit crushed and the one side was slightly damaged. It took longer to fix it. That could have been the people delivering it though, not Amazon and I seem to have gotten a better packed product then others who have reviewed this before me.",3.0
Nice map. It didn't arrive as soon as I would have liked.  I wasn't able to use it as planned but I gave it to my grandchildren. They like it.,3.0
"The map was smaller than the measurements indicated; however, I was able to make it work.",3.0
"Nice practical map. Could stand to be sturdier, but not too shabby.",3.0
they fold the darn thing up so when you hang it the creases are very visible,3.0
Had wrinkles in it,3.0
"The map was of good size and quality. However, I was disappointed in the way it was shipped. It was only in a thin plastic cover so the ends were bent up when it arrived.",3.0
That map wasn't the problem but the way it was packaged smashed it so now there are lost of creases in the map. This was suposed to be a gift so im a little miffed about it but the map itself is a good map.,3.0
"I thought I bought a 50 x 32 , but it was much smaller. It is still usable if you need it.",3.0
Packing wasn't good.,3.0
the map is nothing spectacular.  it arrived in good order and displays well.  it's a decent product for the price.,3.0
There was not as much detail in the countries as I had expected.  The quality of the paper and printing was very good.,3.0
"Purchased this map to compliment a United States wall map I had previously sent my grandson.  The map itself is fine and he loves it.  The problem is that it took almost two weeks for it to get to daughter's house.  Right or wrong, there is an expectation that shipping is relatively quick (as in 5-7 days).  Further, the tracking information was poor - the delivery range took it out to September 17th when I ordered the item on August 26th.  Thankfully they got it on the 5th, but there was no way to know that until it was actually delivered.

That's the reason for the three star rating.  So, good map, slow delivery and poor tracking.",3.0
"Good wall map that serves the purpose, however, it is not the quality, heavy duty lamination you may be used to--this one has a very light, thin sheen of lamination that makes it just a step better than regular paper.",3.0
"My own fault for not considering it but if you want a true depiction of the northern country sizes you need to get the map that shows the rounded earth. However, great as a reference tool!",3.0
"I  also ordered a Michelin laminated wall world map . The Michelin map had so many details ie. many cities within countries,mountain ranges shown in contrasting colors, just so much better a presentation,than this Rand Mcnally version. The Michelin version had thicker lamination making it more durable, country flags at the top and bottom. I believe it was also a few $ cheaper,The Michelin version is larger and more pleasant to view. A good 3X lighted magnifyer or so, really makes the details POP!",3.0
"The map is a great size and the lamination is perfect for hanging.  Unfortunately, the map does not include most cities and rivers.  Some countries have been either renamed or changed in some way and the map does not reflect that even though it is a current one.  I like it and have it hanging but wish it had more detail.",3.0
"The colors are too light to differentiate the regions, but it still serves its purpose.  I recommend getting one that has more vivid colors.",3.0
"Cool map, but  cuts off both poles. Also ""laminated""  is hardly what I would call the mild gloss on this map, so description at fault there.",3.0
"OK, it is a good size and plastic. Up to date (the 20120-2013 version.) BUT..... I found it sadly lacking in detail. A mostly blank map leaving lots of space where they could have included more detail. Many island groups of 10-30 islands are pictured as one dot. Where is Christmas Island? Diego Garcia? Tasmania? The Kamchatka Pensiula? Saipan? Yes, they included South Sudan. Gosh. Ok for some poeple. I'd pass if I had it to do over.",3.0
"The word ""laminated"" made me expect something a little thicker and heavier that what arrived.  I guess it means it's been treated so you can write on it? It's worth it for the price, though.",3.0
"The map was fine and useful but it did come crunched on one end. This is a problem that others mentioned but I thought that the shippers would have figured out a way to ship it without this happening. They didn't 't.
Too bad.
I couldn't iron out the problem so it hangs blemished.",3.0
"Excellent packaging.  Detail is pretty simple, and no boundaries are illustrated for the States, Russia, etc.  It's very basic, but good for a quick glance.",3.0
"My main complaint is that the lamination is very thin! When secured to the wall with push-pins, it tears-off very quickly! Just thought that people who're interested in this should know about it!",3.0
"The delivery was fine.

Room for improvement was the quality. It doesnt feel that good and quite cheap like. I wanted a nice one that i could frame and hang on the wall but it just doesnt work with this one. You get what you pay for.

Pros: Easy to hang up. if you have a hammer and a nail and a soft wall.",3.0
"we all have wall maps in our offices at work so the new CFO needed to have one.  This map is the right size and has a good color scheme.  Unfortunately it could not be used because the ""frame"" was not substantial enough to stand up to the duration of transportation.",3.0
I ordered without paying attention to the layout. We live in Hawaii and my wife flies to Japan. I will look into a replacement that has North and South America in the center so my kids can be shown the flight routes for vacations and moms working routes.,3.0
"This poster looks really nice. I ordered it for my classroom and have already received numerous complements on its appearance.

My major gripe with this was the packaging. poster is laminated and was somehow bent during the shipping process. there is now a noticeable line of wrinkles that run down the poser. Nothing worth sending it back for- but a little annoying.

-I would recommend this item be shipped in a tube rather than a box.",3.0
"The map does not show the current political status in Sudan which became two
countries last year.  The Republic of South Sudan in southern Sudan was established in 2011 and when
I purchased the map I expected it to be an updated one.",3.0
"the map is nice, but the packaging was terrible and left it with many creases in it that i can't get out.

it's decent but not something i would frame in this condition. good for educational purposes i guess...

if they fix the packaging problem, i would give it 4 stars.",3.0
"The map is good, cheap, but the packaging that came with was crushed and made
many permanent creases in the map.",3.0
"This map was much smaller then I though it was supposed to be, nice map though but not as detailed as I wanted it to be either.  I ended up hanging it up in my Nieces play room.",3.0
"has anyone know when this item will be avaialbe again to order? cant really wait i need to give it to my kid.

Thanks, RM",3.0
Not what i expected .  Wanted more roads for a trip i am planning .  Map did arrive in good shape and timely.,3.0
"Late to the review, but I ordered this back in December of 2010.  The map came folded and sandwiched between two pieces of cardboard.  Took a few days of flattening out under some weight and the same cardboard pieces to make the map presentable, but the creases are pretty much in there for good.

As others have stated, the map itself is great.",3.0
"As others have stated, my map arrived in box, not a tube.  The box looked like it had been sat on several times.  Needless to say, the map hap a bunch of creases on it.  I am planning to glue the map to a piece of foam-core to get the wrinkles out and make it easier to hang on the wall.",3.0
"Great map - too bad it was shipped by being rolled up and placed in a plastic bag, so it arrived rumpled and crushed, like I'd been saving it in the attic for several years before putting it up on the wall.  I whined to the vendor, who gave me a full refund, so I can't complain.  I would buy the map again, provided the shipping issues were resolved.",3.0
"The map is great but the ""Lamination"" is very cheap and flimsy. It gets the job done but I'm going to be careful in the future and make sure I buy a map that is more durable, Sturdy and actually laminated and not thin ""Plastic-ish"" paper.",3.0
"This is a laminate in the sense that it is not just plain paper, but not laminated in the way most people consider.  The map is not the standard piece of paper that has been taken to Kinkos and had nice thick plastic heated on both sides.  Instead it is some sort of paper/plastic material.  I purchased this to be able to mark on it with a dry erase marker and then erase and mark other things.  As of yet I have not marked on it because I am afraid it will not come off since it is not laminated like normal.  I guess this is why it is cheaper than  some other ""laminated"" maps.  It is still a good looking map and seems pretty durable.",3.0
"Pros: Poor quality & dull & dim color.
Cons: Right size",3.0
"The map itself is very nice - detailed, colorful, sharp printing, and good quality laminating. If only rating the quality of the map, I would have given it 5 stars. Our only complaint has been that the map was received damaged; the shipping box looked fine, but the map was dented and wrinkled in several places. We returned the map to Amazon and figured we had just received a bad map, so we ordered again through Amazon. Same problem - dented/wrinkled map and the shipping box looked ok. Returned and ordered a third map (this couldn't happen THREE times, could it?)...well yes it can! The third map we ordered was also dented in several places across the map. This third shipping box had a dent in it as well, but we're not sure damage during shipping is what caused the dents. So now we're sending the third map back and trying one last time for an undamaged map - couldn't possibly happen 4 times, could it?",3.0
Liked because I drive truck and i have to keep track of x ways i travel. Easy to see all x ways,3.0
"The lamiate was extremely flimsy, not for public display, maybe for personal use.  Good map, poor laminating.",3.0
ok,3.0
Cheap  quality!,3.0
"I agree with the other people.  This is a VERY thin laminating job.  I bought a world map by this company and it was excellent.  Laminated as I expected, so I took with a grain of salt what other reviewers stated.  After I received the map, I understood exactly what they said.  The lamination is VERY thin and it is not even trimmed.  I like the map, not the laminating job!  It came packaged very well!  No problems with that.",3.0
"The map itself is nice.  However, whoever rolls it & places it into the tube should be shown how to do it properly.  Mine arrived crushed and with a tear in it.

After seeing how many people have commented about the bad packaging,  would not buy this one again.",3.0
The map was covered in a plastic wrap and then placed in a large cardboard box. About a foot of the map was protruding from the box. The end that was protruding got bent and damaged. You would think that they could have shipped the map in a cylinder to protect it.,3.0
"Not the best map we have had on the wall in the kitchen as this is where we plan our trips, we have found it lacking in clarity and places of interest so we will not be buying these type of maps again",3.0
"Took ages to arrive and even though it was rolled in a tube it wasn't rolled very well and consequently looks as though it is folded. I've had it laid out flat for a week now but it's still creased.
Actual image is great though and it's really large.",3.0
We're taking a trip around the world this winter.  The laminated surface of this map is perfect for tracing our route with magic marker.  Our grandchildren will be able to keep track of our progress.,3.0
This chart is the perfect size for limited classroom wall space. Only regret is that there is a seam down the center of the chart which makes it unsuitable for long sentence stips if you want it for multiple usage.,3.0
"I was pretty excited to get this calendar (as I've researched several) for my switch to Kindergarten.  I thought the picture cards were going to be great to include special days and holidays but it doesn't come with many.  It only comes with 4 birthday cards, 2 field trip cards, and 2 ""special day"" cards.  As for Christmas, Valentine's Day, etc... nothing.  That may be fine for other teachers, but I really like to include that with our morning calendar time.  The plus side is that the cards can be used with wet erase markers and so if I don't figure something else out (like make my own cards for the holidays) I can write them on the number cards.  Oh well...",3.0
"these are great charts, but they are GIGANTIC.  I probably overlooked the dimensions when I ordered them (I'll go back and look to see if they are provided).  Had I known how large these are I would not have ordered.  They are well laid out, nice charts, but I just don't have that much wall space to add these amongst all the others we need.  :(",3.0
"This item is truly more for a classroom.  We bought it for our daughter but there are some many pieces and parts it is really for a classroom, not a child.  It is fantastic though in terms of what it includes, the colors and the fun.",3.0
This organizer serves its purpose but compared to similar organizers it feels very flimsy.  The material is most definitely not any variety of canvas.  I ended up having to add extra attachments to the wall to keep the papers in it from folding in on itself when I put papers in the pockets.,3.0
"The product I received is what is shown in the picture, but the item description is incorrect.  ""Includes 33 date cards""--no, it doesn't.  ""Measures (14"" x 46 1/2"") with 13 see-through pockets""--the pockets are blue nylon, as shown in the picture, and there are only 10, not 13.  It's a good item for the price, lightweight enough to hang on Command hooks, rather than nails, and it seems to be sturdy enough for my needs.  If you really need 13 pockets, though, take into account the three fewer pockets than advertised.  Personally, I didn't need the date cards, but I'd be pretty upset if I did, since they weren't included.

BTW, I gave the item 3 stars because of the description errors.  For my own needs, I'd give it 5 stars.",3.0
I think this will be helpful in my classroom this year.  I really wish  that the FABRIC WAS HEAVIER and that there was a magnetic strip on it.,3.0
I HAVE NOT FOUND A USE FOR THIS BOOK SO IT IS SITTING ON MY SHELF.  I THOUGHT IT WOULD CONTAIN SOME USEFUL TIPS FOR A PAPER THAT I WAS WRITING BUT IT DIDN'T.  I LOVE BOOKS SO IT IS ON MY SHELF IN HOPES OF USING IT ONE DAY.,3.0
"The differentiation information inside is a good reminder of stuff to keep in mind, but I will never use it because it is so gigantic. I could not carry it around with my binder and books because it is so much bigger than every thing else.",3.0
"Item was as described, just a lot bigger than I had pictured. It came rolled up in a tiny box so all the pieces are bent and do not stay on the panda at all. They will need to either be flattened or laminated.
Other than that great item for younger children.",3.0
This is very big. Plus I'm not sure how exactly you dress the bear for the weather. It's just a big cardboard cut out. How do you exactly use this?,3.0
"This is fun, durable & a great addition to our homeschool room. As far as I am concerned, we don't need numbers up to 30--you can use a calendar for that. The only reason I gave this item 3 stars instead of 5 is the pieces split between the capital and lower case letters a couple times. So if you don't have space for the whole thing, you will scratch your head trying to keep ""z"" with the letters. ""D"" and ""d"" are on separate pieces along with ""O"" and ""o"".",3.0
"This item shipped very quickly, however when it arrived I was disappointed to see that it was wrinkled and the corner was bent. It obviously was NOT a new product and wish this was stated before I bought it. This poster is for a daycare and will most likely receive a little wear and tear from the kids, but I wish it was brand new and perfect for parents to see for the first time. Thinking about returning it and looking for a different poster that is NEW...not used in good condition.",3.0
Very flimsy not worth $10.00,3.0
"For the $, I think the inserts should be been precut. I had to use my large paper cutter to cut them all out. There weren't even perforated lines. The chart is as described and I liked the dowel at the bottom to give it weight. Used dry erase and it wipes off every time you move them. Would suggest for a more permanent schedule using sharpie.",3.0
Mine came with cards too.  I had to cut the cards out by hand though and then laminate them for longevity.  Should have been done for me.,3.0
didnt care for dry erase,3.0
"Love the idea of it and would have been great but unfortunately I can not give 5 stars because I received the wrong slips for in the pockets, witch sadly makes it un useful for us!",3.0
it looks a little cheap,3.0
I was so excited when this arrived.  I wrote the number with a dry erase marker that wiped off as I moved the cards.  I tried overhead transparency markers.  They stained the cards!!!!  They are ruined before I even got to use them.  They suggested using crayons.  That is a joke too!,3.0
"It is finally here but not what I was really excepting, but it still does the job. Thanks for it.",3.0
"The details listed for this product are incorrect.  The size of this is 13"" x 33"" and there are 16 pieces.  It says so right on the package.  I picked this one because I thought it was going to be a bit bigger than the others.",3.0
"The pocket chart itself is great, the inserts however...when I write on them with dry-erase markers, Expo dry-erase markers at that, they dissapate. It drives me nuts. So I relaminated the laminated inserts just so I could write on them. But in all it serves it purpose. I do wish it came with more blanks so it could be used for a greater period of time.",3.0
Great activity but after being folded and shipped the plastic for the pockets was cracked .,3.0
"This is a TINY pocket chart.  I did read the dimensions, but I guess it just didn't register just how little this thing is.  I opened it up and wondered why I paid more than four dollars for this. It seems kind of cheap to me.  But, it is a sturdy little pocket chart, so I know it won't get torn up easy.  The straws are just small thin plastic straws (think-  coffee stirring straws).  The pocket on the front to store the straws inside of is nice.  The numbers and words come on two small squares of poster board.  The squares are not separated, but it's not a big deal to cut them. The numbers are also small. I I used clear matte con-tact paper to ""laminate"" the numbers so that they won't get torn (worked great).  I would say this is an okay item to purchase if you want it to teach place value, or if you want to use the pocket chart for something else altogether.  Just keep in mind, that it is a rather small pocket chart.  Putting it on a classroom wall would make it look even smaller.  I cannot imagine that this would work in a large classroom if you want to make sure everyone can see it.  A smaller, closer setting would be better.",3.0
"I was sad that within a month of daily use in my kindergarten classroom, the pocket is already shredded at the top, so not very quality construction.  I'm dealing with it, but I want others to know.",3.0
"I purchased this for my 3 yr old as we are doing preschool at home. I wish that the apple was not cut in half as it makes it difficult to set up. The biggest letdown is that this is not laminated, although the front paper is shiny and appealing it can be ripped, which is not good when you have a 3 yr old and a baby in the house. Wishing in the description that it had stating that it was or was not laminated.
Other than that it will be a great teaching tool for my children.",3.0

"I purchased this for my 3 year old in hopes that he wouldn't be tempted to remove it from the wall as he'd done with the peel and stick ones I previously purchased. The posters suit their purpose, but aren't dynamic in any way. I think I'll shop around for more colorful. Also, it ripped quite easily when I tried to retape it to another section of the wall.",3.0
"Great colors wish it would have been a little bit bigger tho, it's what I expected but not as big as I thought it wou be ,, but packaging was great and came in the mail fast",3.0
"This item shipped very quickly, however when it arrived I was disappointed to see that it was wrinkled and the corner was bent. It obviously was NOT a new product and wish this was stated before I bought it. This poster is for a daycare and will most likely receive a little wear and tear from the kids, but I wish it was brand new and perfect for parents to see for the first time. Thinking about returning it and looking for a different poster that is NEW...not used in good condition.",3.0
Durable but is not a wall paper and does not have an adhesive back.  More like a laminated paper. Tough to get to stick on walls around corners.,3.0
"In wanting to teach my 3-1/2 year old the concept of time through the learning about the calendar, I purchased this product because it had all that I desired: insertable dates, days and months into clear pockets.  However, what I failed to realize when I purchased this particular product, was that it was ONLY the dates.  lol!  That's what I get for shopping when the kids were awake!  (At least it wasn't expensive, eh?)  Anyway, I should have known something was amiss when a very LARGE package arrived.  I thought I was going to be getting a small, 8-1/2x11 wall-type calendar, not the gigantic Teacher-in-the-Classroom-so-that-all-30+kids-could-see calendar!  I think the actual overall product is fabulous and if we had a large living space (we live in an apartment), it would be really cool to hang in his room or in the kitchen, without it being the prominent ""work of art"" on display, but it's definitely a joy kill for small spaces.  So, I give it 5-stars for the concept, colors and value, but 3-stars for just being waaaay too big for a non-classrom type setting.",3.0
This was only the numbers for a calendar. It was not what I wanted.,3.0
Calendar holder NOT INCLUDED.,3.0
"The Calendar dates are great, but I ordered this expecting that it came with the blue pocket calendar it is advertised with.  I'm having  a tough time finding the pocket calendar, so I haven't been able to use the months and dates printouts.",3.0
I like the colors and can use these to teach patterns to my second graders while teaching them essential calendar skills.,3.0
I like these and they fit perfectly with this specific calendar pocket chart but I don't like how I had to cut them all out by myself.  Very annoying.,3.0
Did not come with the scheduled board just the cards.,3.0
a bit smaller than what i expected but if you are gonna place them in the pockets i guess it would fit perfect. I personally use it as a poster. you may also need to laminate it if you want it to last.,3.0
This does not include the holder.  Read the description closely since the photo shows the holder also.,3.0
"I thought this came with pocket chart, it should not be in the picture if not included. Now i have to go buy a pocket chart",3.0
Ordered and thought I was getting pocket chart and cards due to picture but only got the cards. They are great. The picture is just misleading.,3.0
"I made a mistake.  I thought I was getting the chart for an amazing price.  I failed to read the description that clearly states this is for cards, not a chart.  The cards, however, are sturdy and will be used anyway.  I like how they are blank so that I can fill in my own schedule options (which are not the standard classroom titles).  Also, they are perforated so I do not have to include the clock with them if I don't want to do so.",3.0
"When I ordered this, I thought it came with the pocket chart as well. That was my mistake for not reading everything about the product. Looking at the title of the product and the picture, I thought I knew what I was getting. So, I was a little disappointed. I like to get what I see, and I see a pocket chart. Wish the pocket chart wasn't in the picture.",3.0
"Although the product was pocket chart ""add-ons"" which were time schedules, if you were not clear on what a pocket chart ""add-on""  included, you might be mislead (as I was) by the picture, which shows the add-ons in an actual pocket chart, which is not included.
Other than that, the product was fine.",3.0
"It can be used in classroom or at home, when you are trying to set parameters of time, a routine or agenda of the day.",3.0
Good for struggling early readers,3.0
I didn't realize that they were much larger than the other Bob books.,3.0
"This is a nice product except for the quality of the sight words. First, cutting them out is risky. Kids do not need practice cutting out such a product. They have other, less costly, things to cut. Secondly, I don't intend to laminate them, and I doubt they will last very long. It looks pretty for now. My question is -- how long will it hold up? For that reason, I gave it 3 stars.",3.0
"Not good quality, overpriced.",3.0
It does not come with hooks which makes it hard to hang and use. I feel it should come with the product.,3.0
"I was so excited when I saw this pocket chart on sale. I looked at the dimensions and knew it would be perfect for my classroom. Two days later, it arrives, and the dimensions are WAY off. The product is 3 x wider than the description states. This pocket chart is not 10 x 40 like it says, it is 34 x 40. Total bummer.",3.0
"It's a good calendar to use when teaching days of the week and months.  I only gave it three stars because you have to cut on the days, date and months squares by yourself and the lines are very thin.  At this price, everything should be precut.",3.0
cheap material i would say its over priced,3.0
"With this planner you get what you pay for. The paper is so thin that everything I wrote bled through to the next page. I have doubts as to whether or not it will make it through the school year, but it doesn't have all of the unnecessary extra things that usually come with a planner.",3.0
You get what you pay for.,3.0
"I'm not sure if this is the fault of the company or of the mail service. But when I received my planner today it had a huge crease down the middle. Just cosmetic, but very frustrating. The cover is now bent and all of the pages inside have a permanent crease on them.",3.0
"The spiral wire on the one I received had been pulled and then tucked back in....about 3 inches of wire....so the pages don't turn right and I had to find wire cutters to cut off the wire that was extended past the notebook.  I needed this product NOW so I could not take the time to return it.  I am NOT amused, as I have to use a defective product for a year until it is time for a new one.  Quality control on what is being shipped out is slipping.",3.0
Boxes to write big in and customize w/color. No Saturday and Sunday located in planner- but there are plenty of extra boxes to customize your own. Love this planner.,3.0
"Its obviously not silver. Didn't expect it for the price. Nobetheless, its pretty and big. I thought it would be smaller.",3.0
Much bigger than expected.,3.0
"Very durable.. Except for the pin holding the spring. That will fall off within a matter of days to weeks. However, I've been using this without it for the past two years and the rest of it holds together very well! If you want it to keep its spring, you shouldn't get it though.",3.0
Serves the purpose.,3.0
"The clip is very hard to move and its smaller than it looks.  Wouldn't buy another one, but it works ok.",3.0
"Too small
Needs to be bigger and longer

loved it in the beginning but it broke after 3 months,3.0
"Appears to be Good Quality.  But does  the supplier have a Larger One ?  would be good to have a larger clip, To hook on a belt loop Easier.",3.0
It's hard to tell just how tiny these cards are. The picture makes them look much bigger. They are fun and cute anyhow.,3.0
Small. Beautiful cards but I wish I'd known the cards were so small. The size of the envelopes are given but the cards are smaller. Beautiful cards but I'll be mailing them in another envelope as they are small for mailing -- maybe too small. I've received so many punch studio cards and loved them -- but none were this small. Definitely too much money for such small cards.,3.0
"Pretty cards, but very small. Better to hand out than to mail.",3.0
I purchased these as greeting cards but I received blank gift cards.  Sent them back.  But I will say the gift cards were beautiful.,3.0
as expected,3.0
Did not realize it was filled with religious references. Will be purchasing another journal without religious references next time other than that the quality was fine.,3.0
"UPDATE (Jan 5, 2018):
I returned this item last month and only got a partial refund due to restocking fee. I tried getting back on it after coming back from Thanksgiving vacation and was on day 20-something, but the repetition wasn't useful for me anymore. My ritual was the same every morning as was 2 things to avoid at night. It just wasn't useful for me anymore and forwarding to the last weeks, it didn't change at all, so rather than spend another 1.5 months writing in a journal that wasn't proving useful beyond the first 2 weeks, I decided to purchase a proper planner for cheaper. Also, the strap broke. If you're charging almost $40 for a journal, the strap should be made to withstand use and not come off when I'm only on day 20-something.

UPDATE (Nov 16, 2017):
The price has increased to almost $39. A fair price would be $25.

UPDATE (Nov 11, 2017):
I'll take original review of 3.5 stars down to 3 stars. After another 10 days since my review and quickly flipping through the rest of the journal, I see that the format doesn't change at all other than the right side of the page being filled with new info (which is useful). But I wish the actual area one wrote in wasn't exactly the same day after day. I end up writing mostly the same things. This is unfortunate because at the very beginning of this journal they wrote: ""Most journals have the same jargon and setup on every single page, and after looking at simple cloned page tat you've seen for a week straight, you become desensitized."" Exactly. That's what has kinda happened with me here after the first week. I have to really remind myself to look at it, update it, think of new ideas, etc. The info provided on the right changes daily and most, but not all, are useful. This is good, but I wish the left side where I actually journal had some more variety to keep the momentum and focus going. I wish they'd also have less self-affirmations as I find self-affirmations in general cheesy and not useful. Also, I thought the point of this journal is to establish a morning routine that will help the rest of your day. In that regard this journal has helped me tremendously but I keep having to look past the constant insistence on waking up at 5am. I've done that before for previous jobs and ended up being depressed most of the day just as I would if I wake up very late. Some of us have different schedules whether it's biological or job related and can't wake up 5-6am. I also have bad insomnia and am unemployed so just waking up by 8am, mediating, journaling then being at the gym by 9am about 5-6 days a week is a miracle in my book. I have to thank this journal for that, but they keep going on and on about waking up before sunlight and before the rest of the world which gets irritating and makes me feel like I'm failing. I wish there would be more flexibility. But they've taken a one size fits all approach. I also would like more ideas laid out initially in types of routines. Also, should my most important task of the day also be part of my routine or are they separate? Should my morning routine be the same every day? Isn't that why it's called a routine? If so, then should I be writing the same list of things over and over or should I keep it different on weekends for example? I'd also like more examples on things one can do to improve life by 1% the next day. I sometimes run into a block and can't think of new ideas. Overall, there could be more clearly directions and ideas. Anyway, I don't mean to sound too negative as this journal has helped me a lot, but I really have to work it and tweak it to my own schedule and flow to make it work.

--------------------------------------------

Original review:

I'm on day 13 and this journal has helped kickstart a morning ritual of meditation and exercise I've continued with this far. For that alone, I'd give it 5 stars. But I'm taking points off simply because this journal is too expensive at $35. $20 would have been more fair. $25 should be maximum. My other criticism is that the format doesn't leave much physical and structural space in the journal for your own notes other than the fields already there (which get repetitive day after day). The section about 2 things I could do to minimize distractions at night I always end up writing the same things (i.e. don't look at social media) so I end up overlooking it often. The part about the most important task of the day says it should be tackled and done with first thing in the day. But my main tasks for many days are things I do later after my morning ritual. Yesterday my most important task was getting to the airport earlier than normal but my flight was at 3pm so it wasn't a task I could tackle first thing. I failed getting to the airport regardless and learned a lesson. Anyway, maybe the authors are targeting this towards people with corporate day jobs and the most important task at their job. As an artist, I don't have a regular day job (anymore) so this part I have to tweak. Overall I like this journal but the format is getting a bit same-y so far and I'm hoping it changes later on. There should be some small area for each day to write some extra notes and comments but I always end up writing on the margins and elsewhere. I'd also like if there were stories, profiles, and quotes from creative types. This is a good journal overall but you have to really work it and keep it handy. Overall I'd give this 3.5 stars but can't give 1/2 stars and 4 stars would be too high given the above criticisms, so giving it 3 here.",3.0
"Love the map-  initial reaction is it was thin and unsturdy, but that made it easier to take poster tape and hang.",3.0
"I, too, love the postcards. I participate in a postcard exchange and can easily find appropriate cards, especially for those seeking quirky cards. It did surprise me to learn that these require standard letter postage for delivery inside the U.S. I did not realize the USPS has a maximum size for the postcard rate to apply.",3.0
Scam.  Could make an iPhone app instead,3.0
Just what I was looking for.,3.0
"The clicker was listed as new, but I could tell from the way the box was damaged a tad bit that it was used. Even though it had tape on it and a 'New' sticker. Clicker also had stains on the back.. So thanks for that, sigh. But it seems to be working as of now. Just don't list something as new, when it really isn't.",3.0
need it for school so yea it works,3.0
"Decent, it gets the job done. The code rubs off of it, and you gotta open up the remote. But I mean you gotta give something for it being relatively cheap",3.0
"The Icliker was good. due to the class requirements, I had a little problem selling it to a student.",3.0
I had to buy it for class so...,3.0
"If your buying this item it is because you are attending a communist school that reigns over you with an iron fist, demanding you to buy silly clickers. Ratings on this product mean nothing.",3.0
An overpriced remote control. Only rated it as high as I did because there is an undocumented feature allowing you to reprogram the device.,3.0
On time and it works,3.0
I have no idea why this little piece of remote controller is $40 but it works in class. No need to buy the upgraded version.,3.0
"I had to purchase this for Nursing school. We maybe use it all of two times! It was a waste of my money. This item did work at it should, I just really didn't need it.",3.0
bought clicker used. seems to be working fine. saved money buying used.,3.0
"Product came in good condition, but it turned out to be one that I did not need.",3.0
"It works as it should, but I will never absolutely love an educational remote. I saw the new versions that kind of remind me of wii controllers, and although they're fancier and even have silicone cases available, if they're not required, then just settle for this ugly, old school clicker.",3.0
"I bought this remote ages ago and I still, to this day, remember how much of a headache it gave me. It was always breaking, not registering my answers, constantly needed to be set up, and was defective after a month. I remember always having to tap it on something to get it to work. However, it did get me through two classes so I can't really complain about it too much. Good thing I didn't pay the 30 or 40 bucks my school was charging. Yikes!",3.0
required for class... very basic and works... nuff said,3.0
"When I received the i>clicker, there was a single AAA batter lodged far inside the battery compartment, covered in dried-up acid. I had to smack it a couple of times to get it out. Works okay, gets the job done, which is all I can ask for.",3.0
its alright,3.0
"I got it for my biology class in college. It was required and it does the job. It turns on real easy in the bag though, so take out the batteries or something, that way it doesn't die so fast.",3.0
"This clicker works fine like the other ones on the market. However, for some reason it transmitted a different code than was written on the back. I referenced it against the source to correct it and have not had problems sense.",3.0
"It's an ok Iclicker that I am required to use for class, but I am more annoyed that I have to use it when I have a different type that I also had to purchase for another class. Why can't professors just pick one product to use!",3.0
"I chose this for a class I have.

It got the job done. Unsure how to play it up or complain about it.",3.0
"The most important part of an i>clicker is the ID registration number which was very worn and very hard to read.
Other than that it works well.",3.0
"Works as described. What a great money making gimmick for lazy college professors. Don't waste time getting to know your students or even permitting them to interact like human beings. Instead, make them buy an overpriced electronic clicker to catalog and track student responses like a police state. Brilliant. My only complaints are that it should require proprietary batteries that you can buy only from the manufacturer at outrageous prices, and it should bill you each time you press one of the buttons. Huge oversight that you can continue to use it all semester without paying again and again.",3.0
"Class is about to start and after ordering this seemingly overpriced device I found out there is an app.  Check win your professors and save yourself the money.  No offense to anyone involved with the product, but for the technology it is way overpriced!",3.0
"Second edition is out, and it is what I would recommend getting, but if it is okay to use a first edition it is a great product.",3.0
"It works, But one of the buttons get stuck every now and then. But besides that It gets the job done.",3.0
"The serial on the back was nearly illegible, which would have made it inoperable had I not been able to discern the numbers.",3.0
"I got it for my Anthropology course. Used it constantly and consistently in class. Definitely use a promotional code to get it cheaper if possible. In my college's bookstore, it was going for $30-$35.",3.0
"I used this in one of my classes and it tracked my attendance as well as was used to answer questions in the classroom. However, ultimately it was not recording my attendance 100% of the time so as with any other piece of technology, you have to make sure it's always working.",3.0
Well when it comes down to it this item worked. I just don't understand why classes use them they just waste time.,3.0
"Purchased this for my biology 101, used it only a handful of times.  Is a fine product but not worth the money unless you're actually going to use it.",3.0
"Needed it for a class, and not very commonly used; it's my first time using it through out my education career. I think the creator of this product is dumb.",3.0
Most likely you will be using it for a class and it gets the job done. Dont buy a used once since you cant reuse the code,3.0
"I'm not a big fan of using excess technology in the classroom, and some of my professors just use it to take attendance. If it wasn't for the fact that some professors use it for quizzes and participation points, I would find it a waste of money. The product itself works just fine, and the battery life seems to be good.",3.0
Seems to work just fine although at times it needs a little shake for the light to come on. It is clearly a previously used product.,3.0
This one came in kind of dirty. They're letting me return it. Ohwell guess is what happens when you try to buy cheap,3.0
"It arrived pretty fast, the only thing about it though is that mine came with the ID sticker worn out, or almost blank. I had to get a magnifying lens and light to get the code.",3.0
"The clicker is in good shape and came with working batteries, but there is no ID number on the clicker, which makes it hard to register it.  The back panel instructions are also different that the instructions on the one pictured on the iclicker website, so I'm not sure how old these models are.",3.0
"It works fine, but it's no substitution to yelling out the answer. Why allow everybody else the opportunity to ponder the question on their own? SHOUT OUT THE ANSWER. ASSERT YOUR DOMINANCE OVER THOSE PUNY MORTALS. YOU ARE THEIR GOD.",3.0
"I had to buy this clicker for a college class. This is the second brand of clicker I had to buy for a class (in my Freshman year). I wish the company would create an app for Android/iPhone users to help deter cost. Luckily I found this product on Amazon for $20 new, which is about half price.",3.0
"i ended up getting points off in class because it did not arrive when it was supposed to. it also had some kind of gunk on it, kinda gross. at least it came with batteries...",3.0
Product works well but the batteries are difficult to remove and if left in a bag or back pack can be turned on easily.,3.0
"Product came as expected.  No problems with it.  Teacher was able to incorporate it at the class room with its unique ID, no registration required.  I plan on retruning it when class is complete since this is the only class known to use it at my school. So far so good.",3.0
"To give you some background, the only reason I bought this was because it was required for a number of General Education courses offered at my university.  And therefore, being a college student, I did not enjoy having to shell out any more money on materials, the iClicker included.

It does its job well, and the battery life is excellent, but it is an unnecessary piece of technology.  The same function could be accomplished for free by simply raising your hand.  But if a professor wants to take surveys in class in a speedy manner while maintaining confidentiality, then the iClicker is the answer.  It's just a shame it costs as much as it does no matter where you look either online or at a bookstore, but at least it does what it is advertised to do.",3.0

Very cute book.,4.0
Such a cate book!  My grandson loves corduroy!,4.0
cute story,4.0
I am a fan of Corduroy and of Dan Freeman's books. It's a sweet story about friendship and it is perfect for bedtime. Just long enough without too many words for a tired adult to read. :o),4.0
"The book was in beautiful condition for it's age. However, it is the standard hardcover edition for that book. From my experience it is not a ""Big Book edition"" (as advertised). A Big Book edition is usually a term for books that you put on an easel to read to a large group.",4.0
"After loving the original Courderoy all during my childhood, and seeing how much my little one enjoyed it, I ordered A Pocket for Courderoy and was a little dissapointed by the story.  It still contains Don Freeman's lovely artwork, but it seemed a little forced for me and the part where courderoy almost gets thrown in the dryer was a bit disturbing considering how fatal that could be to a little child who thinks it might be fun to do that too...",4.0
"Teddy bears and kids go together like peanut butter and jelly. This classic children's story sticks well together,and the kids are sure to be stuck too.
This little bear is a bit shy. He is almost childlike going through the various motions of his adventure. Being of a child's view point is a huge plus with young children. He is faced with obstacles a toddler may have to deal with.",4.0
"I likeed this book for my daughter. She loves the Corduroy character and identifies well with the book. The same characters from the previous Corduroy series, Lisa, and her mother and new ones like the artist, and the laundromat manager. Corduroy remains the same mischevious bear as he wonders away in search of a pocket. The story line is great for 3+ age group as it teaches children about what what goes on at a laundromat and other social skills like staying near mom or dad.",4.0
"I ordered this book, because I thought it might be helpful for my Bachelor Thesis, which is about social entrepreneurship, its definition, differentiation, their values/motivation and ethics.

At the beginning I was really disappointed from the book, better said the first two questions.
It does not really answer the question ""What is social entrepreneurship"" with giving a full definition, it just describes the history and why it evolved, but not what it is. Same with the next part: ""When did it emerge as a global movement?"": It just gives historical facts to its emergence but it does not clarifies when, where and why...

But the next question-and-answer sections were really well answered.

Often the section answers not directly on the questions or very broad and also covering answers from other sections/questions. I am not completely through I just have written Chapter 1. So this is not a complete book review so far.

But I can definitively recommend the book to get a basic knowledge and good understanding of social entrepreneurship.
Its also a pleasure reading it and you get to know much more than just the knowledge about SEs :-)",4.0
"What do you get when you combine business skills with social conscience? A social entrepreneur. Social entrepreneurs recognize when a part of society is stuck and offers new ways to get society unstuck. They don't just give a fish or even teach people how to fish. They revolutionize fishing. Examples in the book of social entrepreneurs are the micro-loan Grameen Bank, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee. This book is great for people who see a big problem in society, e.g., high school drop out rates of 50%+ among Hispanic males, divorce rates 50%+ and unemployment rates of 10%, and tackle the issues using little money but lots of energy and innovation.",4.0
would recommend,4.0
"This book goes a long way toward helping the uninformed lay person about the nature, history, impact, and promise of the social entrepreneur movement.  The authors provide multiple examples and draw from a number of disciplines to explain the movement.  This demonstrates one of the principles I take away from the book--social entrepreneurship is an interdisciplinary activity.  This is one of its strengths but also one of the challenges to its implementation.  A good read.",4.0
"I have a strong interest in social entrepreneurship ever since I envisioned a social enterprise (and as I grew disillusioned with Government and the progress of other NGOs and nonprofits). I was hoping that this book would give some insights in the direction of social work and some ideas of where we could take things. I was right. I got loads of insights and ideas and feel motivated to make the move to change the world.

This is not a how-to book for creating a non-profit or social enterprise, but is a great introduction to social entrepreneurship. I recommend it as a starter read to understand the challenges of creating one, and to get inspired as to how you can overcome them.",4.0
Complete and easy to read book for those interested in getting introduced and learning more about social entrepreneurship. Recommend all of Bornstein's books!,4.0
This is the best book I've seen on the business model of Social Entrepreneurship. I highly recommend this for anyone interested in helping our society through their business.,4.0
Provides good examples and puts things in perspective. Makes you feel like an inadequate human being at times. I call that motivation.,4.0

Good delivery. Nice bible holder. Has lots of pockets. Thank you,4.0

I do like that it keeps all things easily @ hand ...
I do use it all week to study me Sabbath School Lesson ...
I use it also on a weekly basis to carry lesson & Bible to church ...

Bought it for my granddaughter's bible.  She loves the pockets and the style.  Yes I would recommend this to a friend.,4.0
"WE bought this for my daughter's first bible and she loves it.  The size is right, and allows her to carry her AWANA book in the outside pocket.  The cover seems to have held up to the wear and tear so far and we pleased with the product.",4.0
"The Bible cover is nice and my daughter loves it. However, I ordered pink and a blue one was sent. It was for her birthday, so she opened it to discover the wrong color. We were disappointed. Everything else is positive.",4.0
Very cute bible cover. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I bought it for my daughter's Adventure bible.(What it's made for)It's on the too roomy side. Her bible falls out easy. She loves it any way.,4.0

good,4.0
"I love this cover! I am tired of my kids destroying bibles and their bindings. This cover works well and my daughter loves the pocket on the front to keep a pencil/pen/stickers, etc.

My only complaint is that the Adventure Bible Junior Bible does not fit in it very well. The bible very easily falls out if the kiddo tries to pick it up when it is unzipped. This is frustrating, but overall it serves its purpose and will work better when she gets the older kid Adventure bible.",4.0
Arrived quickly and my granddaughter loved all the extra pockets!,4.0
Perfect bible cover!,4.0
Just what my granddaughter wanted for her Bible,4.0
It is hard for little hands to zip.,4.0
Gave it to my 10 year old granddaughter with the Adventure Bible. She loves the color and all the pockets. It seems pretty durable.,4.0
My daughter likes this backpack type Bible cover.  She is able to put some pens and a little notebook in the pockets.  The cover does protect the Bible.,4.0
Fits the bible as it should.  Pockets for things collected at church.  Daughters like them and the bible is protected.,4.0
"The quality was good, but the size was not as shown in the description, so it did not fit my daughter's Bible.",4.0
"This is a great bible cover - it has lots of pockets and places to put extra notebooks or paper for note-taking during classes.  My kids use their bibles at Sunday School and at camp, so it is nice for them to be able to have somewhere to place the paper for their notes - and somewhere to put all of the paper they get to bring home.  There are also a couple of slots to hold pencils/pens so that everything you need is right at hand.  Perfect!

The reason this was given 4 stars instead of 5 is that the bible tends to slip out of the inside pockets during use, leaving it unprotected as the kids are not likely to put it back in while using it.  They just close the cover back, leaving it out of the pockets on the inside (so it is closed in the cover, but not encased on the inside).  They are using the Adventure Bible's this cover was made for, so it seems the cover is a bit oversized or not-quite-the-right-design for the bible.  However, we love the other features enough to overlook this one!",4.0
"My daughter loves this cover and it was a great price.  Very durable, and the color and construction is very good.",4.0
"My kid loves this cover.  Love the pockets and the strap.  It does a good job protecting the Bible.  Only problem is that it doesn't stay on the Bible as well as some other covers I have had.  Which is very odd because it was made for the Adventure Bible - which is what we have it on.  It is just a little too big.  When the Bible is closed it stays on fine.  When you go to close your Bible, that is when it can slip right off.  Not every time, but enough that it annoys me.  Doesn't seem to both my kid though.",4.0
Just what I was looking for for my grandchildren.  Simple to understand with good illustrations.  The cover is great to keep the bible from getting torn up.,4.0
"Wish the Bible didn't swim around in the cover quite so much, but it serves the purpose to protect the binding.",4.0

Great bible cover with lots of compartments!  My son loves it!  My only complaint is the front pockets are so bulky that that bible doesn't lay flat when opened.,4.0
"One small complaint...I purchased this with the EARLY READERS version of the Adventure Bible which is smaller and does NOT work well with this cover. Otherwise, the cover is pretty cool. A couple of handy pockets. Has a nice youthful look without being babyish.",4.0
"This cover is great for kiddos who continually break bibles and their bindings! My kids love the  pocket in the front. It's a great place for stickers, pen, pencil, etc that they get from church.

I do not like that the Junior Adventure Bible does not fit in it well. My younger kids pick up the case with the bible without zipping it and it falls right out. I'm not too worried about it because I always try to double-check to make sure it's zipped, and it works well with the older kid Adventure Bible so they can grow into it.",4.0
"We have the paperback Adventure Bible for early readers for my son.  It doesn't really stay in the case well, but makes it easier for him to carry to and from.",4.0
"I bought this for my 8yo's adventure Bible to help keep it clean and protected.  The material does seem a bit cheap, but it looks nice enough and he likes it, which is what really matters. He LOVES all of the many pockets. There's always a place to keep whatever they've given him at church that day. He has one of the Adventure Bibles that clasps shut, which means we weren't able to take advantage of slipping the front and back covers into the case. Instead, he just clasps the Bible shut and places it in the case. That's fine though, it'd be that way with any case he got for it. It'd be hard to read it in the case anyway when he's got the pockets crammed full of stuff. The handle seems pretty secure, but I guess I could see that the material it's attached to could rip if it were treated casually. I've told him that he can carry it by the handle, but I've asked him not to swing it around by the handle because other reviewers have said it can fall off easily. So far, so good. All in all, nice case to fit the Adventure Bible.",4.0
This cover is too big for the Boy Scout handbook.,4.0
"I bought this for my son's Boy Scout manual. There are pockets inside that indicate a book can be held in place using the front and back cover of the book. Unfortunately the book doesn't stay in the cover once it is unzipped. Despite this, the price was too good to pass up. Overall my son is happy with it.",4.0
Ordered this to go with the bible. Love the case overall. Very we'll made. The only issue I have is it's just enough to big that if you aren't careful the front or back comes out of the case. Hoping I can fix that with a little double sided tape.,4.0

"Bought a bunch of these as a gift for the Webelos Bridging over.  They were a huge hit with the boys.  The only down side is that the book isn't quite the right size so the part inside that holds the cover under the material isn't quite right.  If it was my own son, I'd probably cut a cardboard or something to help hold it in place.",4.0
Worked great for the current Boy Scout Handbook. Needs the spiral bound edition. The compass is just a gimick and its really heavy so we took that off but it keeps the book safe and has extra pockets for all the random bits and pieces that often would get shoved into the handbook.,4.0

I really love this item for my son whos 8yrs. great on the material is slightly cheap.,4.0
"This is a nice product. Has many areas to store pens and tablet and even keys or some change. It is a little more appropriate for adolescents, but it works for me, too. Great price, as well.",4.0
"Purchased for my son to use when carrying his Scout Book. It's mad wit through numerous camping trips - including a week at summer camp! Zipper and velcro hold up very well! Nice feel with handle and ample inside room - including a space for a pen/pencil. Only complaint was the compass - the clip broke about week two and compass was lost. Not a big deal as my son uses a better quality compass anyway but if you're buying it for the compass, I'd suggest placing it in a pocket or adding a sturdier hook.",4.0
"We use it for my son's scouting book. The scout book is smaller so it slips around in it.  But I as a mother like it and his book looks a lot better than his brother's who doesn't use a book cover.  I also realize that my son has everything in one spot--book, pens and other things he might need for his meeting",4.0
A little big for a Boy Scout handbook but it does the trick.,4.0
works good but the book cover flaps inside does not hold our book in them,4.0
"Good book cover for Boy Scout manual. Has extra pockets for Whittlin Chip cards, etc. Son has brought on 2 campouts and other outdoor events, cover has provided good protection. Plenty of room to carry paper and pens. Compass is nice addition, but is not high quality. Do not rely on this compass for orienteering requirements.",4.0
fits my kids scout book great and gives him a zippered place to store papers so they don't get lost,4.0
"If you are using this as a cover for a boy scout handbook, get the medium size.  Even that one is a little big.  The book covers do not stay in the flaps.  But there is enough room for several pens and pencils, a small pad of paper, and the big pocket on the front can hold a few merit badge pamphlets.",4.0
"It's durable, practical, and looks nice. The only thing to be mindful of is that the mesh that forms a long pocket for utensils in the front is thin enough for the pointed parts of pencils to wedge in and break the mesh material if pushed too hard.

"Nice quality and fits the boy scout handbook perfectly.  I had some old name tapes around from when my husband was on active duty, and sewed one on the flap.  It came out very nicely.  If you are looking for drab green holder for either a Bible or the Scout Handbook, this is definitely worth taking a look at.  My son was very happy with it.",4.0
Great product. I got it for my son's Boy Scout handbook. It is a little big and I actually used the cardbard it came in as a stiffener. But he can keep an extra small pad for notes in it. I put a name tag on the flap. It would be 5 stars but the compass while lookign quality is pretty much worthless. 3 of us all bought the same item and none of the compasses point true north. (or even the same north),4.0
"We purchased this Bible cover for my son.  The cover is great quality canvas and my son loves all of the zipper and velcro pouches to store notepads and pens.  I know the compass is more for decoration, but my son, being a cub scout, thought it was awesome.  However, after several uses the compass has fallen off and does not work.  It would be nice to have a working compass, but the point is to cover the Bible and protect the pages.  This cover does a great job of protecting my son's Bible.",4.0
I love the product. Great for organization. Is heavy once you add Bible.  I am constantly using it.  I love that the cover can be taken out separately.,4.0
"My wife really liked the look of this organizer, but it is a little big for her bible.  It should be nice for her bible studies once she gets to a point when she needs to keep additional items in it along with her bible.  If you are considering this for a purchase, take note of the measurements of your bible and this organizer.  There is a bible cover sleeve that comes with this as well, which is nice.",4.0
Perfect for new Bible! I'm a happy customer.,4.0
"I love my bag, but I wish it had zipper pockets.",4.0
My Bible did not fit as stated otherwise it would be an added protection for your Bible. I am disappointed because it did not serve my need.,4.0

love it,4.0
More than I expected!,4.0
"I have a huge parallel Bible and I had the hardest time finding a new Bible cover because of its size.  It fit in this one, though to be honest it is two pieces, a smaller one that goes over your Bible and the bigger one is for carrying your Bible as well as any other study items you may need, but it worked for my huge Bible.  There is also extras like a pad of paper for notes, highlighter and pen.  The light color means it gets dirty easily, but it has been cleaning fairly well.",4.0
"This Bible cover fit my large-print NASB like a glove.  Not only is it practical, it looks great.",4.0
Good deal; fits my Bible and handy,4.0
"Rugged handsomeness is what I'll call this.  When you're shopping for a bible cover for a child you don't want something plain, you want something that might add a spark to it.  For the girls you easily add the flowers or the gems but for the boys that aren't into camo there isn't much out there.  This seemed perfect.  Once I got it it seems really sturdy and I love all the pockets and the compass, it gives it that special touch for a younger boy (and my girls like it too) but is something that will still work in 10 years.  The only problem I had was it was a tad small for what I needed (a hardcover a Catholic Children's bible) so I had to put a paperback in it instead.  It would have been a problem if I hadn't purchased this and another cover for 2 different kids with 2 different bibles.  So make sure to double check your dimensions.",4.0
Son loves it for his bible!,4.0
Too big for use as a Scout book cover but is good quality.  The pockets are too small to be useful though.,4.0
Enjoying it very much. Very cool.,4.0
I really like the cover with the pockets & pen holders inside & out.  The non-metallic zipper operates quicker & smoother then the metallic zipper on my previous cover (not this style).  I like the color too.,4.0
"Great case. It's too big for my sons current bible, so he uses it for other thigs. But we decided to keep the case knowing he'll upgrade to a different bible in a few short years.

Very nice bible case. However it was way to large for my bible in all reality but it still does its job of protecting my bible for me.,4.0
Good product. Wish the inside package would hold bible better.,4.0
I bought this for my 8 year old son.  He really likes it.  It is designed to fit oversized bibles.  His bible is large but not huge so sometimes the bible slips out of the pockes.,4.0
My son loved the case. But he didn't get the size right for his bible. So it was way too big. So he just acclimated and carries all his other stuff in there too. It is a cool case.,4.0
My daughter is going to love this.  It fits her Bible (a standard size Bible that you would find sitting in a church pew/chair).  There's another slot that fits her mini-hymnal as well.  One complaint is that the flaps that hold the covers of the Bible inside doesn't go out far enough - so I had to supplement with some cardboard inserts that I cut from a cereal box that keep the Bible cover from flapping out of the case's cover.,4.0
"this is a cheaper product, but it will still protect the bible from wear and tear. I cannot complain about it.",4.0
"A really great bible cover for younger boys. Purchased this for my 9 year old son. It fit his bible perfectly and has lots of fun pockets to put other ""boy"" things inside! My old sadness was discovering that the compass was broken.",4.0
"I purchased this for my husband.  He loved it because it did not look like a purse and because of all the little pockets.  He carries his ""e""reader"" in it.  The compass is only decoration, it was easily removed. The bag is not padded, but if you have a cover on your ""e""reader, it works well.  The bag opens up fully.  We were happy with the purchase.",4.0
"I think the compass is just for show because it points where ever it wants. Also, this is much smaller than advertised. The tag read 9.25"" x 7.25"". Luckily, it is still the exact size of my Bible. I am happy with it, and I won't be returning it. It is well made, feels durable with a sturdy zipper and the color is a DEEPER green than picture. The photo is a little washes out. The bag is actually more of an army green.",4.0
"I ordered two of these Bible covers for my MacArthur Large Print Study Bible and Matthew Henry's Commentary. The books measure 9  x 6  x 2 -inches. The label on the package indicates that the cover will accommodate a book 6 7/8 x 9 5/8-inches. First I thought the covers were too small, however after inserting the book into the cover it just fit. The cover's not leather but the quality is very good.",4.0
"The quality of this Bible cover is very good. The look is also just as advertised. Overall, it is an outstanding product. However, the dimensions listed (12.3 x 9.1 x 2 inches), while they may be the dimensions of the Bible cover itself (I didn't actually measure it), do not indicate, or even come close to, the dimensions of the Bible it will hold. I have an ESV Larger Print Study Bible and it is HUGE (11.25 x 8 x 2.625). This Bible cover will only hold a Bible up to 9.625 X 6.875. Fortunately, I have another Bible, of a more typical size, for which this cover will work just fine.",4.0
"Bible cover looks of good quality materials and stitching. Very nice looking and can easily be for man or woman. Good zipper as well. Book will lay flat when open. Would be a great gift item too. Front of cover has a very nice looking 1"" small/subtle cross embossed in the lower right hand corner.

My bible dimensions are hardcover Bible 9.5 x 6.5 x 1.4 inches. My cover has an extra 1/2"" inch left around the front, top and bottom after I inserted my book. It was the perfect fit for this size of book.

I feel the cover will last several years. One thing - I do wish the handle was made of thicker leather. (That alone would of added several more years to its use.

I will be using this cover daily for my Bible to and from work/church - so, in several months, I will add additional information on here to let you know how it is holding up. Hope this review has helped.",4.0

"Fits the new Reformation Study Bible just released.  Overall I am happy with it but suspect the lifespan of this cover will not be exceedingly long.  It would be nice to have more than the one front pocket but considering the price, I am very happy with my selection of this cover.

After using a couple of weeks, I would buy this cover again and recommend it.  So, in my mind, this product has gone from good to very good.",4.0

Awesome cover!  Bought one for me and husband..... Not 5 star because it's sorta masculine. Size is great for a large study Bible.,4.0
"I like the worn-in look of this cover, it seems sturdy and has some nice features. I do not like it is made of cardboard underneath the plastic ""leather"" appearance. I'm afraid to really use it harshly due to the probability of bending the cardboard and ruining it's clean looks. The feel of it is not of leather, no of leather-like products. It's plastic and certainly feels like plastic. If I had the money i would definitely buy a real leather cover, as any bible deserves to be protected with leather.

I like the handle and the pocket on the front. I've found that those are both very useful additions to a bible cover/case.

My bible is approx 9.5 x 7.75 x 1.75 (I think) and there is a bunch of room available inside, which bothers me a bit, but according to the size info the Large would not have fit. I had a hard time trying to find a cover that would fit it (looking online) so I went with this one. Overall I am pleased with this cover. I would have rated it 5 stars had the sturdiness inside been made of plastic instead of cardboard.

The zipper works well, sticks slightly on occasion but not enough to be bothered by it. I do like that it is a thick zipper.",4.0

The ""Coal"" color is definitely Black, not a gray, so keep that in mind, as well.",4.0
"I love this bag - it fits my mega bible and some notebooks and has a pen and highlighter!  I would give it a 5 but my ONLY reservation in doing so is that it is a little hard to grab the zipper and pull -it gets down to the spine so far that I can't quite get to it very well to get the zipper going.

"This bag will work just fine for what I wanted it for. I read many reviews before purchasing and I'd like to clarify things I still had questions/concerns about. This is not an ""extra large"" bag. But the demensions don't lie. It is what they say they are. I don't have an extra large bible that I needed to fit in it, and my standard size bible fits perfectly. Because I don't have an extra large bible and because I'm not using this case as a jacket cover for my bible, (I wanted more of a carrying cas) I can use the flaps as pockets for my notebooks and devotion book, as well as tucking my bible in the other side. There are 2 holders to keep pens as well. I even through my small clip board in there which I keep all of my church's weekly bulletins. Zipped it all up and have everything I need for church or bible study all in one case. Exactly what I was looking for. I didn't give 5 stars because I do find the quality of the case to be a little ""plastic"" like, but not enough to return it or not use it. (And..it was really inexpensive) and I also think the design of the zipper is poor and it's hard to get started when you're ready to close. All things considered, I would definitely recommend this item to keep you organized and ready for your study!",4.0

Love this product. Was delivered on time . Properly packaged. I have placed two of my Bibles in this case .NIV Paper back (Larger Print ) Zondervan and the Holman NKJV Large Print Personal Size Reference .

"Love this cover! It's well made, it's sewn together and honestly I expect it to last me a very long time. I'll edit this or post in the comments if I have any problems so if you don't see any here, then know it's still going well.

The only thing I don't like, but fully expected for the price, is that I believe this to be faux leather. Still, it's not cheap plastic or vinyl. This feels very durable. I'm very confident in saying this.

I bought it to go with my new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Large-Print-Life-Application-Study-Bible-NIV/dp/1414359764/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Large Print Life Application Study Bible (NIV)</a>&nbsp;in hardcover. It fit perfectly well. I wrote a review on that Bible and the link will be in the comments, if you're interested.

This particular size does fit that Bible very well. I mean, as I put it in the other review, it fits it as snug as a bug in a rug. I couldn't have been more pleased. Just keep in mind that I don't think a soft cover will work well with any Bible cover. They get more and more flimsy as the years pass.

There isn't much more to say except that I'm very excited to own this one. I totally love it.",4.0

Smaller than participated,4.0
Every Bible Bible case and I love,4.0
"Nice item but it was too big for my needs.  My bible is the KJV study Bible by Nelson.
There was at least an extra 1.5 inches at the top of the case, and a little too much remaining width.  I thought I measured accurately, but I guess I didn't 
It's also not as shiny as the picture appears.
The handles seemed secure and the zipper was smooth and pretty quiet.
I returned it for a different cover in a smaller size.",4.0
I love it. Easy to carry and fits my extra large bible.,4.0
"I love it, however, the measurements are off.  Product says it's 13.5 x 9.6 x 3.6 but it's actually 11 1/4 x 7 3/4 x 3 so my bible doesn't fit.",4.0
"I BOUGHT  THIS BIBLE CARRIER BECAUSE I HAD JUST PURCHASED A NIV SUPER GIANT PRINT BIBLE. THE BIBLE CARRIER WAS ADVERTISED WHEN I MADE THE PURCHASE THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT THIS  PARTICULAR BIBLE ALSO  BOUGHT THE CARRIER.  SO, I BOUGHT THE BIBLE CARRIER.

WARNING FOR YOU.  THE BIBLE DOES NOT FIT.  IT IS TOO LARGE.  MAYBE MY MISTAKE AS I TOOK IT WOULD FIT MY BIBLE WHEN IT WAS SUGGESTED TO BUY IT.  GOOD PRODUCT JUST BAD SUGGESTION.",4.0
"Just received the bible cover and it is beautiful. One problem, in the product description it's dimensions are listed as 13.5 x 9.6 x 3.9 inches. It's actually 11.5x7.5x3 inches. I'm keeping it because I have enough women in my family that one of them will use it. But, I have to find one that has the listed dimensions. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars.",4.0
I like it and it fits my Bible great.... I just wish I had looked a little closer and discovered there were no pockets to hold my cough drops.,4.0
"Very nice case, but did not fit my husband's bible. I would surely use it if your bible is this size.",4.0
Outstanding Bible cover.  I'm very satisfied.  The only thing that could make it better is if it had an additional pocket or two.,4.0
Such a lovely bible cover. Good quality.,4.0
"This Bible cover is very sturdy,  and big enough to carry my medium/large size Bible with room to spare.  It is among the more stylish carrying cases I've seen, but the leather is not the highest quality available.",4.0

Well-made. Nice handles. I wish I had ordered black instead of burgundy.,4.0
"It is a nice looking case. Note that it is NOT leather; it is leather-like. This is not a bad thing though because if it gets dirty, it can be easily cleaned with disinfecting wipes and not ruin the material. Fits my bible perfectly. Wish it had an accordion pocket inside to hold a note book or flyers. Great item for the cost and I believe it will hold up to the amount of use it will get.",4.0
"Just like one I already have. It was advertised as being made of leather, but I am sure it's not which is disappointing but I guess considering the price it would make sense that it's not, but should be reflected in the description.  The spine seems as though it will break down as the cardboard is not strong.",4.0
"Imitation leather, but does the job for covering my large print NIV study bible. Looks like it is well made and will last a long time. I am happy with my purchase.",4.0
Very nice!,4.0
Nice bible cover.  Looks well made and holds my large bible with room for a pen and could probably also hold a small notepad.,4.0
"I like it, but it is a tight fit for the Large print NIV. No extra room. Doesn't look bad, it will do for the price!",4.0
"It worked very well for me since I have an oversize bible. Would have rated it with 5 stars if it had a small outside pocket for pens,pencils,& note paper.",4.0
"I'm going to use this as a bookholder/tablet holder/small briefcase for interviews. It's the perfect size. I wish it had an internal pocket or two. It has one zipper all the way around, so when I open the bag, I have to be open this like I would a book (which was what it was intended for, obviously). I just loved the color and wanted an interesting and different accessory for job interviews, business meetings, etc. It appears to be well-made. I like the double handles.",4.0
"I love the quality of this product, my only complaint was that my bible (although I measured my bible and compared to what was said online) is noticeably too small for this cover, so I am disappointed.",4.0
"I purchased this particular case for my ex-large size bible.  I wish it had a little more room. It was difficult to judge the size from the website, but again, it is a very nice and durable carrying case.",4.0
"I like it, but wish it had more room for pens and markers.  It fits my NIV Study Bible fine.",4.0
I like the way this bible cover is made. The only thing I would change is I'd love to have it in the pretty purple and with a little bling on it.,4.0
The cover was everything I expected.  It fits my bible perfectly.  The only suggestion I would make is it would be great to have an outside pocket to slip notes and programs into without having to open the case.,4.0
"I like the cover that I ordered and have no major issues with it. I did, however, think it would be a little bigger, since it's an extra large. Barring that, it's a nice cover, and I am currently using it.",4.0
"I do appreciate the warm rich color and texture of this bible cover.  I expect the quality workmanship will hold up for a number of years to comes.  Perhaps the only thing missing is an outside pocket on either side that would make it easier to slide in notes,  etc. rather than opening up the entire case when on the run.

Definetly worth the cost.",4.0

"a World of Ideas: Essential Readings of College Writers, is a good book and seems to suit my needs in the college English 2010 course I am taking.",4.0
The book came in the exact condition specified. The shipping was very quick; I eneded up getting the book before the estimated dates arrived which was very convinent for school. I'm looking forward to the deal that allows me to send the book back at the end of the semester in order to get most of my money back. That being said the cost was substantially lower than it was for me to buy through my bookstore. I was very pleased with the service and will consider doing this again in the future.,4.0
another textbook i bought with amazon which also was a great buy for a new book compared to buying a used book that was more expensive at school bookstore. the only thing wrong with this purchase was that one page from the book was larger the rest other then that amazon books are the best way to finding less expensive books for your needs!!!!!!!!!,4.0

"It is a great book and I love the way it is set up. The themes of the book as well as individual selections were very interesting to read and made it exciting to go through and learn different styles. However, I didn't enjoy having to go online for some of the readings. If I wanted an eBook, I would have purchased that instead. Having a physical textbook means not relying on patchy internet connections just to access a textbook for a freshman writing class.",4.0
This was in good condition and arrived as expected.  Just wish I new how to return for  credit when finished with the class.,4.0
this book has many little stories captured into one. it is a very inspiring book for English. This is a recommended/ required book for college in English 2.,4.0

"I rarely brought this book to class because most of the stories were online and I'm allowed to use my laptop in class.

It was difficult to do the assigned homework because my professor would write something like, ""Read pages 300-365"" and, because she had the paperback version and I had the hardcover, her page 300 and my page 300 were totally different sections. Something must be off-- perhaps an extra page was added to the hardcover, setting off the pages slowly one-by-one?

So, if interested in this book, buy the paperback version. :)",4.0
"My 3yo loves this book! He asks to read it EVERY night.  The story is fun and engaging.  You can hunt for the missing dot on every page, which he enjoys.  The illustrations appear computer generated which is not ideal.  Also, the author could have chosen a different object to teach the ""c"" sound rather than a cherry.  It may be confusing for a child just learning phonics. But, my son loves loves loves the book so I have to give it four stars!",4.0
"This book is so fun.  It's part ""I Spy"", searching for the missing dot, part fashion show as little ""i"" tries on a star, a heart, even a ladybug in place of her missing dot, and just a great story too. The i-cing on the cake is that it keeps kids engaged while learning the alphabet.",4.0
"Vivid, colorful illustrations are the first feature readers will notice about this new title by Audrey Wood, but the story will keep them coming back to this delightful book. The lively, lower-case letters, called Charley's Alphabet, have a problem - the little i has lost his dot and the letters must help find it or they can't go to school. The story draws the reader to the conclusion, even answering my question, ""Who's Charley?""  Children will enjoy searching the illustrations for the hints about the ending. While there are many alphabet books, this one has great appeal for the young child, including a plot along with opportunities to repeat the alphabet.  As a school media specialist, I look forward to sharing this with my young students.",4.0
"I'm returning to kindergarten after several years and struggling to reinvent the wheel. I found AlphaTales to be a good, cost effective way to help build my classroom library. My students really enjoy the alliterations and letter cheers.",4.0
"I like the books, but it didn't come with the case to hold all the books. Cute books for little kids!",4.0
"Some of these stories are really cute (The M book for example) while others are pretty silly and leave a lot to be desired in a story. The point of the books however are to help the children understand how the letters of the alphabet are used to make words. My preschool daughter is just starting to connect the sounds of letters with the first sound in a word, these are very helpful with that skill. If you have a preschooler and are willing to work with them to learn new skills I would defiantly get these books.",4.0
"This is a handy set that we will use in our business. We have an art-based preschool that ties in the artwork with a letter of the week. These books provide the perfect length, each telling an alliterative tale that sticks with the kids. A wonderful and fun supplement.",4.0
"This is one of the better tools I have found for getting my son (4 yrs old) to get interested in reading.  He wants to get a new letter book every night and morning.  He follows along and has started sounding out the words on his own.  While some of it is memorization, other times its not.  This is fun and practical.  Some of the letter books could have better words (like icicle for ""i"" over and over), but most are excellent.  I would give it a five star but for that lapse.  definitely recommend to the pre-reading crowd.",4.0
"Great calendar, my 3 year old loves it.  I bought a roll of contact laminating paper and laminated the pieces for about $5.  This will help a lot since the pieces are just thick paper (like notecard thickness).  I also glued the calendar on a large piece of foamboard.  Other than that- very nice.",4.0
Great product and very helpful thanks it will look great and be a great addition to my classroom.,4.0
"Nice size, colorful simple pictures and a nice font.  Just wished it was laminated...cost me $50 to laminate it at Kinkos.",4.0
"I bought two rolls of velcro for the numbers and taped it down to a dollar store foam board. I love it and we use it everyday but even though the paper is thick and shiny on the top, with the pulling on and off the calendar every month I worry I should have spent the extra money and laminated it to ensure it lasts.",4.0
"I was a little disappointed at first, but after we punched out all the pieces and laminated them I think it's gonna work very well for my preschool class",4.0
"It's nice but is too big, is not what I'm expected to fit on my wall.. this is really for classroom.",4.0
"This is super cute and I actually really love BUT even though they have several of the holidays and even some rather obscure ones, they DO NOT have Memorial Day.  That was the one disappointment for me.",4.0
This is an excellent tool for preschool. I have used this in a daycare setting as well as a hime setting.  I laminated the pieces and attached velcro dots to make the pieces more sturdy so they will last longer.,4.0
"We love our calendar. We use this every morning for at home preschool. I laminated and cut all of the number, weather, week day, and holiday cards. I only wish there was a way to laminate the calendar itself. I also wish there was a good way to attach and detach the calendar numbers. I suppose if my calendar was laminated I would feel better about attaching velcro circles. If anyone has ideas, let me know! Other than that I would recommend this for the price!",4.0
I have not yet given this gift; perhaps at Christmas for preschool classroom.,4.0
nice but could be sturdier.,4.0
Really nice.,4.0
"My daughter wanted to have ""teacher supplies"", so this is one of the things we gave her.  I added little adhesive velcro stickers and they have worked really well.  The kids love this and it's fun for us to put up special days or holidays so that they can count down.  Great purchase!",4.0
"Good product, not very sturdy. This is great for adult-use, as kids would bend and tear the pieces. I help my daughter use the calendar and it's held up well. Would be good for a classroom as long as the teacher is the only person using the pieces. I like that there are so many options to the calendar - very thorough.",4.0
Bought this for my 4 year old daughter to get her ready for kindergarten.  It's a great learning tool!  Laminated it and will stick it on a board.  She is also learning to recognize her numbers using the calendar.  Love it!,4.0
I bought this calender for our home classroom. The kids really like it. It comes with every possible special event and holiday piece to put on the calender and two sets of numbers. It has a days of the week paper that you can place the day and the weather. It is big and colorful. The only thing that would make it better is if it were laminated or coated because it will rip easily. I laminated mine so it lasts longer otherwise the numbers will quickly get wrinkled or damaged from wear and tear. I think this is a great price when compared to other class calenders and I would buy it again. I plan to get lots of use out of it!,4.0
We are homeschooling preschool and this was perfect. My son loves it and I was able laminate all the smaller pieces. My only complaint is that I wish it did come laminated. It would be easier if I didn't have to do it. But other than that I love it!,4.0
"This is a wonderful design. It has everything you could ask for with a student calendar...and it is bright and colorful.  However, unless velcro is added to each piece or push pins are used, there is no easy way to change the calendar every month.",4.0
"Love it! I would've given it 5 starts if it came laminated. I bought a cheap roll of clear contact paper from Walmart. That did the trick. Took some time covering it with it and cutting it out, but def worth my time. Great buy! Highly Recommend!!!",4.0
"The calendar is perfect for your home school classroom.  It helps teach the little ones the days of the week, months, weather, etc..My only wish is that this was velcro/magnet. I have push pin holes everywhere.  One day in my ""spare time"", I am going to put the little velcro on the back of each piece and on the calendar.",4.0
"This is a good little calendar set. I laminated the school house with contact paper to make it more durable. As well as the months, weather, etc. I did not laminate the days and special days squares, because there were so many, but I would recommend it if you can. The illustrations are cute and colorful, and it like the school house design as well.",4.0
This is a good deal. It's bright and simple. There is more lessons and things to color on the back. My daughter can read all the words clearly. I just wished the arrow came already attached. Why do I need to assembly something this simple? So ridiculous.,4.0
"I really like this chart, I just started homeschooling (""Regina Caeli Academy just in case you were wondering) so far circle time is my sons favorite part of his curriculum, which includes listening to Catholic children's songs and classical, calendar time, and weather time. It did not deserve 5 stars because it's flimsy, which means you have to get it laminated before using which was an additional cost for me since I don't have a laminating machine. However I think it's adorable and functional for my sons grade level (1st grade ASD)",4.0

There are lots of signatures which is great and some comments by certain items throughout the yearbook.  Lots of things are expected like who was voted most likely do to this or least likely to do that.  Overall it's a nice addition for Ever After High collectors.",4.0

I have been slowly adding some of these Peppa books to her collection, as she loves to be read to. She also loves swimming so I knew she would enjoy this one. She knows all the characters, and loves pointing them all out. This book is cute and colorful, however I personally thought it was lacking a little bit as far as the variety of pictures. Each page is pretty much the same with the characters in the pool, with some slight variations. However, as you can tell from my video this book has been well loved in just the couple months that we have had it. My daughter wants us to read it to her over and over, and she carries it around with her all the time looking at the pictures. So although the pictures are a bit repetitive to me, my daughter loves it and that is what matters most. There are 23 pages total not including the cover page, and there are just the right amount of words on the pages to tell a nice story without losing her attention. Overall I like this book, it just isn't my personal favorite in the series. I still would recommend it to anyone with a child who is a Peppa fan.

"A VERY SIMPLE BOOK

My kids love the entire Peppa franchise. But this book is on the lower end of the scale. It's just not as entertaining as the rest. Peppa and his family go to the pool....and go swimming. That's pretty much it. There is no real story to speak of.

It's a decent bedtime book because it's very soothing and calming. It's also got value as a book to let a kid read by herself because it's simple and they can get the entire story just from the pictures. (And anything that makes a kid sit and read by themselves and be interested in it is a very good thing)

The coloring is vibrant. I'll give it that. The coloring of the illustrations captured my 4 year old's attention.

But the other Peppa books are better if you're looking to buy only 1 or 2.",4.0

I am placing it in and out of storage and allowing my 5 year old to hold it while he is counting, so I expect it to last at most a year.",4.0

The activities start at a simple task to more difficult.  Our son is 5 years old with Apraxia.  This is a wonderful tool for at home therapy along with professional therapy he is receiving.,4.0
"At first I was worried that Chuggington would be a modernized version of Thomas the Train. Boy was I wrong. Both the TV show and the books are great. In this particular book, they encounter a new dinosaur - a Photosaurus. It was part of a display for a new museum exhibit. But soon they realize the dinosaur is a great height for taking pictures. So with the help of friends and a friendly exhibit, Wilson gets his pictures for the new posters. We have only read a few of the Chugginton books but the colors are super bright and vibrant. The stories are fun and this book will get kids by having both trains and dinosaurs. Awesome story for Chuggers young and old.",4.0
"I got this book in PDF form very inexpensively.  My daughter loves it, and it is really helping her with her pre-writing skills.  My only recommendation would be to make copies, because it has helped my daughter to be able to do the same pages multiple times.  She likes getting used to the pages (she's only 2) and sometimes that takes more than one try.",4.0
This tree is really nice. Sturdy then construction paper tree. Bright and colorful. Looks really nice in my preschool classroom.,4.0
"My 5 year old son really loves this tree. It is colorful, a good size and worth the price. It is more sturdy than the constuction paper trees that I have made in the past.",4.0
"Nice size and easy to put up, the tree just looks a little spooky if that makes any sense.",4.0
"Good quality laminated heavy  duty paper tree.  Could not write on leaves with pen, dry erase, or permanent marker - ink would pool up.  Not sure what kind of marker you need to write on these.",4.0
"I am the librarian at a small K-12 school; I love decorating my door for each season or holiday and went looking for a tree so I wouldn't have to try to draw one. I'm very pleased that I decided to buy this one! I love that it can be adjusted to the height I need, and having leaves for both fall and spring is great - I'm definitely going to be using this many times throughout the year. The one thing I don't like: the squirrels in the middle section. I thought these would be an optional thing that you could remove if necessary, like the leaves. You can't, if you want to use the tall version of the tree you're stuck with the squirrels, and they may not fit with what you're trying to do. Otherwise I'm very pleased and for the price of this tree I couldn't ask for more!",4.0
Up in my classroom right now.  Refer to it daily for spelling the words and PV.,4.0
this is a very long border...just keep that in mind..,4.0
Very tall border.  I use it to cover the rubber molding at the bottom of the walls in my classroom.,4.0
"Very 'cute'..great for teaching days of the week/months etc., You will need to add a few items to complete, but leaves it for personalization!",4.0
"It serves it's purpose.  It's a little flimsy, but to homeschool my pre-kindergartener it's fine I suppose.",4.0
I laminated all the pieces and it has helped them hold up against my 3 year old. Great for in home teaching or In a classroom.,4.0
Wished it was a little more durable maybe laminated,4.0
"I liked this product. However, I didn't realize I would have to do some work in figuring out how to stick the days onto the calendar and so forth. So, I created flaps, instead of using Velcro or magnetic strips. It works. And my daughter loves it.",4.0
"Used most of it, some was redundant, but nice to have backup material",4.0
Good buy,4.0
"I loved it! It was great for teaching my first grade classroom. I enjoyed this very much so.

I liked the amount of holidays it includes. I though the sunshine format was very interesting and a unique-way for students to get excited. Also, I liked how it included weather, day of the week/months of the year.

Overall: It was amazing!",4.0
"came on time, good price, good condition. not the best quality but for what i wanted, it worked! you need to put your own adhesive (velcro, tape, whatever) on the back of everything to get it to stay up",4.0
My daughter will begin teaching soon.  Not sure if she will like these or not but I like them very much.,4.0
These deserve a five star if they happened to be sturdier.  I bought them for my daughter to use in her play classroom at home.  She loves them.,4.0
These are cute signs that are helpful in class.,4.0
kids love it,4.0
My 5 year olds love them for playing school.,4.0
"My niece is a primary school teacher.  She asked for a No Yell, Bell.  Given the savings of that item I also got these Class Signs.  She loves them too and finds they add to her management of the class room.  The kids really feed off the signs and she has noted that her classes (even the ones she is the substitute teacher for) all like the signs.",4.0
"Used this flip chart every day, all school year in my kindergarten class- my only complaint is some of the songs are really short. and only sung one time, making it difficult for the kids to learn it",4.0
"This flip chart is well-made and sturdy with really big, colorful pictures, but I like the calendar time one a lot better. I just feel like the ABC songs are okay. Sometimes they are a little long and not as catchy as I would like. I think that shorter, more simple rhymes would work better for the ABCs. But with that said, I have some other teacher friends that have used this and loved loved loved it. I just couldn't get into the songs. But I really loved the calendar time flip chart, so if you are choosing between the two, go for the calendar one.",4.0
My students loved this ! I used it in a special ed class and the students enjoyed singing everyday. It was worth every cent.,4.0
"my 2 1/2 year old loves these songs.  i think some of the songs could be more targeted to the subject letter, but it's still a lot of fun.",4.0
"I've used this chart in my PreK classroom for over 6 years now.  It's great!  The kids love most of the songs and we ""hunt"" for the letter each week with a dry erase marker.  (Note: The dry erase marker comes off easier if you erase it at the end of each week instead of the end of the school year.)  It's durable - it's lasted me 6 years and is just now to the point where I think I should replace it.
Most of the songs are to catchy, familiar tunes.  There are a few songs (2-3) that basically just go through a random list of letter-vocabulary words (kitten, kettle, kite, kazoo - thus 4 instead of 5 stars) and the kids have a hard time remembering all of the words to those songs.  However, I printed off clip art to represent each item and show the pictures as we sing and that seems to help a lot.
We sing the letter song for our focus letter every day at the beginning of our phonics block.  After singing the song, we do a quick activity.  On Monday, we discuss the meaning of the song since there are sometimes vocabulary terms the students are not familiar with.  Tuesday/Wednesday we listen for the letter sound - I say each word of the song (without pointing to the words so that this is strictly an aural task) and the kids have to do a specified motion if the word I'm saying starts with the focus letter.  Then we sing the song the ""silly way"" by over-emphasizing the words that begin with the focus letter.  This usually requires me to sing a line and have the students repeat it.  Thursday/Friday we look for the focus letter and students come up to circle it on the poster using the dry erase marker.
I leave the flip chart out in my ""teacher center"" and the kids always come up and use the pointer to ""read"" the poster and sing the song.  I don't think I could teach PreK without this wonderful tool!",4.0
"This book has some great and usable ideas.  Some  the pages were a bit wordy for first grade and I was expecting a bit more from the book, but I did find a lot that I can add to my centers right away.",4.0
This is a great board.  It would be even better if it was a bit larger.,4.0
"Nice easy to use, wish there was a little more velcro to secure. But overall not to big or to small.",4.0
I really like this board. I just think it is a little pricey. But I bought it along with some magnetic money and we also already had magnetic letters and numbers. My six year old son is having a lot of fun and learning using all of these things together. I would recommend it for a learning tool.,4.0
"This magnetic board is good for my toddler.  He loves it.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only becuase the trifold design is great, but the velcro that keeps it together doesn't hold up to my toddler playing with it.  So I had to tape it together to keep myself from having to do it over and over again.  I would recommend this however to anyone.",4.0
Some how the Velcro that holds it into an A-frame came off. Not sure what happened. We would have given it five stars if it wasn't for the velcro.,4.0
It is simple but works great. Only issue was the velcro started to peel away from the board on the bottom.,4.0
"Nice little board, good for play and teaching",4.0
My little one loves this,4.0
Eventually after several erases the board doesn't seem to erase as easily and cleaner must be used to get the shadows from previous writing off.,4.0
"Nothing against this product,  it serves it's purpose but my son wasn't interested.  We bought a full size easel and he prefers that.",4.0
Works fine.  I hope the stand hold up!,4.0
"It works.  But here are my pros and cons.

Pros:
* easy to set up and put away
* holds the little magnetic letters

Cons/complaints:
* cardboard-like, but not dollar-store-like
* not metal
* magnets don't slide, but you don't get that strong magnet feel you'd enjoy with a metal board
* not confident it will last, but it's not flimsy

Bottom line: it will last just fine for toddlers learning letters or for using magnetic icon cards, but put it away after use.  I probably should have gotten a nicer tabletop easel like M&Doug brand to last, but this one is OK.",4.0
My grandson loves this!!! This was going to be a Christmas present but I couldn't wait.,4.0
It's okay! Not the quality I was hoping for but the next step would be an easel. Good way to find out if your child would use something more expensive.,4.0
"It works great as a magnetic board, but not so great as a dry erase board. It doesn't really erase clean, as the marks are still seen after erased..",4.0
Great item to have with your magnets. My son plays with this board while I make dinner and do other things. We also use it as a ramp to roll his cars down.. Can't beat it.,4.0
"Smaller board than I thought but works good, my daughter likes it.",4.0
"We loved this board. Worked perfectly fine with our expo markers and foam magnets. A couple months in it did get torn on the top after some toddler handling. It was easy to tape up and lasted a few months after that incident as well. I really like that this board stands up! Eventually the tape wasn't holding and the board would no longer freestand.

I'm in the market for a new board now and probably will not rebuy this even though we loved it. Hoping to find something a little more durable this time around.

This board is great for 5yo+ or toddlers if they're supervised.",4.0
My grandson loves it.  It's just the right size for tabletop use and the cost is reasonable for the product.,4.0
It is a little small for what we had in mind but it works for what we are doing.  Layering of magnets doesn't work.  A little flimsy.,4.0
This was a big success as a gift for my nephews.,4.0
My four year old grand daughter loves this.  I purchased it with Melissa & Doug Magnetic Ltters and Numbers.,4.0
"Great for my classroom,  need soapy water to clean, but good otherwise",4.0
My great grandson 16 mos old loves placing the magnetic animal s on the board. The board and animals entertain him so he no longer plays with refrigerator magnets (great way of keeping him out of the kitchen).,4.0
"I would expect 10inch taller, 6 inch more wider than the current one! The thing is good.",4.0
"Magnetic board holds ok, but not as well as our kitchen refrigerator. For small words and sentences this should work well. I have already figured out that I need a much larger board. I tried both the Melissa & Doug Magnetic Wooden Alphabet and the foam magnet alphabet and they both work.",4.0
lvoe love this. my 2 yr old does too. another interactive way to teach but fun for her,4.0
"I was going to mark this 3 stars, but I imagine for the price you're not going to find anything like it. As a Special Educator who moves around and pulls small groups I love the concept and design, but the magetic pull isn't very strong (light plastic letters slip a bit) and the dry erase isn't as erasable as it could be. But for a portable table top workspace it's pretty good. Just remember NOT to leave any writing on the board, erase it immediately to prevent stains and permanent marks. If you can, use the flat magnetic letters rather than the letter shaped platic pieces.",4.0
I have a stainless steel refrigerator therefore there are not much space for my son to play with his magnet. Brought this for him to put his magnet on. He enjoys sticking his magnet on it. Great to have so he can play with his alphabet magnets.,4.0
Love the magnet easel... great for moving to different areas... Wish it had some sort of non skid pad on bottom though...,4.0
The easel seems to be well made and easy to store away. Not too large for smaller kids to use.,4.0
"Bought this for my granddaughter because stainless appliances do not support magnetic play. She loves it [age 2] and it can go in the car, plane, or on a table or floor. Good 'old-fashioned' non - tech non-electronic toy choice",4.0
Purchased this for my 2 great-grandsons to use with their Melissa & Doug wooden magnetic numbers and letters.  Just right for table top and easy to fold and store.,4.0
"I used it with my  granddaughter. It is useful, but can get bent very easily.  That's why I only gave it 4 stars.",4.0
"Fun for little ones that are learning the alphabet or for making small words.  However, I wish it had more vowels to be able to make more small words.",4.0
"This is good product to have with unlimited possibilities. I also ordered the magnetic letters & numbers by Melissa & Doug.  The dry erase has to be erased quickly or they tend to leave marks. Also, the magnet is not very strong. It's a nice size & works very well for our needs.",4.0
Magnetic Board:A fun toy. It is easy to use and the magnetic letter stick well. It a little small but good for small group work,4.0
"My kindergartener granddaughter loves forming words and illustrations on her magnetic letter board easel. It fits nicely on the kitchen table or at her desk. Great for homework, creative play. It frees up refrigerator doors formerly used for magnetic letters. After use it folds and neatly stores in minimal spaces.",4.0
I like this product a lot. The magnets stay on well and I love that it folds for storage. Just make sure you erase quickly and don't let the marker stay on for a long time or it will be difficult to get off.,4.0
"I bought the kindle version of this text as part of my transition to a mostly paperless student. I am using it for multiple courses, so it made sense. The book is quite heavy and I love the convenience and accessibility of the kindle version.",4.0
"This book is a great book to have if you are going into the profession. It gives you plenty of information and history to back it up. I would also recommend Evans' ""Student Development"" book if you have not already checked it out. These are a must for the profession.",4.0
Book was in great shape!,4.0
This text is perhaps a bit too broad to really be helpful and even my prof doesn't like it but it is the best work he could find in the topic area.,4.0
These are great little books for stocking stuffers.  Definitely decorative and catch the eye.  As far as functional I don't know as I gave the ones I bought away as stocking stuffers.,4.0
"Got this in the mail yesterday and was very happy. When I ordered last week ... there was no sourcing fee. For 1.50 it's a very unique/compact/easy-to-carry notebook. It's thin enough to fit inside a purse and can be used to jot down ""to do"" lists or whatnot but it's too small for journaling. I've ordered several more notebooks from the publisher and can't wait for them to come! Wish Amazon would carry more of these notebooks because there are some stunning ones featuring the paintings of Renoir/Degas/John Singer Sargent. All for 1.50 or less. These make excellent stocking stuffers and I cant imagine a ""girly girl"" or sensitive guy would be disappointed to receive one. Im happy with the quality and will buy the William Morris address book ... if there's no sourcing fee.",4.0
Awesome gift! Thanks for your service!,4.0
"This is a small, unlined notebook with a striking cover. You could keep this in your purse or desk for occasional notes/reminders/lists. Not enough sheets for a journal. Very good price.",4.0
Nice little notebook for the price.  Needed something to round my order to $25.00.  Small enough to fit into purse for quick notes,4.0
"Perfect size for a purse or tote bag. Use it for grocery lists, to do lists or for sketching. Nice print too.",4.0
"The paper wight seems thin and the cover is high gloss. For the price, I think it is a good buy, but it will be obviously cheaper when standing next to other higher quality notebooks. It is a good travel size, but slightly too large to comfortably fit in a coat pocket.",4.0
It's thin and the paper inside is of decent quality. I would buy again.,4.0
"Very cute notepad. I say notepad, because it is fairly small. All pages are blank, so it would make a cute doodle pad. Super cute, and really good quality if you like travel sized notepads.",4.0
"Pretty little notebook to give a friend who treasures Arts and Crafts era architecture, furniture, fabrics, etc. I'm sure she'll enjoy having and using this little item.",4.0
Good notebook .. I gave it to one of my female students.  She really liked it.,4.0
"Beautiful cover, but very small and thin. Honestly I wouldn't pay more than $1 for it.",4.0
"NOTEbook. Tiny. Would be nice if it had lines to draw on, but works fine!",4.0
I keep this in my purse.  It is small enough to fit easily in my purse and very cute when I take it out to write notes on. the paper isn't lined so there are no limits to what I can do in it.,4.0
Its a neat little notebook that does not take up too much space can fit in your pocket and comes in handy . It's also convenient if you need a few more dollars to complete the 25 Amazon prime shipping!,4.0
I thought this would be a standard sized notebook--like a composition notebook. It's small but the paper seems to be of very high quality. It would make a great sketchbook. The design is also beautiful and unique. I think I may keep it as a small gift for someone in the future.,4.0
It's pretty small and its great to fit in a purse but if you need it for school I don't recommend buying this,4.0
"Speedy delivery and very very inexpensive little blank notebook.  Looks nice in my handbag and is just the right size to write down thoughts or outline plans.  A very nice little gift, too.",4.0
"It is a nice little notebook, but only about 4x5 inches. I did not understand from the advertisement, how small it would be.",4.0

"This butterfly notebook by Scovak looks very nice sitting on my desk and comes in handy for quick notes.
The size is on the smaller side and about the size of my hand. It has a glossy cover with vivid colors. I love butterflies and that's why I chose this design. There are 32 blank white pages. Not only is it useful for quick notes in the office or school, but also great for children. The pages are great for doodling or journalling.
Overall, it's everything I expected and for a very low, reasonable price. I will consider buying more in other designs.",4.0

This notebook is a good size to keep in you pocketbook. It's a convenient size for pockets too. Always good for jotting down quick notes. I find it very useful and always carry it with me.,4.0
I love butterflies and it looks pretty! There's not much to say about a notebook.,4.0
This notebook is a nice way to spice up your school supplies. It is girly and fun. I love that it can be taken anywhere because of its small size. The only problem I have with it is that it does not have lines on the pages. I prefer having notebooks with lines in them. It makes everything more precise and clean.,4.0
Would order this item again. Great for the cost. No complaints. Pages are blank inside. I use mine as a journal. Would order again. Great little stocking stuffer comes to mind.,4.0
"It's a nice little notepad, I like to keep one in my purse and this fit great. I like how the pages are blank instead of lined so I can doodle in there, too.",4.0
"I bought this one because I needed to add a couple dollars to my purchase in order to get free shipping.

It is nice looking, my daughter loved it. If you are ever in that position, it will be well worth it.",4.0

small handy and nice exterior picture. good to have in the car or in the house for taking quick notes.,4.0
"Very pretty butterflies, but the notebook is very small ... more like a note pad. I gave it to my daughter because she likes butterflie decor ...",4.0
The notebook is cute and worth the $1.35 I paid for it. It is small and has just a heavy paper cover. Nothing grand or special. The 12 year old girl I had visiting really likes it so it will be hers.,4.0
The book is nice.  The small size is convenient as it fits in my purse and is available when I need it.,4.0
"And that's it. Cute and little, very little. But real handy when you don't want a big bulky note pad in your purse.",4.0
Very cute notebook and it fits in my purse so I carry it everywhere.  Love the butterflies too.  So glad I added it to my order.,4.0
"This product is exactly what I need to occupy my children in places where I don't want them running around making noise (church, waiting rooms etc). Plain unlined paper, a small size and a pretty pattern is perfect for my small girls. Fits nicely in my wif's handbag.",4.0
Enjoyed using it. Can't say too much after all it's a notebook. What else can one say? 3 more words. Really?,4.0
Its a great little notebook for the money. No lines on the pages but a great price. I am very pleased with the notebook. Its great for doodles or righting. Well worth the $1.50 i paid.,4.0
"I read the other reviews and it IS a very small unlined note book.  Not a larger normal spiral  note book size. I was fine with this as it's for my college student daughter, and she needs to keep lots of lists.  Would be perfect for  purse size. Very pretty artwork!",4.0
It is a nice little book. Well made ! The pages are blank so it can be used as an autograph book for a farewell or bridal shower.,4.0
"It's my fault I'm disappointed.  I didn't read the discription.  I saw Butterfly and thought it was a book on butterflys, not a note pad.  Always read before buying.",4.0
"This is a very useful notebook, although you have to be careful it is VERY small. It is perfect for sketching and the price is perfect when there's free shipping.",4.0
I got this when it was $1.50 because my other purchases were just under $25 for free shipping.  I used it as a party gift.  Nice to keep in your purse or car for when you need to jot something down.  I would not pay $3.49 though.  You can get 3 or more little notebooks for that price at office stores.,4.0
Book is good. Explains everything well.,4.0
"Great quality for a great price, it was much more expensive at the book store.",4.0

"As a psychology major wanting to focus on the counselling aspects, a sensation and perception course was definitely not high on my 'want to take' list.  But, not only was the class entertaining and informative, but this text was pretty darn good.  It wasn't nearly as dry as my usual psychology text book, and it was highly informative, going into depth and giving examples to tie everything together.  If you are a psychology professor, I would highly recommend this text for your class.  It made me, someone not interested in the topic at all, not only love the class but continue to use the knowledge that I gained in real world settings.",4.0
good,4.0
"Detailed, colorful and seemingly accurate.  A bit thin, but on the wall it doesn't matter.",4.0
"Use this in a first grade classroom and love it. I had it laminated to preserve it, as it is made of very thin paper.",4.0
Bought this map for my husband's office wall. So he can track where he makes sales across the country (he just opened a new business). I am only giving this 4 stars because I regret not buying one that is laminated- the paper is thin so it can tear easily if you are tacking it to a wall.,4.0
Pretty thin but print quality is good. I glued construction paper to the back before putting poster on my wall.,4.0
