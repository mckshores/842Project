Small did not hold up well...great for a one time use,2.0
Not as fluffy as the picture. You will definitely need leggings when you wear this because its see through.,2.0
"This tutu is completely see-through. I bought it for my 6 year old to wear in a parade she is walking in and she absolutely will not be able to wear it without pants on underneath, which I was not expecting.",2.0
"Not the same color as the picture. More of a darker gold than a bright yellow. Disappointed in the length, longer than expected.",2.0
The map book was too old.  Had to order another one that was more up to date.,2.0
Don't be fooled by the claim of topographic maps.  They're a joke and useless for anything beyond adding a little color to the roads.,2.0
"Just received this atlas, today.  I have the Benchmark atlas's for most other Western states.  I was looking to purchase an Arizona one from Amazon, but they didn't carry it.  Why they carry other states, and not Arizona, is a mystery.  Anyway, I didn't want to purchase from a third party, so after reading the reviews on the Delorme, decided to order it.  What a disappointment.  A road map from the welcome center will work just as well.  Very little detail of the back country.  Hard to distinguish the different roads other than major highways.  Now, to be fair, I haven't seen an Arizona Benchmark.  But if it's anything like the Utah Benchmark, for instance, I would trade three Delorme for one Benchmark.",2.0
"So succinct, less than impressed. Should have bought lure/flys instead.....",2.0
"Pretty good intro to prepping,but very little substance. It will get you thinking,but is more of a review of FEMA guidelines.",2.0
"Very basic, bordering on obvious info provided in the book. Not alot new in these pages. Went straight to the the bottom bookshelf in within 30 mins of arrival.",2.0
The book was ok.  Had some good ideas and was a very quick read.  Overall not a complete guide to someone who wants to get into full on prepping.,2.0
Not as much fun as we thought. It was ok for spinning and twisting but that was about it.  No good on ice or snow.  Didn't slide down grassy hill or on sloped cul de sac.  Maybe the kids can use it at the beach,2.0
"Adhesive traction discs came off with the first use. Once it was used outside on the sidewalk it was to abrasively scratchy on the bottom to use on our interior wood floors without causing damage to the floor. Also the rough surface now snags on carpeted surfaces too.

Don't use on rough surfaces if you intend to use it indoors.",2.0
"I was unimpressed by this product.  It arrived in a box that was already splitting open, so I worried that I did not receive all of the pieces.  Luckily I did, but I could not put the thing together.  The screws seemed too big for the nuts they were supposed to go into and too long overall for the bar itself.  Had I been able to put this product together I would have had extra long screws poking out of each hole.

The one good thing about this product was even though I went past my 30 day return window - the company still OK'd my return.  Too bad the shipping cost was almost as much as the product itself.  I have yet to see the refund, but I would assume it takes about a week or two to process.",2.0
"Went together pretty easily and felt quite sturdy. However, it did not fit in the doorways of our older, thick walked home.",2.0
"The unit I received was missing parts so that was very disappointing. The hand grip foam is too soft and so it rotates while using. This is not the best thing to have happening when trying to pull yourself up. They have a hard rubber wrap for the pieces that support the unit against the door frame, this type for the hand grips would have been better. The unit does go together very easily and holds my weight fine, about 200 lbs.. Most home door frame trim is pine or some similar soft wood and so this type of chin up bar will dent or score the wood. More padding is needed to protect the door frame.",2.0
"This pull up bar is poorly designed and they instructions for hanging it were incomplete at best!  We measured out doorway, it does not fit.  My husband hung the hardware to hang the bar according to instructions and it did not work.  We are now using the bar with two clams.  My husband will design something later to make it stable without use of the clamps.  In my opinion this was a HUGE WASTE of money!",2.0
"product seems like is not going to last long before it starts to bend, I would recommend the Iron gym pro better than this one",2.0
Ive been using this band for about 6 months now and it is already breaking. It does not get heavy use as I use dumbbells mostly.,2.0
The attachment (handle) around one of the ends of the band is breaking around the metal ring that keeps it in place. This creates a hazardous situation during the work out. I wish that I could return it (after 7th session of use) but I am in Germany for a several months. I bought it in the US to bring it to this long trip. Dissapointing.,2.0
Resistance was to higher when I ordered the turquoise one.,2.0
This product does the job,2.0
Handles are not well made. They keep coming apart.,2.0
Used this for pilates. Lasted for less than 2 months before snapping completely.,2.0
"The product worked as indicated. My complaint is that there was no caution about potential eye injury. In my case the device, with the under door place strap in place, slipped from under my shoe, snapped back and hit me in the left eye. This caused an injury which to date has resulted in a traumatic cataract and potentially vitrioretinal surgery. I strongly recommend anyone who uses these bands wear eye protection. This injury is not as uncommon as you may think. Simple solution is wear eye protection.",2.0
"One of 5 has already broken; the handle completely broke away from the band and snapped back on a client. I have lost confidence in the remaining 4 and will not use them anymore, and will not order these bands again.",2.0
"I liked it at first but I'm already on my second one. I have the green one (10-12 lb.). I use it 3-4 times a week for no more than 10-30 minutes each time. I use it with my exercise video that requires one. The first one broke after 8 months of use and the second one is already splitting in places and looks like it will break any day now. I've only used it for 4 months. I will have to try a different brand because it should really last longer than that when used properly, as I do. It hurt when the first one broke. It snapped during use and smacked me on the leg. (Imagine a VERY large rubber band snapping you from fully stretched) So, needless to say...I don't want to experience that again.  As a side note...I never did find a need for the door anchor that comes with it.",2.0
Isn't for beginners or light lifters but the seemed part of the handles that connects the band and handle isn't made good enough for the tension of the band don't know guess I might try another brand,2.0
I have to change my review from the first week of purchase.  This yellow band is closer to the green bands in our gym than the yellow ones I was using.  I pulled a muscle in my left arm because I did not realize this band was so different.  After only a year it had several tears in it and I had hardly used it.  I just threw it away.,2.0
Snapped in half after one month of use,2.0
I have the green belt and used it 3-4 times a week for a month. Today while doing Pilates the band came loose from one of the handles. I liked it and it worked great up till this point. I can still use the band but I needed the handles for the specific types of Exercises I'm doing. Very frustrating.,2.0
"Got maybe 10-20 workouts in before the handle ripped off and almost took my eye out in the process.  Was ok while it lasted, but does not last long.",2.0
Barely used it. Bought it to take away on trips and the handle broke while using it. It also has a lot of stress marks.,2.0
I liked it a lot until it broke and put a dent in my door only a couple months in.,2.0
"I bought the green band in May, 2016. After just four months of using this band three times each week, it's already fraying. I like everything about this band, but it's lack of durability for high-intensity interval training. I do use it roughly -- tie it through chain-link fence and step on it on gravel -- but I would think it should endure that type of outdoor use.",2.0
"I bought this for my husband, first one snap by the handle almost injuring him. when I contact seller they send the replacement right away (great service). Unfortunately replacement broke too exact same way. I could not return it since it passed 30 day period. I would not buy this product or recommend it to anyone.",2.0
"Just used it for 30 min bi-daily strength exercise for the past 6 month.  It slapped and broke during exercise.  When I checked on the official website, it only support 60 day warranty.  Guess that's what the asterisk in the bottom of it's slogan "" 100% AUTHENTIC. LIFETIME WARRANTY* "" meant!!",2.0
There should have been more information given about strengths.,2.0
broke after using it one time. I cannot find the contact number for the company!,2.0
It does not have good quality handles that could last long. Handles got broken within a few weeks of its use. The grips that attach the handles and the tube with each other are also ripping up.,2.0
Plastic handle broke thi first time using it.,2.0
"Something happened with this product. Came without Attached foam handles. So, how does suppose to use it?",2.0
"Broke after using it a few times. Triple knotted it, hope it does not break again. Kind of cheap to break so soon.",2.0
"To set the picture I am a 64 yr. old man who never worked out to speak of.  I bought the second to highest resistance and although I really don't have much to compare it to, this seems way too easy to stretch.  I'm no body builder, I assure you.

Even worse, is the canvas handles.  I had another one before and the triangle handles were all smooth plastic.  When I use these the canvas rubs across the sides of my hands making them rough and raw.  Plus as the hand part rotates over the canvas it kinda jumps or sticks like it's on a ratchet.  I won't be buying from them again.",2.0
"The band was fine.  The plastic grip broke off on both handles though and did not last a long time.

I called the company and they replaced the band with a new one immediately.  Great customer service!  The second band has seemed just fine thus far.",2.0
"So it worked well for a couple weeks, but during a lunge workout, it snapped on me.  I liked it and thought it was a great product until this happened.  I noticed small rips on the band.  This could have been the issue.",2.0
"I bought this band to use as a step-up in intensity from the band included in my T25 package, and was highly disappointed with the length. It's a good length if you want to do the exercises described in the included pamphlet (mostly things that use the door anchor, also bicep curls) but if you are using this with a program that EVER has you use bands as a substitute for weights in over-the-head exercises like military presses, these are NOT the bands to buy. They're simply too short for that kind of exercise.

Note that these bands are the standard length: 4 feet. The only bands I've found that have been longer are the B-Lines bands that are (as far as I can tell) exclusively distributed by Beachbody.",2.0
Very flimsy. Did not feel like 5lbs and the handles have a funny spongy texture that makes them feel funny,2.0
"The bands seem to be well made.  The how to use booklet is not very useful.  The pictures are blurred and not easy to understand.  The description is on one page and the picture is on the back, doesnt much sense.  I think I should have returned them, they don't get much use because I don't know how to use them effectively.",2.0
Poor chinese quality,2.0
I did not find the bands durable . At least two broke within a few weeks.,2.0
bands broke,2.0
Blue bland busted on first use at handle.,2.0
I had bought another one in past from Bodylastics and for the same price I had a lot more quality and some extra devices to attach the bands to. I'm returning this one.,2.0
"So far the bands are great and I like the fact that I can attach multiple hands to one set of grips.  The problem I have is with the door anchor.  There is a small plastic cylinder inside the anchor side of the door anchor that is supposed to prevent the door anchor from coming through the door.  The first time I used it, this plastic piece broke, which allowed the anchor to become much flatter which then allowed it to squeeze through the door.  I have to admit, this was an internal hollow core lightweight door that does not lock or secure very well.  When the plastic piece broke it also jarred the door allowing the latch to open, the anchor then shot forward and smacked me very hard in the center of my back.  I posted a picture as well.  I'll take some blame for choosing a wimpy door, but the design needs some work.  USE CAUTION!  Lucky I wasn't turned around to take that shot in the face. FYI: This was very painful.",2.0
One of the bands broke within 2 weeks of use. I'm not at all confident that the other bands will hold up.,2.0
I purchased this set after reading a lot of good reviews but unfortunately I didn't have the same exp. as others. Initially the quality of the band looked really good but after some use they started to show signs of wear and tear (let me also say that I take care of things that I use) and as of today the status is that my 4 out of 5 bands are broken.,2.0
"I bought these about 5 years ago from today's review. They worked fine when I was first starting out.

I've recently started using them again with some workout videos and in the span of 3 weeks, 3 bands have SNAPPED mid exercise right where the band is glued or attached somehow to the clasp portion (see attached photos). Now I have 2 more bands, the heaviest ones, but no way am I going to try those too because I'm sure they will meet the same fate as the other 3 bands but with greater force.

These are fine when they're new, but don't expect them to last very long. I'd contact the company for their ""lifetime guarantee"" but seeing the other reviews like mine, it seems like a waste of time trying their customer service.

Looks like I'm going to bite the bullet and just get some actual weights instead.

If I were you, I'd consider investing in other bands or solutions.",2.0
"So I purchased these back in May so about a month and a half ago. All was good till a few weeks ago when the seem on one of my handles busted. No big deal, it still was able to be used. Well yesterday towards the end of my workout I was doing chest flyes. Had already done 2 sets and was about halfway thru my third when I heard a loud pop and what felt like a bullet hitting me in the back. The seam that held the D-ring busted. It put me on the ground immediately. I've shared these pictures on Black Mountain Company's Facebook page but haven't gotten a reply. Maybe they'll see this. I wasn't abusing these in any way and honesty since I've had them have probably only used them a dozen or so times. Needless to say I'll never trust these bands again. Thank God it wasn't my face or my eyes. Metal buckles and huge rubber bands don't feel real great when the pop you at full draw. Giving these a 2 star review because they are great, until they break... Beware!!!",2.0
"PLEASE READ!! Per safety instructions, you are NOT supposed to use this product WITHOUT safety glasses. ""WEAR EYE PROTECTION AT ALL TIMES WHILE USING RESISTANCE BANDS."" Who does that? Have you seen people using these at the gym working out with eye protection in case on of them snaps? ALSO ""RESISTANCE BANDS ARE INTENDED FOR 90 DAYS OF USE. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES USE RESISTANCE BANDS BEYOND 90 DAYS"". What does that mean? If I use it once, then I don't for 2 weeks, then does the clock start ticking after the first usage or not?  Maybe it should be ""don't use more than 90 times""? Those safety guidelines don't make any sense and who puts a date stamp on their stuff? I don't. My life is crazy busy enough without having to worry about the possibility of my resistance band snapping and blinding me because it was past the 90 day usage date. If you see a 50 year old woman running around with a rugged scar down her face and tapping a cane on the sidewalk you will know it was from resistance band failure. Totally ridiculous. And why wasn't this placed up front - dangerous resistance bands for sale? I haven't really used them as much as I wanted to because of they stupid brochure!",2.0
"The leg strap attachment has caused me actual bodily injury. Due to the poor design of the leg strap, the velcro keeping it in place rips away with any significant weight and the whole system of bands slams into my door frame with, what seems like, the force of a shotgun fired beanbag. Not only does this not feel pleasant, especially when it kisses your skin on its way into an alternate dimension, but the 3rd time this happened to me it caused a serious sprain in the shoulder of my supporting arm. Not cool right before Army Basic Training :( Oh I also had to reinforce the sewing on the little strap holding the metal ring, that tears off too.",2.0
Not that simple to use.. may be its waste of money,2.0
I was a bit disappointed in these honestly.  Two broke within a month and the colors seem to fade really quickly.  Saf,2.0
"They didn't really last, every single band would rip, some the first time I used them.",2.0
"I have the bands...all attached, quality seems great. Came in the bag...awesome. But that's ALL I have. Where are the ankle straps? Where is the guide? Door anchor?? I paid for the extras as well! ",2.0
What happens after 6 month use,2.0
First time using this attachment since I ordered this and it broke.  Luckily the bands just hit my door and nothing else.,2.0
These are good as far as resistance but really really short. I am not sure if it says that in the description but I can't put them under my foot and extend my foot out. Be mindful.,2.0
Not all of the components were included.  It felt as though this had been a returned item that just got put back on the shelf.,2.0
First time use and one of my bands snapped. Was doing curls with the red band according to the book they give you and it snapped! Not happy.,2.0
"Not the greatest, better  advertised then worked!",2.0
"I am only giving this two stars because I am so upset now that my ankle strap broke today! Otherwise it has been AWESOME. The door attachment is like a dream come true, it is like having a cable machine in your house. I've been using the ankle straps for kick backs and now I am so bummed out that it broke. The sewing just completely came apart; not to mention from the first time I started using it, it started sort of unraveling with lots of frayed ends on the ankle strap. ALL of the other straps, bands, and door attachment work like a charm. I am just upset with the ankle strap. It is obviously very cheaply made which doesn't reflect the rest of it. Please make more quality ankle straps that don't break after only a few uses!",2.0
"I hope you get to read this review before you purchase. I bought this product because a friend of mine put me on it.  Received it yesterday and decided to actually read the manual (glad i did!). On page 3 are the saftey instructions and direction 4 says, ""Resistance bands are intended for 90 days of use. Do Not, under any circumstances, use resistance bands beyond 90 days.""

-_-

So when you read about some people having theirs break and stuff, I am sure it was after this 90 day period.  So don't let the ""lifetime warranty"" or 60 day ""no questions asked"" warranty fool you because they mean nothing when the products lifetime is only 90 days. The reason I gave this product two stars is because im sure they'll do their job for their ""lifetime"". If you're looking for a short term addition to your workout, these are perfect for you.",2.0
"The bands started off great, and then the red band broke away from being secured to the silver latching piece. It has only been two months and I can't exchange it for a new one. I order just the BMP red band but that band is permanently attached to its own handles, unlike the other bands, not allowing me to add multiple bands to the handles. Very discouraging.",2.0
All but 1 of these bands snapped with Moderate use ...,2.0
"I purchased these quite awhile ago. We used them for about 6 months with no problems. Then due to an international move, they were put in storage and not used for a few years. Just pulled them out of storage and they looked fine. However, the green one snapped the first time I used it - both of the handle ends snapped off. Almost got me in the face. Considering they were not actually used that much, this is surprising. Hopefully I can get these replaced.",2.0
"I bought these resistance bands to do P90. After three months of using the bands, it seems that there is some sort of manufacturing defect in them that keeps causing the black cap that connects to band to the strap to keep popping off. Of the five bands I received, three have had this problem.

I called Black Mountain Products after two bands broke and they very promptly replaced them. Then the third band broke after five workouts and damaged my front door. I then contacted BMP to see if I could get a refund (this was after the Amazon refund window had closed) and they told me that since I purchased the product through Amazon, they would not refund the purchase. I told them that the bands were appeared to be defective. The representative said that something must have happened to the bands in shipping or some sort of lubricant must have gotten on them. They then said they'd ship me a new set of bands at no extra cost.

While I am happy that BMP has been so willing to replace their seemingly defective merchandise, I wish I had never bought them in the first place.",2.0
Instruction manual was put together by a disinterested 2nd grader. Very poorly done by leftover scraps of paper.,2.0
"(Update)  I had to update my review because of a issue I have with these bands.  The end pieces that keep the clips connected to the bands can fail.  Basically there is a ball inserted into the band tube with a tight outer band around that.  This ball is what keeps the band from coming out of the clip.  On my black band the outer retaining tube worked its way off and when it did the ball popped out of the band.  That meant that that handle was suddenly without resistance so I almost punched myself in the face.

Always check both retaining ends before you used the bands.  If you see the outer tube slipping, work it all the way back on before using.  If the ball pops out it is very hard to get back in and probably impossible if you don't have tools to use.  Be careful when using these with suspension type exercises since a failure may cause injury.

Also be extra careful when using a door as the anchor point.  If opens by accident or someone opens it the band will snap back and smack you really, really hard.  Best to use a door you can lock it that is possible.",2.0
"They look like they work, I just really wish they had been upfront about the use of natural latex. They use the wording ""Natural Rubber"" so if you do a search, like I did, for ""Latex Free resistance bands"", these still show up.

I ordered, opened the box, immediately got nervous and went to investigate online and carefully read through the description, before I used and had a complete allergic reaction.
Disappointing that they would not make that clear that latex is involved. It's dangerous for those of us with severe allergies.",2.0
Ankle strap just broke at the first use,2.0
Missing a piece,2.0
Wow. One of the bands broke with 5 minutes of using them.,2.0
"Seems ok but missing all of my paperwork. No exercise chart, no warrantry papers and no starter guide. Hope they can be contacted easily. I kind of need some pointers.",2.0
"It's a shame because I mean they work well enough, but the clips that you use to hook the bands to the handles are very cheap and weak. This one broke the first time I tried using it. BMP said they stand behind their products, but they did not respond to my several email inquiries about getting a replacement.",2.0
"Nice bands, but disappointed that they didn't send me my door anchor or ankle wrap. Hope they see this and send it over.",2.0
"The resistance bands are good quality except the carabineers are covered in rust right out of the box. If it weren't for the rust, this would be a great product.",2.0
"Functional, but a pain in the ass to use.",2.0
Great price point but these are a little too light weight. Im not a body builder and I'm finding myself using the heaviest band all the time and even having to increase the resistance. Almost every other color is a waste.,2.0
"I haven't had them for a long time, but the green and red bands have already broken on me. I need something a little more durable.",2.0
"One of the bands broke doing a shoulder press. The rubber itself was fine, but the contact point with the hook became loose. d",2.0
"The exercise bands are of decent quality, good considering the price of this package. That being said, the door anchor is absolute garbage, and tore while I was exercising(4th time using the set), causing the bands to snap and hit me in the face, along with me falling backwards(I was leaning back to create tension on the bands) and injuring my back.

The bands are good, don't trust the door anchor, you'll get hurt.",2.0
"Hmm... I don't know if I have bad luck or what. But I've had this set for less than a year, and have had one band break, leading to a painful and scary injury, from the metal snaps being whipped into my abdomen, and one handle break which thankfully didn't injure me. They honor their warrantee and quickly ship the replacement at no cost. But after two accidents, I really can't trust these anymore. Too much potential for injury again. I have their loop bands, and have had no problem with those. Personally, I'll never use bands that have any metal parts again. It's just too scary now.",2.0
The handle broke in the middle of a workout. Without the handle the bands are useless to me. I tried gluing the handle with gorilla glue but it broke again. This product does not last.,2.0
"Not accurately described.  the actual band is not very long.  Total, with handles, it is about 5', however about 1.5' of this is not resistance band.  Doesn't work for what use it for.",2.0
"No ""Start-up Guide"" nor ""exercise chart"" included. I have no idea what to do with these things. Apparently I'll have to locate and purchase information on using bands.",2.0
Difficult to notice the Resistance between the 5 bands.,2.0
There is no manual or videos on how to use them for training,2.0
"Very weak bands. I wish they had some stronger ones. Already exceeded capacity. Or i wish they added a few more.

Slightly disappointed due to high expectation as #1 reviewed resistance band product on the market.",2.0
"I needed resistance bands to work on physical therapy exercises at home after a shoulder injury, and this kit looked similar to what I was using at therapy. The handles are almost identical, and the resistance loads are similar (by color) to the ones my therapist used as well. However, these bands are just too long. You can't anchor them with your feet and exercise your arms. If you anchor them in a door, you need a good 6-9 feet for any real resistance at all. With no load at all the bands are 48 inches long (4 feet!) if you include the anchors at each end. If you attach a handle, that's another 6 inches. If you attach the door anchor, that's another 6 inches. At that point you have 5 feet of slack before you even start pulling on it.

The bands, anchors, and handles are all solidly built. If you have the room, this product can be amazing. I don't have any complaints about the quality or the value, it's just not the right product for someone like me who lives in an apartment with limited space.",2.0
"Really wanted to rate this WAY higher, BUT I only received ONE leg strap and NO piece for the door. Which really bums Me out. Because everything else is great. But sucks to find out you're missing pieces.",2.0
"I did not receive the door anchors, ankle straps nor the workout charts as described in the posting.",2.0
Not a realistic replacement for dumbbells.,2.0
I would prefer them shorter and the only one we use is the Red.  The others do not offer much resistance and are collecting dust.,2.0
The quality of the rubber band is not vey good.,2.0
"Bands were too short, returned product",2.0
"The product is good, the problem is I didn't get the yellow and green bands. I also didn't get the manual that was supposed to be included.",2.0
I had a lot of expectations for the durability of this product. Sadly the rubber bands are falling apart just after 5 months of use.,2.0
"Not the name brand advertised, cheap knock off. Plus took over 3 weeks to ship and that's after I contacted them. Only 3 bands not 5.",2.0
The concept itself its wonderful but in prctice its useless. Always love the idea to do wok out w/o weights. But the durability of this bands ar very limited. Mine lasted 2 months And the. Snaped a couple. And it wasn't w/o too much use. Bought a second set AYLIO thinking this ones would be better. Same thing. As said nice concept but unpractical,2.0
These bands at first was great but soon all became unstable and broke so you get what you pay for,2.0
One of my bands has a hole in it after just one use :(,2.0
It seems that my red elastic band has already worn through from normal everyday use. I was happy that I checked it before I used in my work out before it snapped. The nylon door strap wore right through the band.,2.0
The product did not contain all that it showed. I plan to return it if I do not get a second handle.,2.0
Wife don't care for them as they always pop loose and slap her.,2.0
"Sorry for starting with a paraphrased Adele song, but it is surprisingly perfect for these bands. Read on for the long version, or skip to the tl;dr bullets below. To start with the good, they're good starter bands (although I think the extra light is quite useless, but perhaps they're useful for female users who're more focused on toning than bulking), and at a very good price. However, they're far from ideal, for a couple of reasons. First of all, the handle isn't fixed, but has a canvas band than moves freely through it, and in my opinion, this isn't good design: it often slips mid-rep, causing an awkward jerk and spoiling form. However, other than that, these have functioned well for me, and I've advanced on them, starting with a weak light and progressing to the extra heavy in a few short months. My main problem however, is that I have lost faith in the quality of these bands, and in their interpretation of customer service. Whilst using the heavy (black) band, mid-rep, the edge connecting it to the clipping system snapped off, and in the middle of a bicep curl, snapped back and hit my thigh, giving me a not altogether pleasing welt. Now, before you tell me it was my fault, you must know three things: 1. that I have a fairly common ectomorphic body, carrying a sum total of 135lbs on a 6' frame, 2. I was using it without a double loop even, and 3. I'd been on the black band for roughly two weeks, so I shudder to think how long this would've lasted for a real body-builder. So two big (imo) issues knocks it down to maybe 3 stars.

Why then, have I given it a lowly two stars? Simply because, after reading in all caps on the back page of the manual that all bands are FULLY warrantied for life, I wrote to BPM, expecting some sort of explanation, and a quick replacement. This was about two weeks ago, and I have not heard back at all. Nada. Call me spoiled for having been used to Amazon Customer support, but I think two weeks of non-response deserves rebuke, and in my lowly state, that means a not altogether pleasing review. (See how I tied it up in the end?)

Now, for the tl;dr:

Pros:
- Good range of resistance
- Ultra portable and light

Cons:
- Handle design prone to slippage (-1/2 star)
- Poor design - had a breakage at the corner near the metal clipping system (see picture) after < 2 weeks use by a pretty lanky guy (-1 star)

"i used these bands for about 4  weeks before the first one broke.  then after another 8 weeks of using another band, its now broke.  they work great while they last.  i am now ready to purchase another set b/c i am without bands i need for my type of workout.  unfortunately, i will try another brand to see if i get the same quality or better.",2.0
"only resist for two years, my red, blue and green are broken, its a lie that its for life garantee",2.0
"Handle started breaking after 3 uses. Now almost impossible to use. My wife has had her resistance bands for almost a decade and the handles are still intact. I guess cheap plastic used here. Quite disappointed. Should have returned them earlier. The bands are solid, but the handles, not so. I may have to purchase the handles separately.",2.0
"Not crazy about these.
Not as much of a workout as you'd hope.",2.0
I ordered and paid for the resistance bands plus the door anchor and ankle strap and the package was missing the door anchor and ankle strap.,2.0
"I like the quality of the bands, and they combine well to put in a range of resistance.  However, the handles are a pretty cheap, brittle plastic.  One of the handles shattered while I was using heavy resistance.  I pulled out the pieces and tried to use the strap only, but it has something stitched in the middle, and hurts the palm of my hand.  So not very satisfied with this.",2.0
"I thought it looked nice and all, and was so excited to get it. Opened the package and everything looks great. Plus it's cheaper than lots of the other ones. But the first time I used it, two of the band snapped broken. Waste of money, plus I'm bruised on my leg and arms when it snapped broken!!",2.0
These just didn't seem to work well.  Not recommended.,2.0
"Worked for a little it then started to wear away and developed holes in the after about 6 months of regular use in addition to weights. No longer use them in fear of them snapping. I'd spend the extra money and buy the thicker, more durable bands like I ended up doing after these wore out like- Lifeline PRO Resistance Trainer Kit",2.0
These are great except for the fact that they have large scratchy protrusions where the elastic band connects to the linkage; this makes some exercises difficult to do without scratching yourself up. Otherwise they are good bands.,2.0
"While we just got this item and cannot verify if it lives up to expectations, the very poor quality 'manual' and the company's response to that leaves me wondering if the product can possible be any good.  The 'manual' is a couple of pages that are poorly reproduced with stains on the 'cover.'  Since this is one of the first things that you see and is a way for a company to represent themselves, it leaves much to be desired.  The company indicates that retail versions are better packaged (according to them, the packaging costs them 1.27 cents, though I think they must have meant $1.27).",2.0
Way too long.,2.0
"Seemed OK, but was not impressed with the door mount piece. The SPRI model (saw it at Sports Authority) seemed more sturdy. Also cost me $8 to send it back. Be careful what you order Amazon Prime doesn't seem to cover returns. Thought it did. To bad LL Bean doesn't sell this product.",2.0
The red band was on the verge of snapping after only one week of using it with p90x. Of that week p90x only recommended using the bands for 3 of the workouts so technically it only lasted me 3 days. I had the bands in the anchor mechanism to simulate pull-ups and the anchor came out of the door and hit me directly in the sternum and left a pretty impressive mark and I immediately went and saw a doctor. Overall good concept but in my own experience I found the product to be sketchy.,2.0
"the quality and thickness of these bands stink, they stretch and tear easily and don't hold well under my athletic shoes of any type. the weight doesn't feel right either.",2.0
never use . the system doesn't fit me,2.0
"What is all this raving about these bands, may I know? I have hit my head against the wall so many times by reading the wonderful  reviews  at Amazon that I am going to stop believing in them. These bands are AL THE SAME SIZE, for God's sake !!! Any one who uses resistance bands should know that many times the bands have to be doubled for  more resistance. Now, how a person 5'5"""" or taller can use them? Any one taller than the mentioned height will have problem without doubling the band. This bands was a total waste of money. I should had gone to Walmart or any sport store and see what I buy. That's the problem many times when buying clothe, shoes,etc without seeing them with your own eyes.",2.0
just found it to be cumbersome,2.0
Had one of the bands actually tear in me within the first two weeks of using them. Did not return or complain though so I blame myself on this purchase.,2.0
"The problem with elastic bands is that the resistance changes as the bad is stretched out.  Depending on what you use it for, this may not be a deal breaker.  For stretching and flexibility work it is ok, but if you intend to use it for strength building this is not the right tool for the job.",2.0
"The delivery of the product was on time and the product is perfect to fit in my suitcase when I'm on the road. Now I can work out in my hotel room when on the road, as most hotels do not have weights available - only treadmills, so this is a perfect solution.
Thanks again for the quick service..

Followup: (9-2-14) The door stop on this set is not big enough. It will come right off from beneath the door. I know they say to use it in the door jam, but they do not say not to use it under the door.  Last night anchored the bands under the door, to do bicep curls and the stopper slid out and hit me square in the left eye socket - I saw stars and then the unbelievable pain. Just got back from emergency room - cut on pupil-  swollen eyelids  and extreme pain in my eye socket. This set is going back. They need to increase the size of the sewn in door stop - not nearly big enough...I'm writing this with an eye patch on my eye. Not fun.",2.0
Not good they broke within 2 months,2.0
These would be good for range of motion exercises but to do them all you need a door jam with a 6' radius of clearance which very few homes will have and I have never seen a hotel room with one so these are of limited use.,2.0
"I ordered these on May 3, 2014 and the green band broke today. I used them about 3 times a week. Not impressed with quality.",2.0
Product arrived just as advertised. Broke a couple of bands after just 30 days of use. Might never break for the average user but if you are really using them hard they could break on you.,2.0
Love it just to short was thinking that the ropes was longer. It is a must have item nice nice,2.0
"I have several different bands and these are the least likable, they do not stretch enough and make it way to difficult to use",2.0
"The kit idea is great and the band seem to be very good, but the second time I used them, one of the handle broken in my hand. The handles are nylon, foam and plastic. The foam covered plastic tube broken using just the red band. If there were some way to switch the plastic tubes to alum. or a heavier plastic, I would give them 5 stars.",2.0
"I would advise against these. They worked great for about 6 months, then all started showing signs of wear. Now, 8 months into owning them three have snapped just from using them for pull-up exercises, and some lifting exercises. The door strap chews away at them as does the ankle strap. No good at all.",2.0
"I purchased these for my husband for Christmas and 1 has broke a little over 2 week into him using them. The break happened near the end of the band, but not at the junction with the ankle strap. I think these are best suited for a lightweight lifter, but that should have been indicated in the description.",2.0
"So far, the door anchor and the lightest resistance bands have both snapped. When the door anchor snapped, I went flying across the room and landed hard. I was not seriously injured. The lightest resistance band snapped today and the carabiner part of it was rocketed into the ceiling with enough force to break anything remotely fragile. The scariest of all is that there is no indication that a part is going to break... it happens suddenly. I am nervous to continue using the unbroken products and will buy some free weights when I can afford them.

Edit-

Bought some adjustable dumbells and am much happier using the dumbells for almost all the exercises I would otherwise use with the bands. I still use the bands for a lat pull-down.",2.0
"I ordered these bands on the recommendation of my physical therapist, who is working with me to build my upper body strength. About two months after I started using them, the light blue band snapped off in my hand during an exercise set. It just failed, as if I had taken scissors and cut it across. Keep in mind that I was doing two reps of ten resistance exercises a day at a pretty low level (and that my PT had designed these).

So I contacted Black Mountain Bands about this and received a very nice email explaining that such failures are very rare. The company also promised to replace the defective band. That was a month ago. I have not received any replacement and now just hold my breath when I use this product. In the meantime, I am looking around for a different set of bands to replace these.",2.0
"Initially, I was quite impressed with the build quality of these bands. I  bought a set for my father , who is  70 years old,  to use for some basic strength training exercises. After about 3 months of use at 4-5 times per week, the blue and green bands (which he used most frequently )  have  cracked/broken.  I am guessing, my dad used it at a  moderate intensity  at the max. So I am disappointed with the build quality of these resistance bands. Those in the market for a resistance band should look at other vendors with superior quality.",2.0
"Found these bands on Amazon and thought the price was too good to be true and in fact it was.  I've had two different bands snap on me the second which caused me injury.  The first time a band snapped I thought nothing of it and called the company and they promptly sent me another.  Great I thought until one of the thicker bands snapped on me lacerating and badly bruising me.  If your only going to be using these bands every now and then then their ok, but for more frequent use they are no good.",2.0
"Good quality, but the bands were too short.  I would not reccomend them to my friends.  They need to make them longer.",2.0
"I bought these for P90X workouts and they worked ok at first, but like another reviewer said they are a little too short for over head exercises that require you to stand on it.  Also they have worn down really fast an yesterday one of the bands snapped on me and I now I have to replace it after only using them for 3 months. If you are using them for rehab exercises than they are good but if you plan on using them for any real exercise program then I would get something else.

I will say though that the company as a whole is great.  When I called them to let them know the band snapped they sent a replacement no questions asked so that was much appreciated and tells you what type of company they are.  So 5 stars for company but 2 stars for bands based on my use.",2.0
Don't buy this. My set had little tears and imperfections in the bands. It says to contact them about those things and I did. They said give us a shipping address and they ship me a new set. Never happened. I'm still waiting to hear back from them about this new set. To the bands: it seemed as my set had been used. There were tears and little bits of plastic sticking out of all of the bands. Then one of the outer rings on the backed cracked and broke. And I didn't every get a door hanger or ankle strap... Still waiting on that new set too...,2.0
i didn't get a door or ankle strap  I didn't reseive either a door anchor or a any way to hold bands to a door,2.0
"I used to own the other elastic bands by Black Mountain (the ones where the handles come attached on both ends). Some of them broke so i bought this version. I compared both versions to the same lbs in each band, and for some reason there isn't the same resistance in the version, as there is with the other. Ex: both 30lbs don't provide the same pull of resistance. This version is weaker.
It's hard to explain, so by all means find out for yourselves.",2.0
After two weeks one set of bands (black) broke.  The design of the handle attachment also sucks.  The attachement is metal clip to metal clip with one end stitched onto rough material.  When working out these parts tend to scrape the back and make use very uncomfortable.  Do not buy.,2.0
these bands start sticking flat when used where stepped on and start ripping at these areas they are only good for temprary use!,2.0
"I bought these for my husband in March of 2012 to use with P90X. He used them for one full session of P90X and started to use it for another session of P90X recently. Right out of the bag the clip that holds the bands to the handle broke on the black band.  And since then 2 more bands have snapped in two. They are used on a smooth, rubber surface or looped over a pull up bar.  Always stored in the original bag.",2.0
"The bands themselves are fine...nice color-coded and totally functional.
The door locking mechanism, which supposedly makes it safe to bring resistance to the bands once ""anchored"" to the door, are NOT functional.  I've had these bands snap back TWICE on me.  Needless to say, without a more adequate way of fastening these to my door, I cannot use them again.
The company needs to provide a longer strap which totally loops around the door hinge in a slip knot.  Anything short of that is not safe.",2.0
"I bought these resistance bands 2 weeks ago to use along with P90x.  Everything looked good upon arrival.  The carrying case is nice, and all of the accessories seemed pretty straightforward.

After using the resistance bands once, the green band already had a tear in it.  I was pretty disappointed, and called Black Mountain's customer service.  They were very nice on the phone, and said the band must have been defective.  They offered to send me a new green band free of charge.  I have yet to actually receive this band after 2 weeks, but I haven't lost hope yet.

I had been using the rest of the bands daily for P90x over the past 2 weeks.  This morning, I had the yellow band completely snap on me, which was pretty unpleasant.  Now I've had 2 of the 5 bands either tear or snap on me.  At this point, I'm just buying a different brand, since I don't trust the durability of this set anymore.

One thing to note is that I think these bands are particular sensitive to the exercises where you need to step of the bands closer to the edge.  The particular exerciser that caused the yellow band to snap was the squat x-press.",2.0
"As most exercise products, these were used a few times, and stored away in the bag for a few months. I took them out to start using them again after a car accident has kept me off the free weights, and the bands are starting to discolor and fade. Makes me nervous that the integrity of the rubber is weakening...",2.0
"I love the idea of having a single set of handles and the ability to swap the resistance level out or use multiple bands at the same time. But after only about a month of usage (every other day) the green band completely snapped mid exercise, and the other side of the same band was almost completely ripped as well. Fortunately I was not injured in this case but I don't trust any of the other bands in the set at this point. I'm looking for a replacement set now.",2.0
Handle bar is too short and has rough strap on its sides. It causes friction/chaffing with my index knuckle when doing bicep curls and other exrcises. They could either use longer handle bars or use smooth surface side straps. I am returning this product. I'm getting the SPRI braided resistance bands instead. It's what the trainers use in my gym.,2.0
"The bands appear to be of good quality, but the weight each band is supposed to provide is not accurate. I bought them to avoid having several dumbbells laying around the house, but now I've decided just to continue using free weights instead of these bands. These are fine for someone wanting only 5-10 lbs of resistance but not for the heavier weights they claim they are.",2.0
"I bought these resistance bands after comparing them to other sets online.  I took a chance after seeing the number of positive reviews but keeping in mind the few negative reviews.  Everything was going well after I had received my product and was using them with no trouble at all.  Two months go by and as I was doing my usual routine, the green band snapped and almost hit me in the face! I know that these bands like all resistance bands will eventually snap.  I didn't stretch the bands out too far and only worked out with them once a day weekly so I'm confused as to why after only 2 months they decide to wear down so quickly.  I'm not pleased with the durability and the fact that the return window closed only days before they broke but that's life I guess.",2.0
"I bought these bands to use with Tony Horton's 10-Minute Trainer.  For the most part these are great until you have to do a military press or an overhead tricep curl.  These exercises require you to stand on the middle of the band and push all the way up until your arms are fully extended.  For these exercises, the bands are too short for me and I worry how long they'll last if I keep stretching them that far.  I'm 6'0"" tall, so someone shorter might not have any problem.  If you're 6' or taller, I would find something longer because these will disappoint.  The B-Line bands used by Tony Horton for P90x and his other videos appear to be roughly twice as long as these.

These are good quality bands though.  The grommets are strong and the clips are metal and thus, less prone to breaking.  The door attachment and ankle accessory work fine.  The ""instruction manual"" is a little sparse and simplistic but you can't expect too much there.  Suspiciously, I noticed that none of the exercises show the bands being lifted any higher than shoulder length.

EDIT: I increased my review to a 4 star after using the bands a while longer and speaking to their customer service.  I also got a free orange band for my call.  According to customer service the bands can actually stretch safely up to 5 times their original size  (their max stretch is about 40 ft. although this makes them unusable).  After 3 weeks of overhead use they still show no signs of wear or tear.

EDIT: Still on the fence about these.  After 6 weeks of use I had to get the red band replaced after seeing several tears appear.  Now I'm seeing tears in the black band and one tear in the new red band already.  As far as I know I'm not using them inappropriately but I may have to go ahead and return the whole set.",2.0
"These claim to be ""fog proof""
Hmm! I wonder what that foggy stuff is when I wore these outdoors?",2.0
"When knives are listed, the BLADE length is typically what is in the description. This is toddler sized. I have small hands for an adult and can only get two fingers on the handle. Returning.",2.0
The handle is far too short placing the wielders fingers in danger. Not good if you are attempting to defend yourself and wind up getting cut by your own knife.,2.0
In order to clean the various barrel sizes you have to put metal adapters on the end of the rod and then the brush or patch holder. The plastic patch holders crack inside the rod with the slightest pressure. Why not have metal holders instead of the plastic...and really cheap plastoc. The latches on the case are hard to close also. Overall it's not that good.,2.0
Low quality cleaning kit.  All the pieces seam cheap and flimsy,2.0
"Nice assortment of cleaning tools, but the main cleaning rod broke at the plastic handle on the first use. Just OK.",2.0
"The plastic components are not sturdy at all. The smallest cleaning rod tip broke on the first use and the threads are now embedded in the smallest rod, rendering that gauge useless.",2.0
"The main cleaning rod with the handle broke at the neck of the threads with next to no pressure.  I was pulling a patch through a barrel and it just fell apart.  Been using an older brass rod/handle with the rest of the kit which seems to be doing alright so far.  Only other concerns are the jags and the small patch puller.  They bend very easily and I'm afraid I will snap the threads off one.

Edit : Just a few minutes after posting this I had a second rod break just above the threads.",2.0
Lot of parts and they are all cheap except for the wire brushes.  The rods easily bent and the molded case does not keep the component in their slots.  Not a fan.,2.0
"Amazon product information states ""Origin: USA"", but the package is clearly labeled ""Made in China.""  I would not have purchased if it was accurately described, and I always ask if the origin isn't shown in the Amazon information.

Except for the lone .17 caliber bore brush, the adapters and the collars/bosses of the bore brushes and cotton bore mops are aluminum, which can scratch bluing and steel barrels (the aluminum-oxide exterior film on all aluminum alloy is much harder than gun barrel steel); brass is MUCH preferred.  It's really odd since the cleaning rods themselves are solid brass.  But now that I look closely, I can see in the photo that the collars are aluminum. <sigh>.  Two stars for false ""Origin: USA"".  Don't support Communist tyrants!",2.0

very nice coloring but tore only after a few times of playing with it. I had a different one that lasted a few years with my kids playing with it.,2.0
"I should of listened to other reviewers when they stated that the material is not flowly parachute fabric.  The fabric is crinkly, stinky plastic like fabric that does not behave the same way that a parachute would.  It smelled of plastic right out of the box and the colors were purple, gold and green.  Very similar to Mardi Gras.  It is going back because I intended to use it with babies and if I don't like the feeling of the parachute on my face, its not soothing or soft, than the babies definitely will not either.

Amazon was amazing as usual.  Great shipping and returns.  Very quick.",2.0
This play parachute holds less air than a plain old bed sheet. We spent an extra 10 bucks on a real Gymboree play parachute from eBay with much more fun results.,2.0
The knife looked great when I received it.  I was very disappointed with the knife when I went to use it today.  Both blades and some of the metal on the knife body have some spots on them.  It looks like it might be some oxidation although it does not appear to be the usual rust oxidation.  This is the first time I used the knife although I have been carrying it with me for about two weeks.  I believe the knife should be of better quality.,2.0
"Came out of the box dull as a hoe. Grind is so bad, it can't be sharpened. Way to go Case. Good QC you got there.",2.0
"I recently got two of these knifes, and several others of different brand, thru a safety program at work. I like the appearance and general shape of the blade. Handle fits my hand nicely. The sheath is kind of cheesy in my opinion. My main concern is the blades of both knives are badly rolled over. I mean REALLY ROLLED OVER. Not what I expected from Case. Granted this knife isn't the most expensive you can buy, but this is a workmanship issue that really shouldn't have been. Not from Case. 2 stars.",2.0

"I bought this unit from Park & Sun last Christmas (2005) for my kids.  Installation was easy enough and we were having fun with it for the first few weeks.  At that point the electronic scoring stopped working, and I called Park & Sun for a replacement unit.  They were out of stock but promised to get me a new unit.  It never arrived after months of additional calls, so I finally gave up.  In the meantime, the rest of the unit fell apart with normal use.  The unit is all plastic parts, velcro, and nylong cord/netting, so over time the side netting broke loose, the connection of the net to the backboard tore away, and all that still worked was the metal rim.  I finally took it down and threw it away.

It may be that my experience with the product and company was isolated, but I wanted to post this review so that others were at least aware of the potential issues.",2.0
It was not like new. A main component was broken. I was not impressed with the condition of the basketball hoop.,2.0
I bought this back in 2006 for out basement game room. I loved it. It looked great on the wall and took up such little space when it was put away. I was so happy there was an alternative to the bigger indoor basketball games. Our family played it for about 3 months and the scoring stopped working. My husband is pretty handy but he could not get it to work and the customer service was not helpful. I still thought we would play with it without the scoring. Then the leg that supports it cracked so the game became unsteady. Last the hoop cracked. I do not think we overused it or abused it. It was mostly played by adults or with adult supervision. I was disappointed for the amount of money I spent that it did not last very long. I would love another one like this but I won't chance spending so much money espcially with no usuable warantee.,2.0
"Great idea for our basement with low ceilings (7 ft. )  Installation was easy enough (although 2 of the 6 screws provided broke (but we were able to use some of our own screws to replace).  After less than 24 hours of use the PVC frame cracked and now it makes it difficult to play and fold up to put away.  I called the manufacturer to ask for a replacement frame. The parts were not in, but I was promised to receive them in a few weeks.  I hope that the replacement parts hold up longer than the original??!!  My kids absolutely love the game  5 yr. old and 2 yr. old. I actually replaced the original balls with softer ones (for safety indoors).  We will see if the manufacturer comes though with the parts and if they can hold up better this time. I hope they do.",2.0
"The idea is great!  An arcade type, indoor basketball hoop game.  I love the compactness too but
we were disappointed in the quality.  The screws holding up the net easily popped out and other
screws are popping out (from when the ball hits the backboard).  The storage net which states will hold
the basketballs when not in use can in no way store even one ball (deflated, yes but who's going
to do that?)  We just put it together for xmas and after an hour we had screws popping out.
I don't think this will last for very long.  I think I will buy things like this from local stores
where I can return if dissatisfied.

I would not recommend this product!  I'm sure there are better quality ones out there (most likely
more expensive too but you get what you pay for - although $149 isn't cheap too!)",2.0
"The price of this Balance Board was really good, but the quality of the construction was poor.  The rollers are made up of multiple layers bolted together.  We returned this product and bought a more expensive version.  Amazon was really good to deal with for the return.",2.0
"My grandparents had a balance board at their house while I was growing up, so I wanted to get one for my children.
This one is not the same at all. It is made of cheap pressed wood. The board slips on the wheel. You can only use it on carpet because it slips too much on floor. The wheel is constructed of three circles and 8 squares that you assemble with a long bolt that runs through them. You have to tighten the bolt regularly.

It is still a lot of fun. It doesn't work as smoothly as the one my grandparents had. We used to be able to stay on it for hours. Because this one slips so much, we can only stay on it for a few minutes.

I don't think it will break from our weight. I weigh about 150 lbs. I don't think I would trust it if I weighed more than 200 lbs.
I'm glad I purchased it, but I would love to get one that was higher quality.",2.0
"For the price i feel the materials are very bad quality,the roller as everybody else has pointed out comes in several pieces & the wood used is very soft,i doubt it will hold up very well over continued use. I am 6'2 & 160 ilbs & i hear the board creaking under me,this does not inspire confidence in the product.
Going to cost too much time money to send it back so i will use it then its fire wood,ponie up for the iriginal bongo board you are better off.",2.0
It broke as we took it out of the box on Christmas morning.  Such a disappointment.,2.0
"This board is unstable and impossible to use.  My friend made his using a large round PVC pipe and a wooden board, which is exactly what I should have done.  I chose instead to go with this less expensive version, and it was not worth it.  The base is not a smooth roller, instead it gets lodged into the outer pieces that are in the bottom of the board.  I am going to try and take these pieces off. This is not the product I was looking for at all. I need a smooth piece of wood, bottom and top, and a simple smooth roller. This, unfortunately, is neither.",2.0
"Like the other reviews I was very disappointed in the construction of the this board.  This item is made up of pressed and glued layers of plywood.  What's more disconcerting is that the roller is also made of this ""wood"". The roller is made up of four discs of wood and numerous little square pieces that fit in between.  All held together by a long bolt.  I seriously doubt the longevity and durability (greater than one year) of this product.

Frankly it looks like someone went to Home Depot and bought some cheap plywood.  Made some cut-outs and put it in a box. I'm returning it today.

I gave it two stars because of its price. Its definitely cheap, compared to the other boards made of solid wood, and it shows.",2.0
"As a child I had a friend with one of these, I LOVED hers. When I saw this one, I was elated. it looked like a good flat board on a solid roller.

Boy was I surprised when I got it. It has a RAIL so there is no difficulty and the roller is 4 plywood circles with 6 plywood squares as spacers. Really cheap. I didn't expect that and am very dissapointed. I would recommend shelling out the extra $50.00 and getting an INDO board..",2.0
"I grew up with a ""bongo board"" which is the same as the balance board.  Except the ""base"" (ie the thing the board rolls on) is terrible.  It comes in multiple pieces of circles you have to assemble to make it.  The wood shreds when you roll on it.  It also doesn't feel very stable.  I wished I had spent a couple extra dollars and gotten the ""all plastic"" one or the ""pivet board"".  We haven't even really used it because it makes a mess and I am scared it will break.  This is one item I may have to bring back.  I LOVED my bongo board growing up and it was so much fun.  I thought it would be fun for my children too.  Unfortunately I picked the wrong one.",2.0
"It is not the old traditional carom board. The striker is the same weight of the rings and is hollow as the rings! Did I say rings are also hollow! Indeed it has multiple game options but I never tried them, as the main purpose of me getting this is for playing traditional carom (nostalgic:-)).",2.0
"I was disappointed to open this on Christmas and see that the playing surface is not wood at all, but a cheap piece of flimsy pressboard with a vinyl printed surface on both sides. I had a Carrom board a a child and they used to be made out of wood. If I was to buy it over again I would look on ebay for a used one from the 70s. The assortment of playing pieces also leave something to be desired, although the Carrom rings themselves are fine. It is all the other pieces which are very cheap.",2.0
Need a separate Striker. Rebound is not possible as carrom sides are quite thin.  Ut in this price its ok to spend some time.,2.0
Poorly made had scratches and some damages missing some parts quite disappointed had to return it for full refund.,2.0
Cheap made and broke getting it out of the box.,2.0
"Bought 2 of these for Christmas for my grandchildren.  The cue sticks are not tapered - just dowels - so the red plastic ends will not fit over the wood.  We tried soaking them in hot water to stretch the plastic still won't work.  We are going to try to glue on regular cue stick cork ends to see if that works.  Wood cues will scratch the boards so we wouldn't let the kids use them yet.  They are 8, 10 and 11 years old.  Will keep you apprised.  When I was a kid we had these and the cue sticks were tapered with no problem.  May try thrift stores to see if anyone still has the regular cues that are tapered.  Board looks like I remember - just the cue are not cues - just dowels.  We may have to try to use heavy duty belt sander to taper them until the ends fit.",2.0
"Subpar, not very study. The kids played with it one time and now it's just collecting dust",2.0
"I bought this game board for our family, thinking we would have it for years and use it often.
We used the carrom board, without the dowels, and the game was fun, but as others said, here are the main flaws:
- the ""cues"" are wooden dowels with a rubber piece on the end
- the pieces are thin & hollow, light plastic
- the game board itself is very thin plywood, and even separated when we took it out of the box!
- the nets (or pockets) are held in place by a thin wire that runs around the perimeter of the board, and they can easily be stretched out of place by anyone, especially kids taking out the pieces

Note: This is not carrom as played in the UK or India/Pakistan.  If you are looking for that, look elsewhere.

Overall, it's a great concept & seemingly priced well, but it's so cheaply made it will not last.
I returned this board for a refund after having it fall apart after one-time use.",2.0
"Do buy this if you want your kids to be disappointed.  Assembly was fairly straight forward and the kids started to play on it right away.  I have 3 boys under the age of 8, and upon initial play, the net did rebound the ball at a very good clip.  This lasted for about 3 weeks, when the balls stopped bouncing back with any oomph.  The Velcro holding the net in place was starting to get undone, but when I tried to tighten it, 2 ripped.  This is not a deal breaker as the net was still usable, but this does not bode well for the longevity of the product.  Also, when my 8 year old kicks the ball hard, it often pulls the stakes from the ground toppling the net over.  My boys really liked this net, and I wish it was built with better quality material.

I did receive this product for my unbiased opinion, and I hope I have offered such.",2.0
Not good for kids learning to play. If you don't kick it in the air then it won't come back to you. It just hits the pole on bottom,2.0
"Had I written this review a month ago, I would have given it 5 stars. It worked great. I really like it. But I went out today to find that the elastic ""ties"" that hold the net to the frame are becoming brittle and breaking. Three broke today alone as my son was using it for practice.

One year is not long enough for this type of product.",2.0
"Missing hardware: set of 4 screws, washers, wing nuts and anchor stakes. Otherwise works as intended.",2.0
"The net began to come apart almost immediately after my kids (all 12 and under) began playing with this, which was very disappointing.  It's stretched quite taught by design, but apparently the tension is too much for the construction of the netting to withstand.  The frame itself seems fine after a year of use, but the net was only good for about a week of use (and by now it's a complete disaster).  Wish it would have included a better net with what's an otherwise good design (and an otherwise fun product).",2.0
Even with some stakes it won't stay in place.  Every time my daughter bounces a ball off it it toppled over.,2.0
Assembly was fine. Problem is it only lasted about two months of light use before the net started disintegrating. Also the elastic ties that secure the net also deteriorate quickly and a couple failed within that same time. Now I have a useless piece of garbage that I have to recycle.,2.0
"I have an 11 year old who uses this everyday for about 1 -2 hours, so it gets a lot of wear.  We have had to replace it after a 1.5 years and will need to do so this again this spring.  The bungee cords are what break first and then the net.  That said the price is low so as long as you don't expect this to last for any considerable length of time it's ok.",2.0
"Started off well, but then a few of the strings started to break.",2.0
When the item was delivered the box was damaged. There were missing parts when we assembled the frame,2.0
"Hard to assemble; pinches your fingers. Too much tension in net - kick the ball at it and it collapses. Then back to finger pinching. My son gave up playing with it quickly. It sat unused in the yard for awhile; sat in the garage waiting to be reused for longer and is now probably trash. Too bad, good idea but this wasn't the proper design. Two stars because the price was worth a shot. Maybe you'll have better luck with it?",2.0
"Generally good. The edges of the net started breaking off in the first few days. And after a couple of months, I have to re-order the net.",2.0
"net ripped in 2 places after 20 kicks into it by a 12 year old.  nice design and useful but net is the weak point.  i did get a response on warranty replacement net within 24hrs from replacementparts@franklinsports.com.  We'll see, but i'd guess this is more useful for little kid play than any serious practice.",2.0
My son enjoyed it for a few days only. It bounces around too much when the ball hits it. You're constantly putting the stakes back in the ground.,2.0
The net broke after about 20 kicks - no idea how to get a replacement or patch,2.0
Crap.,2.0
"I am so taken aback by the packaging this arrived in, I can't even render an opinion on the product yet.  It arrived as a stacked set of 3 boxes, all taped together to make 1 very tall box.  (which looked like something my 8 year old would make when left to play with boxes)  When I opened it, there were a bunch of pieces  loose in the ""box"" with no cushioning, no filler, nothing.  There is no original box for the rebounder.  I can't even tell if all the pieces are included, or if this is even new!  It was to be a Christmas present for my daughter, but now we must assemble it to figure out it it's all there.  I don't even want to consider how we'll have to handle it if something is wrong!  I certainly can't ship it back in what they provided.  My husband, an Amazon shopper for many years, was truly shocked and angered by this.  By far the worst Amazon experience for either of us.",2.0
"Nice goal, except after 2 times use the net started to get holes. Would love to see a replacement net of better quality.",2.0
"My experience with this net was great the first time. Then, when I bought a second net and it was terrible. It took me three hours to put together; it took me three hours to break it. Plus, before I broke it, the bottom bar bent up way too easily, which made it hard to play with. Overall, I spent 40 dollars, took three hours to put it together, and it took me three hours to take it down. This won't be my next choice when I purchase a new net.",2.0
"Good item but the quality of this is subpar at best.  Within 1 day of use, the bottom bar started bending up due to the thinness and the tension from the rebounder net.  Within 2-3 weeks it was just getting worse and worse.  I went to the store and bought ribar to put inside the tube and that has resolved the issue....at least temporarily.  That should not be needed though.",2.0
Great idea. Great price. Lousy net ...a corner of which disintegrated as I was putting it together and further unraveled after a couple of hours rebounding play. Can't find a replacement net....must be one out there...and have already wasted time trying to rectify this. Should have bought a more expensive product I guess.,2.0
we get what we pay for. this is an affordable rebounder but the net does not hold up to shots from a soccer ball. ours ripped within 5 minutes of use as did our friends who has one too. We did get a replacement with little hassle. The new net we reenforced with an old soccer goal net we had and we take softer shots. so far it has held up.,2.0
The box looked like it had been previously opened  and taped back together and is missing a piece to put it together & there were no included instructions,2.0
"Product works as advertised, but I'm very concerned about the durability of this product seeing as how strands of the net snapped during assembly. Literally hadn't even used it and it was already falling apart. Assembly took about 30 minutes, will keep and try it out for now because I don't feel like disassembling it!",2.0
net did not hold up for very long.  Get a pug.,2.0
Use this one for only simple kid play.,2.0
"Not a bad idea, but flimsy craftsmanship.  The net tore in several places during assembly.  Have contacted the company, Outside of that it isn't a horrible product.  I envision it not lasting too terribly long, though.",2.0
The Plastic Handles did not last.  I still use it I just had to use tie wire to make it work.,2.0
"Got this today based on good reviews and value. But found out that in addition to the assembly not being  straightforward (as mentioned by many reviewers) the quality of the net is extremely poor. It will also not stretch to cover entire area especially at the bottom. The one square of the net was already broken and looking at the quality of the nylon string it may not last more than a few days.

Not a happy customer.",2.0
"We just bought this item for our 10 year old son, who loves to play soccer.  It was pretty easy to set up with clear directions, and everything was as described in the listing.  However, after my 10 year old, my 8 year and I were playing with it for a few hours having a great time, one of my sons pointed out that that the net was already torn.  Upon further inspection, I realized he was right and that the net appeared to be very low quality.

I later contacted Franklin about a warranty claim, but they weren't taking calls.  I emailed my claim a few days ago per their instructions, but I have yet to hear anything back.  I called today, but didn't reach a live person - I left a message.  Someone called me back and apologized that I didn't get a confirmation, but I should be receiving the replacement net in a week or so.  So that part of customer service was very good.

Hopefully the new net holds out better.",2.0
"After reviewing several products, I ordered this one from Amazon. It took me half an hour to assemble and I realized the net is too small for the frame. The soccer ball can go through gaps between the net and frame. A big disappointment. I will contact the manufacturer to send me the replacement net before I return the product.",2.0
Sticker keeps coming off,2.0
More of a novelty than for use in the field,2.0
"As a hardhat, it is qualified for actual job sites.  However, I am not a fan of the size (a little bigger then all the other hard hats I have owned)  Second point is the harness system, its a 6 point harness without the dial adjustment.  When switching from putting it on over a hooded sweatshirt or beanie, its a pain to adjust the snap back.  And to find a 6 point dail adjustable insert is hard.  Third point is the look, its basically stickers on a standard white hardhat.  If I had it to do all over again, I would just order larger stickers and a white hardhat style I like.",2.0
"I have one and use it for indoor grilling in inclement weather. It works fine for this, except for the wide 'shelf' on one side that limits the usable grille space.  The problem with this design is that if you get it hot enough to grill on, it will burn off all the seasoning on the side you may wish to use as a griddle. There is no way this product can do both things it claims to do.  I have a dedicated griddle for grilled cheese, pancakes, and French toast. I would prefer a dedicated grill to compliment it. Pre-seasoning or non-stick coatings are also not compatible with grilling lamb chops.",2.0
"This grill/griddle cooks wonderfully - but it looks like our stove gets too hot every time we use the grill side.  The first time it almost melted the gas control knobs on the righthand side of the stove, so the next time I put the grill on the left side of the stove.  I ended up with a powdery white residue on the stove and the underside of the grille, and it looks like something inside the stove may have gotten very hot.
To be honest, I suspect that the problem may be as much related to the type of stove top we have as to the grill design, but the raised rim around both cooking surfaces means that you have a concave surface over your stovetop trapping the heat and reflecting it back toward the stove, more so than with normal pots & pans.
On the plus side, the seasoning process works perfectly *provided* that the grill fits in your oven (do a dry fit before oiling up the grill - we didn't).  If it doesn't fit you'll have to find a friend or relative with a larger oven for this step.
I fried eggs on the griddle side with a touch of butter and had no problem with sticking, even after previously using high heat against that side for grilling meat.
I really wish I could give more than 2 stars for this product, but I don't think we'll be able to grill on it.  On the plus side, this is much less expensive than fancier models with enamel coating.  If you end up not being able to use it as you intended, at least you're not out as much money.",2.0
I would not recommend this griddle.  I have a flat top stop and it doesn't fit across both burners.  Don't waste your money.,2.0
"I gave it two stars because of several different reasons.
It is really heavy I used to lifts weights in my younger days so I thought this would not be an problem for me but I have found it to be just a bit heavy for me, it even hurts my hands so I would not suggest buying this griddle if you have any muscle or arthritis issues, it is something you really need to consider. next is the storage problem, I have a large kitchen but to date I can not find a place to store this thing, you can not keep it on top of the stove well you cant at least if you have an electric range as they suggest never leaving anything on top for long periods of time not even a pot so there is no way you can leave this heavy griddle on it. I tried the oven but when I opened the oven several days later it smelled I was afraid it would transfer yes I cleaned it very well so this thing is still in limbo, very frustrating. Also there are only two of us in this house hold and the griddle is just big for us it is just not practical anything I cook only takes up less then half of the griddle but you have to clean the entire thing of course. Which leads me to cleaning problems, I had found it cleans best only when hot which leads to burns. I have a rather large sink but it still does not fit in it, and I have not figured out how not to scratch the sink in the process. But it does cook well and I have so far not had any sticking problems or chipping of the surface. But then with all the problems stated above I have only used it a few times and had hoped to use it much more. So if all the issues above do bother you then this is the griddle to buy. one last thing I now see it is $10.00 less then I paid for it just a month or so ago so you might want to wait and see if it goes on sale I just wish they would stick to one price. a bit frustrating.",2.0
"The griddle being reviewed is what's called ORIGINAL FINISH.

That means the item has NOT been treated at the factory to

include a baked-in coating.

A purist who has lots of time, patience, and skill to correctly

coat the Original Finish cast-iron griddle by Lodge (USA!) at

home has the golden opportunity to do so.

A klutz or overworked person would do well to SKIP coating the

Original Finish version AND INSTEAD buy a Pre-Seasoned version:

ASIN: B00008GKDQ (into Search Amazon.com type only B00008GKDQ ).

Yes, it will cost you more moneywise (free shipping applies), but

you SAVE on the time and slight risk involved in PROPERLY coating

an unfinished griddle. FYI, Lodge supposedly uses vegetable oils

to Pre-Season their ironware; vegetarians should not be put off.

Read the description (dimensions, features) of ASIN: B00008GKDQ;

you'll notice that the two items are not identical. The supposed

deeper grooves or grease trough on the Pre-Seasoned version is a

point to consider; I have not matched the two up to verify this.

?Does the phrase Wipe Clean signify Less Work for Mother to you?

I myself would prefer to wipe clean the Pre-Seasoned B00008GKDQ

rather than scrape, scour, gouge, and chisel an Original Finish.

A special message to users of cordless phones and cell phones: do

NOT attempt to juggle/cradle the wireless handset along with the

Lodge griddle (either version). You need the presence of mind and

the undivided use of BOTH arms to successfully transport Lodge's

griddle (from stovetop to sink or cupboard). You CAN answer your

phone while using the griddle, but when it comes time to move the

griddle itself (not the spatula), have both ARMS free; you need a

lot more than merely the hands and wrists to schlep this 15-pound

behemoth to where it belongs next.",2.0
"I own at least a dozen of the lodge cookware pieces and love them very much but this is not such a great thing. I went through the normal in the oven seasoning that always works just great but this thing warped like a potato chip! It did flatten back out as it cooled but everytime I put it on my two burners to use, it warps again making it very rocky on the stove top and my pancakes looked like Picasso made them. It always flattens back out but it's really a pain in the ah hum to use. The grill side set off all the smoke detectors and left a greasey film on everything in my whole house and I was only using a med low burner, well, at least the door stopped squeeking! It is also a bit to narrow for two rows of pancakes unless you make them very small and the center doesn't get hot enough. Just when you thought you've experienced all the unpleasantness of this pan, you then go to clean it and discover you'd be better off just throwing it out in the yard for the dogs to lick clean! I love you Lodge, I really do but I'll stick to outside grilling and my larger lodge skillet for hotcakes, the 13 inch round pan is a dream as are all the other pieces I own. As for this heavy sticky thing well, I may try it out on my fire ring next cookout and if that doesn't work out, it's yard sale time!",2.0
"I've had two of these U-Locks, the locking mechanism is just poorly designed.  The first one I traded in because the key broke off in the lock after the third time using it.  The second one no longer opens after only 1 year of use, the mechanism just froze up.  I'd recommend spending a little more to get something that will last.",2.0
"If you have this product, don't pull too hard on the key when you're trying to get the lock open. It WILL break. It happened to me twice.

The first time, the lock was jammed, I tried to force it open, and the key broke. I thought, okay, I was pulling too hard, and this was my fault. So, after the cops came and cut my lock, I stupidly bought the exact same brand of U-lock. The FIRST TIME I tried to open the new lock, what happens? The key breaks. Now, THAT was not my fault. At least, that time, the bike wasn't already locked to anything.

Also, I've had to use WD-40 to get it open when it rusts in the rain. It was sometimes hard to open, even when it wasn't rusted. And I've never even bothered with the bracket, because it's very flimsy, just like the keys.

It's a cheap lock, but you get what you pay for.
But my first MasterLock lasted two years, so it might last a while if you're very careful.",2.0
The poles came for the tetherball set but I never got the ball. I had to go out and buy one separately to make it for Chritmas and I purchased this set well in advance. Still havn't received the ball.,2.0
great at first but didn't even last an entire summer,2.0
I loved everything about this and was really enjoying it with my grandchildren. Until the plastic sleeve broke. It's very thin and one time when I was removing the pole for storage it snapped and came out of the ground with it. Now it is unusable.,2.0
"The set is so much fun and easy to assemble. The problem is that in under 1 month of play and elemental exposure, the rope broke.",2.0
Arrived in torn up box but all the parts were present. Sleeve easy to put in ground but after a few rounds of play it is wobbly and needs to be moved. Definitely needs cemented in for better stability,2.0
Ball had a hole in it when we received it,2.0
Cheaply made :(. Thought it would be sturdier.,2.0
"Product looks good until you install.  Three problems.  1). The steel pole does not fit snugly in the sleeve so after i put in concrete it wobbles.  2). The steel rod inserts into a second rod and this also does not  fit tightly, adding more wobble.  3) i believe that if you have ten feet above ground, you should have more than 12 inches underground in sleeve.  Too late for me to return so i will look to find a one piece pole and cement into ground directly.  Very disappointed.

UPDATE:  emailed park&sun and received immediate response.  they may have a solution to tighten poles.  i will update after i try it.  very nice customer service.",2.0
You need a handy man to put it together... Very complicated:(,2.0
Too much assembly and disassembly required for every game. It also doesn't fit any mid size car while assembled. I wouldn't recommend it unless you only want to use it in your backyard.,2.0
Significant rust after only a couple months. I emailed Franklin and they were nice but said it couldn't be in the rain. Playing soccer in the rain is an activity my kids enjoy so it was not a good match for us. We have a shed to store it when it's not in use. It was easy to assemble and fine otherwise.,2.0
Fell apart after a couple months of use.  I am in Arizona and the elements are harsh on something like this.  Unfortunately nothing is really field tested in Arizona which means we always get stuff that falls apart if it is meant to stay outdoors.,2.0
The goal straps broke on day one from the force of the ball hitting the back of the net. My 9- and 7-year-olds should not have enough power to do this.,2.0
Way too small for a 10-11 year old!,2.0
attachment Velcro to the net comes off too easily,2.0
"Low quality, water comes inside the tubes and get rusted.",2.0
"I bought two of these goals for a school that I did my Eagle Scout project at and both of the goals had defects and they had to be fixed before they could be assembled. On one of the goals there were no pegs where there should've been so the goal was difficult to put together, and on the other goal the end of one of the pipes was bent and needed to be completely unbent to be able to even fit with the connecting pipe. Overall pretty dissatisfied due to the fact that I bought two goals and both of them had something wrong with them.",2.0
"The quality and ease of set up is fine, the issue is the size. It's about five feet wide definitely not six. The height is only and inch or two off so I can handle that but losing a whole foot is more of an issue.",2.0
Goal is decent size.  The Velcro leaves a little to be desired.  It's coming loose in a bunch of places and not enough velcro is provided.,2.0
Nets are felling apart in a few months,2.0
The net developed several large holes after about 3 months of use.,2.0
"My kids were so excited to have a decent soccer goal to practice with. It is okay, but within a few weeks it began sagging across the middle due to the weight of the steel. The steel needs to be a little more heavy duty to withstand the weight and width of 12 feet across. It sags significantly now 9 months after purchase. They really can't use it anymore. :(",2.0
"I don't like this goal. It came with an extremely short net and also was missing two holes on the poles that attach to eachother, also two of the poles for the frame were oversized and dented. I regret buying this product.

Also the net is not black like shown, it's red and blue and also has blue and red sleeves that cover the posts. Not at all like what the image shows.",2.0
"After a month of use on two of these goals the center bars have begun to sag down and not be straight, the metal has all begun to rust,. For the price you not going to find a goal this size, but sadly they just don't hold up like I was hoping for. I have sanded down the metal and spray painted them with antirust paint and have welded the bars straight on both goals to be a better functioning setup for my son",2.0
Nets break easily. Already a couple of tears in the net and it's been two weeks since I bought it!,2.0
"Easy setup and tear-down, solid construction, great price, and kids love it. What more could I ask for.

Edit July 8, 2016- not even 3 weeks in now I have internal rusting pouring out of All the seams and joints. I originally rated this high but now this is a overpriced piece of junk.",2.0
Its glod to play with but started rusting at bottom within 10 days when left outside in grass.,2.0
The opening at the end of the pole was not perfectly round which prevented the other pole from sliding inside and connecting. I will be returning this item.,2.0
"I purchased this for my nephew for Christmas. They are pretty nice quality, BUT home plate was missing. I'm going to contact the manufacturer and I will update this review with how it goes.",2.0
"I would have given it a 5 star , but I paid for a new product and these were obviously used.  They were scuffed and one base was yellowed and had what looked like a melted area about 1/2"" in diameter almost burnt through.  It's such a paint to return something like this so I will be keeping them. They are rigid and will work for what I need.",2.0
Looks well built but two of the poles were bent an the end creating a round hole/square peg scenario.,2.0
"These are not nearly as heavy weight as I wanted. It didn't take too many practices to show significant use by 9-10 year old kids. All bases have dings in them and a couple have permanent impressions where cleats have indented nearly all the way through the rubber.

Overall, I wouldn't buy these again and would hold out for something much more rigid.",2.0
You have to kick soft kicks. The net is too weak for hard kicks. The straps get loose after a while also which makes the net sag a lot. Would recommend for 12 years and under only.,2.0
"The bases each have a defect, they are softer along a line at the edge of each, about an inch from the border.  Whatev-- keeping them 'cause not worth the hassle, but FYI appears to be a substandard product that shipped out",2.0
"OK I guess vs others - but I suggest spending more for the Goalrilla ""rebound"" style so my kids can also use it alone because the ball bouces back out - which builds skills stopping the ball too!",2.0
Don't expect it to last much more than one year. Velcro straps fail after first year. Net starts falling apart after first year as well.  Frame rusted through after second year.,2.0
Disappointed is the lack of sturdiness,2.0
netting was damaged,2.0
"Be aware, the steel rusts very quickly.  within 2 years the metal starts literally falling apart.  you need to rustproof (or at least slow it down) with some spray or brush paint.",2.0
"I really think the materials used to make this product are really cheap. With some kicks, the net broke. I would recommend buying an actual good quality product that may cost more money but surely may be worth it.",2.0
Need more disdants.,2.0
Disappointing quality from Bushnell. Item arrived with a large hole in the housing and was impossible to adjust for proper focus.,2.0
The product I got has a misaligned lens so when you use it it's irritating because you will have a feeling that you thought you're cross eyed.,2.0
"Blurry, difficult to focus, has became paper weight.",2.0
Not a fan of these binoculars very very cheap anf very hard to focus in on something and hard to adjust. I would apend ths money and actually get some decent binoculars,2.0
Poor focus ability,2.0
Clarity really good but could hardly see across the street.  Not strong at all.,2.0
"I can't seem to adjust them, so really can't use them.",2.0
You get what you pay for.  My pair will not focus and missing lens covers.  I put  in drawer as a learning experience.,2.0
love bushnell but these aren't my favorite  quality seems mediocre  but they were inexpensive,2.0
I ordered these binoculars for bird watching and was disappointed. They are a cheap pair of binoculars but were worse than a compact pair of Bushnell Trophy compact 8x25 I've been using. The biggest problem was the left eye would not focus. I send them back for a refund and opted to purchase a pair of higher quality.,2.0
Purchased these thinking they would really give me an ideal view of bird and view of my yard. There is no zoom on these and they seem more like a kids toy than a real binocular. I should have done more research and got a pair that will go further lengths with a nice zoom.,2.0
Can not get in focus.,2.0
THEY WHERE NOT AS GOD AS I THOUGHT COULD NOT RETURN THEM CAUSE IT COST TOO MUCH FOR WHAT IT WAS WORTH.,2.0
"Bought these for my 7 year old nephew. The first time he dropped them they broke. They're easy to use and very clear but don't buy for kids or if you're prone to dropping things. They're not very sturdy, the ocular piece broke right off on one side.",2.0
Returned it as was unhappy with the range that was mentioned Vs what it actually did. also the focus function was a bit out of whack,2.0
Good size but very difficult to focus.,2.0
"I bought this and could not see anything that was far. Literally, I preferred using my own eyes instead of this binoculars. I sent them back right away!",2.0
"I purchased these binoculars specifically for wide field low power astronomical observation to supplement my higher power binoculars and telescopes.  They serve pretty well, I can even pick out some of the brighter Messier objects.  The left ocular is out of focus and fuzzy in the lower left field of view.  Definitely not a collimation issue as the center of the field is quite sharp.  Probably a defective primary lens or eyepiece lens.  Unfortunately I discarded the packaging before I discovered this defect, so I was reluctant to return it.  Check for this problem right away.  If you get a good pair, they are petty nice for the price.",2.0
"These are definitely cheap binoculars. As with most binoculars, these focus by sliding the eyepieces the eyepieces in and out just slightly. However, on my set, the eyepieces can wiggle around a little bit, which makes it pretty much impossible to get a good focus in both eyes at the same time, even with adjusting the monocular. Also, the left side is just not very clear in general and is always hazy around the outside especially. I wasn't expecting crazy fancy, but being Bushnells, I was rather disappointed.

These are not high quality and the magnification sucks. Pricey paperweight as far as I'm concerned.,2.0

"I've had this binocular for quite some time.  I needed an inexpensive binocular for watching the birds and creatures our my shop window.  While they are fairly light and clear, the ""quick focus paddle"" does a terrible job due to poor tolerances.  The problem is that the eye pieces do not consistently move in tandem with each other.  And, even a little heavy eye pressure will change the focus on one or both sides.  I've tried to improve the tolerances on the focus mechanism but to no avail.  Too bad because the price point and other features were just what I needed.  However, this unit is going in the trash because I demand a crisp and easy focus.",2.0

"I usually consider Bushnell products to be of high quality, but these binoculars are awful! We have a few other pairs of Bushnell binoculars and they are great, but not these. They are incredibly hard to focus and the clarity is very poor. There are no attachments for the lens covers and they are of what feels a cheap quality plastic. I guess I should have had low expectations because of the price, but I'm still shocked by the poor quality. I could not get a decent focus on these things despite the two different focusing adjustments (one on the right round part where your eye goes) and one on the piece that is in the middle connecting the two round parts (very scientific description I know...try to keep up)

I suggest you dig deeper into and spend the extra money for these Bushnell Binoculars instead:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bushnell-H2O-Waterproof-Fogproof-Roof-Prism-Binocular/dp/B00CQY7BBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bushnell H2O Waterproof/Fogproof Roof Prism Binocular</a>&nbsp;in the 8x42mm (currently $75). There is such a SIGNIFICANT difference in quality overall, ability to clearly focus, and user friendly features. All the lens covers are attached so you don't have to worry about losing them, and because of this they don't really need a case (in my opinion..). They're water and fogproof, which is great wherever you live (and especially for us as we live on the bay).

Pass on these and buy something a bit more expensive & with much higher quality.",2.0
Junk... Have to use as monocular as there has been double vision since purchase.  Too Lazy to send back.  Would not buy again.,2.0
"Came with one of the objective lenses crooked, which made it hard to focus both eyes, even with the diopter. It also caused a lot of eye strain to use for a while. I wouldn't recommend for someone who wanted a good pair of binoculars that they could use for extended periods of time and the rest of their lives.",2.0

"These binoculars arrived with problems and I returned them:

- the right-lens diopter is very iffy and difficult to adjust. In fact, I never was able to get a satisfactory focus with it.
- both lenses displayed significant distortion around the outside edges
- It was impossible to clearly focus on anything beyond 50 yards
- the quick focus mechanism frequently failed to work and took a few tries to adjust

Unfortunately I had some similar problems with recently purchased Bushnell 20x50 wide angle binoculars. Bushnell used to be an inexpensive and decent brand.  Not anymore.",2.0
"the binoculars were a lot heavier than expected, I have an older  pair and they were not as heavy otherwise they were ok",2.0
"I wanted some inexpensive binos for hiking and birding and these seemed to fit the bill. There was some false color but otherwise fairly sharp and decent. That is, until the strap gave way and the binos landed on the concrete. Unfortunately there's no way to collimate (align the optics) these binos so now I have a useless paperweight. Would not buy again and frankly I should've known better not to purchase anything by the Bushnell brand.",2.0
"Optically these binoculars are OK, considering their low price. But wow do they seem flimsy. The parts that slide in and out to focus are supposed to slide both sides together, right? Well nothing is rigid, so one side can get ahead of the other by quite a bit. Both sides will get pushed in, changing the focus completely, just from holding the binoculars up against your face lightly. The little rocker thing you adjust with your fingers to change focus seems pretty cheapo and fragile. They might be OK for disposable situations, but I would not buy these binoculars again.",2.0
"NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH AS COMPARED WITH OLDER BINO OF THE SAME RATING
RECOMMEND MORE POWERFUL BINO. MY PROBLEM BUT DISSATIFIED",2.0
I've purchased two pairs of Bushnell's and each lasted about a year and a half.  The problem is not in resolution and focus--certainly adequate for a pair in this price range--but the quality is absolutely China-made CHEAP.  In borth pairs one lens began to pull out of its socket and then the other lens did the same.  I thought maybe I could then cannabilize the two pairs into one but that was futile.  Now I have two pair of defective Bushnells: one pair still has a right lens that works so I'm reduced to viewing with one eye.  The other is completely defunct.  At the moment I am now proceeding very cautiously in purchasing a reasonably-priced durable pair of binoculars in the $100 to $200 price range.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!,2.0
"I bought these binoculars to keep in my car - for those times when I see a bird or an animal and I want to stop and see what it is.  They do enlarge what I'm looking at, but I can't get a really good focus with them to be able to see details, such as feather patterns or special markings on birds.  I admit that I have one really bad eye for distance, and I've never been able to look through binoculars with my glasses on, so I take off my glasses to look through the binoculars.  It may be that my eyes are so bad that a good focus isn't possible, but even when I just look through my good eye, I still can't get a good focus.  I've played with the individual focus ring on the eye end, and that doesn't seem to help the focus at all.  I'd say that I got what I paid for - which isn't a great pair of binoculars, but at least they work a little (and are better than having no binoculars in the car at all).",2.0

"Lets face it , for 28 and change I should have known better. Milk jug caps have better fit than the lens caps that come with these , the optics themselves yeah you can see with them a little but don't expect to see the allied landing on Normandy unless its 50 feet from you. I would hesitate to buy anything from bushnell around this price range until your up in the $200+ price range and its still probably NOT made in the USA.

"I wanted to like this tricycle, but the product description is misleading.  It does not ""grow with your child"" as there are only two seat settings that are determined by a couple of notches in the seat stem.  These notches are set by turning a screw.  However, the seat still tends to twist a little bit while at these two settings.  My 2.5 year old couldn't reach the pedals, so I put the seat at the bottom.  Because there is not notch there, the screw digs into the stem's metal and the seat almost freely twists.",2.0
"Warning comes unassembled and not the easiest to put together. This is a big trike.....bigger than I thought.  Also, the bell did not work in the one we received..There seems to be no recourse unless you send the whole trike back.  Disappointed with lack of support.",2.0
"ehhh. Seems heavy. Which is good I guess, means it is sturdy and will last. But it is heavy, with tiny peddles. A 3 year old can't really get it moving that easily. They are going to play on it as much as you think they would. Mine hasn't. He WANTS to, he is EXCITED to, but then he gets on it and ... ehhh. Plus, you really have to tighten the hell out of that bolt that links the handle bars to the front tire fork. If you don't, the tire will move back and fourth while they peddle and are holding the handle bars straight. Why isn't it slotted where that can NOT happen? A bolt trying to tighten a tiny metal piece around a slick shiny metal tube... you gotta tighten the crap out of that.

This is a great tricycle but it does not stop squeaking no matter what you do,2.0
The bike is cute to look at and a nice size for our three year old. However it is not made very well.  It rattles and squeaks something awful.

"This is not the trike of my youth. The forks are the most disappointing as I will have to repair them. Will probably get a machine shop to make some for me. They are too flimsy and the very limited use of two less than three year olds has already caused them to slant out of true. On the other hand, something about the look of the trike makes it the one my grand kids choose as their favorite. Maybe i will find an old one in a junk store or estate auction.

"I'll give it a pity star for almost all metal construction and rubber tires.  Was starting to put it together when I noticed that one of the front wheel spokes was bent in a weird zig-zag.  The rim was bent too.  It was kind of subtle, but just turning it an watching it against the fender made it pretty obvious.  Stopped putting it together and stuffed it back in the box.  Am going through the return process now.  I'd like to do a replacement, but I opted for refund instead.  It's stuffed so tight in the box that I doubt I could get one that's not damaged.",2.0

Expected a lot more from Radio Flyer. This was hard to assemble because several parts had to be almost forced into position. Even when assembly was completed (correctly mind you) the handlebars wiggle out of alignment and the seat doesn't stay at the desired height.,2.0
I hate to give this tricycle only two stars because Radio Flyer in my opinion are the best tricycles out there.  The problem with the tricycle was that somehow it was exposed to smoke.  The smoke odor on the box was overwhelming; we had to put it outside until the tricycle was assembled.  I never expected that the tricycle itself would smell just as bad.  Once assembled the smell of the tricycle was just as overwhelming; it hurt your nose the odor was so strong.  I used Lysol wipes to clean the tricycle but this did not help much.  It also appeared to me that the tricycle was a return that amazon resold to me.  There were scratches on the tricycle and the rod that connects the back tires was bent.  I buy hundreds of items off amazon and this was one of the most disappointing items I have received.  Nexet time I will order products direct from Radio Flyer.,2.0
"It's heavy and loud.  It squeaks and is too big for my 3 year old.  I really regret this purchase.  The only reason I bought this bike is it's gender-neutral so if I have a boy later on, he'd be able to use it.  I should've bought another bike. My daughter hates it too.",2.0
"It looks decent and functions OK but the quality is so poor!

"We bought this tricycle for my son who was 2 years old. He was in the 90+ percentile in height and weight. He couldn't read the peddles until he was much older.

The kid loves it, and will have a great time but the engineer in me know it could be better and feel that Radio Flyer is phoning it in.

I'm honestly ashamed I gave them money for this. Does the product work? Sure. Will the kid have fun? Sure. Could this be built in America at a competitive price? I have to believe it can.",2.0
"I never write reviews but I feel the need to do so on this item.

I bought this tricycle for my son's second birthday. He couldn't quite figure out the pedaling aspect when I first gave it to him but I figured he would get the hang of it.

Unfortunately, now that he is bigger and more coordinated he is still unable to pedal. Though he can easily reach, the pedals have a lot of resistance which makes it hard for him to go further than one push. Keep in mind, my son is often confused for being four rather than two so I don't believe its that he is too weak or small. I think that if he had learned on a bike that was easier to pedal he probably would have been able to figure this one out but so far, no luck.

Other than that, the tricycle is perfect. Great looking, not terrible to put together. No complaints except for the difficulty of pushing. Thus, I would not recommend this for a first tricycle.

Please give suggestions for a better first tricycle as I am still on the hunt!",2.0
"When purchasing this product, I thought that the brand Radio Flyer was a brand that I could depend on for durability since I was using this item in my preschool.  I found that the bicycle that I purchased was not as sturdy as other bicycles that I have purchased in the past and the handle bars could not be tightened enough to keep them from moving, which prevents my 2-4 year olds from riding and turning the bike properly.",2.0
"We were so excited to buy this bike for our 2 year old.  We figured Radioflyer is a well known brand which has been around for over 70 years; however, now the bike is not made with quality American standards.  It's made in China. The bike has a noxious odor which is so strong that I fear it may be carcinogenic to our kids' precious lungs and bodies.  The bike is not very constructed and tips over easily.  Now it will be a cumbersome task to return this product that we tediously assembled.  More disappointing, this toy purchase was a ""tease"" to our child who was so excited have his first ""real"" bike.
I guess, the search will go on.  :(  Buyers beware when buying ANY products for your kids.  Nowadays, company profit supersedes children's well-being.",2.0
"I worked in bicycle shops for years and assembled many tricycles. I purchased this one for my 2.5-year-old daughter because she saw one at the hardware store and loved it. The trike has the classic Radio Flyer look, which is great, and its steel construction gives it some heft and the appearance of durability.

But there are problems. The pedal/crank/front fork assembly relies on a cheap plastic casing to hold these critical pieces together (every time the child pedals the trike, all of these parts are under stress). The casing fell out on one side almost right away, leaving the crank separated from the fork. Trying to lightly tap it back into place with a hammer proved unsuccessful. Also, the handlebar/headtube assembly relies on a nut-and-bolt configuration that even under repeated tightening was unable to hold the handlebar securely in the headtube. this, of course, is maddening to both adult and child when handlebars are constantly out of alignment.

Buy with caution.",2.0
My 3 year old can't reach the petals (she is considered tall for her age).  She is also terrified to ride this horrible tricycle because it tips over!  Nostaglia is about all it is good for!,2.0
"We bought this Radio Flyer Tricycle for my now five year old when she was two.  It tips over horribly.  The front will ""jack-knife"" and then it tips over.  She refused to ride it until she was older, even though she could reach the pedals with no problem.  She just got tired of tipping over and crashing.  When she was three, it seemed to work better for her and not tip quite as much.  We kept it because it is so cute and reminiscent of the old days.  Now, our 2nd daughter is two and we are going through the tip-overs all over again.  It's very unsafe and frustrating for both child and parent.  We are going to sell it in a yardsale and buy another brand that has better reviews and is not known to tip so easily.  Radio-Flyer, you need to do a little work on this one to make it safer for this era.",2.0
My Mother bought this bike for my 2 year old son as a big brother gift when we had our second child.  We had it for a couple of weeks and he drove around in the house fine.  But when we took it out on the sidewalk it kept toppling over if he hit an uneven part on the sidewalk.  So we took it to the park to a very flat section and he kept falling over.  Even a 3 year old friend kept falling over and getting hurt.  I took the bike back the next day.  Yes the bike is as cute as can be but be careful.. wear a helmet and pads!,2.0
"I purchased this tricycle for my 2 year old son-he is 4 now. What a mistake! The bike tips over very easily when turning and it's very hard to tell a 2 year old to slow down when he's trying to have fun. Even in slow speed turns you can see the inside back tire start to lift.
With a 2 year old, riding the tricycle occasionally, all the tread wore off the front tire in 6 months and I have not found anyone who sells replacement tires.
Although I grew up with Radio Flyer's back in the 60's, and they were made very well back then, I have to say I would never buy a Radio Flyer product again.",2.0

"I've owned the PowerAssist (S66N) for about a year and I've been very happy with it. I love the user-replaceable blades and while you may not like the 'wings', they're a lot nicer on your hands than the bare channel. Since I generally carry a small pocketknife, I don't really need a multi-tool with a knife.. So, I purchased the S60, planning on replacing the knife blade with another tool. HOWEVER, the S60N which I received, from Amazon, which appears to be the current shipping model, is the one with the single lock for the tools. The single lock sucks. No, really, it SUCKS. The S66N has the piano style locks where each tool has an individual lock. The problem with the single lock is that if all the tools, other than the one you're using, are not folded exactly right, the lock won't actually lock! This is a major problem!

The picture that Amazon has shows an earlier model S60 that has the piano style locks and the hex head bolts rather than the allen key bolts. The shipping item is NOT as pictured, and as far as I can tell from SOG, the current model is the one with the single lock and the allen key bolts.. I'm sure the single lock is significantly cheaper to manufacture!

Also, the fit and finish of the S66N (purchased November 2015) compared to the S60N (purchased November 2014) is like a child toy. The S66N has razor sharp ruler markings and a beautiful finish. All the individual tools are shiny without any casting imperfections. The S60N's ruler markings are so faded/indistinct that they're almost unusable. The phillips screwdriver is a rough casting with poorly defined screw blades. The marlinspike has jagged burrs on it - it will ruin the rope of any knot you try to use it on.

Also, the cam/gear mechanism for the pliers is a very nice force multiplier, but it means that if you need to open the pliers particularly wide, the handles go out very far which may leave you with insufficient room/leverage to actually use the pliers... I would say that it is more common for me to wish that there was some way to turn the cam/gear mechanism off than for me to be thankful that I have the extra gripping power....

I don't know if the S60N has always been inferior to the S66N or if SOG's manufacturing has just gone downhill, or if I just got a poor specimen.. However, I could live with the casting issues and I could live with the faded ruler, but the single lock is just a pile of steaming doodoo.",2.0
"Had Gerber multitools for many years, and decided to try the SOG.  Well, shoulda stuck with Gerber.  SOG is well built and all, but not very user friendly; especially when accessing the tools other than the pliers. Oh well, live and learn. Stick with what you know I guess.",2.0

Anyway, the knife itself is great, the blade action is really really smooth and the lock is easy to manipulate and strong. I would suggest removing the clip as soon as you get it.",2.0

"We gave this trike as a gift.  While the underlying elements may be sturdy, here is how our daughter and son-in-law described the experience of assembling it -
""An update on the trike. I have two options since it's got missing parts and is very wobbly, obviously because of this. It also needs washers, which they tell you it might need in step FOUR of the absolute worst directions we've both ever laid our eyes on. Terrible!
 Anyway I'm thinking of taking it to the bike store and paying them to look it over and make it safe. If they can't or won't or think it's crap I'll need to take it apart I guess and send it back. Either way she is not seeing it for her birthday. I'll be lucky if I get it to the bike store this week. I'm so sorry. It's so frustrating the crap that's on the market. This is John Deere and I'm so disappointed in the company. The directions are barely legible and everything is mass produced so for something like this it's really pretty awful.

"This trike is fine in most of the ways it should be. The handlebar assembly is difficult to adjust & tighten properly, but that's par for the course these days.
What is inexcusable is the stench of chemicals coming off the rubber (?) tires. How can no one else have mentioned this? Were ours the only tires made of material recycled from a toxic waste dump?
I thought the smell would blow off, but now it's been almost 5 months with no abatement (in fact it's worse in warm weather!) making me REALLY wonder if i should let my kids ride this thing.

"I think that this is both one of the coolest tricycles ever and the worst unassembled product I have ever dealt with.  First, the box looked like it had been tied to a rope and pulled across country before delivery and had an enormous hole in the side.  I decided to assemble it early because I had read that the directions were poor and parts missing.  Turns out both were true.  I had read a lot of grandparents' posts about the difficulty and thought it would not be a problem for me (I pride myself on being good at assembling things and even building things from scratch).  The directions are manageable, but the parts are not well labeled.  The bigger issue is the missing parts.  In fact, it is not that parts intended to be included were missing; amazingly, the directions actually say that the handlebars may not fit properly, and if so, add washers (not included).  All they needed to do was insert a couple extra washers to make this a reasonable request.  I am still working on getting the handle bars tightened - I have a little over a week until Santa needs to deliver it.

"We bought this trike for our very tall 3 year old for her birthday.  We live in the country with lots of sand and rocks in the driveway and no other trike looked capable of making it over all of that.  Both my aunt (who has run a daycare for decades) and my brother (with 4 kids and also lives in the country) have these trikes and loves them.  This is what we based our decision on in choosing this trike.

Let me be clear, Amazon was lovely and very helpful.  This is not a negative review about Amazon or the seller but about the trike itself.

My husband, who has a PhD in agronomy/genetics, assembled the trike.  After assembly, my daughter began to ride it and had great fun - but then my husband noticed the back two wheels wobbling significantly when she was riding it, almost as if they were about to fall off.  A day later, the right pedal fell off while she was riding it (and the left pedal pin was stripped, we had to use a part from home to make it work).  A few days after that, the front tire went completely flat!  We don't have stickers here and my daughter had not ridden it enough to damage the tire.  At that point, my husband took the trike apart, put a screwdriver through the a back wheel and spun it - and the wheel still wobbled.  At that point, we realized it was not an assembly issue but a manufacturer issue - he says that the bearing inside the wheel were not packed correctly and so were not balanced.

We decided that it should be returned, and tried to take it to a local John Deere dealership.  Of course, as they had not sold it to us, they refused to accept it.  Amazon was very helpful and shipped a replacement trike before we returned the first.

The new trike still has a wobble in a back wheel, though not as bad.  However, we feel for this price point that they should be perfect!  The second trike, sitting side by side to the first, was also at least an inch taller taller.  As a result, our very tall daughter can barely reach the pedals and I'm probably going to get pedal extenders for her.  How is it that any company that has any quality control can manufacture the same trike in 2 totally different heights?

What we have learned is... We still like the John Deere trike.  However, due to quality control issues with their Chinese manufacturer, if we were to do it over, we would not buy on line.  (I only bought on line because there wasn't a Deere dealership close to my house and the internet seemed easier.)  We would instead go to a dealership and buy one that was pre-assembled that we could test for wobble and then, if we did have a problem, be able to return in person.  So, that is my suggestion to you - support your local farm implement dealership and make sure your trike is in good working order before you take it home.",2.0
"I had to read the instructions to put this trike together and I would suggest to read them carefully because it would appear to be very simple but it's not. After that's completed, the handle bars loosened several times and took all my strength to get to the point that it didn't come loose again. after several weeks, it's been OK.  So far!  Also the pedal was always coming loose too. Once again with all my strength it finally tightened it. and it too appears to be OK.  But....It's a wonderful trike, the kids love to ride it and for this reason i would recommend it, do to it's very well built steel construction and the air filled rubber tires.  Most others are plastic and solid tires.  and it's a john deer!",2.0
"To much blade play up and down, side to side.maybe i got a lemon.this ""knife"" does not fit my need's due to blade movement..but the knife is really nice-cool looking.""returned back to the seller""",2.0
"After following directions in using the product, I did not see any difference.  I ended up sanding the wood and it turned out great.",2.0
"This product is a great idea,but if you buy it you are taking a chance.  The company is in trouble right now and the web site could be shut down and day now and if you have to use a 800 number to dail up your data from your sportbrain you cann't even use the web site now.  Maybe someone will buy the company and things will work out,but for now save your money.",2.0
This is always coming apart and it is kind of a pain to use. I bought it so I could put it in the back of my Tahoe to take to soccer practice and I can barely get it in the truck. The only good thing about it is if you want to hang it up in the garage to store it will hang flat against the wall.,2.0
"This is a really neat net and construction is well made for the posts, but, had a soccer ball rip through the net with normal use!! Also had lacrosse ball rip the net and cant really complain about that, but a soccer ball?? Hoping some day to find a net of the quality of the posts to actually enjoy this net for its intended purpose.",2.0
"Not a ""folding"" goal at all!",2.0
"First day of use saw the bottom back post shatter in 2 places and the puck rip 2 holes in the net (many more since then).  We're a handful of amateurs that decided to pick up street hockey after a 15 year hiatus.  We use the green biscuit puck and don't exactly reach 60mph shots.  It might suffice for youth with a ball, but quality is as expected for a product like this.",2.0
Not as easy to set up as they claim. There 5 minute set up turned into 75 minute easy set up. No directions so I had to rely on my specialty of looking at the photo on the box and some creative guessing.,2.0
"First, I have to say that it is convinient and easy to carry in and out of garage.  However don't be fooled by the word ""high impact pvc"", it shattered after three month usage.  Better to put the money to buy the steel one.",2.0
"I got this item for Christmas and used it many times. just recently, i took a slap shot and the pvc crumbled into two pieces. Good for young hockey players just learning the game, but not for big kids just learning to play.",2.0
This net is made of thin PVC.  The side post shattered with the first hard shot.  It is not durable.  Such a disappointment for my three children the day after they received this product for Christmas.,2.0
Lasted about 5 minutes. Cheep price but cheep product as well. Got the seahawk 2 and no problems. Unless you absolutely need a one person raft get the Seahawk 2 instead!,2.0
Bought two and one was defective. It deflated te same day. I had bought three other rafts of the same brand some where else and they were great.,2.0
Didn't last too long at all with 4 kids playin in and on it. Busted at the seams in 5 weeks!,2.0
Leaked air from day one. :(,2.0
"This boat was used in a pool only. The size is nice and my kids enjoyed it. The seams are very weak though. A gap opened in the seam within a couple of weeks. I patched it, but then another one opened soon after that. All in all, a big disappointment",2.0
Nice boat bot only lasted for a few weeks! Bottom broke off the sides quite quickly and despite the boat being used gently!,2.0
Doesn't seem to be holding air very well.,2.0
It is a nice item for kids to play in the swimming pool. My kids had fun with it in the first day. However on the second day I found two abnormally large humps at the center of the boat where kids should sit. The plastic layer is ultra thin. It looks like the boat's material won't last long. Quality is a concern.,2.0
"Loads of fun for 2 days in the pool then it sprung a leak. I admit I did get the cheap one, but that was a lot of money for only 2 days.",2.0
Didn't last long before it got a whole in it. This is nothing more than a kids pool toy,2.0
"On my discreet trip to Florida, I only made it 20 miles from the Cuban coast before it deflated. I had to be rescued by porpoises and this weird gay blonde guy with a sequin orange shirt and green hoochy-mama tights. He swore he talked to animals but he was no Cesar Milan. Talk about an embarrassing ride back to shore...",2.0
I bought two and both have two wholes already :(,2.0
"They were fun for the kids,while they lasted. They sprung a leak in about 4 days for one ,and soon after for the other. I guess what do you expect for around 10 bucks.",2.0
"Once you put the air into the boat, it would last about a half day.  I guess you get what you pay for.",2.0
I thought this was an adult size 2 person boat. it is a kid sized thing good for pool use.,2.0
The cooler is really nice but the opening sping mechanish broke and it will not lock close. The top flops from side to side and contents can spill out if tilted.,2.0
Cheap plastic keep your old coolers,2.0
Not as good as the original Socker Boppers that I remember growing up.  Not very durable - with a good punch it busted!,2.0
"My child had a lot of fun with this the first few days she had it, but it's appeal has worn off since that time.",2.0
I found the toy was made of cheap manafacture and broke the same day at least  it should have contain a repair kit,2.0
everything was fine but they could not last more then a few fights...one of them popped right away and another soon followed after that one. cant use them anymore...the patch didn't work for too long after we put it on,2.0
They only lasted for a few fights before the air leaked out of one of two of them,2.0
"My three year old enjoyed this toy immensely while it lasted.  Unfortunately, two pairs popped within a couple of days of owning them.  If they were more durable, I would have voted higher.",2.0
"Ours lasted one day and then deflated.  Can't even hear any air coming out.  I just think it is made poorly.  BTW, this is a crazy price through this dealer.  It is $20 at Toys R Us, but even at that not worth it unless you don't mind spending $20 for a day's worth of fun.",2.0
It was fun for 2 days until it got 3 holes! I thought it was more durable but its not,2.0
"I got this for my 6 year old. It was a HUGE hit with him and all his friends (both girls and boys) because it talks back. But, like another reviewer, it only lasted a week and then got a small hole. It wasn't experiencing any more rough treatment than it's made for so that's pretty pathetic. We've patched it but it's still leaking, so sadly Bop Buddy will be heading into the trash here pretty soon. It's a bummer they don't make this more durable.",2.0
"After reading some of the other reviews, I was apprehensive about purchasing this bike rack.  However, others that I had priced were two to three times as expensive, so I decided to give it a try.  IT WORKED GREAT!  We used it for a vacation trip of about 1,000 miles and never had the first problem with it.  In fact, it's still on my SUV so it's even easier to strap the bikes on and go!  The first time we put the rack on, it seemed unstable, but learned this was the way it's supposed to be.  It rocks a little, but accepted the fact it wasn't going anywhere as long as we put it together properly.  We did, however, bungee cord all of the bikes together for added safety and additional peace of mind.  I would highly recommend this bike rack.",2.0
"I thought that they price was a good bargain. Until we put it
on our hitch. When we tried to put two mountain bikes on the 4-hitch carrier, the straps kept popping off. They only hold tight if you have a regular moutain bike frame that probably was
made ten or more years ago. The assembly itself wiggles a lot.",2.0
"Ok, like most people, I got this thing because its cheap. And boy do I mean cheap.

The 'strap' mechanism is four little dots that fit into 4 little holes in the straps. Yes, thats right, its the same theory as legos. There's no double tie down, there's no snappy thing, there's no bidirectional interlock mechanism, there's no nylon cloth hitch like on a bike helmet. Just 8 little plastic nubs between your bike, a big bump, and the traffic behind you getting a face full of steel tubing, gears, and spokes.

If you really want to use this, I would suggest getting some rope and learning to tie a few knots. Otherwise I never really felt 'safe' just using the lego clicky connection.",2.0
"The scissors keep breaking and the end items keep letting the knife get out of shape.
On my third one.",2.0
"Good with two blades, a nail file and a small scissors.  And a toothpick.  Very handy.",2.0
I've used several dual action hand pump and this is the one I like least. This one is really cheap. The nozzle doesn't stay tight on the hoze sometimes it pops while you're pumping. Does the job but it's a bit too cheap.,2.0
I had bought this product for my sons to set up there pool it's blows all the hot air in the pool it sure make u tire so fast I recommend for the guys to do it they have more muscles then the females do..,2.0
Loses air constantly. My son must inflate it daily before use.,2.0
Recieved and it was pretty much flat.,2.0
"Do to a last-minute issue I wanted to cancel it on that very same day, but the website wouldn't let me do that.",2.0
It's fine for a basketball but what I was looking for was one that would be useful on a dirt driveway. The ball is fine but the description was not really accurate. This would be fine on a hard surface court but not good for the above the garage door type court.,2.0
"The ball barely had any air in it and my son was a little bit disappointed when he opened it today on Christmas to use with his new hoop. Unfortunately we don't have a pump, so we will have to wait till tomorrow to go out and get one. Probably need to get one regardless, but would have been nice if he could use it right away",2.0
this ball won't last 3 weeks with regular use. piece of junk. why would spalding want to put their name on it,2.0
"I purchased this ball for my 7 year old to play basketball.  It arrived ""soft"", at which point I inflated it.  It was soft again within about 30 minutes of use, after which I inflated it again, and confirmed it was the ball.

Amazon's excellent customer service allowed me to return the item for a full refund, hence I'm not giving this one star.  Everything else from Amazon came out great.",2.0
"Ball leaking air, does not hold for more than a couple of days. Arrived partially deflated. Rare glitch from amazon. Soccer ball ordered with the basket ball was fine.",2.0
"i ordered the ball with the ""VARSITY"" logo but got the ""YOUTH OUTDOOR"" instead...didn't return it because a ball's a ball to a 10 yr old boy",2.0
The basketball is made of rubber and it looks nothing like the picture. The surface is hard and your fingers are easily to get hurt. It is a far cry from being satisfied.,2.0
"Ball isn't supple enough to bounce well.  It doesn't matter how much/little air pressure I use, it just doesn't bounce well, and feels heavy and dead.  Not a good ball to teach little one's to dribble.  It does feel like it will last a long time, even if left outside.  But that's not a good trade-off for the poor feel.",2.0
"In an attempt to save $ on overhead door garage door bottom seal, I purchased two of these items. I did a fresh level adjustment on garage door before installing this new MD seal and installed it with screws instead of the enclosed nails. I placed the screws w/washers every 12 inches and kept torque on the remaining seal as I inserted the screws into the door bottom. The job came out well as far as appearance but not so well as far as sealing the door bottom. I recommend spending the $ to get a better made seal if you are looking for something to keep out rain water, dust, etc.",2.0
"After having purchased a Garage door bottom rubber from Home Depot that turned out not to work I checked Amazon and found what I thought was exactly what I needed.
The picture was identical to the bottom rubber I had taken off, but when the M-D product arrived, it was not what the picture showed, in fact it was exactly the same as
the one I had gotten from Home Depot.
Buyer beware when looking at the pictures that accompany the products.",2.0
"Impossible to assemble onto a metal door, the tacks included don't go in, I ended up tacking and nailing it into the other stripping that was already installed just cause I needed something to keep the bugs out",2.0
Probably will work out but it is inexpensive foam vs. a more robust rubber version. It also ame with too few washer/nails for a double wooden. Now looking for additional fasteners at the local store.,2.0
"not come in original packaging, not brought the screws",2.0
"Title says it all. Not very happy with this. I had no trouble installing it and it looks like it seals fine. However, I still have water and snow come under it. I intend to try a different product and or combinations of thresholds and bottom rubber.",2.0
"I bought this to replace my worn out one. However, the new one doesn't seal entirely. I know my garage door is not straight. In the right and left corner I put the patched of sponge seals of several stack. It is a mess.",2.0
Didn't last very long.,2.0
Bought this for lounging in my pool and it worked out pretty good. The kids got a hold of it and did puncture it. The pump makes for easy inflation.,2.0
The package was missing the patch and did not include any instructions,2.0
"Smaller than I thought but not bad. I am 5'2"" and my 7yr old(4ft) can not sit in it with me. She can't fit with me in it! We made max weight also. Looking for a little better and bigger.",2.0
Rips incredibly easily.,2.0
"I bought two of these for a camping trip with my girlfriend and when I opened them up at the lake, one of them had multiple punctures in it. The other one was just fine though. We were both able to fit in one boat, it was just a little cramped.",2.0
"This is a pool toy and not a viable boat by any stretch of the imagination.  It has a 210 lb weight limit, but if you are anywhere near that you won't be able to sit up in this boat.
It's probably great for small children playing in a pool, but lousy for an adult attempting to paddle around a pond.",2.0
NOT FOR 2 PEOPLE.  MORE SUITABLE FOR 2 KIDS IN A SWIMMING POOL.,2.0
Had to return. Inflated first time out of the box to test before river trip and it didn't hold air. Suggest you inflate it ASAP to make sure it works before planning to use it or bring it on a trip.,2.0
"Really easy to be broken, for boat and paddle",2.0
2 uses and it sprung a seam leek,2.0
"I'm only giving a 2 star only because I used it for what I wanted it for, getting a aerator pump out of our pond. It won't hold 2 adults like it says.  It's more of a pool toy!
But for the money I didn't have to get in the cold water. Fun for kid's yes, 2 adults no way.",2.0
So heavy and extremely hard to blow up. Don't buy this unless you have someone super strong to carry it. And make sure you buy an air pump as well otherwise don't waste your money! Too big to use in a pool so only get if you plan to use in a lake or ocean!,2.0
These started out fun for the grandkids.  The bottoms fell off.  They didn't pop.  Came apart at the seams where they were glues.,2.0
Don't expect it to last very long.  Two weeks before mine wouldn't hold air anymore.  Regret not sending it back.  It was around 15 bucks so I guess you get what you pay for.,2.0
"You sit inside and the sides squeeze inward. For $16 it's worth the cost, but prob not going to last very long and it's a lot of trash for the landfill.",2.0
Incredibly thin plastic. A tiny twig put a huge hole in. The included pump is a pump used to fill balloons. Very insufficient. Only consider this if you plan on using it once or twice in a pool.,2.0
Impossible to paddle. Doesn't go in direction we intend to go in. Nothing like paddling a regular boat! Will not buy more! Only holds one person not two unless their both kids.,2.0
Never buy any inflatable boats without Boston valve at-least for major compartments.,2.0
To Thin of material,2.0
"This boat was fun but the 2-person label is very misleading.  This is two person if it's one lighter adult and a child, two children, or 2 adults weighing in at 105 lbs each.  It only holds 210 lbs and they mean that.  More than that and it starts to fold in on itself.  Because of that, we didn't get to use it as we had hoped.",2.0
"We bought this for the kids to float around on in the pool. I blew it up and set it aside to surprise the kids with just a couple hours later...it was deflated. Inflated again (thinking maybe I hadn't closed the valve properly) and lost air quickly.
It came with patches but can't easily find the hole so it's of no use to anymore.
Two stars because I feel like it would have been great and maybe we just received a defective product. And because the paddles are great for a splash fight ;-)",2.0
"Broke down on first use. The floor is not too strong and as I put my foot inside, it touched the shallow bottom of the lake and ripped. I also bought the Challenger which worked great.",2.0
you sit so low that it is difficult to use the paddles,2.0
not comfortable,2.0
"Paddle bent on first use, takes an awful long time to pump up and deflate. The only upside was the boat didn't puncture, so there's that.",2.0
"Pros: Comes with paddles and a pretty good air pump.

Cons: Fits one adult or two small children. Not great quality.

My kids loved this boat, the two times we used it before they ripped a hole in it. It's really just a pool float. We took it to a spring and the beach...and they had a blast. It comes with a patch kit but it is intended to repair small holes only. Best part of the purchase was the pump, it works great and you can use it on a variety of things. Will not purchase again, upgrading to kayaks.",2.0
Cheaply made and not great for stability. Go with something better made or a tire.,2.0
Not very durable..,2.0
Used it twice before it wouldn't hold air anymore.,2.0
Very hard to deflate,2.0
We inflated this & placed it in our trailer to take on our trip & it started losing air before we had even used it.,2.0
i counted over 1000 hand pumps to get it fully inflated. a month later it holds no air.,2.0
"The pump broke after the first two minutes!  Otherwise the boat was ok, nothing spectacular.",2.0
"I thought if I put a lot of air in it I could row around a pool and maybe take into the ocean. This thing is flimsy and I challenge anyone to show me how this thing is row-able. If you want a pool toy, I guess its okay. but don't think this thing is a boat.",2.0
I bought this and it did not come with the paddles or pump like it said in the desception,2.0
"If you weigh over 90 pounds, DO NOT get this. I am 130 pounds, and I had a hard time getting in it without water flowing in. The oars are cheap and the pivot point on the raft is not comfortable. Save up a little more money to buy the higher series version.",2.0
Needs a larger fill hole like most rafts now days.. not just the little one you can blow into. Takes forever to deflate.,2.0
Does not hold the air. Poor quality,2.0
Was hoping give good review..but second time in pool ..it got leak in it..at the seams,2.0
Did not last long before in deflated because of a tiny hole.,2.0
The blue received was not as pictured. It was lighter and greener. I had to make my own.,3.0
"I love the color of this Tutu (perfect blue for a FROZEN themed party).  When it came in, it was very flat and had a strong fishy-like odor.  With a little airing out and some fluffing, it was ok. Your little girl will definitely want a pair of bike shorts under this tutu.  I do not recommend machine washing- the tulle does not look right after.",3.0
"Was kind of long but, had to trim it a bit to fit under my custom made tutu. The color was spot on :)",3.0
Thinner than desired,3.0
"More of a road map than a useful topographical map.  I don't think it would be good for any kind of orienteering.  Nice quality, and tons of details, but its not much more than a road atlas.",3.0
"I bought this to launch small boats and canoes on local waters. The small scale gives no more detail than a road map, and it is missing several launch ramps that I have already used, and others that are listed on different sources. I will keep it in the car anyway, but I am disappointed.",3.0
I purchased the maps so I could see the elevation contours.  I have a Tennessee maps and it gives the elevation changes by 100 foot.  The map gives some elevation but not the contours.,3.0
Better than some of the stuff that's out there.,3.0
"Benchmark series of state atlases is much better. This DeLorme is difficult to read, as there is not enough distinction between, for example, a significant state or county paved road and other lines, such as topographical or county line roads. Such small lines are also not differentiated enough from background colored areas. The Benchmark series is very clear. I have their UT, CO, and NM atlases and have used them (to a dogeared condition) on several extensive trips through even remote areas.",3.0
"I have at least 10 of the  A & G' series which I have used for many years. They are OK for run-of-the-mill road trips requiring only mid level road detail. Clearly they provide more detail and reference points than a 'state' map. They are not to be relied on for serious off road back country travel or hikes. Yes, they are marketed as such and at first glance appear to be a one stop reference - they are not!

They are adequate starting points although it seems whatever I am interested in is split between pages and I sometimes find myself tearing the book apart so I can see and visualize that area more easily. One of the things that truly frustrates me is the inability to differentiate between public and private unpaved 'roads'. Not all landowners are forgiving, especially during hunting the seasons. When that happens the first thing I do, given the opportunity to explain, is show the A & G. Then say as humbly as possible - I think I'm lost, can you help me? Depending on time of day an apology may get you an invitation to coffee or a meal.

When planning my annual back country boonie photography trips I start with the A & G's, then topo software and Google Earth. Use the internet but exercise caution, it has both excellant and dangerous information. When my detail itinery is set I obtain the lowest level detail quadrant maps available. Once underway I rely on the A & G's, a vehicle GPS, my hand held GPS, a backup compass, my reference way points and maps. So far it has worked for me. Have a safe trip!",3.0
"The back roads are hard to see, which is why I gave it a 3 star rating.",3.0
"I bought this to help me find campsites, especially remote, primitive ones.  The old versions showed many but the new ones don't.",3.0
"The print is small, and it has too much detail making it hard to decipher, or read....  Service was good as far as getting it -",3.0

The sectioning of Arizona in this atlas was not what I expected and I had to resort to an old US atlas which showed the all at once state and major routes.,3.0
While there wasn't the detail I'd hoped for I believe it'll be an asset while traveling.,3.0
Not what I expected and would not recommend.  I selected this item for fitness and would not consider a higher rating.,3.0
"Matt clearly takes pride in his endeavors; yet, he showed no attempt to apply this work ethic to presenting knowledge. The look and feel of this book, the exercise descriptions, the graphics, the navigation devices, all are horrible. This is true for all of his books and videos.

I believe Matt wants us to believe he is trying to match his products to his crass persona...and that would be fine. But the truth is his books and videos are simply unprofessional. They lack good topical structure, information presentation, etc. Basically, there is a general lack of respect for books and video creation.

So why three stars? Because content is king! And Furey's books/videos have rock solid and usable content. Most of his exercises work. Period. And his advice, although not explained very well, is more solid than most polished fitness books.

Again, there is nothing wrong with having a crass persona. We all love Mickey (from Rocky), but 'Mickey' was delivered via fantastic actors, sets, writers, and directors.

Matt's philosophy (psycho-cybernetics) allowed him to be a champion wrestler and very skilled speaker and advertiser. He just needs to apply himself more toward his books/videos.",3.0
Good reading for the new prepper.  This book covers the basics that every Prepper should consider. It really gets the reader thinking.,3.0
It does not cover things that need to be covered but it gives you ideas on what you can do to start.,3.0
"Good book lotst of information for someone who has no idea about this subject.  Juf you have a decent knowledge of thes subject pass on this book, nothing new.",3.0
This book is only useful for a total newbie to the idea of disaster preparedness. Very little useful information for anyone who has done any prior reading or undertaken any preparation activities.,3.0
I would say this is a beginner book to lay down a foundation for a plan.  A large section of this book covers water preparation which is essential for life.  Later chapters in many cases just ask questions about what you need to consider for emergency situations.,3.0
This book is one of several I have read on this subject.  I found it not as interesting as I had hoped.  The information is good but I had a hard time relating it to our situation.,3.0
Very Basic information on how and why to start preparing your family for an emergency.  The book is easy to read and for the beginner is a must have.,3.0
this book tells alot about the coming mess in America and how to try to live through it. Enjoyed reading this book but needed more information.,3.0
"Plenty of good advice, but starts off with the assumption that people on a ""tight budget"" are doing things like buying lattes every morning, paying $100 a month for cable, or driving a gas guzzling vehicle. In other words, the author has a very middle class view of ""tight budget"". The author also says that if you don't have money to spend on prepping, it's because you don't value prepping.

That said, it does then offer some advice that can be useful to those of us on actually tight budgets, like keeping an eye out for buy one get one sales and putting the free item in your stockpile, or asking your doctor for free samples of medicines you may be on.",3.0
This was a very novice book for the entry-level prepper. Lots of common sense tips to keep yourself+ your family safe. The book really just skimmed the surface but it's a good start for anyone who has done no prep work whatsoever.,3.0
"This was not really a book, but a short pamphlet that could serve as the most basic of introduction t o the subject of prepping.  It contains good ideas but is exceedingly limited in scope.",3.0
Had a few good ideas I hadn't previously given a lot of thought to and a new twist on things I am already doing.,3.0
"It's a good starter book, but nothing too detailed.  There are better resources from websites that are free.  I probably won't read this a second time.",3.0
"The author is familiar with her subject & covers this unpleasant topic pretty completely, though succinctly.  As a ""crash course"" it was helpful.",3.0
Not bad. Good starter info.  Lots of info for new peepers. Follow this with more research and reading to get really prepared.,3.0
"This is an extremely basic beginner's guide to prepping. A very quick overview of the different aspects of prepping that need to be considered however with very little in depth coverage of any one subject. I would consider this to be more of an in depth checklist as opposed to an actual book. It took me about an hour to read the entire thing. Don't get me wrong, the subjects the author covers are important, especially for the newbie prepper, and it's a good motivational tool to get started. But this book really could be written by anyone who spent a few hours on the internet doing some research about prepping. I wouldn't spend more than about $5 for this book. The Kindle edition is worth the $2.99 but if you're looking to have a hard copy the $9.99 being asked is a bit steep I think.",3.0
"I am no expert and everyone needs a starting place.  If your looking for how many Lbs of beans to store per person, look elsewhere.",3.0
"This guide is designed for an absolute beginner. It has a good chapter on water catchment and filtration that offers some valuable advice. I am not sure how valuable the section on couponing is for people outside of the USA though. There is also a section on preserving food, barter items, bugging out and firearms.

A brief introduction to each topic really but without a lot of detail. You would easily be able to further research those topics that interested you though.",3.0
"I bought this for my 5 yr old and he's not really interested in it. He sits on it and spins around, but there is not really much to do with it. The airborne kids they show in the pics probably have some other boarding experience to do the tricks shown.",3.0
"Bought for my 4 year old grandson based on the advertised age suitability. It seems like it is more suitable fir older kids. Hopefully, he will enjoy it in a yearr's time. His 34 year old dad, however, likes it a lot!",3.0
not as cool as it sounds.  my kids played with it for 10mins and now it is sitting behind the couch.,3.0
Looked neat.  Just not for us,3.0
"These are stiff when new, but break in. The protection sheath is not that protective. After using them for a total of  60-80 minutes they are supple but have a tiny bit of fray",3.0
i am 5ft and 6in and this unicycle is way to short.  All the bolts kept coming off too.  But all in all good starter unicycle.,3.0
Good deal for the money. Quality and construction are lacking. It will serve its purpose but do not think it will last.,3.0
"This would have been a great product, but the sides of the pull up bar that press against your door frame are not padded, so when you use it, they dig and rub against your door frames and quickly grind off the paint. Unless you don't have paint on your frames, or pad the ends somehow, I would pass on this and get a different one.",3.0
"I have an 80 year old house, which features some wider walls / moulding... unfortunately this bar system was unable to cling around the door jams... it does seem solidly built though and seems like it would work for most people (thus the 3 stars, 5 stars it would have worked in my situation too)... Amazon returns was fast and a good experience",3.0
"This is my first pull up bar, so I don't know what other ones are like...but when I put this one in the door frame, I'm really worried that it's going to fall. I'm only 125 pounds, but it shakes a little when I use it. It just doesn't feel very sturdy. It also removes some paint from the wall.",3.0
Pull up bar has been put together but not installed on a door frame.  Requires room on both sides of door item wider than what we thought.,3.0
Acceptable quality.  I always feel like its going to snap.,3.0
For upper body only IMO.  I used it for squats wearing shoes and it's shredding.,3.0
"Easy to use and transport.

Handles started fraying almost immediately. I know that if I try to continue to use them, the handles will break. The fraying is happening just around the grommets. It's happening on the second band I got at a different weight, so it's not just this one band.

I still use them, but I have to grip it by the band itself.",3.0
"I knew this was a short band, but I thought it would have more give in it. I can barely get it into full extension. Will still use but bummer its not 100% what I expected.",3.0
"I purchased this item on 11/23/16 and today 1/18/17 it broke on me. This is the second band that has busted on me. I would not recommend this band if they didn't have a lifetime warranty but since it does, I guess it's a good buy cause they just keep sending out a replacement. The customer support is outstanding. I called to let them know and within 60 seconds I had a tracking number for my replacement. I give 1 star for the band and 5 stars for the customer service.",3.0
Little too light. Was expecting more resistance at 25 lbs. It is more like 10- 15 lbs.  It will be 5 stars if they get their calibration right,3.0
"I used it for a month and it broken down, is it suppose to break?",3.0
I didn't realize how much 10 lbs resistance was. Was too heavy for me.,3.0
It a bit shorter than I like but it will do.,3.0
Love working with it,3.0
"This thing is much too short and much too heavy weight... i thought is was me being too weak but just attempted rows with it and it sprang off my feet, split my lip and left a welt right across my face... no way this is an extra light resistance band ...it cant take any stretching... makes it useless for moreorless everything i want to do with a resistance band.
Discovered this was my fault as apparently the one i ordered was orange not yellow.... i would beg to differ.... orange is the color of oranges... It's a good product but they really need to put the color and weight into the title to make sure you are buying the right thing.... i asked for a refund and got one immedietly no need to return... thank you now i can order something safe for me.",3.0
I hate this thing but I'm sure it's just me,3.0
"First one snapped on me after a few months. Decent for moderate regular loose. Handle could pop off, though.",3.0
I bought this item and I love it but I would really love to exchange it.....the handles broke and that is a safety hazard.,3.0
"It lasted about a year, using it for a couple of exercises 2-3 times a week.  It completely snapped in half this past week.  I'm not sure if I will purchase this brand again as a replacement or try a different one.",3.0
Door band is not a good option,3.0
"Like the quality and color , however, the handles are a bit larger and heavier  than I would have liked. They won't travel too easily .",3.0
ok,3.0
Works very well. Would recommend this product.,3.0
I use this wraparound my work chair.. it better than going to the gym,3.0
"Not what I thought it would be. Might be my fault for not ready more thoroughly but this band is incredibly strong, with a much higher resistance than I was anticipating based on the description. It's also very short, which decreases the amount of exercises you can do with it.",3.0
"I was looking for a resistance band for the 21 Day Fix program.  This band is not long enough for all the exercises, even though it appeared when I did a specific search.  Just want to give a heads up for any of you looking for a band for this specific program.",3.0
thought it would have a much higher resistance but it doesnt. you might want to get the next colour if your looking for something with high resistance,3.0
"This was great until.... SNAP! on the 4 use. Maybe it was the surface I wrapped it around, but my cheap $2 grey band that's lower rated hasn't ripped after 50+ uses.

Going back and getting the next step up",3.0
Love this product ! So many variations of workouts you can do. I use it as an alternative to the cables at the gym so I can always get me workouts in at home!,3.0
Good product while it lasted.  Product worked great but after four months of mild use I noticed small tears in the band.  I know it will snap on me soon.  I have had this happen to me three times with this product.  I have yet to find another one that is better though.  It may just be the nature of workout bands.,3.0
I don't use it as much because the band isn't as long as I thought it would be.,3.0
This is to taunt should have bought the medium strength. Can't do most exercises with it.,3.0
A little pricy for the product. I found something better in the store so I was disappointed by this.,3.0
It is as advertised and functional.,3.0
Cheaply made,3.0
Not that it matters but I haven't used it much and the black tubing is already losing its color,3.0
"The resistant tube is very short, if it was longer it would be great.",3.0
"I have owned the whole set for about a year, and had to buy this to replace the green one which broke. This is the middle band, which is the lightest one to get constant use in P90X routines. So I suppose that is a reasonable amount of use before it broke.",3.0
"I bought the bands becasue I needed something with heavier resistance for p90X, assuming that the band would be the same length as the other bands I've used, but this band was way shorter....too short in my opinion.",3.0
"Either I am not strong enough for the 10 lb resistance band, or it really is too short. I am 5'2"" and I have a very difficult time using it under my feet and pulling it up for arm strengthening exercises. I'm using it for the Jillian Michael's Body Revolution program and I wish I had the ones she has in her video. I often have to wrap it around my bed post since it's too short to wrap around my foot and bring it up to work my arms in a parallel position (such as holding my arms up to the sides (parallel to the ground), keeping them straight, and bringing them in towards the chest). I could use the door holder that it comes with, but then I wouldn't be able to see my TV to follow the reps in the exercises.",3.0
I bought this product it the hopes of using it along with various video's and have not had a need for it.  This is why I only gave it a 3 cause I have not had a chance to try it out.,3.0
"The band came in good conditions, it was just shorter than what I expected. I am still able to use it for some activities but special with the extra attachment, I can put that piece on the wall and make the best of it.",3.0
This is an average product . just for begineers or if you want the arms warmed up. Go for heaviest one if you want it.,3.0
"The band itself seems to be sturdy, but the handles are made of a thin plastic. After 3 workouts, one of the handles cracked and a chunk of the handle came off. It's still usable, but it's a bit awkward.",3.0
"I use this for Tapout XT. Although it is quality band material, lengh is shorter than I expected. That would be perfect if it has a couple of inches longer band.",3.0
"I bought this to use for my Tapout XT workout and well this band is good, very stretchable and won't snap. however, there were some workouts i can't manage to do with the strength that i have. I realized that the price is too high when it's only for 1 band, they have a set for $29 and it comes with 5 bands INCLUDING THIS ONE and a bag to carry them in.",3.0
"I'm on my third set of these. As other reviewers note, this product has a 90-day lifetime. Not a 90-day warranty--a lifetime, meaning you are asked to throw these away after 90 days. I can attest that the bands do start to get small tears after a few weeks, and so I've been replacing them. What is particularly disappointing is that my workout routine only involves about 60 ""stretches"" of these bands three times a week, and I still start to see tearing after 8-12 weeks. I would imagine heavier users would wear them out more quickly.

In retrospect, I should have looked into other products that have anti-snapping features. (Usually this is a cord that runs through the inside of each band so that if it snaps, it doesn't fly around everywhere.) I guess 90 days from now I'll give one of those a try.",3.0
"Works fair, but smells strong and little shorter than some I've used.",3.0
"This is a high quality set of bands, but I am not happy with the design. A lot of the connectors are metal which I believe is dangerous in case the band breaks. Also most of the bands are very high resistance bands and they are pretty short. So you can't really do much with the heavy bands.",3.0
I only received ONE ANKLE STRAP with this order..... Product is okay...,3.0
This isn't designed for moderate intensity workouts or frequent use. Two bands snapped and the plastic handle broke.,3.0
"There is not enough bulk to the strap wedged in the closed door, to make sure it doesn't slip through and slap one on the back as it did with me causing a bruise in the shape, perfectly, of the strap right across my back . Increase the bulk in the strap used to wedge in a closed door to hold steady the bands as you work out. I remedied the situation by using the velcro strap to attach it around the door hinge and this remedied the situation for me. But the bulk of the strap anchor needs to be increased because people with strength enough to pull where the door gives a little can be a hit at very high rate of speed if that slips through the crack in the door.",3.0
Like it but one of the bands broke within a couple of weeks. They are mailing out a replacement.,3.0
ok,3.0
Not as user friendly as expected. Not easy to store and clean up,3.0
the quality is great but all this extra black latex support at the edge of the tubes and the handles all together make it really uncomfortable while doing triceps. as they rub against the arm its awfully painful and you kind of get abrasion like feeling in arm. majority of resistance bands are like this but i found one that i would like. so returning these as soon as possible.,3.0
Well bought it in 2015 and today the red one finally broke,3.0
Doesn't smell like the last one but still has a slight chemical smell to it. I'll probably let it sit with the other one.,3.0
"It's just a Titanium Tornado Baseball Necklace Orange Black and White 18"" Titanium necklace.  It's not for me so I don't know how good it is.  It took weeks to get here.",3.0
"It is a basic titanium necklace. My son doesn't wear it too much, too bad it didn't come in just black and orange without the white strands.",3.0
"The cords are ok, but the handles are very low quality and very small for a tall man with big hands like me (6')..  the straps hurts my hands everytime i use it. The the door strap is great though.",3.0
"Quality product but the door mount is best for a door that is never opened. When I open my closet,  the hinge anchor part falls into my hinge and prevents the door from closing. In a multiple person household such as mine, everyone does not want to deal with this challenge.
Other than that, product is good.",3.0
When i first got these they worked great. but i did have some negative comments about them also. There is only one set of things you hold on to so if you are working out with a partner you cannot. But if you work out by yourself these would be great for you. Also after about a month or so of working out one of the bands broke. I haven't had a problem with any of the others just the one.,3.0
resistance bands are a little short.,3.0
"I don't use RB for routine workouts but find them convenient when I travel. Product seems adequate for light use. However,  it concerns me that the instructions demand the use of safety eyewear rather than explaining how to use bands safely. It also concerns me that we are advised to use these bands for only 90 days. What exactly does that mean? Each band for 30 minutes each day? 90 days regardless of how used?  Seems like a CYA statement, but not helpful to the user.",3.0
"used it once, its pretty lame tbh but i just mean resistance bands in general",3.0
Love these bands. Great size/weight variety. Only downside is that they turn whiteish after a while of not using them.,3.0
"Purchased this item in February...decent product at a decent price.  Used the bands on average once a week since purchase date and just last week (July 29) the green band snapped.  I used the green band in conjunction with the Black and Red band attached to a Lifeline Heavy Duty Door Anchor...maybe that caused the green to ""wear"" in a couple of different locations before snapping.",3.0
"The bands themselves are nice and sturdy. I have used them with the handles for months and have had no problems. However, I'm giving this product 3 stars since I used the ankle strap for the first time today and it already tore and is no longer usable.",3.0
The bands are to long.  Switching the handles to any band that I want to use is a pain.,3.0
havent used it yet but it looks okay,3.0
The bands are great but the ankle straps broke the first time we used them. We bought 2 and the thread broke away from the material around the ring on both during first time!,3.0
length is too small,3.0
Good set of resistance bands.,3.0
"Great product - I like how it came with a carrying pouch. Good way to work out at home when I'm too lazy to head to the gym. Taking off two stars because the leg strap tore when I attached the orange and blue resistance bands to it, which is a shame. I still like the concept of the product though. Let's you stay fit by working out a little everyday in the convenience of your own home.",3.0
Difficult to keep up with all the parts.  Hand grips are rough on my hands.  They are easily portable when one wants to keep up with their program while traveling.,3.0
So far these are working as advertised as a good quality resistance band set however in using the fasteners I cut my thumb since the carabiners have very sharp edges apparently. Watch out!,3.0
They appear to be a nice set of resistance bands - not the best but good - but I'm concerned because the booklet that came with the set says that they can be used for up to 90 days.  I guess that means that they become susceptible to breakage after that.  That does not inspire confidence in their use.,3.0
"I upgraded the handles for these band because I was too sure about the strength of these. I am sure the are fine though, but the thought of catching on of these in the eye. No thanks.",3.0
Its nice but no dvds come with it . just has a flemsy book that shows you the way to use them,3.0
"The bands and connectors are good quality and adaptable to my needs when on the road. At home, however, having just one set of hand grips means I need to be clicking them on and off all the time. To do the workout I prefer, I spend almost as much time transferring bands as exercising. When they are next manufactured, it would be good to label the bands in some way in addition to color. Since I am color blind, I cannot tell some of these apart. That is true for many men.",3.0
"This product contains latex. Given that 3 million people are allergic to latex in US, it should be clearly marked on the packaging and in the product description.",3.0
The ankle strap broke on first use. Very poor construction on this as the seam holding the metal loop ripped. All the rest is very good and does what is should. Good workout and I really like that you can stack the straps. Too bad on the ankle strap as it made my rating plummet.,3.0
"The carabiners are too big and clunky. Wish they were smaller, less weighty, less scratchy on my skin, and that two sets of handles were included so you could work out with a partner.",3.0
Good solid bands,3.0
Decent resistance bands but be careful not to put too much strain on them.  The lowest resistance band (the yellow one) broke after only a month or two of using.,3.0
"So I loved the idea of being able to clip and unclip different resistance bands to the handles and even stack multiple bands that way. Great flexibility for using different resistances. It all looks great. Sadly, first time using them and the ball that holds the end into place snapped in the middle of the workout. Scared the heck out of me. Obviously I am returning it, but I am going to keep using the other bands for a couple days and see how the quality is. Maybe it was just a fluke on that one band? Of course now I am kind of flinching every time I stretch them because I think it's going to snap.",3.0
"Excellent set, but only comes with one ankle strap. Other sets come with two straps, which makes for a more efficient workout, but otherwise satisfactory.",3.0
Finding tears in bands after 6 months of use,3.0
"I was SO exited for these bands! I did my first workout and the black band snapped across my face! Other than that, I love these handles",3.0
Worth the money except I had one strap for hands instead of two sent to me. Lots of colors in different strengths.,3.0
"Be aware that the removable handles do add some extra length to the resistance bands, making them more bulky than necessary for some workouts. Wish I would've considered that. Also, having to switch the handles is kind of annoying. AgaIn, something I should have considered. Quality seems to be good, but I've only used them a couple times because of my issues with the handles.",3.0
DID NOT REALY COME WITH GOOD EASY EXERCISES.,3.0
"After using the black band for 2 workouts, the end snapped off.  Very disappointed considering I haven't had them long.",3.0
"A bit lightweight but will assist with some physical therapy movements that are different from using dumbbells and gravity or doing push ups using body weight and gravity.  Had expected the material would be bungee cord type elastic which would be more durable, but these are made out of rubber and am worried about long term longevity and possibility of breakage if wrapped around a stationary object.  I think probably better than the rubber bands I got from the physical therapist which have to be tied with knot that always slips at some point.",3.0
"I am a 180 pound male who is use to using weight machines like a universal and use medium weights with multiple repetitions per set.  I am looking for an alternative to weights to add to my workout that will be low stress on my elbows in particular.  I have been using the bands in conjunction with the weights and do not feel that I have reached a balance between the muscle workout with weights and the workout with the bands.  I do find that the stress on my joints such as elbows is less with the bands but I do not feel that I am getting as good a workout.  Also, I do not see the point in the extra light and light bands.  I think they are too little resistance to be a useful addition to my workout.  I would rather see a band option that provides higher resistance than 30 pounds.",3.0
"The resistance on the bands is pretty low, this is great for people doing rehab or getting back into the swing of things. However, 70lb combined resistance seems higher than the combined tension from the bands.  When I all 5 it was difficult but I was expecting a higher resistance level for certain workouts. They work great for arm exercises though.  Then again I have no idea what the standards are for these things. For the price it's a great deal and I wish it were more in line with my needs.",3.0
My package did not come with the door anchor.... I like the bands but I need the door anchor to use for a lot of the exercises.,3.0
Bit short but still good to use,3.0
It is annoying to have to switch out the handles --- and feels like there's a lot of added bulk with the connectors.,3.0
"I found these to be a poorer quality than expected.  The clips used to change handles / bands were rusty upon arrival and didn't function smoothly.  My advice is to buy a better quality set, or a set with fixed handles on each band.",3.0
"I would have given 5 stars, but the plastic under the foam on the handles broke. I was only using the first 2 easy straps and do not know how this happened. The straps or tubes themselves are great and well worth the cash. (I only gave 3 stars because of the handles breaking the straps are some of the best I have used.)",3.0
"This is a great seat for a great price but band resistance just isn't for me. With websites stating this can replace your whole gym must have some kind of imagination because I don't think it compares at all. For some rehabbing some joints or something, sure it can do that fine, or maybe take on a business trip to get some sort of exercise when you have no other option, fine, but don't be looking to replace your gym unless you have some real dedication to being frugal.",3.0
Not a fan of the way the bands function.  Would prefer to have 2 separate bands in each color.  This would allow you to better adjust the band tension.,3.0
"These do what they advertised they would, but I expected the resistance to be higher based on the description.  They're still useful, but not as much as I hoped.  The various exercise diagrams are a nice tough, and the nylon handles have been durable.",3.0
"This is ""OK"" but not ""super quality"" as some have written.
Came with only one velcro strap presumably for ankle, no other attachment components except a ""door anchor"" ... nothing to attach a band to a heavy object as you'd think would be there.",3.0
ok for the price,3.0
Have not used but expect be fine. Make sure read directions vs. Relying on pictures. It shows some placements of door jam holder in top or bottom and to be safe need to put inthe  side where hinges are. So directions sketchy and pictures can be  misleading. I called and pointed out but did not get much more than defensive answers.,3.0
Not my cup of tea,3.0
"In general I love this product. However, I have to point out that the red band snapped after about 8 months of normal use. I was doing arm curls and it snapped at the joint as shown in the picture causing my arm to shoot upward and hit me in the eye with the handle. Luckily it caught my eyelid and eyebrow and didn't go directly into my eyeball which might have blinded me. I think the product would be safer if the bands were covered in a fabric sleeve to avoid the snapback if the rubber breaks like some other products",3.0
"safety first!  i recommend reading instructions before use.

heres the link to buy them. https://www.amazon.com/dp/7245456313/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_50",3.0
"Good product! I am giving it three stars as I expected the construction to be similar to the Sport Cord brand and instead the construction is more of a rubber tubing. The blame falls on me for not researching further to figure out what the construction is. I am giving this product three stars because the resistance tubing of this product does not stretch nearly as much as the sport cord making it less versatile for what my intended purpose was which was providing resistance during lateral movements, lunges, step ups etc...If you are wondering if this is a bargain compared to purchasing a sport cord to accomplish similar goals I would recommend purchasing a Sport Cord. Once again I would like to mention that it is my fault that I did not investigate further and the product is good quality and would be a great buy for someone who was looking for a very portable system to provide resistance in a wide variety of exercises. This seems like it would be perfect for someone who has to travel a lot.",3.0
"Goid product. I have used it for 6 months  but it does have some flaws. I have a gym membership and play tennis. I wanted these to do some flexibility and strength exercises

PROS
- The rubber material seems to be durable
- Plenty of resistance (unless you are a power lifter)
- Very portable and the pouch is great to place it in my gym bag,  suit case or tennis bag
- The handles are very comfortable ... No need yo use gloves
- Reasonably priced

- I wish the booklet had more exercises. The web site didn't have much (have not checked again recently)
- Only one leg brace ... The stitching started to tear after moderate use. Should have 2. The metal loop can't be opened and it is really hard  to fit the bands trough if you need to do exercises where you need to grab both ends of the bands . I replaced it with the GoFit leg braces which are much better quality
- The metals loops at the end of the bands are starting to rust

For the money they are not bad however my wife wants some and for her I will be looking at GoFit or Bodylastics.",3.0
The bands were not as long as I expected. IF you are taller than 5'8 these may not be the bands for you to use for leg exercises.,3.0
Did not come with everything shown,3.0
"I would love to be able to give this product 5 stars, but can't. The product itself looks very well made and durable. However, I am giving it 3 stars because of the exercise and user guide. The guide only included page 10, 5, 8, and 3 (in that order). The kit came with two email addresses for customer service, with a note saying that someone would contact me within 24 hours. It's been a week. All I need is someone to send me the COMPLETE PDF that I can download. I know a few exercises I can do but would love to take advantage of all the tubes and connections.",3.0
"They were purchased to be used on weekends. Compared to other, slightly more expensive sets I should have not been so frugal. They just don't feel as good as the other sets available and their construction is not as good either and they lack weight markings. But, all said, good enough for occasional use.",3.0
"Nice compact packaging, especially if you travel a lot like I do. However, I broke my red band (heaviest one) after 10 days. To be fair, I wrapped it around some relatively uneven surfaces, but still...

I do highly recommend using resistance bands though. I've been amazed by how many random AF exercises I've managed to do. Seeing results already, and it's not just down to the extra cinnamon I threw on my oatmeal last Thursday.

To conclude. DO get exercise bands. MAYBE look for other ones around the same price point just incase. DON'T drink a drive.",3.0
Product lasted a good while eventually snapped i felt it should have lasted longer it also had such limited options in the heavy dept when first purchasing ..,3.0
love the bands but missing the over door attachments great for general full body workout when on the go,3.0
Convenient but need to improve the connecting area which might cause scratch on your skin!,3.0
Does the job,3.0
Not as durable as tehy used to be. I'm disappointed,3.0
I've always come from using weights and to be honest ... these seem like good bands? But I just don't think I like bands.,3.0
My husband works out with these everyday. These worked with his t25 work out videos. However the Green band has already snapped and broke.,3.0
Easy to use.  Nice that handles can be connected to more than one band at a time.,3.0
The were very good but i abused them and they started having minor tears in the elastics after six weeks from me stepping on them with my sneakers which were pretty jagged but for the price not to shabby. I feel like if i wore different sneakers this mightve not happened,3.0
The quality is awesome I have a hard time however getting the bands to shut in the doors.,3.0
No longer give out orange band. I just purchased the second set after the first one worn out and torn apart after 2 years of light use.  They used to give orange band but no longer has that.,3.0
"My biggest issue overall with this product is the handles.  My hands aren't especially large (I'm only 5'8""), but I found that grabbing the handles during particular exercises (curls in particular), the handle's straps would rub against my knuckles.  It got to the point where it was rubbing my knuckle raw.  I haven't used them much since, but I guess if I were to, I would purchase weight lifting gloves to provide some protection from the straps.",3.0
Bands are a lil weaker than expected,3.0
"The product itself is fine, but the other day the red band snapped and broke at the handle while I was working out. Fortunately for me the end that broke flew over my shoulder and not into my face. I've had them for about 4 months and I'm not sure if that's the normal wear and tear time. When I called to tell them about this, it was the person's first day working with them, and he directed me to wear to buy a new band. I'm not one to ask for something free, and didn't really expect it, but it's a little annoying that I have to rebuy something after using it for such a short amount of time.",3.0
Only came with one leg band,3.0
"The bands are fair.  I used to own a set that came with handles attached which was great.  This came with only 3 bands.  The first one is way too light, the medium is fair, and the last one too heavy so I can only use one of the bands",3.0
"I really wanted to like this product!  I always see the women in the work out videos using these! However, they are VERY long!

The bands are great but the handles aren't. The glue used to keep the handle attached to the nylon isn't strong enough so the handle slips all over the place.,3.0

My husband bought these for himself to use. They function and do whatever they are supposed to do other than encourage him to use them. So they just sit there dusty,3.0
Haven't had a chance to use it because I have a bad shoulder. It seems like will work great. Comes with all the goodies that it says in the doorjamb holder is excellent. My has been inspected it all and he is a weightlifter,3.0
"I've been using mine everyday since I got them last week...I've almost exclusively been using the red band but that just snapped on me.

Not sure what the issue is. Other customers say they've been using theirs for MUCH longer. Maybe I just got a defective band?

EDIT: I got in contact with Black Mountain and they graciously sent me a replacement band. Unfortunately they sent me the wrong (sent me another black one instead of a red one). Anyways, the thought was definitely there -- good customer service.",3.0

"These work pretty well, with some caveats. My main purpose was to do leg curls at home, which work well with the ankle attachment. The issue is that the stated resistance levels are very optimistic. I can one-leg curl with every single band attached. So, I had to purchase additional bands which is disappointing.

I did try some triceps push downs, which were only marginally effective. Because of the length of the bands, I had to stand quite far from the door - and even then, really wasn't able to perform an efficient exercise through the full range of motion. I suppose that if I had a super high doorframe, this might have been less of an issue.

So, three stars because with enough bands, they do work for single leg curls - which meet my needs. I'm just glad that I don't need them for any other exercises.",3.0
"additional handles would be nice, otherwise you are just changing handles to work with a different band.  otherwise, great for PT",3.0
"Well, I must've gotten a set that was returned.  No door anchor.  No exercise chart.  No booklet.  Nothing sealed.  As far as performance, I'm just starting to use these, and not quite comfortable with them as yet.",3.0
"The bands work well under moderate to heavy use but the door anchor shreds them.  Since I do most of my workouts in the door, after about a month to month and a half the bands start coming apart in the middle.  Maybe a door anchor with a softer neoprene inside to hold the bands is what is needed.",3.0
lazy me stopped using them after physical therapy. I was afraid I'd break the door.,3.0
"Bought these for my travels. They're easy to carry but I'm giving this three stars because the bands are not as resistant as they claim to be. I'm using a combination of black and red for chest (allegedly equals 40-50 lbs) and red and yellow for triceps (allegedly 27-34 lbs), and I can hardly feel any pain in my muscles. Nothing. And I usually suffer with anything above 10lbs because the truth is I haven't worked out in more than 10 years and barely started last week. I've been on a diet before this, went from 210lbs to 165lbs. No creatine, no steroids, no supplements other than my protein shake as a replacement meal on certain meals. I've seen skinny girls at the gym who could lift more weight than I did.

So, in short, I'm not exactly athletic, and these were way too easy for me. Will probably use them for a bit until I find something stronger.",3.0
"Was very happy with this product at first, and wondered for a while why anyone would choose free weights over resistance bands. Then after just a few months of semi-regular use, one of the bands has began to fray, and it is only a matter of time before it snaps completely. I'm willing to give the product benefit of the doubt and assume I got a faulty band.",3.0
"They work great. I'm doing the P90X and use these for the workouts. The only flaw I would say is the clip thingy (it gets in the way). But, not to worry, once you get the feel of how they work, they work wonderfully.",3.0
As exptected,3.0
"Use it pretty much everyday. However, the lower two bands yellow and blue seem to loose its elasticity and resistance. Shipped on time.",3.0
Only one set if handles for all these bands? Disappointed. But the bands themselves are good.,3.0
These bands are a really good price and I like the set. Some of the clips don't close that easily but I am overall satisfied.,3.0
"This is a good product that does what it says. Very light weight and easy to bring around. The bands uses carabiner hooks to attached to the handles. Sometimes I use the bands without the handles but you will have to wear gloves if you are holding the black ends. Alternatively you can  hold the rubber tubing. However, I am quite disappointed as the ends of the bands (all of them) are rusty. I believed these are due to storage conditions at the warehouse. With that said, your muscles can't tell if you are using shiny or rusty exercise equipment.",3.0
"Overall a high quality product, the only complaint i really have is that several of the clips don't open fully which makes it difficult to get certain cables on and off the hand straps.",3.0
"The bands may look pretty cheap at first glance; however, they hold together well with strong resistance. The pack is a great selection of different strengths that will help with conditioning of muscles. The storage pack is a basic bag and could be a bit nicer, especially since it is something that you will use frequently and carry around with you.",3.0
"I am 5'6"" and I feel limited on how I can use these because of how long they are... I'm sure my husband who is 6'4"" won't have any problem using them in whatever way he wants but I am definitely disappointed in the long length and I think if it is stretchy then why make the length so long.",3.0
"It is a good set and gets the job done. One note if you want to do bicep work, there is only one band of each weight class. You will need two sets if you wish to do exercises independent  of each arm.",3.0
Well made product but not practical for average user: Too cumbersome and time consuming to change bands(resistance) for each exercise and keep track of which bands you used for each exercise the last session. I suggest the WOSS Enterprise suspension system instead( same as the TRX system at half the price).  A suspension system uses your body weight as the resistance so there is no need for multiple bands. The WOSS system is remarkably well made and fits into a vey small bag you can carry on vacation or overnight sales trip.,3.0
Pretty good but not great. Been using these for 4 months now and they are all starting to rip. No resistance bands will last forever but was hoping to get 6 months. Good for the price but not the best.,3.0
"The bands seem very sturdy, but there was no exercise chart nor were there any instructions. So I don't know how to fasten or use the ankle strap or the door anchor, nor do I really know how to use the resistance band set except for what I hope to find on the internet. I find it frustrating when I'm sent something without any documentation and am expected to know how to use it intuitively.",3.0
they are o.k.,3.0
Nice little set.  Not sure about having to post a review to get the free Orange band offer though.  I don't like trading reviews for incentives - I think that skews reviews in favor of products.,3.0
"I just received this item today and it is missing the ankle strap. The other items seem to be all accounted for, but I purchased this set mainly because it also had the ankle strap included.",3.0

"Bands were too log and im 5'6"". need them another inch or two shorter. But overall great product!",3.0
The system uses a lot of carabiners to hold the tubes to the handles.  The system is great otherwise.,3.0

"Nice rubber bands, durable with good strong clips.",3.0
"I'm not a very strong person, but I was able to use all of the bands connected together and didn't feel adequate resistance from the bands. I also noticed the bands are too long for some of the exercises resulting in the need to anchor them on a door or exercise tower/apparatus. The quality seemed acceptable, but the bands left a slick residue on my carpeting just from handling the material.

Overall: 3/5 stars, not enough resistance from the bands - these seem like toys compared to the ones found at fitness centers.",3.0
hardly use it...good when i travel...but not that great...one of the holders snapped with the band hitting my leg once,3.0
good product,3.0
"Love these bands. I have used these for the P90X program for a few years now and they work great. They just take a week or two to get used to them but they are very convenient to travel with. I have had them for about three years now and they haven't worn out or been damaged in any way.

Update on 9/15/15:After about 2 years, one of the bands snapped. Unfortunately, this is a band users nightmare come true. The band almost caused a serious injury. I do not feel safe when using this product now as a result",3.0
works for what it's intended for but it's quite annoying having to switch the handles for each band.  Good price for what it is though and I probably would have got this one anyway.,3.0
"It is as good as you can expect from rubber bands. They get a little white after some months of usage, but keep having their strength, The handles are good and the door support works as expected",3.0
"Seems like a good product, so far used the bands once with no issue. My only problem is that it only comes with one ankle strap which I thought was a mistake but it appears to be intended that way. My physical therapy involves using 2 ankle straps as part of my program and I simply don't understand why they would only package it with one ankle strap. Ended up having to buy an extra one separately which cost more than 1/3rd of the price for this whole set.",3.0
" I'm a Personal Trainer and I bought these for an ""at home"" workout option while I couldn't make it to the gym following a surgery.  I've returned them after I tried them out.  The quality is okay, there was no issue there.  The resistance is just not effective.  I had to use 3 bands together just to mimic about 25lbs.
FOR LADIES:  You might find these of use for a circuit workout or HIIT workout.  They'll probably offer enough resistance to keep up the 'ole heart rate.
FOR MEN:  I wouldn't bother. Even 20bs of resistance isn't enough for the majority of guys, and there's only one of the bands that is supposedly 20lbs.  So you're paying for a bag of bands you won't use.  The description of resistance in pounds is not accurate in my opinion.
 With kits like these you pay for the rings and handles and gadgets.  I was looking for the old school resistance bands used by physical therapists. I found some others here on Amazon.  I'll post my review of those as well.",3.0
Did not receive ankle strap as advertized.,3.0
"The bands are alright, but do not use them for P90X3.  The problem with these bands is that they are too short to truly be effective for any P90X3 maneuvers that require standing on the bands.  Of course, it would be unfair to solely judge the product based on something they were not solely designed for, except that with the bands comes a booklet explaining moves you can do with the bands.  One of them is squats.  The problem is, with the shortness of the bands, it is not possible to do squats with any real weight as you cannot get properly into the position.  Into that, my red band is already starting to fray after maybe 15-20 uses.  I don't believe I overstretched them (more than four times their length), but then again, with how short they are to begin with, it is entirely possible.",3.0
"The strongest/thickest (red) band broke after a few months of light use. The second strongest (black) is doing OK, but it isn't enough resistance for most leg exercises. I thought that I could just add more bands to the handles (e.g., have the black and yellow bands on at the same time) to get more resistance, but it gets annoying/cumbersome to step on both at the same time. For example, for calf raises, you'd have to somehow step on two bands with only the front part of your foot, since you're lifting your heel. One of the bands always escapes within a few reps, disrupting the set. This might be because my feet are small, but if your feet are bigger, you're probably taller than me (I'm 5'3""), and your bands might snap even faster than mine! :P

For home, I would recommend a good set of dumbbells instead (or a barbell and squat rack if you're into that). I got these bands because they're obviously a lot cheaper than an adjustable set of dumbbells, but in the end, they don't produce as good of a workout as dumbbells. I'm too busy struggling with figuring out how to step on two bands, or worrying about a band snapping, or trying to figure out what the band version of a great dumbbell exercise is. For travel, I would recommend just doing bodyweight exercises. These bands were not worth it for me.",3.0
"OK, but recommend buying the type that is covered in a nylon sleeve. Over time, all these bands wear and will eventually break. If one snaps without to covering, it's like a huge rubber band flying right at you. With the cover, it just stays inside.",3.0
They're ok but pretty cheaple made. The black band turns gray green after a couple uses. Fine for a warmup or stretching. Maybe rehab work after injury.,3.0
These are good. Idk if I'm too strong or if its the fact its adjustable weight but its hard for me to determine necessarily the struggle but they work. They work as a perfect replacement for heavy weight. I don't feel like my body is rocks. The only complaint I have is that these come with interchangeable cables. I bought it trying to conserve room but when in the moment coming to work out with only a one minute pause its a lot to change the cable with the handles. Other than that I definitely thing these are some od the beat band for then best pricing you can buy. From this company in general,3.0
"The first thing I must point out is that the foot strap is the stinkiest thing I have ever smelled. Just touching it made my fingers stink for hours. I had to put this thing outside for a couple of weeks to air out enough to bring inside. I'm still scared to touch it, let alone wear it around my foot while trying to work out to a sweat. Unfortunately, one of the reasons I purchased this particular package is because it did come with a foot strap.

Bands work adequately and switching them over is pretty easy. That said, if you are going to switch bands frequently, you might want to get a kit that has more than one set of handles. The bag is handy.",3.0
"I purchased the set about two years ago and have used the bands maybe a total of two dozen times while on trips. Quality construction, but two of the bands are already shredding and are unsafe to use. Appears the latex deteriorates faster than it should. I'm disappointed that I'll have to replace them at my cost........although BMP's website claims their products have a lifetime guarantee.",3.0
"About the product: Comes with 5 colored bands of varying resistance. The handles are comfortable and the clips allow you to quickly adjust the amount of resistance as needed. The door anchor requires no installation, you basically just close the door on the closed end of the anchor and run the resistance band through the open end. The ankle strap is comfortable and is fastened with velcro. The booklet is informative and contains instructions on how to perform a variety of upper and lower-body exercises.

About the quality: I bought these resistance bands about 8 months ago and they show considerable wear and tear. The black and green bands have completely torn apart. I did use those bands the most, however I wasn't even using them that often, just light-moderate workouts 3x a week max (with many missed workouts along the way). i did perform overhead presses, but being 5'10"" I doubt my height played a role. To be fair, I was working out with shoes, so that may have contributed to the damage. I tried going without shoes, but the bands were uncomfortable under my feet. I notice some resistance band sets come with covers for the bands and I think that can help with comfort and reducing friction.",3.0
"Before I bought these I read all the reviews, they are ok  although the handle broke after 3 times of use, definitely expected much more uses.",3.0
"UPDATED 12/18/2015. This review has been updated after over a year of regular use of the set 3 times a week. Please, read at least the first paragraph if you plan to use the DOOR ANCHOR included in the set.

This is important usability info. The door anchor included in the set can ruin the bands after a very few uses due to friction of the vulnerable rubber tubes against the rough material of the anchor. This peace clearly requires some technological improvement. I suspected this outcome immediately when inspected the set right after arrival, but, because of the lack of any experience with this kind of equipment, it was assumed that the bands were designed and manufactured to withstand this friction, especially because the enclosed brochure showed some exercises with a band passed through the anchor and handles attached to both ends. After 10-15 rehab sessions both bands showed clear signs of wear and tear in the places of contact with the anchor and a few cracks were found. At that point, after some experimentation, one solution was found, which helped to prolong the lifetime of already damaged bands for over a year,  the anchor was combined with the ankle strap and the bands were passed through the metal ring, which can accommodate up to three bands. The main disadvantage of this solution is that the ring is not large enough to routinely replace the bands, but it was sufficient in my case. A much better solution is to buy an anchor with a protective sleeve or another device that protects the rubber tubes. There are a few different options available on Amazon.com, which will be reviewed below.

Besides the obvious drawback described in the first paragraph the set is quite decent and durable. One practical limitation is that bands included in the set provide only very moderate resistance for major muscle groups even if the strongest three tubes are combined. So, for a reasonably fit man, this set is suitable for rehab rather than strength and muscle building. A premium orange band is available that can help to overcome this limitation, but even this will not be sufficient for a strong man. As was mentioned in the original review below, these bands are not suitable for serious strength building/maintenance.

Actually, it makes sense to limit the resistance of these bands because of technological limitations of the elastic material or tube construction, which, apparently, don't allow regular and prolonged tension beyond the limits of the recommended use of bands included in the set. In my personal example, and I am very far from a body builder, after about 10 months of regular appropriate use following recommendations outlined below in the original review, deep holes developed in two of most frequently used bands. They were monitored, and the bands were still used as before. These holes are not related to the damage described in the first paragraph since they are located quite far from the place of contact with the anchor. So, they are obviously due to some technological fault of the tube construction. By now, one band has had to be decommissioned because the hole started to grow with each use and the band could break any time. According to these observations, the bands are nevertheless quite resilient and don't break suddenly even in the presence of a rather serious damage as in two cases described above.

Recommendations: 1. Consider buying a separate door anchor that prevents the tubes from rubbing against the nylon webbing. I've purchased three different anchors -- SKLZ Pro Door Anchor, Heavy Duty Door Anchor by Albingo, and Lifeline Heavy Duty Door Anchor. Also, I got one with the Bodylastics set mentioned below. All of them have different sizes and constructions and maybe more or less useful in particular situations. Nevertheless, all of them have a common distinctive feature  cable protection from friction.
2. Depending on anticipated strain and load consider buying a more appropriate set of bands/cables. I've purchased Bodylastics Max XT Warrior Edition System, which provides for much greater loads. Also, it's more convenient to use, it looks much more advanced both technologically and aesthetically, and it includes several additional useful items.

Original Review

These bands are as good as most similar products, and they should last for long time with moderate reasonable use. What is different about this set is a shocking number of reports about torn and broken bands that often caused serious injuries and even a few cases of disability. Also, it's quite unusual to read these reports in some 4- and 5-star reviews.

Usually, I don't pay much attention to 1- and 2-star reviews because it's very common for people to have various reasons for dissatisfaction, which have little to do with the quality and usability of the product itself. Actually, since I was going to use the bands for rehabilitation and the number of positive reviews was overwhelming, I decided that this product should serve its purpose for me and bought it in September 2013. This conclusion appeared to be accurate, and, before writing a regular review, I decided to read again what other people were saying. And this time many reviews sounded very alarming, often, apparently, without the author's intention. What could one think reading a 5-star review that asserts that if the exercise equipment breaks, it is beneficial for the user because this indicates increased power of the user, and the sooner it happens the better? And this opinion was not an exception. Somehow, I didn't feel comfortable using this product and conducted in-depth Internet research on similar products including Amazon reviews. The results are as follows:

1. As some reviewers suggested, this product had improved over time, and many reported incidents might not be relevant for new purchases, so it might be prudent to disregard old reviews. Unfortunately, many new positive reviews from 2013 mentioned various quality related issues. This could be due to incorrect use of the bands.
2. Similar products sold on Amazon have much better feedback, and complains are about incomplete sets, delivery issues, wrong band size, etc., but not about damaged bands and injuries. And a few products, such as Bodylastics and JS Fitness sets have almost no negative reviews. I have no intention to advertise anything, but one should not look any farther than Amazon to find some alternatives to compare and make a choice.
3. The bands certainly should not break in a few months and even years unless they are defective or damaged by inappropriate use. Of course, some drivers can wreck a perfectly good car in a few months, but it doesn't indicate they've become superior drivers. If the active or working length of a band is not stretched more than 4 times, the band should serve for many months of daily use.
4. There are bands with built-in protective devices, such as inclosing sleeves and enclosed cords, which should prevent possible injuries and traumas in case of band failure.
5. The flat bands might be a better alternative since their length and, therefore, resistance can be adjusted much easier. They can be folded multiple times if needed, which increases both resistance and reliability. There are extremely heavy duty flat or loop bands suitable for heavy lifting and body building.

Practical recommendations:
1. Inspect every band thoroughly on arrival for any possible defects.
2. Test every band carefully with gradually increased load and inspect thereafter.
3. Contact the manufacturer in case of any issue and/or question. They have excellent customer service, which I had a chance to verify personally on a few occasions.
4. This set should be perfectly fine for light to moderate loads and/or infrequent use.
5. Read the enclosed instructions before using the bands. The most important safety instructions are periodic inspections and overstretch prevention.
6. If no defects are found after a few uses, the bands are likely to be in a good condition and unlikely to break without any indication of wear and tear, which can be revealed by periodic inspections.
7. Avoid stretching the bands more than 4 times their active or working length. Rolling a band around the hand or reducing its length in any other way will reduce its working length. This should not be used to increase resistance (overstretch), but only if there is insufficient room for exercises. Using entire band should always be preferred.
8. Using bands attached to a door, wall, post, etc. effectively doubles the resistance, saves room, and allows for greater control and variety of exercises.
9. Avoid incidental cuts, pinches, scratches, etc., which can damage the band. Always inspect bands after using them in some unusual way and/or by another person.
10. If the items above sound like too much hassle, consider buying more reliable and, possibly, more expensive bands with protective sleeves or cords, which will give you peace of mind and can actually be more economic.
11. Read customer reviews on Amazon very carefully before buying any product if you plan to use it for vigorous and tough exercises.

P.S. A huge number of trivial positive reviews might be caused by the ""free orange band reward"" promised by the manufacturer for a fair review, which can encourage many people to write a few words instead of agreeing with already existing reviews, which would have been much more convenient for new customers.",3.0
Alright but just a little overpriced. They've lasted long but not my favorite exercise equipment at all. Couldn't use it because the bands are slippery and your feet won't catch hold at all.,3.0
These bands were very nice. I used them on many occasions and they worked very well. A very good product.,3.0
This item is OK so far but the straps on the narrow handles rub the sides of my average size hands. Annoying. I do get a fairly good pump from these however.,3.0
"I will start my review off on the product. I love my bands. I travel quite a bit and take these bad boys along with me wherever I go. When the weather is bad, I default to my bands and get the exercise that I need. My only concern is the length of the bands. They are very short for certain exercises and you do not get the full extension needed for a workout. Quality is ok and they fit easily into a carry-on.

Now for my thoughts on the Black Mountain Products company. Its concerning that they sell this set on Amazon directly from Black Mountain but they are $3.00 more than their own website. Plus they provide free shipping. Since they are the same product from the same company, why not charge the same price? Go figure. I am sure the extra $3.00 they make per order is being donated to a very important charity....",3.0
"I bought these to use when I tried P90X, and they wore out around day 60 (I ended up buying the bowflex 5-52 adjustable weights to finish).  I enjoyed them while they lasted, and it should be noted you must have shoes on when using this, otherwise it will pinch/rubber burn your foot...common sense should have told me that I suppose but I learned the hard way haha.",3.0
"These bands are what I am looking for in a set of resistance abnds for traveling and I wanted to order these bands, but what's the point when even as a Prime product the delivery estimation is 1 to 2 months.",3.0
Was very excited to receive my Resistance Band set and get started with my workout..no can do..did not receive anything but the resistance bands..no exercise chart and no door anchor....,3.0
"I was using these with P90x, and they were great in the beginning. However, the bands start developing small, hairline splits that eventually widened up into full blown cracks. I noticed that these splits would appear at points where I stepped on them often, but band exercises require you to do so so it's really no excuse.

Also, they only come with one pair of the palm grips, so changing them from one band to another during an exercise routine is a chore. I would say shop around for some higher quality bands.",3.0
The Door Anchor broke with the first use and now I'm a little afraid to use itagain. I don't want to flip that thing into my face. That could really ruin my day I think. Maybe I should give it to my Mother in Law and let her test it first:)  Hopefully the other parts will last longer.,3.0
"I use it once in  a while when I workout at home, I prefer actual weights but I am sure it works well if I use it more often.",3.0
"These are a good price for some good bands.
I don't like that you have to mount the strap for these to be fully useful. the way this is intended to be used is mount the wall strap and run the bands through the strap. I have been able to use them outside of that but I was not aware of this design when I got these.",3.0
"Decent bands, but you can do better.  They are shorter than any band i've ever owned and the handles are a bit cheap.  As someone who has been using resistance bands for years, I would suggest looking at the Bodylastics bands instead.",3.0
"Probably great product as others have stated. my product arrived missing parts the ankle strap and door anchor and chart. I have not been able to use because I had to return the entire product.
I used a few of the bands and they felt sturdy.",3.0
These are really good bands.  Everything came as described.  I've been using them since I got them.  They are really great at work where I can't have a full weight sets.,3.0
"Does the job while traveling.  Lot's of flexibility in configuration.

Downside is that the handles and clips get tangles easily.

Guess that's the price you pay for flexibility.",3.0
"Overall the quality is good.  The only complaint is the band length is a little short for me, but I think it's OK for some workout.  Shopped at Walmart the other day, I saw another brand of band set, and bought it.  It is longer than this set.  Now, when I travel, I bring both and so I can use long and short as needed.",3.0
"I wish these were all once piece with attached handles. Once I started using them I found that the metal clamp was annoying and in the way. Perhaps it's human error but I find it awkward - especially if you need to switch sizes often.

The quality of the actual bands are good though - Very thick.",3.0
"I really like the ability to stack bands together on the same handles for a greater choice in weights, but these bands are just too short for the my use. I returned them to order the 48 inch bands from the same company. The door anchor and ankle strap were unnecessary for my use as well. I would have preferred to have this same product in at least a 48 inch!",3.0
"The product is functional. I like that part. But the wall-attaching stripe and even the handle bars to some degree smells horrible. The wall-attaching stripe smelled like industrial strong waxy rubber. It smelled so bad that I threw it away. The handle bar, thankfully, smells less intense but it still smells like rubber/latex.

I hope the smell fades soon.",3.0
My green band broke prematurely after only 10 workouts. Overall the equipment is great but the bands should last longer than that.,3.0
"Within a couple of uses, one of the plastic handles broke. Now when I grasp the handle, it doesn't grip properly and pinches. I have not contacted the company yet for a replacement handle, but hopefully they will work with me on a replacement.
 Another issue I had is that the program I'm using switches bands fairly often during the routine. The problem is that I have to stop the dvd and put the handles on another band and it seems to waste a lot of time. I wish that I had bought bands that each had their own handles.
 I think the product presentation is good and they give you a nice bag to keep the bands in, but I wish I had bought a different set.",3.0
"I have had these for about a week now... and i am afraid to use it at full potential...why?

well from the first minute i took it out of the bag, i could tell it is made of cheap material...it just did not feel sturdy or durable enough to handle any demanding exercise or tension... the rubber bands look like they can snap if you push them... and if that happens it could be very dangerous as it might hit you and cause you injury...

i will continue to use and update this review....but regardless of whether anything happens or not...this is not a product i would buy again as it doesn't feel firm or sturdy enough for the kind of tension workouts it is intended for...",3.0

"Resistance bands work well, and are a cheap trade off to buying sets of dumbbells... My only issue was with the velcro strap they provided to fix your bands to a structure.  Mine snapped on me and shot back slamming into my chest and knuckle (fractured my one knuckle!).  For as much force as you are using they should have NEVER used velcro, rather a buckle would have been better.

Also, it would have been nice for a second set of handles so you don't have to keep switching between exercises, but thats just me being picky...",3.0
"I bought these bands as an alternative to free-weights to use with P90X and for general exercise use so I could have some kind of resistance.
The problem I ran into was using them in any stance that requires me standing on them, such as curling, squats, rows, and such. The band rubs against the shoe and over time wears away the rubber until it snaps. The band you use the most will go break first. My first one broke 4 months after first use.

Still it comes as a whole set so there are other ones to use as replacement and I really liked the fact they could be combined to the same handle for increased resistance.",3.0
I have not even bother reading the directions and was not really inspired to use this product to be honest. I couldn't figure out if you were supposed to fold the cords (they are long) or how to use them but I really didn't put forth the effort either. If your considering buying this looking for some serious resistance this is not the product as I think it's very lightweight. Others seem to like this because I did research and read reviews.,3.0
"I have been using the Black Mountain resistance bands for the past eight months, they are great for traveling and until this morning's workout I would have given them a high rating. However the red band snapped and the severed bands flew back and caused injury to both of my hands, bleeding knuckles, serious pain and black and blue bruising. I had not done anything other than use the band as directed.

In Black Mountain's favor they have responded immediately to my issue and are replacing the failed red band as well as providing a stronger orange band which was not part of the original package. I will be sure to check the bands for weakness in the future.

Based on their response I will raise my rating from one star to three stars.",3.0
Instructions of the exercises are a little hard to follow; but seems to be made well and I think it will last a while.,3.0
"I bought these maybe 3 or 4 months ago and have used them, or 3 of them on a regular basis.  As far as use goes they work great.  It is convienent to have each individual band clip in.  At least until they show signs of wear or break, and they will.  Then you have to throw away the whole band.

There is nothing inherently wrong with these bands.  My purspose in writing a review was to caution users of these and all exercise bands.  I've had two bands break on me.  The first, a competitors, snapped back into my face, cutting and bruising me below my lip.  It then snapped back and took out a piece of my wall.  The second band to break (one of these) snapped in the middle and didn't harm me.  Upon closer examination I saw small holes beginning in the bands.  My suggestion is to routinely inspect your bands (as I do now) and wear eye protection when using them.  Even if you ignore my advice just know that they will not last forever.  They will eventually break.",3.0
I got some exercise bands for free. I needed an extra one so I went on to but this one.,3.0

"I got these in the hope of not having to need to buy heavy, expensive weights for workouts. I thought bands would be a cheap alternative to dumbbells. While they are to an extent, this package only comes with very low-resistance bands. The ""heaviest"" band has only about a 30 lb resistance, which is the red one. All the other bands seem to have ultimately no use. The ""lightest"" band starts at 2 lbs of resistance! I don't know why someone would need a band with only 2 lbs. Along with 2 lb yellow band, i see no use for the also very light blue and green bands. The only other band besides the red i use is the black and only when i do straight arm lifts. If you are looking for high-resistance bands for high-resistance bicep curls, Don't buy this. Frankly, if you are a guy don't buy these, unless you have a use for VERY low-resistance bands. Women should find this package useful though.",3.0

I received this resistance band set a week or so ago. So far so good; I've had no problems with the bands stretching out of shape or snapping during a workout. I'll update this review if any of that changes. Otherwise if you're looking for a good set of resistance bands go with this item.,3.0
Based on the number of positive reviews I purchased these bands. They provided adequate resistance and I enjoyed it for the few weeks they lasted. Eventually the bands started bursting from the black fabric points. Apparently there is a small ball in the bands that hold it in place. four of my bands broke at that point. That is definitely a weakness in the manufacturing process. I haven't seen any cracks on the other parts of the bands.,3.0
"I've never really previously used resistance bands and so read quite a few of the reviews here before purchasing as well as wrote to Black Mountain Products for their thoughts on this set vs the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Mountain-Products-New-Strong-Man-Set-of-6-Resistance-Bands/dp/B003VPLWTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Mountain Products New Strong Man Set of 6 Resistance Bands</a>. Many reviewers wrote that this stackable set is good for P90X but I have to agree with the few people who said it wasn't so great for this purpose.

The quality of the bands seems very good and I'd give the product 5 stars for quality. The problem I have with these is that in order to make these stackable, the connection adds about 6"" between your hand and the beginning of the band in comparison to other bands. Compare the pictures here to those for the strong man set.

Some strength exercises in P90X have the weight moving very close to the ground. With the extra 6"" added, you can't get nearly that same range of motion doing it as instructed and I can't change my body position enough in order to create that range of motion while doing the exercise properly. Maybe this is because I am short but you can watch the P90X video and see that even with the bands that they use, the person using the bands can't really do the exercises as properly as the people using the weights. If anyone wants to comment on this review to disagree, I'll read what you have to say and edit this entry to reflect if I am swayed.

The stacking function, though, is helpful. I am 120 pounds and can only do maybe 7 pullups - hence the need to be doing P90X! But I have to stack the three strongest bands in this set to get what I feel is comparable resistance to a real pullup. On the strong man set, you'd have to hold two or three handles in each hand to get the same resistance so this set is easier to use.",3.0
"I originally got this set to use when traveling.  I like it so much that I use it at home.  The adjustable bands are great to use for all different exercises.  It would be nice if the set came with better instructions, how much can the bands stretch?",3.0

"This product is ok for Bandas good for the price. Easy to use
There some exercise that will be best to use a weight on p90x do I can't really use them for all exercise. I still don't regret buying these bands. Good quality. And they will make you break a sweat!",3.0
I guess it's an ok substitute for when you cannot make it to the gym... but there is no comparison to free weights.,3.0
"Like so many others, I got these bands to do P90X. For most exercises they are just fine, but in a few of the exercises the size of the connecting hardware makes using the bands a bit uncomfortable. For example, when doing the swimmers press, the bands need to run up the length of your body and across your shoulders. The connecting hardware will rub against you and can be unpleasant.

But other than that, the bands have a good range of resistances and the hardware does let you connect multiple bands at once to fine tune the resistance to what you need, which is a really great feature.",3.0
I like the flexibility that these bands offer by having the handles separate. You can change up the resistance easily. However I'm not to thrilled with the length of the bands. They are too short to perform certain exercises.,3.0
"I love what you get for the price.  Unfortunately, the band with the least resistance broke on us within the first week of use.  I'm worried that if that happens with one of the other bands someone in my house may lose an eye!",3.0

"The wheel itself is awesome the problem is the templates doesn't come with the wheel, once you receive the Wheel you have to download the templates which is very costly you use lots of ink if you choose to do it on your own and if you go to an outlet that can print the templates for you they are really expensive as well so for this reason I'm out on the Wheel need to come up with a better way for the templates to come with the game not through an e-mail but actually with the game wheel itself. But over all I really do like the wheel and I do plan on using the wheel after I create my own templates with tag board and cartoon pictures, I will also have my grandchildren to color and decorate the tag board cut out the art work and then take them to be laminated,",3.0

"Update after two weeks of use biking.  Single pane lens.  The support bar on the inside makes cleaning difficult.  The fog resistance is removed by cleaning with ""Invisible Glass"" cleaner.  Anti-fogging spray for scuba diving masks works well enough.  The two large vents on either side render these goggles useless for WDE protection (Winter Dry Eye).  Three inches of electrical tape solves that problem.  The gasket allows enough air flow so that the goggles do not fog until I stop moving.",3.0
"I got this to go with the Pro-tec Classic Snow Helmet. It's not really built (in my opinion to go with a helmet) but it works well just on your head. But I prefer to use helmets so if you plan on using this to go with a helmet, it's at your own risk.  It does fit with a helmet (tested using the Pro-tec), but there's a gap between the top of the helmet and the goggle exposing a part of your forehead. Which isn't really the best on a cold day on the slopes. I now just use it as a back up when I hit the slopes.",3.0
This is a very dull blade. I do like the case that the blade is in. I wish the blade was a little bit bigger.,3.0
It is a nice little knife. I went to take it out and the chain broke around my neck. Quick fix I used paracord.,3.0

"It was a bit smaller than i had expected, otherwise  it was a great deal.",3.0
This is nice for someone with smaller hands. I would like to see the same item but a little larger.,3.0
"First of all let me say that I don't believe in ""Necklace Carry."" The position of the blade in general along with the assumption that most of us do not live in areas where it is acceptable to wear a blade around your neck, make it a ridiculous accessory that cannot be accessed in a quick, fluid motion when the S#!t hits the fan and you need a weapon at hand. I purchased this item for the blade itself. The tool itself is solid. Full tang construction, nice comfortable scales and a good weight. However, this blade is designed more for smaller, more feminine hands than mine. (This is not a sexist statement or  dismissal of the Karambit's usefulness. Simply put women have smaller hands than men in MOST cases) The Karambit has a reputation as an effeminate weapon. There are pros and cons to this but in this particular model, the size of it impedes it's usefulness. In addition to the size the sheath is far too rigid. If you're looking for a blade that you can easily easily pull with one hand at a moments notice this is not the blade for you. HOWEVER... If you're the type of practitioner that likes a project this blade can be modified to your own personal specs. A little file work on the blade and some 550 para-cord (you'll have to heat the ends of the cord to taper them in order to lead the cord through the small holes in the sheath) on the sheath and you'll have a serviceable tool, accessible from a belt loop. This will make a good working tool and an easily concealed O.S.K. that you can use in a pinch.
Overall, the company delivered ahead of schedule, the blade was new in the box (though it needs to be sharpened) and if you are looking for a project this is an inexpensive and structurally solid blade that can be the backup to your backup with a little love and some elbow grease. This product will make a great gift for the wife, G.F. or little sister but if you are cursed with big burly man hands, some simple mods will be necessary to insure that you don't cut your pinky..",3.0

My grandbabies are not particularly interested in playing with this toy. It's attractive and has a nice chime but doesn't hold their interest for very long.,3.0
I bought this because some magazine gave it high praise.  It is durable but that is it.  Unfortunately it is not one of my daughter's favorite toys.  She only plays with it if I present it to her and then not for very long.  It is kind of a boring toy and does not do much but make a few sounds when you roll it.  I think it could have a better song selection and better electronics for the money. Basically it is a plastic drum that plays music when you roll it. The other buttons don't really do or teach anything.  I say it is over priced and over rated.,3.0
"it's not a big as I thought it was going to be.  The handles are very sturdy, however I purchased it for some kids at a summer camp.  Although I like the colors, I will probably buy a leaf tarp with similar handles that is larger and sturdier.",3.0

"I know the size is clearly listed, but it is difficult to use it with kids as a parachute toy because of its size.  I have kids from 1-8 years old.  Only the two smallest would have any interest for more than 2 seconds.  it is not really big enough to play many games you did back in school.",3.0
"This review is about this parachute compared to other parachutes.  It is not a review about whether or not parachutes are fun.  Of course they are.  On the positive side, this parachute is cheaper than others.  Unfortunately, however, I thought I was ordering a parachute with pink in it (see photo), but received a parachute with dark purple, instead.  It's not a very attractive parachute.  Also, I thought I was ordering something that would hold a lot of air and be fluffy.  It is not.  It's heavy.  Finally, I thought I was ordering something that a child could sit in and be lifted by adults (like in the gymboree).  The directions clearly state you can NOT do this with this product.  I'm sure kids can have fun with this, but the limitations break my heart.  I was so looking forward to this toy.",3.0
"My two year old son fell in love with parachutes during his Gymboree play classes.  After just a few weeks, I decided that I needed one for home so we could continue the fun there and invite the neighborhood children to join in.

All kids love parachutes and there is so much you can do with them.  He loves being dragged around the house in it, hiding under it, using it to send one of his teddy bears flying through the air and making it go up and down with the other kids.

The only reason that this product receives three stars is that it was smaller than I expected.  The product dimensions are clearly stated but I had difficulty transferring those dimensions into how it would work.  It is difficult for the kids to run under the parachute because it is so small.

Very good for the price but I will need to buy a larger one.",3.0

"I simply love the fact that if this cooler gets dumped out of the truck or boat or off the porch, that nothing spills out.  The screw-top lid is the most secure of all.

But the problem is with the spigot design.  When the rubber ""cover"" gives out, you've got a leaker.  What a bone-head design.  I'm going to seal up the spigot hole as I don't use this cooler for water anymore.  It was used for that for a couple of years, then became my camping/fishing/truck cooler.  Now it is side-lined until I repair (permanently) the leak.

I'll buy Igloo the next time i want one of these type coolers-especially if I want to depend on it as a water cooler.  But also note that I'm very hard on coolers.",3.0
"I returned this product because it seemed huge.  I was looking for something to work on balance for horseback riding - this was just too big for me (I'm 5'5"").  It seemed like it would be fine for use on working on balance, was really easy to put together, but for me was just too large and it's nice to have different size fulcrums.",3.0
"The way the bottom cylinder is designed is meant for it to be lightweight to ship so it comes in about 12 constructable pieces. I find that this piece, when put together, losens frequently. It holds the board okay but the board will skip occasionally when sliding off. I'm not sure what causes the skipping (perhaps that it is made from unfinished wood) but it completely kills your balance and ends your bongo session which is annoying.",3.0
"Being that this is wood, the wheel edges have begun to split. Nothing super bad yet, but a plastic wheel would have been better suited for this.",3.0
"I used to weight 260 pounds. Now I weigh 250 pounds. I used this balance board as part of my system for losing weight.

My son's adult weight is half mine. My son used this balance board on an almost daily basis for four years, and loved it (at the start of which, he probably weighed 100 pounds). The balance board was in near-new condition after four years of continuous use.

When my son went to college, I began to use it. In just four months the thing has been completely destroyed -- the wood is splintered, the grooves are too big, the top slides too much.

So I am torn. I love balance boarding. And I even love this balance board, for all the joy it brought my family. However, I just wish the manufacturer had used a slightly more expensive wood, and built a product for larger people.

I don't know if they ship it with a recommended user weight (for example, skateboards often clearly say that they are not engineered for people who weigh more than 200 pounds).",3.0
"I bought for my 5.5 year old but am returning.  I couldn't even get on it - it is terrifying! And I am a snowboarder myself so not totally inept.  Its much bigger (wider and taller) than I expected. I think it might be good for teenage boys who are skaters or training to be skaters/boarder.  Hats off to all these reviewers who could use it!  I am retreating to the alex monkey balance board for my kid. Also the round thing on the bottom is not a solid piece but a bunch of cut wood pieces that you assemble which surprised me, though I guess it rolls ok - like I said I was too scared to really use it.",3.0
"The only other one I've used is the Indo Board which goes for quite a bit more.  This board is far less versatile than that one.  For starters, the wood-on-wood contact from the roller to the board is very slick and out of the box, it's not a great experience.  I added a couple of strips of cloth/athletic tape to the contact points (on the bottom of the board) and it has greatly improved the experience.  I can't say I really like how it is on a track.  The indo board is a solid cylinder, so you can do things like  90/180 degree swings.  I just think that one is more fun.",3.0
"First and foremost, I think I should say that this is a great item. It's fun and it can be great for your balance. That being said: BE CAREFUL!! It's not a horrible idea to start off using this on the carpet until you get the hang of it. If not, you risk a few nasty spills. The only reason that I gave this a three-star rating is because the wheels are a bit flimsy, which limits the types of surfaces that you can use it on. Concrete, for example would probably ruin it within a matter of hours. Try it on a hardwood or tile floor, to be safe.",3.0
"I bought this so my boys  (ages 5 and 7) would have something to do besides tear up the couch while watching TV.  They are always moving so this seemed like something to engage their bodies... well, Everyone loved it but my Dad.  He thought it was too dangerous and would knock a hole in the wall.
Instead, in the course of normal use - it broke.  Its been sitting on Dad's workbench for three weeks awaiting repair.
Not well made. Yes, it is dangerous. Probably not my best idea. I still like it. But the disign doesn't take what little boys have to give.",3.0

Solid construction. the roller is, well ugly. ive seen these types of boards with nicely crafted rollers made out of one piece of wood. This roller is 4 discs and 8 spacers that you put on a large rod and then bolt together. Overall I like the board but I am probably going to add some grip tape and possibly carve a roller out of a solid piece of wood.",3.0
"******PROS******
-While it's of course not of professional quality, the game of Carroms is quite playable on this board. I've introduced my friends and family to Carroms using this board, and they all really really love it.
-The board is aesthetically pleasing, I have yet to play any games that require the checkerboard in the center, but it will get use.

******CONS******
-As others have said, the build quality leaves much to be desired. Pieces often fall through the nets, the walls are a bit loose (which decreases the distance at which carroms can travel, the included pool cues are just dowels (crooked ones at that), and the whole board is prone to falling apart when traveling (it snaps back together with some effort, but it's a pain to always do).
-The Crokinole side of the board makes for a miserable game of Crokinole. Crokinole requires a hole in the center of the board for carroms to fall into. Instead, there is a millimeter deep indentation to allow the playing of other ""games"".
-Other than Carroms, Crokinole, Checkers, and it's variants; the other 70 or so games included in the rule book are terrible. They're merely dice games, top games, and mini-contests like see-who-can-knock-over-a-pin-first. While I doubt anyone would buy this board to play these lesser games, forcing them to function with the board detracts from the greater games. If all of the stupid ring games were removed, then the Carroms could have been solid, as is tradition. If the shoot the ring/pin out of the middle indentation games were removed, then the indentation could have been made several millimeters deeper, making Crokinole playable. And of course, if all of the useless tops and pins and cues and dice were removed, the board would be cheaper.
-The rule book is USELESS!!! Especially for both Carrom and Crokinole. For example, they say that 24 pieces and a queen should be used to play carrom, and that they should just be thrown into the middle of the board in at random. In reality, only 18 pieces and a queen are used, and there is an order to place them. Their rules make for an extremely long and drawn-out game. I ended up looking up the tournament rules online and making my own house rules.

In conclusion. It's an alright board, but for the price it could be so much better. You will only play Carroms and maybe Checkers with this set. All of the other games are terrible. Also, the Carrom company continues their legacy of including terrible rule books (Nok Hockey being another example).",3.0
"Fond memories playing this at school in my childhood - now my grandkids love playing this when they're over.  Like everything, it's not as good quality as the one I bought about 20 years: The carrots are a softer (rubbery) plastic so we use our old carrots. The cues are shorter than my previous ones, and are just a round dowel with no rounding on the ends, and are slightly bent. I will be replacing them.  The carrots fall out of themesh on the pockets, so I will be adding fabric over that. Also, the mesh doesn't stay completely tucked into the slit that holds it in place.  The board is ok.  The pegs that are used on the flip side game are glued in place (older boards had holes to insert them when you wanted to play that game) which interferes with setting the board on a TV tray for playing carrots, but this can be worked around.  The product arrived on time with no damage. Although I rate the quality 2 to 3 stars, I'm glad I bought it. There are more expensive versions that appear better quality, but for young children, this keeps them entertained.",3.0
I can tell that within a year the pockets will tear or holes will get bigger on the pockets,3.0

"Well I read the reviews and it sounded like a fun toy.  So I tried it out before I gave it to my kids.  Well the kids never got it.  I almost broke my back on that thing.  Sounded like a fun toy to practice balance.  Is it really possible to balance on it without holding on to a wall or something?  If so, please enlighten me.  Sounded fun but after I tried it, not so much.  I left it outside and my dog thought the wheel was a chew toy. =0)  I also thought the wheel was somehow attached to the board.  It is not so when you lose your balance the wheel goes a flying.  If you like a challenge then go ahead a buy it.  If you value your spine, then I would think twice.",3.0

Old fashion fun for our grandsons,3.0
"Cheap panel board and really cheap plastic parts.  Also, the instructions could have been written out better: larger with illustrations would have been nice.",3.0
"Good classic fun for children and beginners...
There are enough games here to keep your analog fix going for a long time...in a digital world this old-school classic provides hours of fun for kids and adults alike...

And, this is a good entry into carroms. Before long you will be either itching for more, better, faster...or you will return to your digital world.
Game on!

Board quality are as expected for price-point and construction quality. Pocket netting is flimsy, but adequate and will likely need to be repaired often. Rails are deadened with little bounce for acrylic strikers and wooden carrom-men. However, the included carroms and pieces are suited for the construction materials. I would recommend using the included pieces with this board. If you graduate to a tournament board and more traditional carrom play, you will find the boards set better for the pieces intended for their use.

Don't take the 3 - star for inferior product. It is a classic and I think is intended to be an inexpensive introduction to the sport and provide for some great family fun. Game on!",3.0
The kids didn't play it.  It doesn't have a screen.,3.0
"Bought during a lightening deal. Less lightening and more thinking, I probably would have passed, but nostalgia took over my brain.",3.0
It was scratched up with one game... Not happy about that. I wish my son loved it as much as I did when I was a kid but that's not the case. He's currently using it for Lewis instead.,3.0
"kids 9, 11, 14, 18 don't think it is that fun",3.0
OK board.  Not the best quality.  Its OK for the price.  The top is flimsy and the pockets won't last forever.  Fun game. For the price you won't be disappointed.,3.0
I love Carrom from my childhood but the board is cheaply made with the side bumpers falling off soon after arrival.  We had to re-glue all the edges back in place and jimmie the netting so it too wouldn't fall out.  The plastic pieces don't have the same weight as the original version either.  Probably about what you'd expect for the price of  re-done nostalgia.  I now have the board as a wall ornament.,3.0
"I wanted to get a carrom board like i had when i was a kid and this was the most similar. Unfortunately, the shipping was LONG and several of the pegs broke after simple use. I repaired with super glue, but rather disappointing.",3.0
It sucks that it didn't come with a stand or legs to prop it up. Don't remember playing this game on the floor,3.0
"Carrom is a fantastic game! With that being said, they need to figure a better way to ship. Over time I've ordered 4 carrom boards and all have been broken upon arrival. They seem to get dropped on the corner and need a few repairs with tape",3.0
I grew up with this game the board was made of wood and beatuifully painted.  The sticks looked like pool ques not just stick with no shape to them. Was a little disappointed.,3.0
"I got this board at a reduced cost from a scholastic fair because the pieces and manual is missing.  anyone know where i can order replacement pieces.  can someone scan a copy of the manual and put a link online? someone had posted a link to replacement parts but it does not show up.  maybe you have to type ""dot"" for the relevant part of the address.",3.0
Love the board except the nets in the corner pockets are too loosely tied to prevent the pieces from falling through,3.0
This was a gift for an 11 year old boy - my husband loved his carom board as a kid and thought this boy would like it - his reaction - faked appreciation - he was looking for electronic games. Times change and this may become a toy of the past.,3.0
"The first board sent fell apart - literally, but Amazon replaced it with no hassle and in record time.  The second board was fine and we are enjoying it as much as we used to back in the 60's.  It's a fun, family game that you don't have to plug in or buy upgrades for. .sort of refreshing these days.  Highly recommend it for those who have never played it.",3.0
"Carrom is lots of fun.  However, the board we ordered fell apart the first time it was used.  We had to glue all the sides together.",3.0
"because it's so many games in one this board is a bit confusing.  also, they do not provide you with extra pieces so if you lose a piece the game is done.",3.0
There is a design problem. One cannot do a ground pass rebound.,3.0
"Good product, but the ground stakes don't hold it in place.  Any hard kick knocks it over.  Needs better fasters to the ground.  You have to rig something or pick it up after most kicks.",3.0
Works welll and easy to put together but a part came broken and Franklin is not accepting calls for replacement parts.  I would have given it 5 stars but I consider this poor customer service.,3.0
I have only had this rebounder for two weeks and the net has already ripped.  it only went through some light use.  The spikes don't do a great job holding down the goal.  i had to put a sand bag in the back and bags of rocks on the two sides and then used the 4 spikes for the front.  it helped.  it did work great.  the balls rebounded well but would be really nice if the net would hold up much longer than 2 weeks.,3.0
Net ripped on first day.,3.0
"ok product, but net arrive already ripped. I had already throw away the box before we put it all together.",3.0
Good for the price. unstable tho.,3.0
"Nice but very big, was hard to assemble.  Seems warped at times",3.0
It's hard to stabilize the rebounder for shots of significant speed. It's probably great for young kids but I haven't figured out how to really secure it to the grass without it wiggling loose with each shot.,3.0
"My daughter got this as a gift a year ago (13 months to be exact). The net we first got in the box was damaged so we had to order a new one right away. It has been outside this entire time and I'm just noticing we will need to get a new net now. There are a few broken strings. It's a great product, however beware that you need to check the net closely. No rust and it stands up to our 9 & 12 year old kids.",3.0
great,3.0
The metal U shaped posts do not keep the unit down when practicing over a longer period of time.  Otherwise it works great.,3.0
Works well but isn't very durable.  A few of the net strings have broken but overall good.,3.0
The stakes that hold it in the ground aren't very strong.,3.0
"Update:  After using several months the frame would not stay together and the net started ripping in many places. Looking to purchase a different brand this year.
Original post:  Bought this for my 11 year old son who just started playing on a soccer team for him to practice.  It was received timely and was fairly easy to put together.  While I was putting it together, one of the upright support rods didn't attach securely to the bottom rod.  After completing assembly it seemed to hold all together well.  The screw does need to be retightened after it is moved around very much.  Overall it has held up nicely enough for him to use almost daily to practice and play with neighbor kids.  Very sturdy net!",3.0
Ok - net is super tight and not that easy to put on - a couple strings broke while attaching the net to the frame.  Frame bends under the tension.  Hope it last for a few months.,3.0
"frame and angle change built is pretty good.  light and easy to move the net around the yard.
assembly is easy but fitting the net around the frame is pretty difficult although expected for rebound net.
however, right upper corner and center netting started to fray right away with 2-3 strands left. it won't last too long.
one of the rubber holders for the net also frayed and ripped after few days.  asked Amazon for replacement due to poorly
made netting.",3.0
The product works as described but the net broke in less than 15 days,3.0
The little ties on the net kept coming apart. It's nylon twine so hard to retie. Right out of the box it came untied while we were putting it together. Once we got that taken care of the boys loved it and it seemed pretty sturdy.,3.0
"Definitely not for kids over 10 years.

I just completed assembling today (easy, clear instructions, went together as expected).  My 14 year old son is no soccer phenom, and is of average size, etc.  Within 10 minutes he had sent a shot right through the net, breaking three of the strands of the net.  It still functions, so I am deciding whether to bother disassembling the thing to send it back.

Probably great for little kids, but not for older kids or adults.",3.0
not so good,3.0
The kids loved it but it ripped and now has a hole.,3.0
"The frame is weak and causes the frame to bend up in the middle.  This significantly reduced the sweet spot for rebounding.  This makes it more difficult use inside on carpet which was my primary goal.  Now I have this giant thing taking up space in my garage.  Also, I think I got a defective net as well as there was an extra rope section that made the net impossible to untangle.  I cut it and it seemed to be ok.",3.0
The product is sturdy and works well if you hit the ball in the right place. My son is 10 and manages to hit it over the net most times which is a pain. Also a couple of the bungees popped off. It may be okay for younger kids or in a different kind of placement but it had not worked out for us,3.0
it is difficult to adjust the angle of the deflection.  It has rusted a little bit (I had spray painted it when I first received it) and now the adjustment is even more difficult.  But the kids do like it.,3.0
"Not to tough to put together. I bought it for my 3 year old grandson and he's a bit too young to work it properly.  Also on the picture it looks like it's a goal but it's not, the mesh is on the front of the poles so can only be used to kick the ball into it to rebound, not to score a goal. Anyway he's too little to kick it hard enough but I guess for an older child it would work.  Not too expensive to give it a try and we're going to keep it and see if he likes it later on.",3.0
and it should come with at least SIX to begin with...so so for sturdiness.  not meant for any soccer players or kickers over 11 years old.  pretty easy to put together.,3.0
"Great in theory, but one of the locks on mine wouldn't stay locked so it would go down whenever the ball hit it.  Not easy to take apart for storage.  The bungees to secure the net are hard to put on when you get to the last few since they are so tight.  I thought the net could have been slightly larger to stretch.",3.0
I've only had this for 2 weeks and it was a great practice goal for me but today the net just started ripping I don't know if I should even order a new one,3.0
"The goal was good but in about 2 years or so the elastic hooks started breaking, and as soon as I bought the thing the things anchoring it to the ground obviously didn't work well. Although it was only 40$ so 2 years was pretty good. But the bottom bar on th frame fell off in a couple of months and I had to fix it with screws and duct tape, but that held sufficiently. So it has it's ups and downs, therefore, three stars.",3.0
This says you can adjust these to return ground ears or pop-ups but the directions n the package and on line do not tell you how to adjust the net,3.0
"Some assembly headaches, doesn't really hold to shape as I had hoped. Does the job. Easy for kids to slide around.",3.0
"It doesn't collapse down without taking it completely apart, which isn't great for those of us with limited storage space. It's currently hogging part of the garage because I don't have a yard to store it. Otherwise, it's made of quality construction and does exactly what it's supposed to [aka keeping soccer balls out of my living room].",3.0
The net itself and it's size are fine.  The ground stakes that came with it are cheap and inadequate.  I've placed cinder blocks around the part of the frame that's on the ground to keep it stationary.,3.0
"It was easy to put together and works pretty well.  But if I had it to do over, I would have gotten the bigger size.  Kicking a ball into a 6 by 4 net is not as easy as it sounds.  The 12 by 6 model is twice as expensive but would probably get more use.",3.0
"This was not packaged in it's original box (looks like a returned item to me). The  parts sort of rattled about in the package causing some damage to the metal bars. Also, the ends of the box were almost open when it arrived. The product was missing it's instructions, bolts and nuts as well as the stakes to secure it to the ground.
Since my kids burst into tears when I mentioned returning the item, I got new stainless steel bolts and nuts and galvanized ground stakes at Home Depot, and figured out how to put it together without the instructions. I also got a can of rustoleum to touch up any dinks and scratched in the finish.

The product itself is really nice. Works well, and the kids are really enjoying the rebound.",3.0
"Rebounder net was easy to assemble according to the directions provided.  Frame appear to be of good qualtiy, however the netting seems a bit thin for heavy duty use.  On the first day of use by my 15 year old son, he drove a shot into the center of the netting and it ripped, indicating to me that the device was not designed of old, stronger teens and is better suited for younger, smaller players.  The net does round very well and works as intended, but I would recommend only for 12 yrs or younger.",3.0
"This rebounder is great fun but the lower joints collapsed after only 2 weeks of use.  Potential solutions: (i) only use this rebounder from 10 feet away instead of 20, (ii) brace the lower-front joints with the pins provided, (iii) re-design the lower-front joints to be a single 3-fingered piece, instead of 3 pieces connected by just one screw.",3.0
"Green stripe Tape not adhering to helmet properly,more time could have been taken to ensure stripes where on properly.",3.0
It could be better,3.0
Quality is fair and reasonable for the price,3.0
Was bought for my son.  He did like it as it served it's purpose.  Was ran over the first week it was purchased.  My thoughts is that the inner lining was cheaply made.,3.0
"The griddle was received as ordered.  Unfortunately, I opted for the unseasoned one.  I followed instructions on how to season, but was a bit disappointed with the result.  Except for this ""problem"", I love the griddle. I recommend customers buy the seasoned version since it is fired at a very high temperature to provide a ""deep"" seasoning.",3.0
"We used the grill for a beautiful New York strip steak.  The steaks were delicious.  The stove was a mess. The stove has black marks under the grill.  Took us 20 minutes to clean up the mess. I'm not sure I'm using it properly.  ""What heat do you use to heat it up?""  The answer to this question should be on the box or on a slip inside the box.  It's the lack of directions that informed my rating (3 stars).  The grill itself worked absolutely fantastic.",3.0
"It's my own fault, I suppose.  You see everyone on the kitchen shows with their reversible grills and think you need one, too.  First the positive:  This is an excellant price and you can't beat with the free shipping offer.  For some this would be a great additional to your kitchen but not for little ole' me.  First it takes a long time to season and is quite heavy.  Since you can't put it in the dishwasher (dah) you have to wait for the grease to cool, use paper towels to soak it up, then haul it over to the sink for a cleaning without a hard brush, no soap.  Then make sure you dry it well as it might rust.  Just know what is involved before purchasing.  For someone like me that uses it once every other week, it's wasn't the smartest thing I've ever purchased.",3.0
The hammock requires 12 + feet to hang in.  If you have more than 12 feet of space you can extend the length from the ring at the end to the hanging point with a proper test rope or chain. I found this out by writing to the company. The product came with no information about size.,3.0
"The ... description says this hammock can accommodate two adults. Not bloody likely! Maybe if those two adults were Kate Moss and Lara Flynn Boyle; but an average-weight woman and man? Uh-uh. You'd be resting on the bar of the hammock stand; this hammock is way too saggy for that.
I'm a little concerned about the fact that it's made of cotton rope; I think nylon rope would be much more durable and weather-resistant. Still, it's not a bad hammock for the price (free with the purchase of the stand), and it is dangerously comfy. Practically every time I lie down on it, intending to spend some time with a book, I end up taking a nap. D'oh!
I'm going to Scotchguard it and probably still take it in when the weather gets icky. We'll see how long it lasts; I won't feel ripped off if I end up buying a better hammock next year.",3.0
"This lock works well, with quirks.

1) The key is hard to turn. Yeah, my bike locked up at the grocery store. Took a good 15 minutes of fidgeting to get it to work. When I got home, I sprayed WD40 into the lock, operates smoothly ever since.

2) The lock rattles in the mount when riding. I got fed up with it and used a Velcro strap to hold it against the frame. No problems.

3) Bike insurance is a scam. Kryptonite does full lifetime warranty, even if it is a bit sketchy. Master Lock I think does only a year. Don't know how that makes sense.

I lost my key and had my bike briefly stolen before security found it locked across a parking lot and behind a building, so now I need a new lock. Just not this one, I'll try a different one this time.",3.0
"If you are locking up a 50lb. <$100 X-Mart bike this is the perfect lock.  This will make your lame bike virtually un-stealable, with the combination of the low resale value of your bike and the hassle that would be necessary to extract it from this lock will deter 99.9% of thieves. Don't even bother using the cheap plastic mount, it will break apart in a couple weeks and you will have to make dangerous U-turn to go back and pickup your lock off the road.  Just put it on your stem.  I guess if you are an angry gorilla like some of the other reviewers then you could break the key off in the hole.  You just need to maintain some composure and make sure you get the key in all the way into the hole, turning as you push it in to get through all of the chambers, before attempting to unlock it.

If you have a nice $1000+ bike you will find that any lock available will not suffice to adequately protect your investment and give you full peace of mind.  You will need to keep that bike out of public sight and in your direct line of sight to properly secure it.  Many pros will even cut your thin and light frame before they even attempt to cut your 15lb. lock.  If you live/work in a high crime area, just get yourself a junker that can get you from point A to point B, add to it this lock, and you will never have to worry if it will still be where you left it. Hey, even if it isn't still there, you will probably find it within a 50ft radius from where you left it, because the fool figured out how lame your bike really was and ditched it.",3.0
"Ok, so I purchased this and took it out of the box today so I could set it up as a Santa gift for my son; however, there was NO BALL inside the box!  After a rush job to Sport Chalet (which we were trying to avoid by ordering early from Amazon.com), and after much frustration, the situation has been corrected......but I'm still out more money.

Others have commented that there was no ball with their set either....what's the problem here??!",3.0
My daughter loves it. It's hours of fun. However the description said it comes with a compact handpump with two needles but it didn't. Therefore three stars for deception.,3.0
Tried to inflate ball and the plug fell right in... played with a flat ball until we could go to Dunham's Sports and buy another one.,3.0
"Good quality ,we are pleased.",3.0
Fun game for all.  The rope is fraying after less than a week of use.  Needs Better rope.  The clip to hold the rope to the pole also flies off.  We replaced it with one that screws instead of clips and have had no issues.  Wish the company would make these changes.,3.0
"At first it was great. I had it out in my backyard and it was a lot of fun. Then after a few months past the hook on the top kept falling off, even though I asked my father (who is a pretty tough guy) to screw it in. Also the string snapped and the ball has been disinflating eventhough it has no hole. So it doesn't last very long.",3.0
I put 3 stars because everything was awesome but the string on the ball and the ball itself was cheaply made junk for sure. I'd just buy a pole honestly.,3.0
"This set was great at first but once we put it in the ground we noticed it sways a little at the top when the ball is being hit.  The kids love playing with it though. It's like a magnet for every kid that comes to the house and they think it's so cool that we have a tether ball set in the back yard.  The issue I have is that unless you take the top part of the pole off and put it indoors every day, the sun and rain get to it and the string that attaches the ball to the pole disintegrates and unravels.  Also, we live in FL and the moisture causes mold/mildew on the ball.  We've had to replace the string & ball now twice so it's been kind of a hassle.",3.0

I cannot give a very fair review since we didn't even open the box, but I was kind of surprised how small and lightweight the box was and I was hoping for something that would last a long time for big boys.",3.0

"Great for my granddaughters, put in the back yard. Tons of fun, just need to get a tire or base for it ?",3.0
Not very sturdy.  Would have been happier with a stronger pole. I doubt that it will hold up for very long.,3.0
"My kids love playing tetherball, however, since they are a bit older and stronger, the rope kept breaking and the ball would fly off.",3.0
"I bought this game to keep the kids busy at my son's high school grad party. I remembered playing this game in school and since we don't have a pool, I thought it would be fun. Well, the teens weren't interested - but the guys who were around my age had a blast. Unfortunately the rope / ball couldn't hold up. The ball ripped off the cord. The metal clasp broke and they had to finagle it on the pole. They had fun, but I will need to replace the ball already after only one party.",3.0
The pole for this ships in two pieces and the top slides onto the bottom. This joint is not very tight and the entire top half of the tether ball pole wobbles as much as 4 inches back and forth at the top. We are considering scraping it and replacing with a pole that is used for chainlink fences.,3.0
We have a hole in our driveway that we used for our children's tetherball and we decided to get another to replace it.  The pipe is too wide to fit into the existing hole so the children are unable to use the tetherball until we enlarge the hole.  I wish I thought about measuring the hole before purchasing the product. Construction should start soon.,3.0
"Overall it is not a bad product. The only fault I have with it is the plastic sleeve they send to insert the metal pole into, did not fit. I could only push it in half way, putting more concret in the hole seems to fix the problem. Other than that it works fine.",3.0
"The bars are fairly thin & light and sags some in the middle of the top.  The net had a couple squares not sewn together near the middle somehow, so there was originally a hole  - so I had to manually tie a couple squares together at their corners to make it better.  That was no big deal but it shouldn't have been like that.  It was fairly easy to put together by myself following the instructions.  I'd say it's worth about 80 dollars.",3.0
Easy to assemble. Ready to play in 5 minutes. However the Velcro fasteners shipped with the product are of subpar quality and keep breaking off - this is just a few days in. Now to look for good Velcro or other fasteners...,3.0
"Easy set up, but the Velcro straps that hold the net on are low quality.  Now we have a net that doesnt stay on.",3.0
"This is a good goal/net.  The straps are not super sturdy.  My daughter kicked her ball and it hit one of the straps just right and ripped it in half/off the goal.  The other thing to be aware of is that the goal sags in the middle on the top bar; this is disappointing but doesn't really change the function/purpose of the goal.  I would give this goal a 3.5 stars, not quite a 4 star  due to it not being as sturdy as expected.  Otherwise, my daughter is happy with it and can practice her kicking.  We'll see how it holds up over a 6 mth or 1 year period.",3.0
Bought two of these for a youth camp.  One was broken at camp when a middle school boy ran into the goal.  OK but not very durable.,3.0
"Pretty good net.

Will rust on the bottom a little if left outside.

White Velcro straps began to wear and snap off from kicks - had to replace them

Overall, a decent net for the price.  Just be aware of the problems that come with weathering.",3.0
"Easy to put together. Good size for smaller kids. Stands up well. It cannot be left out in the rain. The side joints open upward, allowing rain water to pour in to the tubing. Ours is now orange with rust as it collects large amounts of rain water inside the tubes.",3.0
The top/crossbar started sagging almost immediately,3.0
"Fun to play with, but it isn't very durable. The straps broke and the metal pegs keep coming out.  Eo i kick to hard? I am only twelve.",3.0
"The velcro straps lasted about 6 months, we replaced them.  The net completely fell apart by year two.  Frame is holding up, we will buy a replacement net but not sure from which company.  Having said that, this goal is outside all year long in hot sun and rain and has a very active, now seven year old boy, using it frequently.",3.0
Easy set up.  Delivered on time.  Half of the Velcro pieces that gold the net in place have already broke. Will be replacing with zip ties.,3.0
"Not too much to say, easy assembly, light weight. Good for kids. Rusts very easily. Water gets trapped inside tubes then leaks out rusty water when you move it. Not expecting to last more than a year if you leave it outside.",3.0

This is a ouster size for my 10 and 7 year old boys and their friends. It is easy to put together until you get to the net. The red tabs go on the top but you have to use loose velcro straps to connect it. I'm not a fan of this method. I'd have preferred the velcro be on the net so we know where to put them or to use hooks like other Franklin Sports products. But once it's together it's good. I do prefer the folding version of these for easy storage.,3.0
"Much bigger net than I thought it would be.  The kids loved it.  One bad thing was when shipped was NOT put in a box so the Christmas present was ruined since the kids saw it on the front porch.  It put together real easy and all the parts were perfect & new.  However my husband said the Velcro that attached the net to the bars wasn't that strong and the net was a little cheap so he got adhesive Velcro to use so the net didn't go anywhere.

So 3 stars because so far my kids love it, it was MUCH bigger than I thought but the net was on cheaper side, only Velcro that was that strong to hold net on and it didn't ship in a box.",3.0
Not as sturdy as I expected but light weight,3.0
"Loved it, but after a few practices for U4 kids, the net ripped in a couple of spots. Quality of net is lacking, otherwise a great goal",3.0

"It's good for a little kid.  Not great.  Rusts.  (No, we don't rush outside when it rains to drag it into the garage, and it doesn't sit out in our snowy winters.)  The ties holding the net on have one by one fallen off -- the Velcro just tore -- so we'll be using plastic tie wraps to re-attach it.  It's lightweight, which is mostly good.  You can easily drag it around where you like, and strong winds have not knocked it over.  I don't regret the purchase, but my son is also not a serious soccer player.  If we needed another one, I'd shop around for something different.",3.0
"Frame is sturdy, the net is okay.  The velcro straps to hold the net onto the frame are crap.  They have the strength of a strip of notebook paper.  They weren't just coming apart, they were tearing in two the first time he used it and could not be reused.  Disappointed!",3.0
You get what you pay for...  I've played baseball for a long time and these are not anywhere near heavy duty bases.  The rubber is fairly thin but will not break through so they should last a little while.  Don't count on these bases being ridged as they just bend and flop fairly easily just by holding them.  Good enough for my 7 year old son but these won't last for a number of year to be used with my other kids.  Not bad for the price but I was thinking they were much more durable than they are.,3.0

The cross bar has two remarkably weak points where they join three pieces together. I have had repeated issues with bending.,3.0
"Easy to assemble, the boys love it, but I will say - the net ripped in the center after only a couple of weeks.  My son is a fabulous player, if I do say so myself , but at the same time, he's only 9 so I can't imagine it would hold up to the level needed of someone in high school for example.  Also, the frame is light enough that it would surely dent or buckle if anyone hung from it...",3.0
Get what you pay for.  Fairly low quality and one of the boxes did not have all the parts.  Found a chunk of PVC pipe and duct tape to complete the installation,3.0
"This product was easy to put together. The quality of the net isn't great, it has a hole in it after using it for a month. So the ball always goes through the back of the net.",3.0
"Great for backyard practice, but we've had it for seven months and the velcro straps that hold the net to the frame are starting to rot.  I'm replacing them one by one with cable ties.",3.0
"The metal framing structure seems sturdy and was easy to assemble, but the net tore within the first week of use.  We got a great deal during the holiday season so I would purchase again, but now we need to figure out how to repair the net.
If our 11-year old could so easily tear the net during soccer play, then I am sure that it would not be able to withstand use from older children or regular daily use.",3.0
"Like the size.  But for an 8 year old who is active and likes to jump up and touch the top of the net ( hang on it), it is not sturdy enough.  The frame  bent a little, but it's certainly very functional still.  The kids love it!",3.0
"The net was delivered quickly, the frame is decent quality, but the net ripped within the first day. We are very disappointed with the quality of the net. For a backyard practice net, it will be fine, but I expect more out of the Franklin brand.",3.0
These are a little light and move easily.  Had to put sandbags on the back of them so they wouldn't move.,3.0
"Sturdy in my windy yard. Putting it to get here would have been a breeze if the ends that needed to be inserted into each other weren't distorted (one end one each side was oval instead of round and so my husband stood on them while I watched for the tube to get round). Net kind of slides off the top corners a bit. Maybe not for the expert or a picky person, but works for fun in our yard.",3.0
They hold water like crazy. Don't like taking down to drain and I really don't want to drill holes either.,3.0
The net on this goal is kind of flimsy. I sent my 8 year old out to play and it had a hole in it within an hour. I have had it about a month and it since has gotten another hole in it. I don't necessarily regret the purchase but it isn't stellar quality either.,3.0
This goal is fair for light use. Blows over easy.  Son doesn't really like it.  Was supposed to be gift from Santa but was delivered in the box with pictures all over it.,3.0
The price is rights but... a couple of soccer kicks on the crossbars and it bends easily.  You must take the cross bar apart and try to bend it yourself.,3.0
"This is good for a youngster, but my 6-year-old hit it so hard, the velcro ties are not sufficient to hold the net in place. This is not for the older soccer player. The stakes also are not deep enough to hold the goal in place as they pop up from the grass we have to hammer or push them down when they comes up. The stakes should be longer and the net should be held down a different way. I will be calling the company for more velcro ties. Two ties were torn before they were put on and I had to resew them. Hopefully the company will send free replacements. Otherwise, okay for price.  Others do cost more, but I wonder if they are designed better.",3.0
"These did not provide the focus range I was looking for. But, I'm sure they would work for someone else. Not a bad product, just didn't work for me.",3.0
"They work fairly well, but I find this pair very heavy while wearing them out on hikes.  I find quite a bit of neck strain after a short while out in the field birding.",3.0
These really aren't very strong powered and a bit hard to get the right adjustment.,3.0
These binoculars make everything smaller!,3.0
"I find these hard to focus, but when they finally get there...not too bad!",3.0
There okay. Nothing special.,3.0
"This product is too heavy, and unclear for some view. However, it just suit its price which 21 dollar?  I don't use it a lot because it kind of useless. However, you still could see some views clearly but stunned.",3.0
"You're going to hear that it's great for the price and it is... but the other cliche' is you get what you pay for. If this is your first set, you might be thrilled that there's an actual magnified view but for seasoned eyes, you might notice the chromatic aberration (the colors of light being focused apart). Mine was pretty severe. Not just slight as expected. Pretty obviously off. I'm thinking the shipping might have affected alignment of lenses. For birds, eh ok. For looking at the night sky and stars? No. View was not crisp. Felt dull. Not ideal for narrow set eyes. Go ahead and spend twice as much for five times better views.",3.0
They work for short distances.,3.0
"these are much larger than I though I was getting from the Amazon Blurb.  Since I bought them from the Warehouse, they are not returnable.  i will work with the size.",3.0
Work good but not much better than my vintage Tasco except the fine tuning with paddle is better than the thumb adjustment.,3.0
"Very light weight and the rubber around the eye parts are thin. The view. Adjustment and quality is fair, Fair for the price ,,, I don't think they would handle a drop or a bump so wear the spaghetti strap of a band that it came with, and handle with extreme care, perhaps get an insulated case\carrier for them if you plan on taking them on a journey,",3.0
"These looked externally well-made and produce a nice, clear, bright image.  They seemed like an excellent value for the money.  I purchased them for my husband to use while we were on safari in Africa.  They worked well until day ten when the focusing mechanism stopped working.  I've returned them.  Maybe just a fluke, but I'm picturing little plastic teeth inside the focus housing that maybe don't hold up long.  At any rate, back from safari we don't need another pair, so I won't reorder.",3.0
Not strong enough for bird watching. They may help in a concert.,3.0
Very good good quality for the price,3.0
"very cute and went great with my Halloween costume! for the price, couldn't have asked for better. Warning: if you are not a child this tutu is a very tight fit, i wear a size 0 and it was a little hard to get it over my hips",4.0
Great fit for my 6 year old,4.0
Met my expectations. Thank you!,4.0
Exactly what I was looking for. Paired with a white cami for a gift for friends at a birthday sleepover (8 year olds). It was a frozen theme. And the girls had a dance-off.,4.0
Looks just like picture. Simple two layers of material and satin waist band.,4.0
"The skirt color is exact. The length is fairly long but not really long either and it can be cut with a scissor if another length is desired. It's see through but nothing boy shorts can't fix but I'm wearin black leggings underneath anyway so it's not a problem.

I'm going as a princess for Halloween and recommend this one. The length is just right it's not super poofy but if u tuck it inward from the waist it puffs up a lot and looks great.",4.0
Perfect for the price point. Three layers of tulle - definitely had to wear some spandex shorts underneath. Great for costume purposes considering it's 11 bucks! Fast shipping and easy to work with company.,4.0
"This is thick enough that you can't see through it, but it is very long, so be sure to check the dimensions. I ended up cutting it shorter.",4.0
"I wanted to get this atlas, especially to help us find places to go camping and hiking.. It's not always easy to find campgrounds or primitive campsites (since they're not always located in clearly identified campgrounds), so having these detailed maps is very useful for that. We recently used the atlas when we camped in the Catskill Mountains region, and I was glad we had these maps to help us out.",4.0
No comment yet,4.0
"GPS and Waze will get you there, but it's more fun planning when you can see the whole picture. And the map doesn't need batteries either.",4.0
"It is fairly detailed, accurate, and up to date. This was a lifesaver navigating and shortening my new 500 mile, rural milktruck route.",4.0
"Wonderful, comprehensive atlas.  It's a little large.",4.0
This atlas was a help on our trip on back roads in western New York the past couple of weeks.,4.0
"While perhaps not 100% accurate in extremely rural locations, nevertheless quite helpful and easy to read. I am buying a second copy to leave in the car when we go exploring.",4.0
"I have purchased these maps before, including older editions for NY and FL.  They are tops for showing all the back roads, even some dirt roads, and are useful for finding your way around off the beaten track. Great for hunting, finding campgrounds in obscure places; better prices at Amazon, too.",4.0
"We are very happy with this, we have owned the Delorme maps before, kept them until they were dog-eared and falling apart. Very detailed maps that really help (GPS is not fail-safe!). Only criticism we have is that the binding doesn't last for twenty years - but by then you might want to get another anyway.",4.0
We needed to locate some undeveloped property in the Show Low Pines area.  This map and the internet were great in assisting us.  We use our Colorado and Wyoming ones all the time.  They are a great resource for people who like to do beyond the end of the road!,4.0
There is a great deal of detail in this map set including some off road trails I was looking for.,4.0
as anticipated,4.0
Nice details and easy to navigate.,4.0
A good basic navigating tool! Easy to read and familiar format to my other Travel Atlases.,4.0
"I recently went on a long road trip to celebrate my retirement.  I would be driving thru at least 6 states and wanted to have a hard map on hand for planning purposes.  While I will have a Garmin GPS unit running, I do like having a manual backup - just in case.  I also like having a map so I can spend an hour the night before reviewing the route and perhaps looking for side roads to adventure.  The beauty of this retirement road trip is that if I see a road leading off into some unknown distant hills, I am free to go.  Trying to get a feel for the terrain ahead or where interesting waypoints along the way on a tiny GPS is impossible.  Having an actual map makes it so easy to look for alternate roads, forest service roads in the mountains, and possible stops.

Now that I'm home, my Atlas & Gazeteers are full of circles, scribbles, notes, and arrows.  They got a lot of use.  Even sitting at a rest stop, quite often other travelers would come up and ask me for directions to some place they're looking for.

The only downside to these maps?  Small print and I have old eyes.  I brought along a magnifying glass to read it better.  My bad luck to forget it at a rest stop and not realize it until I was 700+ miles away.  I stopped at a Walmart and bought another.",4.0
"We purchased a replacement for a 20 year old version.  There is a lot of info in these books so you can use as much or as little as you like.  They are an oversized book so bear that in mind.  Any smaller would be too difficult to read.  The grid system mostly works, unless you are trying to bridge back to back pages, but you can't have everything.  Includes:  state info, contact for pertinent agencies, index of place names for larger cities, and specific info on the Grand Canyon at the front.  Common/popular locations are cross referenced with info for fishing, hunting, recreation areas (camping, hiking, swimming, etc), and wildlife viewing.  Street/road names do not go down to unpaved roads like forest or park service numbers.  Topographic mapping and boundaries for states, counties, parks, forests, wilderness and BLM lands.",4.0
"This issue does not have San Tan Valley shown in it. My US road atlas shows it. FIx it, Delorme. A better job of keeping up with changes should have been done.",4.0
"I have an old copy circa 1990 of this, the updated version has the familiar information and new things have been added.",4.0
"I bought this map and the Utah map. Both are great . The only issue that I have is that the maps are a little bent due to the size of the boxes they were shipped in, The map's are a little longer then the boxes not by much just a few centimeters, so they did arrive with some bends in them.",4.0
Gazeteers are great!,4.0
Have used the Delorme Gazetteers for years.  Needed this for Arizona as I plan to travel there.,4.0
Haven't gone yet but think it will be just fine.,4.0
Good map books.  These are great for traveling and trip planning.  They show places of interests that you might not know about otherwise.  I have these atlases for several different states.,4.0
These are the best road guides ever!,4.0
True to it's avertisment,4.0
Overall detail is good although there are some inaccuracies.  Scale is good but page breaks can be a nuisance if you target a location on a break.,4.0
I have several of these they all have proven very accurate with many extras such as points of interest. Thanks,4.0
"I love these maps. If you DONOT like or use a smart phone with gps or navagation, You will enjoy the map",4.0
It was received in good condition and is what I ordered.  This will come in very handy for my next trip to Arizona.,4.0
I can't decide if this series is better than the Delorme series or not.  But it is very adequate for finding details when wandering around a state.  Recommended for people going to or living in Arizona.,4.0
"I have these gazetteers for about 10 states now. I don't know how I managed before I discovered these. As a pilot car driver who must follow permits exactly, the side streets are enlarged enough to see every street. The insets of the cities are also a life saver when you're in a strange city. For it's information I'd give it five stars. But the books fall apart at the spine quickly. The smaller states are folded and stapled at the spine. Such a very large book should have had more than three staples to rely on. The large states with twice the number of pages are glued. They also fall apart badly at the glue joint.",4.0
"I go back and forth between Benchmark and DeLorme atlases.  The DeLorme versions feature larger scale, greater detail, more depiction of dirt roads and trails.  Benchmark has a more eye-friendly color scheme and layout, detailed maps for selected cities and land ownership maps (BLM, USFS, State, etc).  Somewhat frustrating as I end up with both for states I travel a lot in.  Benchmark, while not showing as many ""roads"" as DeLorme, it does a better job of indicating which of those side dirt roads are ""primary"".  Sometimes the DeLorme is TOO much detail.",4.0
"I have purchased these for Wyoming, Arizona, Colorado and Utah so far.  They are great to take along on a road trip as they are very detailed and show you where so much is.  Elevation, rivers, places to camp etc are just a few of the things in these books.  I will continue to buy other states based in the western U.S. as I plan to continue to take road trips.",4.0
"Just as previous reviewers of this book have stated, the exercises featured in this book are nothing new. On the other hand, many of these exercises are overlooked in this day and age, which is a shame, because they are excellent conditioning workouts.

If you are not a martial artist, don't let the title of this book deter you from buying it. The Hindu Squats and Hindu Push-Ups alone is just one duo of exercises that will build your stamina by astounding leaps and bounds. I first learned these two exercises over twenty years ago from the late pro wrestler Dr. Jerry Graham, and I was shocked to see how these seemingly simplistic calisthenics worked me like a horse.

While the Squats & Push-Ups appear to be the core exercises of Furey's book, he has a fabulous plethora of exercises to tone and strengthen the entire body. You can build quite a personalized home workout, no weight equipment needed, and get great results.

The only shortcomings of ""Combat Conditioning"" are incomplete editing and lack of availability. There is one section where a succession of photos illustrating an exercise appears in incorrect order. There is no ISBN number to be found. Therefore, the book has a weak presence on the Amazon.com radar, which is a drag, because I bet Furey could sell many copies if the product had more visibility.

Whether you are striving for Mixed Martial Arts stardom or just want to get in phenomenal shape without the price of a gym membership, this book is a good bet. I would love to see another edition of ""Combat Conditioning"" in publication: neatened up, ISBN'd and ready for easy purchase!",4.0
"As has already been said, if you're looking for the buff bodybuilder look, then this book isn't for you.  However, if you're interested in increasing the muscular endurance, flexibility, and cardio-vascular fitness that combat athletes need then this book is a must buy!  I have been using combat conditioning for 2 years and at age 40+ I am in the best shape that I've been in over 20 years.  The program has increased my endurance, shoulder, back and neck strength and flexibility to previous unseen levels for me.  It has also virtually cured me after I had dislocated my right knee!  As has also already been said there really is nothing new here, but Furey was brilliant in combining 3 exercises which target all major muscle groups while simultaneously increasing flexibility.  Yes it's true that the back of the book is filled with about 10 pages of ads, but that doesn't bother me because combat conditioning has literally revolutionized my life and fitness level.  I would especially recommend this book for you if you do wrestling, judo, or mixed martial arts.  Combat conditioning will not give you a bodybuilder's body.  But after doing it for a couple of weeks you'll feel so good, in shape, and self confident that you'll probably want to go to Muscle Beach and kick sand in a
bodybuilder's face!!",4.0
"This book is great for people who want quick and effective workouts.  Also, people who do judo or wrestling will benefit greatly.  That being said, the books and tapes he has put out since this one are not worth buying.  Buy this book and use it and you will benefit; purchase his others and you will feel let down.",4.0
"The exercises are nothing new. The key to this exercise programme is how it`s put together. The circuit routine is awesome for burning fat. Sometimes you need reminding of certain things. Granted there is a lot of hype -but in this case it is justified, Combat Conditioning is unbeatable for fast weight loss & getting you in shape in minimum time. In @ 15 minutes I work every muscle in my body and have the rest of the day to get on with my hectic life. It is quick ,very effective, and requires no equipment- everything an exercise programme should be. Combined with Navy Seal calisthenics this will really get you in shape fast.",4.0
Doing this for years. Now that grappling is huge so is everyone else.,4.0
"I have suffered from problems with my back for some time due to injuries. I purchased Combat Conditioning in order to learn exercises to strengthen my back muscles, hopefully eliminating some of my problems. Within one week after starting, I could already tell a difference. Most of the pain in my lower back has disappeared, and now I am moving on to my upper back.",4.0
"Well... this book is a mixed bag. Its style is fairly amateurish and it makes a lot of over-the-top claims about how superior its methods are to every other form of strength training, familiar to anyone who's read through the marketing for as-seen-on-TV fitness programs. I would also tend to disregard any of the long-term training plans (1000 repetitions of any exercise is clearly not a good use of your time, and is certainly not the best way to gain strength).

However, for those who can read with a cynical eye and ignore this nonsense, there is a LOT of valuable content here. It is true that bodyweight exercise can be excellent for developing functional strength, and that many simple bodyweight exercises train muscles that are often neglected by weight training programs (though this argues more for their use in conjunction with weight training than as a replacement). And the list of exercises in this book is very detailed, clearly written and pictured, and includes a lot of esoteric but highly effective exercises that most people, even fitness-aware people, will not know. And these exercises can mostly be done anywhere without equipment, which makes them very useful for those who travel a lot or cannot always make it to a gym.

If you are capable of designing your own workouts, are already interested in bodyweight exercise, and are willing to do more research to find the best way to integrate these movements, this book can help you on your way and offers things many other books on strength training do not. However, if you are looking for a complete fitness program written by a professional with a scientific and reasoned approach, you may want to start elsewhere, as much of the general advice in this book is misleading, and it is much more useful for the descriptions of specific exercises.",4.0
"Matt Furey is quite a character, but he knows his stuff when it comes to getting into peak physical condition. This self-published book has been an Internet best seller from Furey's website, and probably made him an Internet millionaire entrepreneur all by itself. I don't want to sound like an endorsement, but I've used the bodyweight exercises he presents, and they really do make you stronger. The exercises aren't for building pretty muscles for bodybuilding competitions, they're for building functional muscles the are actually good for something. NOTE: the book is still available from Furey's website for $29.95, which is less than some of the used copies are going for here on Amazon and eBay. It's not a collectors item, it's a paperback workout manual.",4.0
"Most of these exercises are not new, if you've played football or wrestled in high school, or were in the military you've probably done most of these. What makes this book useful is the routines and the motivation. Furey challenges you and verbally pushes you, it always picks me up when I feel like skipping a workout. It has good cross training- road work conditioning programs that give you some place to start. The book is a bit pricey, but its the only volume I would recommend. Furey's other products, in my opinion are overpriced and really don't deliver much. Stick with this book and a jump rope, you should have everything you need for a great workout week in week out. If you want more ""pain"" in your workouts, I suggest trying kettlebells, those things are just evil.",4.0
"I will say that the book set out what the author intended.  The exercises seem challenging and accomplish the goal of a tough workout without any fancy equipment, etc.  However I have to agree about complaints on price.  For a relatively thin book, without any accompanying media (for example a DVD showing the author doing the exercises/routines), without color photos and glossy paper the price was a little high (although cheaper than a gym membership, etc.) I agree with the reviewer who suggested Mr. Furey put out a more polished edition and I'd add include a DVD so we can see someone working the entire exercise not just pictures of several points in the exercise.",4.0
"Other reviewers have already said it all, but I'll add my two cents' worth anyhow.  As a book, Combat Conditioning is far less than impressive.  At first glance, you'll probably feel you wasted your money on it.  But if you make it past that first impression and actually do the exercises--even just the three basic exercises that make up the ""Royal Court""--you'll find that the contents of this book are pure gold.

I'm 50 years old and have been using Combat Conditioning as my sole workout regimen for the past three or four years; and I'm easily in much better shape now than I've ever been.  I don't do as many reps as Furey suggests for the young, athletic, or experienced, but I do the exercises daily.  They've benefited me far more than any other exercise program I've ever tried.

Do yourself a favor and buy the Combat Conditioning videos or DVDs too.  Watching Matt Furey do the exercises helps ensure that you'll be doing them right.

More than just a book, Combat Conditioning is a lifetime fitness program--the best I've ever seen.",4.0

Otherwise very happy with it. Recommended for moms with busy a lifestyle!",4.0
"Love this calendar- I've been buying it for 4-5 years. With two boys playing every sport it really helps to have the large space to notate all their practices.
The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I think they should just make it Jan-Dec. Since I buy it every year the extra Sep-Dec pages are redundant and maybe it would reduce the cost a little to drop the extra months.",4.0

The board is clearly not for everyone, but I have found playing a youtube video with some trick ideas helps spur more activity. It's also a good way to practice balance for young ones.",4.0

Little guys can, at the very least, sit on it while you spin them around. The older kids can actually do the flip-it-up and land on it tricks. The friction tape on the top holds feet securely and the smooth bottom is fine on our commercial carpet. Adults can always do the twist on it, which I guess counts as a core workout and certainly cracks up the grandkids.

A nice find and a handy active toy.",4.0

She watched a few u tubes and is a pro in three weeks she says maybe a few parades or the circus but it gets her off her pad and out of the house. Durable and fashionable she loves the green and yellow wheels etc.. Has even learned to adjust the seat by herself. For the price a great buy, you will cherish the one on one memories and the great thrill your child will get when they succeed. Highly recommend.",4.0
"This is a good product for what it does, offering a variety of different grip options so you can get a good workout. My only ""meh"" about it is that the door frame brace has a little play to it, but maybe that's by design. All in all a good buy.",4.0
"Made well, solid constructions, works as advertised.  However, although it does ""fit most doorways 24"" to 32"" wide"" (as advertised),  if you have an old house with narrow doors (mine are 29"" wide), the half circular hand grips' end pieces project  past the main horizontal bar, which causes them to rest on the door frame and create dents. This is easily prevented by putting something in between.  Doors over 30"" won't have this problem.",4.0
"This is an amazing product. Bars are all steel so a much sturdier product then the last one I had. The only reason I gave it a 4 star and not a 5 was because the doorway dimensions are not correct. I have a 30"" doorway and the bar is for at least a 34"" doorway. I had to modify to make it fit. Other than that wonderful product.",4.0
"I don't own many chin up bars, if I exclude this one I don't own any.  It is sturdy, and even though the pictures in the manual don't quite match the actuality (representing 3d in a 2d format always has problems), it was inexpensive and it functions very well.",4.0
"I'm not really any good at pull ups or chin ups, but this is a decent item for a beginner, if paired with a stool or chair. Most of the grips are comfortable, and the only ""sturdiness"" concerns I have are that my doorjamb is strong enough to hold me up. Only complaint is that the grip cushions on the upturned grip slide down when held, but it's not a deal breaker to me. Works great with P90X!",4.0
"I have been using this pull-up bar for a couple of months now and it has proven to be worth every penny. It was very easy to put together, fits my door frames quite nicely and stores under my bed without any hassle at all.

"The parts all came as a complete set.  The assembly was simple but did require a little experience in putting together an assembly in a manner that one did not overtighten and then strip threads.  I used it for a few weeks and then retightened the nuts.  It seems quite sturdy and yet light weight.  The pad and bar above the doorway seems quite good, as it is not causing any damage to the wall or sill.  The only thing I would have suggested is a better hand foam or pads, as it seems that might need to be replaced at some point.

It was a good purchase and I am getting stronger as a result.",4.0

"DIMENSIONS: The long tubular bar that braces against the inside-facing part of your door frame is 41 inches long (so your frame has to be a couple of inches narrower than that--and most are). The upper rectangular bar that braces against the top lip of the outside-facing part of your door frame is 18 inches long (so your frame has to be a couple of inches wider than that--and most are).

The bar is working wonderfully for me, and I'm definitely glad I went with the type that has the extra grips. I'm not using the extra braces that are meant to be screwed into the wall above the outside-facing part of the door frame. I think these are included mostly to prevent a catastrophic, lawsuit-inducing door frame collapse that isn't likely to happen if you have a normal, sturdy frame.

One star is removed only because what others have said about the bolts being made of lower-quality metal appears to be true. I read the reviews and was prepared, so I assembled mine VERY CAREFULLY, only letting the screwdriver slip a few times. Even then I could see that a few more slips and the ends would be stripped. Just do it carefully and you'll be fine.

I would definitely recommend this to a friend.",4.0

These bands are high quality and very easy to use. My one issue is the side straps at the handles tend to rub the sides of your hands with certain moves. I still would recommend purchase at this low price.,4.0
This is a great addition to your work out and is very easy to use and adapt into your workout. My only issue with it is some moves make the sides rub your hands which repeatidly don't feel so hot. I actually use this instead of weights and it does the job!,4.0
"Good product. Solid construction, easy to assemble. No missing parts and no problems at all with stripping the thread on the locking nuts.

The main bar is single piece as other reviewers have said. The bar will not fit above a doorway where the wall is greater that 6 inches or 150mm thick. Luckily one doorway in my house is in a new timber framed wall with 10mm plasterboard (drywall) on either side so it fits. You might want to use a gym towel at the contact points with the doorway to protect the surface from any marks, especially if you live in a rental! Again this is no problem.

Don't worry about all of the negative comments (missing parts etc) you may have read - the product is good, it does what it says and I don't see mine falling apart anytime soon!",4.0

"I am a ""toner"" when I work out; I don't like to ""bulk-up"" when I am doing resistance training. But, my upper body could use a little more size in the back and shoulders and even more in the ""lat"" area. I have only had this product a few weeks and I am already seeing results of more mass in the upper arms, back of the shoulders, and in that lat area from the one single exercise of the rear grip pull-up. Hanging in the door-way while doing the pull-ups is convenient for the ""aided"" form of the pull-up, as just the lightest push from my feet is enough to complete the exercise when my muscles are exhausted. I also use weights hanging from my belt for strength training, but my goal is to do at least 20 of these unaided the regular way, for each set before I am done with the training cycle.",4.0
"Instructions are weak. I built and re-built three times before I got the order right. Make sure you connect the L bracket to the U handles before you screw them into the long bar.

I would probably buy again though.",4.0

"If you live in an apartment, this might not be the pull up bar for you. The only door it fits on is my first floor bathroom, so P90X might have to continue on bands for now till we move or I hang this from the struts in my basement maybe? It's well built, very easy to put together with just one page of instructions, but you need your own wrench. I don't see why they don't just include those cheap metallic key wrenches with each bar, it can't be a dollar or two more with purchase of the bar. Oh well, good bench, will make you love barbara (if you listen to rap) and definitely a great price.",4.0
BMP shipped it out extremely fast which was really nice! The bar works well and does what it is supposed to. The only complaint is that some of the padding on the bar came ripped or indented but for the price it is no big deal.,4.0
"I'm 230 pounds and hopefully dropping but I was a bit hesitant to trust any bar that is portable.  However, the Black Mountain Products pull up bar handled my girth just fine.  It comes with optional brackets that you can mount above the door frame and being a belt and suspenders type of guy, I did opt to use them to make sure it was mounted solid enough to trust.  (in reality, I was more concerned with my door trim not being mounted strong enough over the door and my caution was less about the product than my chosen place to mount it)

Assembly was easy enough and the product appears to be well made and I expect it will hold up well.

There may be other bars that are better, I really don't know, but for the price, I'm very satisfied with these and they will do the job just fine.",4.0
"There are OK for the price.  Put it together very quickly, you need to use your own tools and make sure you find the correct tools. A few minor issues are the parts that touches the side door frames can get some black paint from the bars and the other issue is the height of your door. My doors are not that tall, so I can not get the full reach going down. One more issue is the strong smell of the paint from the bars.",4.0

I was hesitant to buy a doorway pull up bar because I didn't want to ruin my new doorway but it's sturdy and works great. I'm 140lbs and it does just fine.

"Got it for christmas 2010. The instructions state that it is a new 2011 model with nuts and bolts that cannot be tightened by hand. This creates a lock that makes them harder to loosen while the bar is being used. After gathering my tools, I found that these nuts and bolts were hard to turn and they started stripping!!!

"I use these for leg lifts so after some cutting of the chords where the handles are I was able to put my feet in them.  They worked great.  I guess I should have gone for the ""atomic"" (70-75lbs) but couldn't find them on Amazon so I went for the ""purple"" (45-50lbs).  I ended up using these in combination with another Black Mountain chord to get the right resistance for my leg workouts.",4.0
"I purchased this band and one other with a higher weight rating.  Both work quite well for light weight training.  The added piece which fits in a door allows for even more exercise types.  They are well built and should last a long time.  There is a nice booklet with various exercises which was a great help.  The only issue I had with either band was the length - and that really has nothing to do with the band itself.  Since I am short, the band is too long (without tying a knot in the middle of it) for some exercises.  All in all the band works fine.",4.0
"Product came quickly.  I didn't realize that it came with something to put in the door to connect the band to so that more exercises can be done. I tried some of the exercises in the book that utilize the door anchor and it was fine.  The band is great to use and throw in the stroller during my mommy and baby workout class. Because it is light weight and does not take up very much space, I was able to take it on vacation with me, though I did not use it as much as I should have.  I purchased this specific one because it is very similar to the one I use at my gym. The resistance seems to be what it is supposed to be.  I like that the handles are sturdy and have a grip so they don't hurt your hands.",4.0

"I've been using this resistance band for a few months, and it's held up very well in that time. It seems the rating of 50 lbs. is pretty much spot-on, though it doesn't provide quite the same feeling as lifting a barbell. The price and quality seem to be really great though, and I guess I couldn't ask for more from a product like this.",4.0
"I ordered my resistance band a few days ago and I am completely satisfied with my purchase. What I didn't expect was the anchor attachment, so I am much more appreciative of that.

I've also called their office and they have excellent customer service.",4.0
"Works great for my 21 Day Fix workout routine. I love the resistance, and it is definitely sturdy. Have been using it for months now and still works like new. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the handles on mine had dents on them. Seems like they are permanent as I've tried everything to """"un-dent"" them if that even makes any sense. So it's a minor discomfort having the handles not perfectly smooth and more lumpy in my hands. Other than that, it's a great resistance band especially for its price.",4.0

"My Purple BMP resistance band arrived in the mail today and I would say that I am pretty pleased with it.  The listed pull weight is 45-50 lbs and I would say that is pretty accurate.  Doing even a few basic exercises (e.g., curls) makes me feel like it is pretty close to the listed draw weight.  This is a very tough rubber tubing.  It seems relatively well made and the door anchor attachments works well.  I am looking forward to getting quite a bit of use out of this equipment.  I have an Everlast grey tube band that is similar except the draw weight on that is much less (say 10 lbs).

My only complaint is that it's a bit shorter than I was expecting.  I didn't see the length listed anywhere obvious so I didn't realize it would be a bit on the short side.  I'm used to the Everlast one I own which is probably a good foot longer which helps a lot for doing standing shoulder exercises on both sides.  With the BMP one, it's not quite long enough to do that.  I can still do standing shoulder exercises but instead I can only do one side at a time.  Not a huge deal but a bit of a surprise.  Overall seems like a good product.",4.0
Seems good. Haven't tried it yet.,4.0
I am a teacher and I use these bands for an after school fitness club for middle school students. They are very durable and the students love them. The only problem I have with them is the material that connects the handle to the band is rough on the edges.

"I have several different BMP resistance bands, includes the lighter-weight kit/set, and the individual Orange and Purple bands. I prefer the individual bands for heavier weights compared to stacking lighter bands together. Overall, I have found the Orange bands to be the most versitile, followed by the purple (speaking as someone with 1 year of moderate strength training).

One point that is lacking is the attachment strap, which is included in every order. This piece has not failed on me yet, but it just doesn't appear to be very robust, and the plastic/bylon sewn into the lash is not very large. Perhaps it would be better to exclude this piece from the orders and sell a single, stronger lash separate.",4.0

"Works great. I expected it to be portable, but I found that the cord was too bulky to carry with me, and it's too long to do the type of exercises that I like to perform on the go. If you want to lug the thing around, you could do certain exercises without hooking it into a doorframe, but the full range of movements would not be available.

Overall, a solid product, although the picture and description could be more clear on the size, length, and the essential nature of the doorframe attachment.",4.0
"I've used Black Mountain resistance bands before and I like them. The company is also great -- previously, I had an issue with the foam handles on a band arriving damaged, and they replaced it cheerfully and quickly. This band came in good condition, no issues. The only thing I would mention is that you have to have a door in your house that has some clearance on either side, so you can insert the door anchor and have room to do the exercises. I have sixteen doors in my house and only one works for this purpose. It's in my office, so at least I'm reminded to get up every once in a while and exercise! I do find that the band is too short to do some exercises. Or maybe I just can't pull hard enough on it!",4.0
"I have the starter set, with five bands, door hanger and ankle cuff already, and thought this would be a nice addition. It is the next toughest up in level (35-40lbs). Oddly, the instructions included only list the resistances for the first five I already had, and I only knew what this resistance was from enlarging the photo on the Amazon product page. I dinged it one star, because unlike the rest of my set, the cables on these are not clipped, but run through the grips, so in order to double up resistance, I will have to hold two grips in each hand, and can't use this strength with the cuff The door hanger strap is included, though.",4.0
"What can a reviewer say about a piece of rubber cord?

Never having used an exercise band before, I went into this experience completely cold, so I offer my observations as a rank novice.

This band seems very well made. The handles attach to the band through sturdy metal grommets that look like they'll never come loose. Black rubber sleeves over the joints add a finished look. Clad in thin sponge rubber over plastic cores, the grips are thick enough to grasp easily, and the textured rubber provides for a firm grip even with sweaty hands. The straps that attach the grips to the band have no loose stitching or sharp edges, and the sewing is tight. On the down side, the band exudes a strong, unpleasant chemical odor, but I'm sure that'll go away after a short time here in the dry Southwestern desert air.

Overall, this band, along with the included door anchor, appears to be a high-quality product.

The ""Exercise & User Guide"" that comes in the package explains how to use the band, and of course it includes the obligatory cautions, warnings and legal disclaimers (""Always use safety glasses...""). The step-by-step instructions feature small but useful black-and-white photos of each exercise. You can find many more exercises, including the lower-body ones that I was particularly interested in but that are not in the User Guide, on the Black Mountain Products website.

This Black Mountain Products band adds a new option to my exercise regimen, and I expect it to see a lot of use. Based on this sample, I'm very satisfied with the brand and the product.",4.0
"This product is a resistance band with the one I tested being the lowest resistance available.  The band itself it hemmed in permanently with fabric handles which are pretty generous in terms of being an easy grip.  The band itself itself was fairly low resistance but is still useful for many exercises including curls and leg exercises.

I suppose the only downside of this band it the inability to be able to change or add resistance.  Therefore, you will need a few different bands for differing exercises and uses.  The band included a door attachment, but frankly, with mos interior doors, it is far too easy to rip the door frame apart using it (or any other similar item).

Otherwise,  this is a well made item and I have found this and other bands are great for many uses in the home and also for travel (where taking this is great for stretching) because this can be packed easily.",4.0
Makes working out anywhere easy and fun! I wasn't sure what weight to get so I kind of guessed. It would be nice to have a couple others in different weights so I could do more exercises more easily.,4.0
"The Black Mountain band is an adequate medium quality band.  At its price point it is a fair deal.  Better quality bands have higher quality handles which switch from band to band.  With the black mountain set, you have to buy each band separately.

For most people one band will probably be ok, but knowing which band to pick might be difficult for a beginner.  You can adjust the tension by stepping back from the door another space, of course.

Overall I think this is a decent product.  I've used better quality.  I wish I could comment on long term reliability but that will have to wait for an update.",4.0
"The elastic part is made of latex, and has a very strong odor. If you're allergic to latex, you WILL have a reaction to this.",4.0
"This set of resistance bands are strong, well made and solid.  I've only used them for a few days but the quality appears to be there to this point.  The accompanying booklet  provides 18 different exercises, some using a door to secure the bands and others that can be done by standing on them.  An anchor is provided that allows the bands to be secured to a closed door although it does not seem to work on all doors (depends on clearance available and how tight the door is to the frame).  However, the anchor is secure and solid.

A full set of bands are available with difference strength levels though I only tested the ""extra heavy"" red set.  For a beginner, probably a progression of strengths will be more effective and allow for a better workout while learning the exercises.",4.0
"Bands are good for portability, and I like doing some exercises with them at home because they prevent ""cheating"" in the same way rings do and allow for some unique exercises.  I've tried a few brands, and the Black Mountain ones are pretty typical.  I have the red one, which is still fairly thin.  This type of band has the handles attached rather than clipped on, so bands can't be combined.  If you are okay with that, I think you'll be happy with these.  The handle is comfortable and they work well.",4.0

"This is a great product! Is highly durable, easy to use and just an all around great band (much higher quality than the products i have bought at some chain sporting good stores). The only reason i gave it a four star rating is because after i bought this product, i actually ended up having to buy the adjustable set because i needed to have something a little more diverse for my p90x regimen. But thats more of my fault than the products falt, lol.

Update: Today, one of the two bands i bought, had a huge rip in it (it has been a little over two months since i started using) its not as durable as i thought it was when i started with them. I emailed BMP about the product warranty. They responded in under a day, i told them about my situation and they decided they would send me two ORANGE BANDS UPON MY REQUEST (one for my set where the handles detach and one normal one, orange is the heaviest band they have and isn't available on amazon).

Durable and the handles are easy to change. The instruction manual lists some exercises twice and isn't super helpful. Over half of the exercises shown in the booklet require a door to anchor from. Didnt realize that when I ordered it as I workout in a basement room without a door nearby.,4.0
"I have used this twice so far, and very much enjoy them! Didn't realize I was so weak haha. Will update in a handful of months on info about wear after weekly use.",4.0
"The bands are great. The nylon bag to hold everything had a 4-5"" slit in it, which I easily mended on the inside with duct tape. The exercise chart was missing.",4.0
"I've used resistance bands for years and there are many out there that fail quickly. I have found this set to be of better quality and hold up longer. This is not to say they last forever, they don't. I use these everyday for about a year now and have not had any snap as yet.",4.0
"I have only had these for a few Months. I have only used them a handful of times and the blue one snapped on me this morning during my workout. Seems like they should last longer than that especially since Ive barely used them.

Update: I contacted the company directly because my return window through amazon had closed. I told them my blue band had snapped after not very many uses. They immediately sent me a brand new blue band! Great customer service.",4.0
"Great products, love the carry bag. The handles are amazing. My favorite product is the door jam strap to be able to hit different angles, and it is so easy to use. The price is fair and I am very happy with my purchase. I would have given this product 5 stars if the orange band was included!
Yellow= 2-4 lbs
Blue= 4-6 lbs
Green= 10-12 lbs
Black= 15-20 lbs
Red= 25-30 lbs
(Orange)= 35-40 lbs",4.0
"So far these bands are better made that others Ive tried. The resistance is constant throughout your movement, it doesnt snap back or feel too soft. Looking forward to increasing the range of motion in my shoulders. This product gives me a good stretch along with a good workout.

So far the only thing I would have like to see is the weight range labeled on each band.",4.0
"Product & accessories are quality made & as advertised. However, no instructions or safety information are included. No diagrams, etc.",4.0
great product and has held up well,4.0
Excellent set of bands. Commenced usage two weeks ago and already seeing results...,4.0
Very happy with my purchase,4.0
product arrived prompt and as described,4.0
Nice product for working out when I travel and am staying in hotels!,4.0
"So far, so good. Was able to get a decent work out of the arms and abs in. Only gave four stars because it doesnt tell you what the weight is on the bands, only on the manual. Eventually, youll learn what each bands weight is by memory.",4.0
very good,4.0
"Okay.  So I have had these resistance bands for little over a month now and am really pleased with them.  The main thing I like about them is that they are so easy to configure due to the carabiner connectors.  While I am not a materials engineer the quality of the bands and the various components is good.  The stitching on the ankle and door bits is good.  I had no problem using the door attachment.  It slid right into the space between the door and frame.  I closed the door and was working out within minutes, once I got the right level of resistance I was looking for.  Need more just add another band.  Need to reduce the resistance just swap out or reduce the number of bands you have attached.  Easy as pie.

I do recommend paying attention to the warning about wearing protective glasses for your eyes.  I have had no slippages but always play it safe when it comes to my eyes.  I use my DeWalt goggles that I bought for using with power tools.",4.0
It is incredibly flexible and easy to use. There is great adaptability to everyone and everyones needs. It has great resistance and does what you need it to. Only thing I would love it to have is a second set of handles so two people can do the bands at the same time.,4.0
"I have been using the bands for a little over a month and find them an excellent complement to my workout routines.  I use them in conjunction with a Bowflex machine.  I have used bands on and off rehabbing various injuries I have sustained for many years.  The big plus with these bands are the handles which allow proper hand placement and the ease of adding resistance as one progresses.  The bands also allow for resistance through the total motion of the exercise.  Just using lengths of  therapeutic bands requires you to make a handle by tying a knot or wrapping around ones hand.  My only negative on these is that they say to not use beyond one year yet have a lifetime warranty, thus the 4 star rating?",4.0
"I recently got this as a gift and they are my favorite resistance band thus far. I have never used bands with clips on the end before so I was a bit hesitant, but having the flexibility to control the tension is very nice. Looking at the way the clips are designed they won't last forever, but with some proper storage and cleaning they'll get the job done.",4.0
"This is a very solidly built set.  I have used other band sets in the past and they snapped where the band connected to the handle.  The design of these bands are much better and I would imagine it would take a lot more wear than I'm capable of giving them for something to break.  The handles are very nice.  They are a good diameter for gripping purposes.  The door stop mount thing works very well on the top and side of doors.  The comes with one velcro leg strap, but it would be nice to have two, but it works well.  The booklet looks a little dated and shows people doing exercises without safety glasses even thought the booklet states safety glasses should be worn at all times.  I understand from a marketing standpoint it looks odd to have people we safety gear on.  I think an easy way to make the band more useful would be to improve the website to help people select targeted exercises.  Upper and lower body are pretty generic especially when they are followed by non-band tabs.  All in all I have no complaints about the products.  I'd tell anyone looking for bands to give these a shot.  Good price, good product.",4.0
"This makes exercise easy for a lazy person like myself!! I can watch TV and still get an adequate upper body work out.
I have not tried to attach it to a door because I am too lazy.",4.0
"Got these as a Christmas gift a few years ago. Now that I've started doing CrossFit, I use them to work and stretch my shoulders, and also to build up the muscles I'm going to need to do a pull up.
These bands are good quality. All of the seatbelt-material attachments and rings are well constructed. I like how easy it is to add/combine tubes.
I would recommend this product.",4.0
"Good value, good product",4.0
i find the bands to be useful and in good quality,4.0
These resistance bands are very durable and work great. I have used them for several workouts and they offer an ample amount of resistance. Setting them up was very quick and easy and the instruction booklet came with an exercise guide which was nice. I feel very confident that the resistance bands will not snap or come dislodged from the door when using them. Overall this is a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their overall muscle strength.,4.0
This is my third set of this product and I have been happy with the purchase.  Not sure how long other band types last but I'm getting about a year of hard and heavy use out of them.  I'm pretty hard on them so no complaints.,4.0
Nice set. Good amount of resistance..,4.0
"So far these bands are working pretty well for me.  You can get a good resistance workout with them and it is nice to have a variety of weight options. Overall, good for a home workout.",4.0
Good enough for mild exercises.,4.0
"I bought these to replace another set of bands that did not provide enough resistance. They arrived quickly (thanks Amazon) and I got them out and checked them out. They seem better than my old set and offer a greater range of resistance as well.

I use these from the floor (foot capture) and from a wall-mounted anchor. They seem well made and are good enough to supplement my other resistance-training tools.

After a few weeks of use, I can recommend these. I will continue to use them and will update my review if my experience changes.",4.0
Good but not what i was expecting as far as resistance workouts goes but doesn't reflect the product so disregard.,4.0
"Chose because the colors matched his school colors.
He loved it and wears it to schools sporting events with pride",4.0
This is a great quality product for the price. We were able to get the team colors we wanted. My son loves it.,4.0
You cannot beat the price on this product. Most of the competitors wants about 25 to 45 dollars for what it offers. It has the metal clips/hooks instead of the plastic hooks. It works well.,4.0
"Very well priced, took approx. 30 day to receive, so don't purchase if you're in a hurry. Typical over seas quality, but priced right. Great for kids or if you want something inexpensive that probably won't last a lifetime.",4.0
"Great Product so far! I've been using these with the P90X program. I haven't had any issues with bands snapping in my face. The handles offer a great grip and are soft. And probably the best feature of this item are the detachable tubes, it's easy to add extra resistance bands to the handles. I would purchase again in a heartbeat.",4.0
BMP shipped the items out extremely fast which was really nice. The bands are working well so far and seem to be of good build. I do wish that there was another band with more resistance so I wouldn't have to clip so many together. But I love working out with resistance bands compared to dumbbells. We will have to see if the bands hold up for all of my p90 workouts.,4.0
"Overall the performance of the band has been pretty good but the red band seems to not be able to handle the tension I put it through in the p90x program.  However, they have replaced the band once with pretty good customer service and I expect it will be the same again this time.",4.0
Good for the price.,4.0
"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality level of this necklace for my child.  I've seen similar necklaces for much more money, and this one seemed right on par in terms of looks and durability.",4.0
the grandkids loved it so guess it was an okay christmas present for him.  Kids love these things.  I do most of my shopping online so not sure what was available in stores.,4.0
Quick changes keep the workout going.,4.0
They won't replace weights but if you're recovering from an injury or just looking for something more travel friendly these will do the trick for a good price. They quality is better than expected.,4.0
they are exactly what they are and they work.,4.0
I recieved this item very quickly and it was exacpty what I was looking for with linkable bands and quick exchange.  I do wish that the product came with extra handles or at least had it as an extra product you can buy.  The bands are the perfect length and work well for what I am doing.  As long as these bands last 3 months which is about an average of previous bands I have had this is an amazing product for anyone who work out on the go and can not always hit the gym.,4.0
"Very good product and did a very good job of getting me to a level where I can do more with more.  These aren't ""body building"" bands but work well for strength building and toning.  The compact size makes them terrific to take on vacation.",4.0
"I am an active health guru. I wanted to give this product enough usage time before I reviewed it. THEY ARE GREAT!! here is why, unlike most bands I have used in the past, these bands are of great quality. I mean really good quality!! the level of material used is almost military grade (I suggest). The elasticity is sustainable to all types of usage. When I used them for my workouts, these bands stood up to the rough routines I put them through. The handles are heavy duty and the fasteners are well constructed. My experience with other fasteners is that they tear at the joint, and these never budged against tearing. I also used these to train the pitchers in my baseball travel team, they stood up to their usage as well. I recommend these bands to anyone looking for a long lasting product. The pricing is where it should be for this well made bands. (Disclaimer: I was not provided a free product in return for my review. I purchased this product and all my thoughts and opinions expressed herein are my own and not influenced by company or its affiliates in any way)",4.0
"The handles slide around too much, but otherwise good--work well for P90x",4.0
Bought these back in July and have been using them on a regular basis since with no issues.  They provide a nice and easy workout routine that you can do pretty much anywhere as they are very easy to carry with you even when going on vacation.  The main thing to remember is to always check the integrity of the bands before you start your work out as they will wear away over time.,4.0
"Have used the product about a dozen times and works as expected. Cons are - the handles are prone to slipping and the stitching from one of the handles which prevents the plastic grip from slipping came apart during a workout. And not a big deal but the handles are a bit loud, making a squeaking sound.",4.0
Nice alternative to weights. For the money its a good bang for your buck,4.0
While I have only been using for several weeks at home and I am very happy with them.  If you are looking for a set of simple fitness straps for a reason able price I would recommend them.,4.0
Really good for travel or quick home workouts.,4.0
Love them.  The varying tensions make work out awesome. I,4.0
"Probably not fair to dock a star for not using as often as I thought I would, but I will anyway. Good collection of different resistances, comes with booklet of how to use. The attachment to connect to door frame extremely helpful for many exercises. I like to use them when I can't make it to the gym. Leg exercises usually have to be done 1 leg at a time which is less efficient exercise. Seem high quality for a good price.",4.0
Excellent,4.0
Really like this product. Easy to use (after initial process of getting acquainted with it) - even for a senior citizen. Better than hand weights - the size of the handles and the padding on them make them comfortable for my arthritic hands to use. Would definitely recommend this set.,4.0
Well made product.,4.0
"I work out 5 days a week, and I use these 3-4 of those days. I've had these for 5 months, and they've held up quite well. I've even used a tricep rope for doing extensions and they've stood up quite well. I'm not sure how long they'll last, but intend to research and see. I did replace the door anchor with the Bodylastics brand, as it is much better made. I have a picture of my door anchor after 5 months use. The stitching where you put it in the door is starting to fray some. If you buy this set, read the directions. There is an ankle attachment as well. I've never used it, so I don't know how well it holds up, but I will say this; use it on your ankle only. I came across a Facebook post on a fitness page where a guy tied the ankle attachment around his squat rack and did chest flys with it. The attachment broke and hit him in the back. The directions don't mention anything about the ankle attachment, but common sense should kick in and tell you not to use it for chest flys. Anyway, if you buy these, do these things: read the directions, and inspect them before and after each use.",4.0
good product,4.0
Excellent product and well made for the money.,4.0
so far I think they will help with my CP a little at a time. Quality is definitely better than expected,4.0
I have really enjoyed these. They have helped me a lot. I just wish that There was another set of handles. It would be much more helpful to be able to switch with out really having to stop. Is there somewhere that I can order handles only?,4.0
There is a nice variety of resistances and an ok exercise manual. What I do like it the strap that allows you to use doors to do exercises. The one big issue I have is the cheap plastic handles that break very easily. I had to replace both handles.,4.0
Work well,4.0
"The Bands, handles and attachments are of nice quality. Everything received was as I expected. I was however, surprised by the warning in the instructions that say the bands are intended for 90 days of use, and to not, under any circumstance, use them longer than 90 days! I'm not sue if this  is a typical warning for resistance bands or not, but seems to be a disclaimer for the company in case they break after this time period.",4.0
"I used resistance band ropes when I was in physical therapy, so I figured I would get some for home. I really like these. My only complaint is that it can be difficult at times to take the handles off to trade them two other  ropes. And I wish I could secure them on other things rather than just in the door  anchor.",4.0
These replaced my urban fit bands (which after 2 years are still working fine). The black mtn bands handle much more resistance and are fairly easy to clip on/off. The grips are nice and ankle strap is comfortable as long as the velcro is completely wrapped around and not in contact with skin. The black straps attached to the grip and door jam have gotten slightly frayed after two months of moderate use but seem to be holding up very well.,4.0
My prior experience has been with the therabands that come off a roll that the doctor or therapist cut to length.  These are much higher quality.  Very reasonable price.,4.0
"These bands are very easy to travel with, and are handy if you don't have access to a gym.",4.0
Worth the price!,4.0
"Decent bands,  wish they had the resistances written on them though.",4.0
"Great for the price. This was a gift, the only problem is my son is too strong for these but I have a much cheaper version so I suggested he double them over, problem solved!",4.0
"---con---

No beam- / pole- / tree- compatible loop included.  (I use looped paracord prussiked onto the attachment.)

Band's attachment clips have very sharp edges, risk damaging bands.  Also, rough metal burr on one, which I sanded off.  Could shred band-strap.

Included paperwork has contradictory ""lifetime warranty"" and ""do not use more than 90 days"" statements.

---pro---

Portable gym ;  loads of resistance without any bulk weight, just weightless rubber tubes.

Materials seem sturdy enough to be depended on for durability.

The clip-on handles make quick changes of load joyfully easy ;  this also cuts down on equipment size :  need for only two handles.

The handle-bar can slide to adjust on the handle-strap, allowing grip position to vary.

Paperwork has a imaginative variety of exercises, with bands mounted or free.

Length of the bands has clearly been decided upon very carefully.",4.0
"I have been using these bands multiple times a week for the past 6 months and they feel as good as new. There is one set of handles that can be interchanged between all the straps. Although sometimes annoying to switch the handles during a workout, they are very sturdy and the bands don't take up as much room this way. I (early 30s, female) typically use 3 out of the 5 bands on the heavier side, so the lighter weights could work for young kids/teenagers as well. I would need to purchase additional heavier bands if my husband were to work out with them. I'm glad to have the bag to store the straps in. I did have an issue where the hook on the ankle strap broke. However, I called BMP and they were quick to apologize for the inconvenience and are sending a new one with no cost. They were very courteous with no wait time. Otherwise I am very pleased. If it wasn't for the ankle strap issue, I would be giving this product 5 stars. Would recommend to others.",4.0
The work as advertised and even come with a little workout booklet..,4.0
Very good value and works better than thought.,4.0
The product came without instructions.  No white paper.,4.0
I really like this set of bands. The only reason I gave 4* instead of 5 is I wish there was another pair of handles. I start my workout with a lighter band then move to a heavier one but have to move the handles.,4.0
Only had for a week but no complaints yet!,4.0
"I really like these bands, although I think they could be maybe one foot longer.  I'm 5' and could still appreciate a band a bit longer than these.  But otherwise, they are seriously well-made and are obviously of very high quality.  What I like the most is when I'm using them, I feel safe that they won't break and cause me to hurt myself.  That's always a very good thing....LOL",4.0
"We've had these bands for several weeks, and so far they're good.  I'm a little concerned about the rubber deteriorating over time, especially after seeing reviews where people have been hurt when the bands snapped.  It would be a good idea to periodically examine the bands for cracking before use.  Unlike the bands at my gym which are sleeved in cloth, these bands offer no protection if a band should snap.  I wasn't thrilled that the bands share a handle so if you want to change bands, you can't just grab a new band, you have to switch out the handle as well, but this works pretty well if you want to ""stack"" bands to increase the resistance.  All said, it's an affordable, fairly comprehensive set, so for the sleeves and fixed handles, you'd probably pay a good bit more.  You can get a lot done with the bands in this package.",4.0
good quality,4.0
"I have had these for 2 days so this is an intial review. Study constuction, metal clips are solid. Band seem well made also. 5foot8 and lenght is comfortable for curls and shoulder flys. Will update in a few weeks, if no troubles this will get upgraded to a five",4.0
"This has been a godsend!  I usually enjoy going to the gym, but really hate the travel time to get to one, and am usually in traffic by the time I have the time to go.  This really is like having a gym at home - I can do all the exercises that I do normally in a gym.  Great investment!",4.0
Lots of variety.,4.0
Nice set.,4.0
"I purchased this to have an exercise option for times when I was traveling and/or did not have gym access for whatever reason.  It was helpful for that.  Compact.  Easy to use.

Not very challenging if you work out a lot, but it is definitely better than nothing.  Would recommend for the purpose I stated above or for a pure beginner that does not have gym access.",4.0
Bought these bands in order to work on my dislocated shoulder...my home gym was too uncomfortable (old pulleys) to use and the PT gym was only 2x a week. I love these and plan on traveling with a few bands while on vacation. All bands arrived intact.,4.0
The only downside to this set is the limited number of handles. Bought these to use with my personal training clients and it's a bit of a pain to have to switch them every time. Other than that it's great quality and super happy with the price.,4.0
I got what I payed for. Thanks.,4.0
"Can't take dumbbells with you traveling, but you can take these.  My only complaint is that the door hook is not padded and would scratch a door finish.  It might be OK for hotels which have sturdy doors, but probably not for a residential setting if you want to be invited back.",4.0
This product is great.  The bag is a convenient way to store and transport the bands.  Only complaint is that it should come with two sets of handles.  To have that many bands but only one set of handles (so only one person can use them) is a bit silly.  Otherwise it's great!,4.0
"works great, has the option to use over the door, or on a pull-up bar.",4.0
Only gripe are the clips.  Kind of annoying but not bad for the low price.,4.0
As advertised,4.0
Great addition. The ankle straps are soft and the Velcro is strong. Love using these for bicep curls after weights. You can do a lot of different exercises with these bands.,4.0
Bands seem to be very durable and handles and other accessories seem well built too. Be careful to keep good form when switching to these from free weights as they will change the way you do certain exercises.,4.0
Bought these bands for use in a dietary program and they have been excellent after 5 weeks of daily use. No issues and it is nice to be able to take them on the road. If you are a novice like me they are perfect. Doubling bands now and probably will grow out of them fairly soon. The blue band is really too light on resistance to be of much use. Would recommend buying an extra set of handles when you purchase the set.,4.0
"Easy to use and high rating for versatility. The product holds up great during long work out sessions. The fact that the resistance bands are stack-able is awesome. I can set the resistance level between 2-4lbs up to 75lbs. The door anchor and comfortable ankle strap add a lot of variety to my work out that I didn't have before. Hand grips are comfortable as well. Instruction and exercise example booklet are helpful and easy to follow. I wish there would have been exercise examples for the leg muscles, though. However, a quick google search and I was good to go. There were some stray strings on the handles but other than that, there were no issues. I called the owner with a few questions. He was easy to reach both times, kind and professional. Great company and great products. Highly recommend.",4.0
"This is a very well designed system. The handles clip on and off the bands easily. The bands have been sturdy and function every bit as good as any I have seen and/or used in the past 25 years. The design for the strap that jambs into the door to anchor the setup is well designed. I did have a problem with the balls that are sewn into the anchor end breaking. Having used other setups with an anchor strap I am not sure why this one had a bit of a malfunction. Even flattened though it is still anchoring. That is why I didn't give it 5 stars because of the anchor strap.

My use of this system is to maintain as much strength as I can after 37 years of disability caused by a neurological condition.",4.0
I have been using the product for a few months now and have been completely satisfied. This is my first experience using resistance bands and am really happy with the product. I have found it useful when I am too busy to go to the gym and like to use it after a working out as well.,4.0
Great for taking on trips on my motorcycle,4.0
Cords a little on the long side for some exercises.  Attachments are easy and clips are solid.,4.0
"Very useful product. I've incorporated these into my circuit training. Some of them you have to double up to create more resistance, but switching out the bands is very easy.",4.0
"This is exactly the same set of bands used at the clinic where I am getting Physical Therapy, thus it is a perfect tool for continuing my exercises at home.  Very well made and easy to take ""on the road""",4.0
"We ordered these products for our home gym. We don't have much room, so we thought resistance bands would be a great way to go.

The bands and all accessories came exactly as pictured/described. Everything was packaged nicely. We've been using the bands for about 2 months now and really like them. The quality is great, especially for the price. We've been very impressed.",4.0
Wish they labeled resistance values on bands.,4.0
"Solid group of bands.  Very good quality for the price.  The set only comes with one set of grips, so if you want to save time on changing around from certain colors, you may need to order another set of grips.  This is my second set from these folks and they get very good stars for customer service as well.",4.0
"This is my second set of these bands. I purchased the first in 2014 for my wife. She used them off and on for a couple of years (and liked them very much) until one snapped on her mid-workout (leaving a big red mark on her leg). I called BMP for a replacement and received it pretty quickly; however, it wasn't the same product. She didn't like it as much (and another from the original set looked like it was wearing thin) so I purchased another set. She's been using them for a couple months now and likes them. She likes the variety of weights and that you can combine them.

It would be nice if this set came with more than 2 handles so she could switch between weights quickly.",4.0
Met my expectations.,4.0
"Product came on time and was packaged nicely in the carry case.  Came with five bands of five different colors and varying resistance up to 30 lbs.  Also, the exercise booklet which came with this product provides a wide range of exercises for different muscle groups which I am excited about.  One thing I did not realize for some reason is that not all bands have their own handles (just didn't pay attention to the product description or pictures).  A minor inconvenience, but an inconvenience nonetheless.  Another issue is that they are a little light, but because they are stackable, they will serve their purpose well.  Overall, these feel great and are going to be instrumental to my getting a good workout when traveling.",4.0
Works as advertised,4.0
"A lot of pieces = a lot of options = can get cluttered and complicated. I use the red and black bands. I tried contacting the company to get the free orange band that they offer, but I never got a response. Perhaps they will see this review and send me the orange one. I currently use the red and black together. Not sure what the velcro loop is to used for.",4.0
"These are good quality. They won't break and snap you in the face right away, quality set, no complaints",4.0
"First set I had, first use the band snapped and hit my wife in the face.  Contacted amazon for a swap.  Sent replacement free of charge.  Second set we have had no issues with.",4.0
Impressed with the quality of these bands. It was extremely easy to get started and really appreciated the exercise guide that comes along with! Stores away very easily in a tiny zip bag. Really great for getting an excellent workout in without needing to go to the gym.,4.0
Bands anchor is too small to use on bottom of the door.  Makes certain exercises harder such as bicep curls.,4.0
"I've only used the product once so far since I received it, but it is as advertised and does the job. Not what I would expect if I paid a lot more money or was using them at the gym, but for the price they've worked out well. I like the carrying bag too, which makes them easy to travel with.",4.0
"I bought these because of my location, and budget. The bands work perfectly some workouts they completely kick butt... Others like deadlifts I do not feel the burn I think I'm supposed to feel. I could be doing something wrong but for the most part, i enjoy using them. The storage bag zipper broke on the second day sadly",4.0
Good,4.0
"Great set. If you know what you're doing and take care of them they will last you quite a while. Don't overstretch them, if you need more resistance, double or triple up and you'll be good. Don't attach them to anything flimsy that's going to fall over and you'll be happy. Don't think of these as a replacement for free weights but rather as a compliment to them or a safe way to get into working out if you're a beginner. I do wish that the handles were fixed and didn't slide around, but for the price I can't complain much.",4.0
"I bought these and started keeping them in the family room, so that while I am watching tv I will use them. So far it works great. I love how they come in a little bag so that I can keep them nicely hidden in the corner. I have not used the door portion of them yet because I am worried about it scratching up my door.",4.0
Good quality and the manual is easy to follow to figure out the strengths of the bands. But this kit only comes with one set of handles and door strap which means that you either have to readjust between each exercise or do all set for one action in a row. I prefer to mix sets so this is a real hassle for me.,4.0
I've used these bands everyday for about two weeks and am pleased with the quality and versatility.,4.0
I like the handles and the clips are very useful.,4.0
"Great set which is very complete. My only complaint is that it's just a little heavy. I bought these because I wanted to be able to work out while I travel but I've found that I just can't justify the weight, so I've switched to carrying some of the more standard resistance bands instead.",4.0
"When my one and only resistance band broke (imagine getting snapped by a rubber band multiplied by a whole lot!) I turned to Amazon to replace it.  I was delighted to see that the technology has come a long way with band sets that can be used together to form a whole wide range of resistance.  I read several reviews here on Amazon and concluded that the Black Mountain product was the best value.  Having used this product for a few weeks now, I can report that I'm really happy with my purchase.  The bands are of high quality with carabiner clips that give solid connection to the handles.  The handles are padded with foam and feel good in my hands.  I was skeptical of how the door-mount would perform but after a recent business trip hotel stay I can say that it worked flawlessly.  Very happy with my purchase and thinking about buying a second set so I can go through my work-out routine without having to change bands between exercises!",4.0
"These resistance bands do their job very well and seem to be of good quality.  I have been using the green band predominantly for the last month, but it is nice to have the flexibility to vary the bands so easily.  I enjoy the handles provided with the set.  The handles are durable and have better grip than some other resistance bands I have used.

The whole package is nice, including: the workout recommendations and extra pieces of equipment to perform the other exercises.  The carrying case is also a nice bonus, especially if you're like me and do not have a place to put the extra bands, so it is nice to keep them all together.  Overall,  I was very pleased with these resistance bands and they give the ones at my gym a run for their money.",4.0
super handy for workouts at home,4.0
"Very good quality so far, especially the hardware portion. I've used tubing before and it eventually deteriorated so it should be examined before use for any signs of wear. It seems the only way to do anchored two handed exercise is with the door anchor. I would have liked to have seen a piece of looped webbing to use for attaching to a pole. As someone else mentioned, the lighter bands are not really much use for anyone who is in decent shape.(other than for stacking with the heavier bands).",4.0
Black Mountain Resistance Bands have been a great addition to my exercise regimen. Set provides all of the necessary equipment to attain desired workout and results. Moving to these bands has allowed me to jettison my bulky weight training tower giving me more room in my basement. Bands have held up very well so far and seem to be of solid construction and quality. I would definitely recommend.,4.0
I've only had these a couple of days but so far I'm happy with my decision to purchase them. I'm not much for working out so I wanted something I could ease into. The included instructions on basic exercises is easy to understand. I'm only using the lightest resistance so I have plenty of room to grow.,4.0
Quick delivery and quality product.,4.0
I enjoyed my bands very well put together.,4.0
So far so good.  I've had these for about a month and incorporate them with my 7-minute app workout.  The only negative comment I have is the metal clips where they attach to themselves are a little sharp and if you aren't careful you could cut yourself.  Besides that everything seems to be made well and works as expected.  I have seen pictures of people posting bands that have broken so I will say that's always in the back of my mind when using these but so far I've been using the Black and Red bands and have been OK.,4.0
Great pack. This is my second set and the first one I gave it away. Really handy when travelling to keep up with your routine. Would be nice to have 2 of the door jammers. Also would be nice to have a 1 smaller band for leg exercises or in cramped places (did I say Japan?).,4.0
"Don't expect it as the perfect workout set, but it is of good quality given it's price. I'll say this is probably the top resistance band you can get at this price level. I have had this product for a month now, and it works pretty well for me.",4.0
Bands are really well made and easy to use. We bought two sets and find that it is easy to carry the second set on trips. The only downside for us is the color coding is different for these bands versus the bands we have been given at two different physical therapy centers.,4.0
"A few years ago I tore a tendon in my shoulder. I was in physical Therapy for 6 months. about half of my exercises were resistance bands. They were basically strips of latex in different colors for various strengths. They did work and I trained my muscles to be able to function without that one end tendon. Now I wanted to get some new ones to continue exercising mainly in the winter as I am very active the rest of the year. My trainer form blue cross showed me some models out there that were endorsed by Blue Cross. I noticed he used these from Black Mountain that were not on the list. He explained that he was on a budget and the latex tubes are all fairly equal. I did some research and they all last about a year if used every other day. I bought them and they are so much better than I was expecting.

I do get a kick out of the reviews that say this $19.99 is not as nice as the $90 sets. Really? Oh well. They are very sturdy and work perfect for me. I vary my routine but keep the ones going for my shoulder. If you are like me and just need some extra exercise in the winter, I recommend this set.

Like all makes of these check for wear or cracks before starting your routine. I saw one review saying to add Vaseline to make them last longer. I would not do that since it could cause them to slip out of the door jam or even have a chemical reaction. Keep moving. :)",4.0
"Good product. Came with everything stated and the instruction booklet had good suggestions for some exercises. The reason I gave 4 instead of 5 starts is that there is no indication on the bands themselves for how much resistance they apply. The booklet explains which is which and you can kind of tell by the diameter of the band itself, but some type of brief indication on the band would be appreciated. Overall exactly what I wanted.",4.0
Bought for my son fwho's a Personal Trainer for Christmas. Thought he can use this. He likes it.,4.0
Works as designed and shipped quickly.,4.0
"Purchased these primarily for my wife to use. I ran them through the paces of doing some HIIT workouts, ranging from doing curls, lateral raises, and lunges to using them for unilateral work. The quality is good and I think this is a great starter set with a good reputation from Black Mountain. I like the fact that you can stack bands to increase resistance and that they are build on clips. The carry bag is pretty flimsy, so don't expect to use this for more than a stuff sack. Mine had the zipper break the second time I used it. Handles are good quality and their is a nice instruction sheet and reference guide for resistance. Black Mountain does offer a more robust set of bands, which I would recommend if you are an avid fitness person. I am and I abuse my gear. I will need the upgrade! This is also a lower price than I paid, so it's a better deal financially! Regardless, good product and the only change I would make is a better carry sack for taking these on the road.",4.0
Works well.,4.0
"The bands are good, but we had to replace the handles. Worth investing in something more ergonomic and substantial.",4.0
nice,4.0
Great resistance bands! Variety of resistance for myself and my husband to use.,4.0
"As a prior owner of multiple fitness clubs, I've purchased hundreds of fitness bands over the years. The ones from Black Mountain are commercial-grade quality and true to their listed resistance levels. I appreciate the fact that it's easy to combine multiple bands to enable an even wider range of levels. The handles feel a bit plastic-y and are constructed with less quality than the balance of the set. The door anchor is solid with no movement which allows full-body extension with my sets. When using the anchor, my only concern is the potential for door scratches from the metal attachment loops on the bands themselves when I switch between bands.",4.0
"Used in various combinations 3+ times each week since purchased in July 2014, I have been overall happy with this set.  The carabiners and eyes are substantial, easily accommodating two and even three bands.  Construction at critical stress points gives confidence that the bands won't snap.  The hand pieces are comfortable even without gloves and have stood up well.  I use the door anchor underneath a floor frame member on my weight machine, because it doesn't hold reliably underneath a standard door.  I will replace these now because the lighter resistance bands are showing signs of detaching.",4.0
Working fine.  Use them often.  A couple clasps are hard to open,4.0
"Solid construction, sturdy connectors, comfortable handles. I'm not sure the color sequence of easy to hard aligns with the industry standards, and it's not intuitive. [Red harder than black? Green harder than blue?] They don't seem lifetime quality, but a really good value for the price.",4.0
"Still using these a year later and they are really great. The handles are soft foam and everything feels really sturdy and well built.

The only gripe I have is the handles and straps rub against my wrists in certain movements (like hammer curls), so just be aware of that. Nothing replaces a good dumbbell, but these come close. Would recommend.",4.0
"To tell the truth I haven't used these as much as I had intended to. They are good quality and nicely made. The bag is super handy too, so you don't have bands laying everywhere!!",4.0
"These bands are a great addition to my home gym equipment. This is my second set and i am happy with the way they work in place of a cable machine. My first set lasted for a good 4 years before I wore them out. As for portability they work pretty well also, taking up just slightly more space than my toiletries.",4.0
"I have been using these for over a month now and really like them.  No breakage and they feel real solid.  The only thing that I would like to do or see them sell is a d-ring that can be permanently installed on a door frame.  It gets really old doing one exercise and then having to open up the door slide the ring up the jam and then close the door again and then repeat for the next one.  I would like to just have 3 d-rings where you can clip to for a quick change.  Outside of that, the handles are soft and seem strong enough to last at least a year of constant use.  The bands also look like they will hold up and not break.  I have purchased other types that snapped within the year.  These look much better made than those.",4.0
"Good product, good bands, easy to use and is definitely better than all the wasted time driving to and waiting at the gym. The leg strap did, however, break pretty quickly. Awesome customer support though.",4.0
"Looks just fine, as presented online at Amazon.com",4.0
accurate description,4.0
Good. Prefer this to weights when I have the time. I might purchase additional handles and ankle straps if offered so I do not need to change them between exercises.,4.0
"Product shipped fast as promised.  The quality is much better than my old resistance band set, and the karabiners make switching bands fast and easy.  The only thing I did not like is I need to double up the bands to get enough resistance for some exercises.",4.0
Purchased as a gift for my wife. We can workout together easily stacking bands to change resistance.  I cant speak to the life span of the product as we just started using them.,4.0
"This is a huge help recovering from my shoulder surgery and it supplements the dumbbells, by simulating cable exercises.",4.0
"So far the bands have been great. Been using a few times for a couple weeks and no problems. Quality and durability seem fine and its been easy to get quick work outs in.

UPDATE: After some more uses since original review, i've noticed the color of the red band has been getting lighter in areas and some of the fibers on the handles are splitting. otherwise it still seems to function as intended.",4.0
Great set but would be convenient if more than 2 handles were included.,4.0
Really helpful!,4.0
good good.,4.0
"Overall, I like the product, for it does what it is supposed to do.  I enjoy the weights being color coded and it's very durable, however, needs a bit more length to them as it is difficult to perform some pilates moves with it.  I would also recommend getting a second set of handles.",4.0
Love it.  Lightweight,4.0
I like it,4.0
I like them. I have bought others and these seem to be pretty nice. Price is right as well. I bought this set to use in my office at work. These have meet my expectations. No complaints.,4.0
"Nice little setup for in-home use.  Especially if you have to go somewhere and be away from the gym for a few days.  These aren't going to make you big and you won't make a lot of gains using only rubber bands, but it's a good way to supplement your workout at home or wherever.",4.0
"I love these bands. They are very versatile and allow me to tailor my workouts for most muscle groups. With dumbbells I'm limited to the number of exercises I can do and muscles I can target. With these bands I can work my muscles form any angle. Highly recommend it!!!

I've been using them for 1 year now (about 3 times a week) and have only slightly lost their tightness. I may be buying another set in the next few months for other family members.",4.0
i use these to help keep my legs and knees moving. I have arthritis and using these to get stronger has helped me. This is my 2nd set as I stupidly left my old ones at a hotel.,4.0
"I purchased these bands about 4 years ago because I wanted something lightweight, durable, and versatile to use both at home and on the road when I traveled for work. They've held up remarkably well over the years, even as I've had them stored for long periods of time in various parts of my house (attic/basement/laundry room/etc), with no discernable wear on the rubber or the attaching clips.

That's not to say that they've been 100% invincible; several of the bands showed signs of wear (outer rubber layers ""chipping"" or crumbling away along with small hairline rips). Howeover, B.M.P. has always promptly replaced them at no cost to me. That alone gives me the confidence and satisfaction to recommend these strongly to anyone considering them. I'm sure you'll be as pleased as I am!",4.0
perfect for working out in the house,4.0
"Portable way to get more than body weight in as a traveling musician. They can get a bit cumbersome if you are doing quick changes but that's the nature of it. Make sure you have a really solid door to do them in, or you'll have to build something.",4.0
"Well made, solid product. enjoying being able to workout in the office",4.0
"My fault that I did not realize that these bands are intended for use primarily attached to a doorway or wall.  My house is a little congested, but I will find a way.  They appear to be very well made of good quality materials.  About the time I ordered these I had to have surgery on one wrist, so any of this type of activity must necessarily be a bit lop-sided for awhile, but I look forward to when I will be able to use them.",4.0
"Love them..only
Thing is that one of the handles broke two weeks later..but I manage without it",4.0
Fantastic and great idea to use it with the door,4.0
"I got these specifically to use while traveling.  I've been using them for a month now and I am pleased.  Construction seems good, I find the handles comfortable, and the attachment for using in the door frame is very good to have.  I haven't used them for leg exercises, preferring body weight exercises for that, so I can't comment on the leg attachment.  I am only using the first two bands right now, which means to me this set will work for me for quite a while yet.  When not traveling I prefer to go to the gym for the social aspect, but when time is short I can use the bands at home so I don't miss a workout.  Worked together with a stationary bike or elliptical for cardio and you have an exercise set up that takes minimal room.",4.0
"Just what I wanted, packaged well, great product, fast shipping.",4.0
"I don't think they can replace free weights if your really into building serious strength. I'm no expert by far but i'd say if you have limited access to free weights and machines,these really can help. What's good about these,is that they really hit the to of the range of motion hard,on full contraction. They are weak however at the start of the range of motion so you have to find that balance of how many bands to add together and how far to stretch them out,to start the exercise. Also what angle to keep them at for optimal results.",4.0
These bands are the real deal. They work and you do feel the burn after use. I will be buying more bands.,4.0
"Bought 2 month ago and totally happy. Looked for an easy to use solution to help me to recover from misdiagnosed Candida.  The only reason I am giving 4 stars, I wish to have second set of handles as a standard part of the delivery.",4.0
This is a great product for anybody who wants to workout at home (if you don't make it to gym sometimes due to busy schedule). Been using it from last 20 days. Only suggestion is if they can provide a large spring snap hook which can be used with ankle strap. Ankle strap can be used on any pole in house with different positions.,4.0
"Nice variety of parts here. I replaced the handles with ones that are more heavy duty, but the bands and anchors are good.

Thinking about getting a second set so I can have more of the heavier bands. I like how you can combine different colors to get just about any weight.",4.0
They do the job.,4.0
"When you can't get to a gym, when you're traveling, or just when you want to change your workout routine these bands are great. I've found that the very light resistance bands are best when used combined (stacked) as they offer little resistance used alone. That said, they are lightweight and portable, and they're effective and give the user a nearly unlimited number of exercises for all muscle groups. These Black Mountain resistance bands are a versatile and very affordable way to keep in shape.",4.0
"very easy to adjust the amount of weight, bands can be stacked to increase overall resistance. Very portable.",4.0
"I bought these since I travel quite a bit and these are an excellent stopgap measure during those times.
Pro: weigh almost nothing, easy to carry, high quality construction.
Con: the booklet has less exercises than online.  I wish there's a 2nd door anchor.",4.0
"Very nice set of portable exercise equipment. Would buy again.

I have had problems where a gym is not accessible and I was in the process of moving, so a gym membership wasn't rational.  These did the trick for helping me stay in shape and I still have these and use them every week.

Quality of the bands themselves are pretty hefty - expect them to last you a long time and also the ability to attach multiple bands to the handles helps a ton. The process is a bit tedious to keep adding more bands but it definitely helps increase the difficulty. Just don't expect to gain a lot of mass using resistance bands as your primary equipment. It's good for toning and increasing body strength though.

Some cons I have with the equipment is the door anchors and leg straps. For the door anchor there's only one and same with the leg anchor. Also the leg anchor is hard to get tight on a smaller leg and is pretty uncomfortable (not really cushioned).

The door anchor is pretty good but the problem is that sometimes it WILL scratch your doors. This is due to the material used. Other door anchors that I have purchased use a heavy foam material to protect your doors. So take caution when using the anchor.

Overall it includes a variety of bands and one door anchor and leg band. Pretty good set of equipment to use for everyday use.",4.0
Great product!,4.0
"I bought these for physical therapy on a problem shoulder. Overall, I like the quality of these bands and found them to be a good value. I took off a star because almost all the clips on the ends of each band were rusted around the hinge fresh out of the box from Amazon. Most still work well enough, but some of them are so rusted that the clip is hard to detach/attach to the handle.

I called Black Mountain customer service and told them the problem, and the representative was very friendly and said they'll send me a new set, and they did. My new set arrived a few days later. Unfortunately, even this new set has rusty clip hinges. There is obviously a quality control problem with these clips. But, aside from that, I am enjoying the bands, and they are helping with my shoulder.

For reference, I am petite at 5'0"" and I haven't found the length of these to be an issue for my purposes.",4.0
"Bands look to be in good condition. I am 5'7 and 130 pounds, I have not applied much force to the bands but they seem to be durable and also accommodate to my height which is a plus. Id surely  recommend for a good batch to have as an alternative workout.",4.0
shipped fast and nice set of bands,4.0
Good quality and really easy to bring with you while traveling.  Wish it came with heavier weight bands but overall recommend.,4.0
"I've only been using this set about a month. So far I'm very happy with it. I'm not a gym person, but I wanted a way to tone up at home. Did not want some bulky machine taking up space. This set fit the bill. I like how easy it is to increase resistance by combining bands. The accessories included allow for a wide range of exercises. The bands seem to be well made and the Lifetime warranty is a plus.",4.0
Very Good !!,4.0
Good work out.,4.0
Haven't used them a lot.  They have a small pamphlet with exercises but most are for hanging them from the door and I haven't ventured that far.  I need to look for exercises for seniors. I don't want to hurt myself.,4.0
Good product complete with illustrations on how to use it. The door attachments must be explained or illustrated.,4.0
Good quality. They have been used daily and I have not had any issues with them. Good for rehab.,4.0
"This product is great.  Watching p90x videos, I got inspired to purchase bands of my own.  It's very convenient that the product also comes with instructions along with several exercises with images demonstrating them.  As a first time band user, I was glad this product came with instructions.  The anchor seems pretty solidly made and I had no idea placing it into your door hinge would lock the band.  I weigh 160lbs and performed their exercises using the red band with no issues.  Another nice thing is that the holes for the handles are large enough for you to stack the bands if the 25-30lb weight range isn't doing the trick for you.  For this price, the product is a steal!  My only gripe is that I wish there was some sort of writing on each band to indicate it's weight.  Sucks having to refer to the instructions to determine the weight of each band.  Other than that, the product seems solid!",4.0
I work over the road as a locomotive engineer. Staying across the road doesn't always allow me to workout like I would like. This has been a wonderful kit to bring with me for those stays. I use them at home when I'm feeling like I don't want to workout around other people. The band's seem to be quality along with the metal d rings and carabiners. Also included is a pamphlet of the resistance of each band and a handful of workouts.,4.0
"These bands are VERY good quality. There are so many uses for resistance bands - strength building, flexibility, among others. Something that really sold me on this particular brand was the toggle that allows you to safely anchor the band in a closed door. This allows for a wider variety of exercises as well as using a greater range of motion. Why did it lose one star? It would make my workout much smoother if there was at least one more pair of handles so as to not have to stop and change them out when going heavier or lighter. Other than that, these are the best quality bands I have used outside of the gym!",4.0
"Very nice, heavy duty, plenty of choice for different weights for different exercises. I had watched YouTube videos of this Black Mountain set before ordering and the product is just as shown in the videos! Resistance Bands are great for a quick workout before getting dressed for work. Haven't been on vacation this year but plan to take the set with me when I go!",4.0
great for traveling to see clients.,4.0
Cool bands.  Got two sets to add a little resistance to body weight movements.,4.0
Great item for a great price...comes with all items shown and a exercise book.,4.0
"Use: I've been using these things 6 days a week for 5 weeks now. I'm a veteran iron-lifter so I've put quite a bit of stress on these things. Although I did have to back off at one point because the door frame started to creek AND I'm still a little scared of one of these snapping and blinding me or ruining my pretty face :p (because that's what I've read from other reviews on bands).

Bands: Work great. Haven't seen any damage. Being new to bands, the workouts are great and something different. Prolonged tension throughout the entire set really puts a burn on the muscles.

Straps: I like the variety, however the stitching on the leg strap started coming undone after 2 weeks. I took it in to a tailor and got it re-enforced for $5, and now it's perfect. The door anchor has just started coming undone slightly and I might have to go back to the tailor. The strap also does leave black scuffs on the door frame but it looks like it could come off with a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser.

Overall: I'd say for the price, they're 4.5-star awesome! Could have skipped getting that gym membership.",4.0
They quality seems pretty good I've used them a few times and work great.,4.0
Product received on time with a great price.  I've only used the band set a few times and so far it meets my needs.,4.0
I love this set it has many different bands for different resistance and its easy to use and has comfortable grip handles,4.0
never use. I'm lazy. hahahaha. probably good.,4.0
Great product! These bands were exactly what I needed for working out.,4.0
My daughter loves this set.  Perfect for increasing her dance flexability.  It would have been great if it had 2 ankle straps,4.0
Great variety of bands.,4.0
"Bought these to help ease back into working out after a bad back injury.  Great versatile product, best band set I've used.  The bands it comes with are a bit on the light side but more are offered.  Would recommend to people wanting to rehab injuries or for people wanting to ease into exercise at home.",4.0
"Arrived promptly and item was as described. I have used this product previously with a personal trainer, and my experience with it was great! The bands are an exceptional tool for strength training, and a great alternative to using traditional weights. We used them at an outdoor exercise area, and were able to tailor workout for arms, legs, back and core. The difference in pounds per band (when exercising) is noticeable and challenging. And the ability to stack the bands is great because if you are increasing in strength, but can't quite make it to the next band up, you can utilize the other bands to get a resistance that's workable for you. Only reason why I deducted one star was because some of the bands deteriorated after 6 months of use. Granted they were my trainer's set of bands, so they were probably getting used a lot more. Hopefully this set I ordered will have better durability. Overall, I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys strength training.",4.0
I bought these to go with a P90X-style workout.  I was surprised by how much resistance they provided!  Switching bands during the workout is pretty simple with the carbinar connections.  Very satisfied with this purchase.,4.0
"Great price on ""prime day"". Happy. Each tubular band comes with 2 snap hooks, with sharp edges (as a cheap snap hook has). Good quality, strong. Useful door hingue. Lenght is OK, for my exercise, but maybe short for some exercises presing it down to the floor. Better ask an expert to select the best exercises for you and don't follow the suggested exercises blindly.",4.0
Seem durable. Nice set. Easy to use and combine for added resistance.,4.0
"My husband and I decided to get some exercise equipment and workout at home instead of going to the gym.  My husband uses bands every other day for rows, chest press, chest flys, and sidesteps with them.  These bands are highly adaptable, with five different bands/resistance, two handles, one ankle strap, one door anchor, and a storage bag.

I believe these bands are a good basic kit that would work well for many people.  Those who are muscular may be limited with some exercises as they may not be enough resistance. These are easy to use and easy to modify.  I also like that the storage bag is roomy enough that you don't have to cram everything in there.  We haven't had any problems with faulty equipment or anything breaking.  All in all, a good addition for an exercise regimen.",4.0
"The bands are good quality and looks well put together, only used it a few times so far but they work great
The thick cloth material handles are sturdy and look like they will hold up
The black bag it came with is the perfect size for everything to carry around",4.0
Instructions .could be a little clearer,4.0
Great variety of straps.,4.0
"Funny how I used to turn up my nose at these things because I was a ""weightlifter"" and I just couldn't see how these could possibly  give you a workout...but for explosive work, (jumping, etc ) stability and core, these things rock. They will never replace weights completely, but they have utility and merit. Plus I took them on a trip, was able to get in workouts in my hotel room, and they weigh next to nothing and take up very little space in the suitcase.",4.0
Nice way to have an inexpensive home workout capability. Clips on ends of bands are big and bulky which means they are sturdy but they take a lot of room. It would be nice to have more anchoring options too. The door anchor is not that convenient.,4.0
These are ok if you are traveling or in a place where you can not hit the gym. I do wish they came with an option of putting around a pole. You must have a door for these. But does work.,4.0
"The husband and I have been using these for a month now and they are holding up well.  Easy to use and the straps are strong.  I took off one star for the carabiner-style clips that attach the band to the handles.  They have sharp metal bits around the hinge area and anywhere the metal is cut - as if they weren't polished or finished properly.  They cut my finger tips every time I change bands and have to be careful not to touch anywhere near the cut metal.  I imagine if they used better quality carabiners, the price would go up dramatically since the metal is probably the most expensive component of this set, so for what it is, I'm pleased with this brand.  It's a good value for everything you get.",4.0
"Product is very good. Clips are easy to use and feel sturdy, attachment points are well made.  Using the door as an anchor is not the most reassuring thing, but there aren't other good options without gym level equipment or the ability to plant an anchor in your wall.

to address some of the comments about how easily it comes out of the door, I honestly believe my door will give way before the anchor would slip through or the connection points would fail.

Overall the product seems to perform as intended, and provide a good variety of resistances to work out with.

If anything unfortunate happens I shall return to this review and hopefully update it.  But, if there are no further items here from me, be assured the product works well!",4.0
"I purchased these as a Plan B for exercise while traveling, for my off days from yoga, and a nice outdoor stretch/workout on the weekends. I've only used it a couple times, but it seems really sturdy and haven't had any issues. The door anchor works great too! My only complaint is the straps do rub on your arms when doing certain resistance exercises. For example, while standing on the band and doing bicep curls, the straps rub on the forearms, but It's not too terrible.",4.0
These are great and I really like the attachment for doing pull-ups and working lats. When I travel not too many hotel gyms have a pull-up bar.,4.0
"Convenient storage in the bag it comes with. Seems to be made with good quality, overall satisfied with this purchase.",4.0
"Great for home use and conditioning. Equipment is shipped in a compact carrying case and levels of resistance are easily switchable.
Note: Anchor should be used on hinged side",4.0
working out well for me so far,4.0
"Great quality for the price and super easy to use at home and on the go. I do recommend buying a separate door anchor because the one included is too small and can slide right through my door, which could be dangerous. Overall, happy with my purchase!",4.0
Its good. would of like if it had two ankle bands instead of one.,4.0
"Have used 4-5 times in workouts and what I like most are the number of bands, and the fact that there are some easy baby level bands in there for wimps like me.  Those exercises I tried and failed at because the bands were stronger than an ox and my noodle arms are not ox like at all...well, the little yellow and blue guys in this pack are FANTASTIC.  I can work out with the big boys now.  Not five stars since don't know how hold up over long time, but that's a minor thing, and shouldn't deter you from dropping the very minimal amount of $ they charge for these.  Like the carabeeners since it makes combining the bands easy.  I even used handles from another set - just clipped them on and done.  Don't over think this - it's got a billion and one positive ratings, and if you are starting out like me, this has enough resistance to get you kicked off.",4.0
"My physical therapist gave me stretch bands to use at home to exercise my neck muscles. The bands would break and I could not do the exercises. Now, I can do my exercises, along with others with the direction book.",4.0
Overall these bands work for me. Slightly short for some exercises. Functional and very travel friendly. One end of the lightest band shows signs of fraying but is not yet affecting the use of the band. We'll have to wait and see how it holds up. Overall good product for price.,4.0
"Now I have only used these bands a few times since receiving them so I won't be discussing durability until a later date.
 I'm currently using these with the p90 system.
 They are well made, no nasty smell to them like cheaper products. Length is perfect for me at 5'9 with plenty of room for adjustment. The accessories also appear of good quality but the door attachment could have been done a bit better. It's not junk or anything I just don't care for this type myself. Handles are beefy and comfortable. Bands themselves come with carabiners attached which makes swapping bands a breeze.
 Overall I would definitely recommend these resistance bands. I will be updating this review as time passes to discuss durability.",4.0
"Stretchy, bandy, fitnessy goodness right here.",4.0
Bands are nice and well made. The connections at the ends rub the skin pretty hard during some of the exercises.,4.0
I was looking for some resistance bands to supplement my work out weather at home or out and about! This is a great compact package that I can take anywhere and work out! I throw it over my pull-up bar and around some post at home and get creative using it at the park! Easy to change resistance but you gotta get use to it,4.0
"Bought these for my wife for when we are doing our BeachBody workouts. The set is exactly as described and easy to use. Pros and cons below:

Pros:
-Easy to clip onto handles to use
-light weight
-varying strengths so you can go up or down depending on your strength or training.
-Comes with all the parts you would need to do almost all exercises what bands are used with

Cons:
-light weight is also a con since they seem like they can break easily that I'm worried about stretching them out to their fullest.
-There is no way these resemble the weights described in the manual. They are definitely lighter and buy enough that my wife could easily notice it

Takeaways:
If someone is just starting to work out and needs bands this is a good set to begin with. I don't see it growing with a person though since they do seem cheaply made that they would break a lot of use. Even though they do not resemble the weight stated it is enough for someone to work their strength up. If you are a person that has been exercising for a while I would suggest a different set because you would most likely break them after some use.",4.0
"These work well and the variety is nice. Color coding helps to separate the different resistances, but these would really be helpful if the resistance was printed on the clip holder. Because of this I took one star since I have to write them on there myself and other similar products have this feature. I chose this over other options since it was multiple bands in one package and being able to clip on different attachments has been useful.",4.0
"Great way to exercise. Gives me freedom from the gym. The resistance of the bands could be higher. But, these give me a great workout and use them consistently. I can feel myself getting stronger and in better shape.",4.0
"I love these bands and use them a lot. I like that they are always close by and out of the way when not needed.

When I bought them the company offered me a free orange band for a review. This whole free products for reviews will be amazon's undoing.  I don't know why they would stoop to such a trick, when these bands are great. They certainly seem sturdy.

I only wish that I could find a shorter band, maybe half as long.  When I try to grip it so the band is shorter the lugs flail me. Or if I wrap it around my hand a couple of times to shorten the band it pinches my hand.  It is not a big deal. These bands are still perfect for most of my exercises but my instruction book shows exercises with the other kind of bands.

I am going to order their Black Mountain Products Therapy Exercise Bands with Resistance Band Carrying Case, Door Anchor and Starter Guide, then I'll have both kinds of bands, and if I find a shorter band that will hook up to the handles, then I'll be a happier camper.",4.0
Durable and heavy duty. Great for working with multiple strength bands. Did not work well with certain workout requiring you to wrap around your feet multiple times as the bands are not long enough. The door way function is great and works!,4.0
Not as good as they made it out to be. The product is just okay,4.0
Delivered promptly in good order.  Have used the system for a week with good preliminary results. There are many exercises available in the manual and online.  It seems to be a very good system that provides a decent and strenuous workout depending upon the level of resistance and number of repetitions.  Highly recommended.,4.0
great product- well made-,4.0
Nicely packaged and variance in weighted bands.,4.0
Everything I wanted with all accessories,4.0
Good quality!,4.0
great quality.,4.0
"Its solid quality. Have been using them for over a month and they have held well. The Bodylastics, which I have used for last 4 years seem better built and heavier. But It may just be difference in the way they are built and not a reflection of their performance or durability.",4.0
These are good strong bands. Other bands I bought prior to this set had me uncomfortable because they felt like they could snap but not this set. Everything about this set seems sturdy and secure. The carrying case makes them easy to travel with and allows you to get a resistance workout where ever you go.,4.0
"I've had my bands for a couple weeks now and I must say, they are super legit. When I saw the price I was skeptic about the quality but since they are lifetime guaranteed I figured why not. I'm glad I purchased them. I've put them to the test and the quality is superb. They are a must have.",4.0
great option for traveling and still have exercise,4.0
"This is a good quality product.  Keep in mind, this set is for the lower strength category.  I am a big believer in the application of resistance bands as you can get a decent total body workout.",4.0
Exactly as advertized,4.0
Bands work pretty well.,4.0
"I bought this a few weeks ago and it's been great to use.  I used to own a Weider X Factor which weighed over 50 pounds, stood 7 feet tall, took up a lot of room and costs ~$300.  I can do virtually everything with BMP's bands that I could with the X Factor (except pull-ups) for a fraction of the price!  Easy to set-up and change, and obviously very portable! I'll probably give it a 5 stars after I've had more time to use it.",4.0
Does the job as was described!,4.0
Nice set of bands with a good range of resistance. A second set of handles included in the set would make it 5 stars. I didn't think I would need a second set but I am finding that I have to switch resistance levels during the workout for different moves and it would be easier to just have two bands ready to go.,4.0
"Great product!

Very sturdy. Reliable. Handles do not cut in to my hands. Enforced D-rings are a big plus!
Highly recommended",4.0
A little awkward at first.  Then good,4.0
This resistance band set has been great for me. Construction is solid and I like being able to stack the different bands for various resistance combos. The included door hook is nice as it allows me to do a lot of the exercises I bought these for. Price is pretty good for all you get too. Overall i've been satisfied with the included bands and will probably purchase more bands in the future.,4.0
"We love the product but we want to buy more accessories for it, like the extra hand grip attachments. Can we buy them separately.  We broke one of them!",4.0
The are well made and sturdy. Very pleased with them.,4.0
They work well but one has a slight rip in it but since they are guaranteed for life I should be good.,4.0
"Product was what I expected to get. The small carabiners have very sharp edges, which should have been buffed during manufacture.",4.0
"Not enough handles, and are expensive when you buy them separately; live and learn. Otherwise, tubes work well.",4.0
Good product,4.0
"Overall great product set, accurate to descriptions and usable. Only minor complain is the lower weight bands which are mostly unused and it would have been better if they provided more heavier bands, but you can always buy additional to add to the set.",4.0
"I love the cables for travelling! They're so convenient, and the handles are pretty durable and comfortable to hold. I just wish the bag were better quality; it didn't take long for it to start unravelling.",4.0
"Easy mounting to the door. Great for quick workouts. Easy putting away and strong enough for any weight or size. I'm 120 pounds and my husband is 210 pounds and it works great for both of us. PLEASE make sure you are putting it in a secure spot on the door, if not placed correctly it will come out and pop you.",4.0
"been waiting for these cheap little things to break for years now ...but I'm still using them . I frayed the red one within the first week of use , and the door holder thingy frays the rest all the time , but again they're still working fine . great starter set , travels well and cheap .",4.0
"AWESOME!  Only 4 stars because that door stopper, doesn't work that great.",4.0
good,4.0
Good quality and easy to use. A gym in a bag!,4.0

These have come in handy when I can't make it to the gym. I would really like to see a way for BM to label them so it would be easy to know the tension without having to stop and look it up. The price is right.,4.0
Not bad but the finger bands are hard to get through the ball.,4.0
Very nice set of bands.,4.0
