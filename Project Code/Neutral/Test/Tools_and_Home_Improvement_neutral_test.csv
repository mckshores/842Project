"If you are replacing an existing water heater, pay attention:
This model comes equipped with 1/2"" NPST (straight thread) connections, which are typical for shut off valves you would find under a sink, and are designed to be used with flexible hookup hoses which have a rubber gasket for sealing. Traditional tank style water heaters use 3/4"" NPT (tapered thread) connectors. The problem is bridging these incompatible thread types without a leak.
If you call SioGreen support, they will tell you to use brass 1/2"" female NTP to 3/4"" male NTP adaptors. This will work on the inlet side, because the plastic nipple sticking out of the water heater is soft, and will conform to the tapered thread of the adaptor. On the outlet side you must connect the supplied stainless steel flow control valve to the water heater outlet. When you then try to thread on the brass adaptor (tapered threads) to the stainless steel flow control valve (straight threads), it will start binding at about 1/3 of a turn. After futzing with this for a couple of hours, I was finally able to get a good seal by using lots of teflon tape and severely over-tightening the adaptor.
There should be an easier solution than this.

Follow up - I've got it installed and working without leaks. It seems sufficient for a bathroom sink or shower, if you take miserly showers. Don't expect to fill a bathtub with this thing.  While 240v / 30A wiring is typical for a tank heater, it is simply not enough power for a tankless if you want to fill a bathtub.",2.0
Not good for only hot water heater for house. Still have problems with correct water pressure . I would use for a second water heater off a main hot water heater maybe that will be better fit.,2.0
"I bought this unit for a trailer in New Jersey. I was unable to achieve a temperature above 34c (93F) with a decent water flow. However, If I reduced the flow, using the supplied valve, I was able to achieve a higher temperature. This was in the bathroom faucet just 5 feet from the heater. My conclusion is that it is not acceptable for this climate.",2.0
"This is more like a pencil drawing than a coloring book. It is more like a book of pictures. Due to all of the spaces that the artist dictates will be black, you don't have much room to color. The paper quality is good, but as far as this being a coloring book - not so much!",2.0
"Very disappointing. Especially the fact that you still have to pay this much for a Pantone book. And now the paper is this thin? It's terrible. I was very tempted to return it except that I need it and am not sure if a thicker paper Pantone book is available. I doubt it. So we're just stuck with this? It's so thin that I'm afraid I'm going to rip it by just looking through the colors.

Also, the numbers are not in order at all. They used to be in order by color then number. Now it takes forever if your looking for a specific color.

I've been using Pantone books for 10+ years and was very excited to be able to get a new one. And all I can say is that I'm truly disappointed.",2.0
"I am SO upset about the newly organized Pantone Plus Series Forumula Guides! The colors are no longer in numerical order, but are organized by color, so anyone familiar with Pantone colors will be pretty frustrated. There is an index in the back with the colors listed in numerical order with page numbers, but the page numbers are located on the lower left corner of the book, which makes finding the right page way more difficult than it should be. The page numbers have always been on the lower left, but in 25 years of using Pantone books, I can't say I've ever noticed, or needed to use the page numbers.

I can see where organizing by color would be more user friendly for new users, but for the majority of us, it's a huge pain. It would be nice if they would offer an option with the colors organized in numerical order. In the meantime, I may take out the screw post and re-order the pages of my guides. That should be a fun weekend activity...",2.0
"I was under the impression that the wedge fit nicely into your book, and light would be emitted from the side of the handle. I suppose you could say I didn't research it well enough, but bought this item for my partner, based on the overall great reviews it has received. Now that I see how it really works, I am disappointed in the fact that using this takes something away from the ""reading experience,"" especially if you are a quick reader. Having to turn the page AND the light wedge can be cumbersome, as it is not THAT light. Ultimately, I think it would have been better to go with the itty bitty book light, or a similar type of light , whose base clips onto the book or a book cover, and extends over the book spread, illuminating the pages as you read, without requiring that you do additional work to light your pages in the dark.

We'll keep this one as a travel light because we won't shed any tears if we lose it.",2.0
"I accidentally dropped this once and it broke at the top of the light. The annoying this was that the broken piece never detached (that wouldve been better and I probably would have gotten another one) but it just stayed on and somehow still works but it bothers me. Lol.
The clip is awkward and slides from the weight of the next because of doesnt have a good grip.
I got this because it wasn't expensive and i guess i got what i paid for.
On the plus side it makes for a great flashlight when looking for things under the bed",2.0
NOT mighty bright!  Very dull compared to others Ive used.,2.0
"Would be fine except that one of the LED bulbs flickers.  There are 2 bulbs ... both on for bright setting, one on for less bright setting (although the difference in brightness between the two settings is not large).  The bulb that flickers is the one that is on in both settings.  Frustrating.",2.0
"So for context, I was looking for a book light that I could use for my Kindle while in bed at night if my wife wanted to go to sleep earlier than I did. This one looked big, bright and with a strong clip. That was all correct. However, for a book light, bright and big are not ideal. For a book light, this is extremely bulky and far too heavy. I had no where to clip it on my kindle - even with a case - other than with the clip pressing on the screen itself. If I tried to clip it closer to the edge, the giant clip would slip off and snap shut loudly, waking up our whole house. It didn't even work well on a book (unless it was a hardback). Paperback books just couldn't support the weight of the light and would bend forward or backwards until the light was upside down.

What's more, this light has two brightness settings which basically mean either one or both of the LED bulbs is on. Even the lowest brightness setting is enough to illuminate our entire bedroom. It's only a little bit dimmer than my iPhone's flashlight. A book light should be light, flexible and just bright enough to thoroughly illuminate the pages/screen that you're looking at. This light was far too large, far too heavy and certainly far too bright to be an effective book light.

On the upside, we are able to snap it in the bathroom as a night light in the middle of the night. I even wrapped red tape around the bulb so it can illuminate our bathroom with a red light that's STILL bright enough to see by but doesn't ruin our night vision.",2.0
This is my 3rd mighty bright light over the last couple of years. They seem to always stop working after about 10 months or so. I will not be buying again.,2.0
"This was amazing at first, very bright light. However, after daily use for less than 3 weeks, the light has significantly diminished. Was not long enough lasting for the price.",2.0
"Might bright is right. Too bright. I bought this to use with books, paper- and hardback. It works and provides light, and I appreciate having two light settings. However the base is heavy for use with paperback books and the light gives me headache. Unless I read a paperback book on a hard surface - which is not what I am doing when I reading before bedtime - I have to stabilize the book in some way and this becomes annoying. I'm not sure why reading lights aren't made with a softer light, one that is easier on the eyes or has the option of different colors like night lights. I already threw away the box so I cannot return. In the meantime I used sticky tabs to create a softer light, and am in search of a better cover to filter the mighty light...",2.0
"I wish I had saved the packaging, because I'd love to return this. It is much, much too bright to use to read in bed even at the lower setting. Not only does it wake up my husband, it's a shock to me, too, which defeats the purpose of reading to help yourself fall asleep. It does seem like a good quality product, and the clip holds well even on a larger book, but in the end, the amount of light is just too much.",2.0
"Light is bright.  Clip is too large and does clip on to allow comfortable ""normal"" reading position.",2.0
light is difficult to adjust to book. Too bright,2.0
"The intensity of the LEDs decreases depending upon how long you have the light on. They get really dimm within an hour. So if you are using the light to read in a dark room, it plays tricks with your eyes.",2.0
"Might as well buy a 10,000 candlepower spotlight and read with that. Harsh LED light guaranteed to screw up your circadian rhythm and not just wake up your sleeping partner but the neighborhood as well.",2.0
"These are great little book lights that clip well onto bed frames for nighttime reading. I had to give it two stars, however, because in less than 2 months, the light on one of them has grown very weak and the second one I ordered stopped working altogether, and I don't have any way to return them.",2.0
"This is a flashlight. It sure is bright like a flash light. I need to improvise now, I need to put a cloth around it or something. It hurts my eyes reading in the dark with this. 1 star because it works and is a good quality but as a night reading light, it should be dimmer.",2.0
Flickers in and off even with new batteries,2.0
"easy to use and stays on the book, but not nearly bright enough. It also seems to dissipate the light in a way that isn't focused enough on the reading material. In other words, too much of the room lights up but the page isn't bright enough to read comfortably. Still looking for a better product.",2.0
I returned it.  The adapter does not come with it.,2.0
"Seems well made, but is not mighty bright. And it's very small.",2.0
This was a great product when it included the cord.  The best part about it was never having to use batteries.  The first one I bought included a cord--the second one no cord.  The description still makes it seem like there is a cord--but now they charge almost as much as the light to buy a cord separately.  MISLEADING.,2.0
This worked well for about a month and then really started to dim and was pretty useless then.  Don't recommend.,2.0
On off switch broke in 2 days...  Cheap junk!!,2.0
its not too bright,2.0
"does the job, but lacks sufficient light distribution to see both pages of regular hardback.
also:  TOO BRIGHT -",2.0
Disappointed. The clip is way too big and it keeps slipping off all the time. The intensity of the light is too bright. One can probably use it as a flash light.,2.0
Broke after day 2. The button on top will not shut off the light and I cant get the switch to work. So I have to disconnect the battery to shut it off.,2.0
"Maybe if I had a side lamp in my room this light would be great.  But even with the ability to use the lower light on the lamp this is ridiculously bright.  With it being an LED it's significantly bright.  I read in the dark, and admittedly I have no idea if that's how it is intended to be used.  When I turn this on and put it on the page I feel like my retinas are on fire.  It takes a significant amount of time for my eyes to adjust - to the point that I open my eyes and they're watering/crying.  The only way I can tolerate it is if I turn the light on while the light in my room is on, then shut the room light off and let my eyes adjust to it.  But it takes a significant effort.  I think if this weren't an LED I'd like it better.",2.0
"Very harsh, bright light. Appropriate for a flashlight but not good for use while winding down to sleep. Seems like it produces that creepy ""blue"" light that keeps you awake. I put some scotch tape and a bit of paper over the light to diffuse it but that looked janky and kept coming off. After I knocked it off the bedside table the battery cover broke and now the whole thing is busted. Also, this thing is bulky and makes books difficult to hold.
Would not recommend for clumsy people and those who have trouble sleeping.
If anyone knows of an EXCELLENT book light, please comment and let me know!",2.0
Chews up batteries in no time.,2.0
The light produced from this light was disappointing.  The actual lighted area on the page was very small.  To read a pocket book it was necessary to move the position of the light for every paragraph.,2.0
This is still too bright to read in the room with my husband asleep.  He was still bothered by the light even on the low setting.,2.0
Disappointed.  we purchase three and two of them are shorting out.  One within three weeks.,2.0
Not bright enough to read in the dark and have to constantly adjust it as it won't stay put. It is better than nothing. Won't buy again.,2.0
"Did not last long, came apart.",2.0
workmanship need to be improved.,2.0
"Okay at first, for about a month, then began to flicker and drove me crazy while trying to read on the bus in the morning.  Did not last as long as I anticipated.  Still looking for the utopian little book light.",2.0
"I purchased this book light for my kindle and have owned it for about 14 months. The light on it is very bright and the padded clip is nice. However, within just a few weeks of owning it the button would not work the first time I pressed it. I would have to press it 3,4, or even 5 times to get it to work. Now, after having it for 14 months a piece of the plastic clip has broken so that the lever broke off. If it worked, this would be great as far as design, but the quality is just not up to par.",2.0
broke in a week,2.0
"The light was a bit dimmer than I expected. It also gets dimmer after being on for only a few minutes. I have it mounted on a small bookcase on my nightstand, and it sits about 2 feet above my book. At this distance, and even closer, it's sadly ineffective for reading after just a few minutes. This is after only about 4 hours of use on new batteries.",2.0
"this light worked great with ac adapter for a couple weeks, then it started shut off if moved the tiniest bit = drove me crazy. For some unknown reason this particular color was $2 more than the blue one.",2.0
"Bought 2 of these for my children to read in bed. They clip right onto the bed frame and they are very easy for a child to turn and adjust (7 yr old) and also to turn off when they go to sleep. They can also be used for road trips etc. Great light!

UPDATE: I have to downgrade my rating.  One of the lights I ordered works great still (we will see for how long) and the other one just stopped working out of nowhere.  We tried replacing the batteries and it just stopped turning on all together.  I tried emailing the Mighty Bright Company since it is warrantied for one year and they don't respond to emails. Terrible customer service and joke of a warranty.  Thank goodness Amazon has world class customer service who helped me out!!! Thanks AMAZON!",2.0
The button is inconsistent - one push may work - or it may take up to 20 times.  I'm returning.,2.0
"I feel like the odd man out with all of the gushing reviews, but I do not love this booklight.  I actually bought 3, one for me and one for each of my kids.  I find the light too bright even when used on the single-light setting.  Plus, two of the lights behave strangely--mine often can only be turned off when I remove the batteries, and my daughter's tends to flicker. Finally, from a design standpoint, I think the clip part is bulkier and stronger than necessary.  I'd prefer something slimmer.",2.0
Way too bright. Lights up the whole room.,2.0
"Seems to not be as bright anymore - will turn on kind of bright but then dim.
At furst i thought itd be too bright, now its not bright enough to even see properly if all other lights are off.
Also, the clip/battery assembly is huge - i wish it was more low profile.
I would and probably will try a different reading if i were to do it again",2.0
not worth the price it cost,2.0
"I thought this was a headboard/desk lamp, which is what I needed, but it is a book light. It functions well for it;s intended purpose, but I had to order another reading lamp to replace a broken one.",2.0
Way too bright to use for reading in the dark.  It lights up the whole room.,2.0
"Difficult to keep it on both book pages, not easy to use.",2.0
Not brite enuf. Clamp is too small and too weak. REturned.,2.0
It worked well but the lights seem to burn out fast,2.0
"It's okay, but not the best one I could have purchased.  You have to move the light from page to page which is annoying!
Two lights are much better, like the one I purchased for my sister!  Now, I have either stick with it or decide to splurge for the better one!",2.0
"Too bright for reading at night without lighting up the rest of the room with harsh LED light. It does seem odd to complain about a light being too bright, but in a dark room I don't need a spotlight on a book, just enough to read.",2.0
It moves about the page a lot.  I stopped using it and bought another style.,2.0
Too heavy to use with anything but a hard back book.,2.0
Bad,2.0
BULB NOT AS BRIGHT AS EXPECTED,2.0
Not bright enough to use for reading in the dark,2.0
Wiring seems finicky and light occasionally blinks on and off as I get it situated.,2.0
The clip is really bulky and unwieldy. Way too much for use with a paperback. And the light is too bright for reading in bed. They have 2 brightness levels but the lowest is still too much. I would not buy this again.,2.0
"I bought it so that I could read at night while my wife sleeps. However, even at the low setting, the light is so bright reflecting off the book, that it illuminates the room. I wish they had a much weaker model.",2.0
"It worked well for a while, but many of the lights quickly burned out.",2.0
The battery cover will not stay on. It's frustrating.,2.0
"It's a really good light, like other reviewers have said, it is too bright and virtually lights up the room. Not good if you have a partner you are not trying to disturb with too much light.",2.0
This little light is strong but very blue in color and seems to flicker slightly. It makes me dizzy.,2.0
"I bought this in June and didn't really start using it until recently. Kind of pissed that it is already broken! The switch won't work. I like the brightness of it, but hate that you constantly have to change the battery because it dims so quickly. Not sure if I had a bad piece, but am trying another brand now.",2.0
Maybe mine was an outlier but after about three hours I lost close to 50% brightness,2.0
"The light is far too bright. It's also not a soft light, it's a really bright LED light. If you have another person in bed with you, they will definitely be disturbed by this.",2.0
"Called Mighty Bright for a reason! I bought this for traveling and for reading in dark rooms without disturbing others with light and this does not fit my needs. The light is so bright it lights up the whole room. I think if I used this on a plane the light would be bright enough to disturb others. If you need strong light to read this would be good, but it's too strong for my needs. Plus if you are using it on an ereader the light is strong enough to reflect off the surface.

 I do like the flexibility of the light.",2.0
This product developed a problem with the batteries making contact. It's not very bright anymore even though it has brand new batteries.,2.0
A reading light should be bright enough to read by!  This is not!  Very disappointed ! I should have known by the price it was not the quality one would expect.  Shame on me !,2.0
"Worked like a charm for about 45 evenings, and then it just quit,
naturally this happened after the return interval expired.

When it's working, the plug in adapter really makes this friendly,
but the light itself must be pretty poorly made.

I've go an LED headlamp that I've used for most evenings over
the last 3 years with no problem besides recharging batteries.

I recommend you think twice if you rely on this reading light,
as it is not particularly well made. Maybe the low price is a warning.",2.0
"I think it's nice, but also, I think... that it's cool......?",2.0
Way too bright. Plus if you pack it in your bag for a trip it will be turne on constantly. Awkward. Too heavy. Really a disappointing product. I guess you get what you pay for.,2.0
Back lid for the battery broke off at the tabs on both ...right away. Had to tape shut.,2.0
"As indicated before, bought three and two have shorted out.  One within three weeks.",2.0
Not very bright,2.0
This light has two settings: really bright and way too bright. I bought this so I could read in bed without keeping my wife up but both settings are stronger than the lamp.,2.0
"Not good for reading in a darkened room.  The LED light is too harsh, and the light emitters on the unit are not hooded or shielded from direct line of sight, meaning that one not only gets glare from light reflected off the page, but from the LED source itself.  Also, it's difficult to properly position the light; the flex wire doesn't stay in quite the same position it's set to.

I'll be using this only as emergency lighting in the event of a power failure.",2.0
OK as long as you use rechargeable batteries.,2.0
"Pretty crappy light. Doesn't light up enough of the page to be useful...and def NOT ""mighty bright"". Flimsy, broke even before I had a chance to try and use it. Save your money! Look elsewhere! I only gave it 2 stars because there was almost immediate shipping.",2.0
"I brought this for my granddaughter.  As of today almost a year later.  She not using this light for books. not great, go back to the drawing board and try again.",2.0
Too bright.  Insane.  Low setting is the same power!,2.0
"The light works pretty well but it shines on a very small area and has to be moved frequently, and it's top heavy and a keeps falling over",2.0
"corroded batteries. useless. used the batteries up quickly, not efficient use of batteries. Did not get much use from it at all. Very disappointing.",2.0
"I bought my mighty bright so I could read while my husband slept and we wouldn't have to turn on the overheard light.  I also wanted it for long car rides at night.  This thing is WAY to bright!!  I could probably use it to trek through underground caves!!  This is a plus for some people, but I would prefer a more ambient light when reading.

It is also just a little heavy and makes reading my kindle just a tad awkward but it's nothing too bad.  As for battery life, I haven't gone through an entire battery life to know anything remarkable.  I am considering purchasing another brand.  Hope this was helpful!",2.0
"Oh my, I wondered why this little item was going to take so long to ship, but I really wanted a replacement for my current Mighty Bright so I ordered without giving it too much thought. It arrived today--direct from China. Mailed from China! The container box DOES NOT say Mighty Bright, it says CLIP LED FLEX-LIGHT (made in china) and includes with 3 batteries. The battery brand is YALIW (made in china) looking totally unfamiliar. The light itself says Mighty Bright, but with so many knock-offs and counterfeit items coming to us from overseas, I have serious doubts about this product.",2.0
"The biggest issue with this book light is that the ""neck"" cannot direct light at the bottom of a page in any book larger than a trade-sized paperback.  You try to pull the neck down so that the light reaches the bottom of the page, but the neck springs back.  In addition, I find all Mighty Brights to be a little too blue and harsh, leading to eyestrain.  My MacGyver-style remedy is to put a piece of panty hose over the light and tie to the neck with a rubber band.  But sheesh, Mighty Bright, why can't you come up with a light that is warmer, and is conducive to people getting to sleep at night?",2.0
"I bought this based on all of the positive reviews. I was planning to use this light to read a large textbook where the overhead room light was giving off too much glare.

I put the light over my book and noticed:
1. Light is not bright enough to drown out the glare from the overhead light.
2. Light is not diffuse enough. There is an obvious coned beam effect if you put the light too close to the book. Put it further away and the light brightness is even worse.

This light is adequate for reading a paperback book but it's no replacement for a desktop light. My 7W LED desktop light is far superior to this light. I bought this for the much smaller footprint but it's going back to Amazon.",2.0
"Though we ended up ordering another one of these, we thought it would be useful for people to know that the plastic is, in fact, quite cheap and easy to break. Specifically, the battery cover slips off very easily, so much so that we've had to tape our battery doors in place. And the clip is susceptible to breaking if pulled in any way.

So, if you only attach it to books and are very careful, they work great.  But if you plan on pulling these out and moving them around to use as flashlights in other situations, or if there are kids in the house, plan on having to replace them every once and a while.",2.0
Not wide enough to grip back of headboard.  So it has been not used for it's intended purpose which is to read in bed without disturbing the MRS.,2.0
"Used it for 6 months maybe 2 days a week and light is getting really dim.  LEDs are suppose to
Last a while.",2.0
"The light is really dim and it seems to be more like a child's toy. I really made a mistake because the light is so dim that it is really useless. Really needed a better light system. The price was really cheap, so I'm not out much.",2.0
"I was looking for light for my kindle, purchased this and it doesn't work with Kindle. Be careful what you shop for....",2.0
"i bought this to study at night.
pro: can clip it anywhere, it's cheap
con: it's not that bright (too dim for me)",2.0
"Needed for laptop under dim conditions. Previously went thru two similar lights that were USB powered...one lasted a few weeks, the other only a few days! Total waste of money. So far, so good with this light after several months. Glad I have rechargeable batteries for this as it needs new batteries every couple weeks with just few hour's usage each day. Created 'visor' with small strip of electrician's tape around lower edge of light to prevent monitor glare, and to help focus it down on keyboard.

Sept 30, 2013 update: Guess my positive review ended up being a jinx. Three days after posting my original comments the light died. Back to searching for a light for my laptop. (This is getting costly.) Lest this be a total waste, I taped a mini flashlight to the head of this so I still have the functionality of the clip and flexible neck. Better than nothing.",2.0
I find that I cannot switch on/off the light after only using it for an hour. The quality disappointed me.,2.0
"Don't understand what all these glowing reviews are about.

The price was right, the reviews were great so I bought it.

Bad decision..

The thing is basically useless....

I'm a 50 year old guy with expected vision and this barely adds any light while attached to my book stand.

Time to find a much more powerful light....",2.0
I love this light but it didn't take long for me to fall asleep one night with it on and then the light burned out :( don't know how to fix it.,2.0
"To easy to slid off.. Also it's a touch light-just touch it slightly and you have turned it on..(Not suppose to be touch light). So be Careful, you will run your battery down before you know it.. Not very bright, so if you accidentally turn it on (by touching it) with other lights on, you might not see it, then next time you need it - battery will be dead...",2.0
"After reading the reviews here, I thought it was the best book light ever conceived. The fact is, not only it is bulky, the 2 LED lights don't provide enough light for me to read confortably in a poorly lit room, even when both are turned on. The light does spread much more evenly then previous book lights I tried, but it still can't cover 2 pages of an open book (regular size), which will force you to be adjusting it at all times when you jump between pages.",2.0
"Started out great.  Cute, light weight book light.  But it died after 3 months of occasional use.  I'm not happy.",2.0
"This lamp was not what I expected. Much smaller then I anticipated and certainly not as ""BRIGHT"" as I needed for my uses. I ended up by buying a different lamp from Walmart at a cheaper price that was exactly what I wanted. Should have done that the first time around. This is the first time that I have been disappointed with  an item I bought online.",2.0
Not sure how come Mighty Bright keeps making other versions when they've created something so much better.  This one has a base that's a bit bulky and uncomfortable on a book.  Check out the Mighty Bright Ultra Thin Book Light instead; it's awesome!,2.0
"Says it takes 2 2032 batterys, so I ordered a 25 pack along with the light. It does not take these type of batterys!!",2.0
This will be a great product if I can get one that works. It only stays on briefly and then goes off. I tried new batteries and that didn't solve the problem. I REALLY wanted it for holiday traveling so I am absolutely disappointed as there is not enough time to return it and get a new one.,2.0
"I got two of these, so it wasn't a ""lemon"".  The light is very dim and gets dimmer rather quickly.  Both are like that.  Amazingly can hardly last a month.  The illumination is crazy weak.  Maybe its the LED but I had to trash the 2 I got.  If you are young and have good eyes, probably ok, but Granny here needs something brighter.",2.0
"This purchase was basically a waste of money.  The light does not illuminate the entire page.  I have to keep readjusting the position of the light in order to see as I read further down the page.  It really should not be that hard to design a book light.  As they say, this is not rocket science...  I have purchased many fine items from Amazon.  This was not one of them.",2.0
"This light is useless for reading in bed next to someone. Even the one bulb lights up the entire room and blinds you with the reflective light from the book/kindle.  It's going to be great for camping, ghost hunting and the like, but you have to put a cover over it to read by. Maybe I should have read the ""MIGHTY"" part of the Mighty Bright.",2.0
"I did a lot of research for this item- my sister has a rechargable light that is not (of course) sold anymore, so I was looking for on as good as hers.  choose this one because of the AC adaptor, decent price and good reviews.  Out of the box, it was great- bright light, easy clamp and seemed to be just what I needed.  grabbed it a week later and guess what- did not work at ALL- not on the AC, not with batteries, nothing.  after plugged in a while, I could get one bulb to sometimes light.  Then it all died again.  I was terribly disappointed and will not try this light again.",2.0
"not really bright and if it hints of being bright it will not be long before the change will take effect. perhaps an hour or maybe two. either way this light seems to be mighty hungry and not mighty bright. Hungry for batteries, it goes through them fast, which is probably why the maximum of two hour brightness accurs.",2.0
"I bought this item at my local bookstore for about $20. It did not work well for me at all. It did not give enough light for me. It only lights about 1/2 page at a time and I had to keep moving in order to light pages. I found a much better light at barns and noble for the same price it has 5 or 6 lights across and can be used as a flashlight too, called a hammerhead by mighty bright. It also can be used with adapters. I returned this small extrafkex2! Not sure how it gets such great reviews!",2.0
"The product works ok on an area like book, but not for a newspaper. It's also too expensive compared to the price from Costco.",2.0
"It's mighty and brighty.  Unfortunately you have to be pretty mighty yourself to hold a book with this attached for any length of time.  My wrists and fingers become fatigued even from just short period of time using this thing, and upon turning the page, the weight of the device on a soft-cover book leads to awkward adjustments.  It bends and flexes the book back if I am not always supporting it properly with my crampy fingers.  It's too bad.  I guess that's the drawback of using readily-available AAA batteries.  That's convenient, but they're just too heavy.  And the long arm is nice for finding the perfect positioning to illuminate both pages of a book, but because the thing needs constant shifting and adjusting, anyway, due to droopage and dropage, it's actually not such a great feature and adds to the awkwardness and cumbersomeness of the product.  It's not worth it to me.

Also, it's quite bright.  Really too bright for a booklight, even on the lower setting, in my opinion.  I might as well have my bedside lamp on because this is disturbs to my husband's sleep almost as much and is less comfortable for me, to boot.  I have good eyes so I don't require such a bright page.  I am going to keep looking for a light that better suits my needs.",2.0
"I was immediately smitten with this book light upon receiving it...I mean what's not to love? It's LED, it's bright, it's moveable and the clip is great! Well then I started using it and realized it drains batteries quicker than a WIImote. I am in law school so I read for 6+ hours everyday and I have to change the batteries (It requires three AAA batteries) twice a week. Also the on/off switch is a button which is too sensitive...it can easily get turned on while in a bag or a purse (it runs out of batteries on me just from reading; I learned my lesson not to tote it around anywhere.) I would give this product 5 stars if it would only not drain batteries so quickly. The whole reason I bought it is because I bought a Mighty Bright book light about 12 years ago from Barnes&Noble (it was much boxier, wasn't LED, and took 6 AA batteries) and it worked great for all those years until a few months ago it lost its ability to stand erect, (go ahead and laugh) the light bulb just falls onto the book....I think Mighty Bright needs to take a lesson from its old bulkier design because the batteries didn't drain on that one.",2.0
"I was looking for a light for my Nook Touch. The light B&N sells is very compact however not bright enough - I have to keep it close the the screen which creates glare. I thought this one might be an improvement - I was wrong.

Cons:
Very bulky with clip occupying ~1 inch of the screen
Neck is too long and does not hold shape well. It also rotates around axis (though this might be defective unit)
The light has blue tint - sign of cheap LED

Pros:
Nice packaging and cheap

This light may do the trick for some people. Otherwise - look elsewhere.
I personally will stay with Belkin Clip-On Reading Light, which is brighter, has true white LED and is very well made.",2.0
"The light worked fine when I first put batteries in and turned it on. As other say, it is a well spread light perfect for reading a whole page at a time.  The problem I had is that if I leave the batteries in it, the light will not turn on again.  It is not draining the batteries.  If I take the same batteries out and check them they are fin., I have to wait a few hours before putting batteries back in, then the light works fine again, for a little while.  I have checked this using fresh batteries, installing them right after taking our the original batteries.  No luck, so I am returning this.",2.0
"The Mighty Bright is amazing for what I use it for. However, the new one I purchased to replace my old was only functional for 8 hours. I ended up going to Barns and Noble to buy another one the next day and haven't had a problem with it. Must have gotten a bad apple. :(",2.0
Worked perfectly as a book light AND a plant light until it broke unexpectedly after keeping it in my purse for just a day. I did not drop my purse nor did I handle it roughly. I bought the light because I thought it would be good for traveling - this was not the case.,2.0
"Needed to replace my incandescent Mighty Bright that had served me well for close to ten years after it met an unfortunate but much delayed death. This unit arrived straight away, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they included batteries. I placed the batteries in the light straight away, and turned it on and was pleased with its performance. Imagine my surprise when I went to turn the light on later that evening and... nothing. I removed the batteries, replaced them, and still, nothing. I actually read the instructions (where I found nothing helpful) and had given up and walked away when one of the LCDS came on. I cycled through the bulbs and only one was responsive. About twenty minutes later, the other bulb came on. This problem has persisted on multiple occasions: when it works, it's great, but after lengthy periods of inactivity (e.g. 9 hours or so) it takes forever to turn on for reasons that are not quite clear to me. Judging from the other reviews that I've found my experience seems to be anomalous, but I definitely could not recommend this product if their reliability issues are anything like I've experienced. Very disappointed, but I'll be back with another review after I send this one back and receive a replacement.",2.0
"The Might Bright XtraFlex 2 Light is too big for what it needs to do.  I should have looked closer to the size specs, but when it arrived, I was amazed at how much larger it was than I thought.  Because it is so big, it does not attach as easily.  It is just too bulky.  I'd recommend a smaller book light.",2.0
"This product worked for one day then broke.  I sent it back and got a full refund.  It was easy to return, Go Amazon!!",2.0
"Ok let's get to it:

I spend 5 years using a Fulcrum Multi-Flex LED Task Light, Silver- so I KNOW reading lights, and the FULCRUM took a beating of trips and experiences-the silver paint came off on the switch showing the red undercoating-SO YOU KNOW I USED IT A LOT. AMAZING device. But-I wanted to replace it, and forgeting what I ordered over 5 years ago...I ended up in the search engine world of MIGHTY BRIGHT (sp) and since I was in a rush-ordered the double light MB after reading the glorius Amazon reviews. (In that amount of time, I assumed technology had simply run overtop my FUCLCRUM with super powers. It hadn't.

1) The Mighty bright is a GREAT LIGHT with intensity settings. We know that.

2) Problem one. It has a soft push ON/OFF switch. And THAT is IT's undoing. If you travel with the light, in bags or suitcases or knapsacks, any pressure at all, WILL TURN the LIGHT ON, and there unless you happen to catch it, goes your battery life!!
OUCH! Suddenly, your mighty brite isn't so mighty when you go to use it next, unless, you have batteries near by, which most people don't.
On the cheaper one light (Fulcrum Multi-Flex LED Task Light, Silver) you have the old fashioned CLICK switch for the ON/OFF and it takes a CLICK from you to engage the battery life. Many times while using the Fulcurm, I didn't like the hassle of making a click for on, vs a soft push, but after seeing the Might Brite ON in one of my travel bags--eeeek ...I wish for the old fashioned CLICK switch. Now if you just keep the light in your bedside drawer, this may never be an issue for you, but if you are a road warrior like myself and travel alot-you better travel with 3 extra AAA's or you will have NO LITE.

3) Problem two. The Goose Neck. YIKES. Nice when new, it degrades quickly in motion.
One reviewer mentioned the problem and I didn't beleive it. Well, now I do. You can work around it by being patient and using balance, but it is a flaw, and should be stated.
In comparison to the goose neck on the single light Fulcrum--well, let me say, I could tie knots with the goose neck and it would STILL work and keep its motion and nice connection to the bulbhead.

4) A wee bit pricey compared to the Fulcrum, is the the Mighty Brite. Granted you do get that extra luminosity for larger books but it is a trade off.

Conclusion: The Mighty Brite could have been a 5 star, but although it is a very nice light-it does have some serious flaws. I would give nice lights as gifts, as I love people who read, and don't like people reading in the dark. I would have to say the Fuclrum wins handsdown, because if you don't have battery life you don't have a light.",2.0
"I bought the Mighty Bright light for my Kindle 2, this review is for anyone considering use of the light for Kindle 2 only.  In my opinion, the light should not even be advertised as an accessory for the Kindle 2.  It is huge! The light cannot be properly clipped directly onto the Kindle without slipping off.  The only way it would stay on is if the huge clip is partially clipped onto the screen. I cannot review on how well the light actually works because I didn't even turn it on. On to the next one....",2.0
"I have had problems with this light from the start.  Half the time it won't turn on and when it does, only one light works.  Would never buy it again.",2.0
This is a great Kindle or book light.  It is not a grill light!,2.0
"I bought this light because many reviewers were remarking about the brightness of the light.  Even the name says ""Mighty Bright"".  The light is not that bright.  The small size also demands that you mount it higher above the reading material as the ""footprint"" of the light is too small otherwise. I suppose it would work in a pinch if your were out in a tent somewhere and wanted to read a little but for long term home use it is pretty much unacceptable IMO.",2.0
This is the first product of this type that I have had....I really love the light it is great BUT the batteries last a few hours & then they start to go dim...It is great for my new Kinkle 2 but when I have to change batteries after only a few hours of use it is not worth it----and the outfit I bought (appx 2 weeks ago) it from through amazon will not replace it.....if not for the battery problem it wld get a 5 star exspecially for use with my Kindle 2....,2.0
"I really want to like this light.  It is good and plenty bright.  The flexible arm is a nice idea, but it isn't stiff enough and rotates or bends occasionally when you don't want it to.  Also, the clip isn't strong/sticky enough and slips around when you hold the book sideways.  Those are two fairly huge flaws in an otherwise seemingly well-engineered product.",2.0
"I own the original mighty brite light and much prefer it- this newer version, with 2 LEDs, is inferior.  The light output is not as bright (unless the two we have are lemons) and the switch makes it far too easy to accidentally turn the light on while traveling, etc. which kills your batteries.  The original light had a manual switch that was better at preventing this from happening.  Go with the old one......",2.0
"The light it gives off is good, the clip is good.

UNFORTUNATLEY the neck is SO WEAK, it flops down if you are using it for long periods, or you move to quickly, or are using it in a plane/car and have a slight jolt. It's so much of a nuisance I gave it away and am looking for another type.

DISAPOINTING single flaw, but a MAJOR flaw.",2.0
This one was broken when it arrived. They are pretty cheaply made but serve the purpose.,2.0
I just received this item in the mail today and I keep having trouble with the led light. It keeps fliquering.,2.0
"I saw a lot of great reviews for this which is why I bought it. I never buy anything without looking at the reviews and other products. I decided on this and am very disappointed. I got it in the mail today, just turned it on to use it reading in bed tonight, tried to bend the neck to better suit my book and I heard a crack and the light went out. I can get it to flicker now but it doesn't stay on.",2.0
I just found out from grandson that his light doesn't work well.  He said it works for a while the just goes out.  Disappointing.,2.0
Cute little light however I just received it and already the batteries are dead. I wasn't sure if it was broken or it was the batteries. Believe it or not the batteries itself or more money than the item. And Im hoping that these batteries last longer and its not something defective that just drains batteries.,2.0
Despite brand new batteries it often turns off when the battery compartment is touched. Very sensitive to keep on. When on it is a great addition. Wish it was durable. Daughter likes otherwise,2.0
"Sometimes the light goes on, sometimes it doesn't. Disappointed in this product. When it works, it's great.",2.0
"Worked for all of 10 min. Something appears broken between the battery and the light itself, which runs through the bendable neck. Light does not consistently turn on and it doesn't consistently stay on. Tried changing batteries and light with no luck.",2.0
"Cute design and initially worked as designed, but within a month the light would no longer work.  The light was not dropped or manhandled--rather, it stayed clipped to my daughter's bed for reading at night.  We've changed batteries several times, to no avail.  Like others have noted, the light is neither durable nor built to last.",2.0
"Cheap construction. Dropped it about a foot onto a table just after putting the batteries in, and now it doesn't work.",2.0
"The LED is way to bright, it lights up my entire bedroom and drives my wife crazy when she's trying to sleep. I wouldn't buy this again.",2.0
"Cute product looks like the picture, but my daughter used once for Makayla 20 mins and the batteries already died.",2.0
Not nearly as bright as I was hoping it would be!,2.0
"I gave this light only two stars, the battery did not last a month on ours. Other than the battery, the light is cute and works well",2.0
Blinding light! Just too much!,2.0
"I think it's cute but think the switch is bad. When I click the on/off, I can hear it click, but nothing happens. Sometimes, it will click on but then I can't turn it off, despite multiple attempts. I have to bring it to my husband who can push the knob harder than I. I'm not a fan and would like a replacement.",2.0
"Nice idea, great light output but poor quality. Mine broke in less than 24 hours...the little plastic bracket that holds the spring to the clamp body broke off of the clamp body. The clamp will still work but it's loose. 2 stars for the light output",2.0
It's a really cute design but shines way too brightly.  I got this item so that I could read in bed at night while my husband is trying to sleep but this little lamp lit up our whole bedroom and kept him awake.,2.0
Fell off the bedside table and broke after 1 use.  At least it wasn't expensive.,2.0
Difficult to charge and started falling apart and not charging after a month .,2.0
"I read a lot at the evening.  Was hopeful t his light would due the trick.  It's convenience and bright, however I was only able to charge the light two times.  Now when I put the light back into the clip, it slides out.",2.0
I got this for Christmas and I love the idea of being able to charge my light. That being said the charging usb end looks as though the metal pieces are just glued on and after 1 month will not charge. It is now fit for nothing except the rubbish!,2.0
Too dim for any illumination purpose.,2.0
"I ordered Lime Green, and what I received was too yellow, so I'm not sure if what I received the color I ordered, or if the color was misrepresented.  I returned it and bought something locally.",2.0
"Do not fit my puck lights. The bulb length is correct (or close enough to fit) and the bulbs do WORK in the puck lights. However, the bulbs are thicker than the existing ones, so I am unable to reattach the UV filter cover with the bulb installed. The original bulbs were 30/64"" wide, and these are 33/64"" wide. It does not seem like a lot, but it's enough -- the UV filter is glass, so there's no way for it to flex to accommodate the oversized lamp.",2.0
Purchased in November 2015. One bulb went out in about 5 months. The other bulb is still working after 1 year 4 months. Would not purchase again.,2.0
good price but the metal legs are too thin,2.0
"We've ordered these bulbs at least twice. The first time we ordered them, they worked perfectly. Now the second time we ordered them, the outer glass (around the bulb), appears to be a different configuration, so it no longer holds the filament in place. This is causing the bulbs to ether burn out too quickly or not even work at all. For example one of which the filament is just hanging inside the glass, and doesn't light up. They appear to be the same brand, so I'm not too sure why the change of style.",2.0
"too tall for my ""puck"" undercounter lights...seem to be good though but way too tall for the installation",2.0
Maybe I got the wrong bulb but these are bigger around and barely fit in the puck lights I bought them for.,2.0
It does not fit in the socket.  I cannot use them and I do not want to spend money to send them back.,2.0
Did not fit my fixtures,2.0

I put one into my light fixture and it barely glowed.  Not sure I can return it since I opened the package.,2.0
Four (4) of the ten (10) did NOT work.  The filaments were broken.  This is either the result of poor manufacturing or....?,2.0
"Assuming they live up to the advertised average bulb lifetime, these are a good deal. However, I was replacing two brands of lights, and whereas the two previous brands were close to the same size as each other, these were bigger. So big, in fact, that they do not fit in the puck lights, and barely fit in the outdoor lights. At first I thought, ""Well, Mea culpa for not looking at the dimensions in the product details,"" but those dimensions are of the box(es) not the bulb. These bulbs all say 120V 20W JCD G8, but these a touch longer and fatter than the other brands.",2.0
I bought these bulbs for the light over my stove.  They are OK when they are on but they don't last very long.  I only turn them on when I cook and have replaced them as often as every 2 weeks.,2.0
"These seem abnormally sized for the type of fixture they're supposed to be mounted in. I had to manually clip the prongs to fit all the fixtures I tried them in. Seeing as how they're branded for a G8 base you'd think they'd fit in G8 bulb sockets...

But, they were fixable with some elbow grease.",2.0
"It's not worth the time and effort to return the item, but the item that I received is not the item pictured.  The bulbs that I received do not use metal wires to support the filament.  The type that I received has the glass pinched in the middle.  My experience is that these bulbs have a sorter life span.  Please provide an accurate picture of your product.",2.0
For a G8 base it's a larger bulb than I usually get from Home Depot.  It doesn't fit in the under-cabinet puck lights I have.,2.0
we got them to fit into our under cabinet lights and they don't fit with the caps on.  they light up ok but seem much larger than other lightbulbs we've bought.,2.0
I bought these thinking they would fit g 8 ge microwave and they won't the prongs are slightly shorter than other g 8 bulbs and won't stay in socket so I can't use them !,2.0
"I have been buying these bulbs simply for the price, but they have an extremely short lifetime.  The product arrived on time, so no fault of the seller, but I am seriously considering finding other products.  Hard to match the price though!",2.0
I bought these because I was tired of paying $6 apiece for replacements at the home store.  The specs match the originals exactly.  Light output does not match.  These are noticeably dimmer.  I have a five light under-counter array and it is obvious that the replacement bulb is not as bright as the four originals.  I tried several of the new bulbs and they are all the same.  The decreased brightness changes the look of the counter top considerably.  If you replace all your bulbs with these it may not be a problem for you.  But I designed this array to provide strong specular highlights and these bulbs just don't deliver.,2.0
They don't fit as a replacement. Insulation too thick.,2.0
"I THOUGHT WARM WHITE MEANT IT HAD A WARM YELLOW-ORANGE TINT, TO MATCH ANOTHER ROPE LIGHT I ALREADY HAD, BUT IT WAS BRIGHT WHITE",2.0

"I don't write many reviews, but for this one, I went out of my way to do so:
Pros - Cheap
Cons - The color doesn't match - some bulbs have a pinkish hue, others a yellow, and others a blue - so, if you have three bulbs next to each other, there is a significant visible difference.  Also, perhaps even more importantly, the comments about the bulb life are true:  My previous bulbs that came with my new house lasted 7yrs - these last only a few months - very frustrating.",2.0
They do not last long.  I've had to change them much quicker than other brands.,2.0
"These bulbs are a great price, but you get what you pay for.  It was a crap-shoot for how long these bulbs would last - some would last a couple months, but others would burn out after 2 weeks.  I went through 12 bulbs in less than 1 year in a single 4 bulb fixture.",2.0
"Unfortunately, I have to replace them occasionally on my lamp system, as they burn out so fast.",2.0
"These bulbs kept on burning out on me, which was pretty frustrating. I know I didn't buy a Phillips or GE brand bulb, but come on.. they shouldn't be burning out in less than a month. Some did last a few months, to be fair... But I feel as though you could find a better product for a similar price elsewhere",2.0
"Most of them blew out after a few weeks, lost cost is not worth the low quality, would not buy again.",2.0
"These fall in the ""you get what you pay for"" category. For whatever reason, these bulbs are not as bright as other G9 40 watt bulbs and I had to buy more expensive ones unless I was going to change all of the bulbs in my bathroom light fixture. Using these along side the brighter bulbs made the glass shades look unmatched. Live and learn ... (Also, may I iterate other customers' advice. Do not touch to bulb portion of a G9 when replacing them. Use the packing or a tissue. That way they will last as they should.)",2.0
The clips on top of the bulb do not get a good connection into the socket of the light fixture. I have had to bend the the clips out to try to get them to get a good connection. sometimes it works and other times the glass will break on the bulb. i have 8 fixtures in my house that require these bulbs and it is a constant battel to keep them working not to mention they are very...very HOT! I changed out all of my florencent fixtures to the new ones because I was tired of constantly dealing with flickering lights and changing out ballists. Belive me for what it cost me to chang out my fixtures I should have stayed with the florecent lights.,2.0
"good for the price,",2.0

I don't think it's the light as it does it in every socket, and the remaining original bulbs that came with the light are still going strong.  I think it's just poor quality in these bulbs.

They are used for under cabinet lighting in our kitchen and need to be replaced quite frequently.  Some of the places they go are quite awkward so we wish they would last longer.  Also, I have noticed in the cabinets above them that they give off quite a bit of heat, probably because they are halogen bulbs.  I want to try the LED with G4 base next.",2.0

Because the price per bulb is so inexpensive, it is still cheaper than buying the overpriced bulbs from the local big box hardware store (although those bulbs do last sometimes up to a year before changing, and those ones do seem a bit brighter for the same wattage.  So, if you are using these for outside landscape lighting, just be aware that the bulb life will be relatively short, but at about 60-70 cents per bulb, it's not too bad a deal, as long as you don't find it a chore to replace the bulbs.",2.0

"I was so excited when i opened the box and saw this sign. The retail packaging was just great, just like at the dollar stores, i knew i was in for a treat! When i removed it from the plastic i noticed that the back was partially removed, surely because the manufacturer wanted me to see the wonderful engineering inside that makes this such an outstanding product. Then i realized that this was a ""do it yourself kit"" designed to teach and instill pride and confidence when you are finished assembling it. After several attempts i was able to get the wires alligned well enough so that the bulbs would stay in their intended holders, i felt that sense of pride and accomplishment. Now it was time to light it up and tremble in fear of this icon of horror! I plugged it in, turned the switch and it blazed forth in it's red and blue, the likes i hadn't seen since my grandmother's old Christmas tree. That's when i knew that this would be the prop that would keep on giving!
  As you can probably tell, i was being sarcastic. I bought this out of curiosity and wasn't expecting much, but this has to be one of the biggest pieces of crap props i have ever seen. The lighting inside is usually loose and not attached in it's proper place, which requires you to rerout the wiring so that the bulbs will fit properly into the flimsy holders. These are the same bulb type as used to be used on old Christmas tree strands and are considered to be fire hazzards, because the burn so hot. Just the type of thing you want inside of a small box made out of flimsy plastic (you can tear it with your hands) and cardboard. I will tell you, this thing gets hotter than the Devil's britches! Don't put this near anything flammable, and don't leave it on unattended, you will be sorry. Don't touch the front of it while it's on unless you want to get burned.
  The only reason i gave this 2 stars and didn't return it is because i can work with it and make it better. I'll tell you how. First, take out those Christmas lights and give them to someone you don't like. Then buy some battery powered LED lights they sell them here on Amazon pretty cheap. Then install them around the interior and through the middle. Not only will the sign look better and be better lit, but it will be battery powered so you can put it anywhere. And because it runs cool it won't be a fire hazzard anymore. I would suggest that if you don't want any grief and/or don't plan to convert this sign so it it useable, then don't buy it, it's not worth the price, and it is certainly not worth the risk.
  Hope this was helpful fellow Amazoners!",2.0
"Not the quality I expected from P.Cable. While it cuts, the blade has a wobble, i.e. bent so it cuts like a cheap dado. Not really wide, but as a cabinet maker it does not cut a thin cut that the Freud (spelling) blades make. It is going back to whomever...",2.0

Secondly, I cannot find a store that sells placement packs, which I find very inconvinent. This has been my first experience with a Porter Cable product.

"I purchased this base for use with my PC 690LR one month ago and in the time since its arrival I have not had the need to use it until this week (week of Sunday May 26, 2014) for an 8-ft. Roubo Workbench project. Over the course of the two days I was able to use the base the locking mechanism failed, even with the lever in the full locking position the base will not hold its position. I am writing this only moments after the mechanism failed and cut my project short. For a product that costs over $100 it seems to me that a frail, cheaply made locking mechanism of plastic on metal would not even be an option, but, here I sit, with a broken plunge base on account of poor engineering.

The very existence of this base revolves around this most important mechanism, yielding unto the user the ability to lock and unlock his/her router in quick succession in order to change the depth of cut instead of otherwise laborious tasks like chopping deep stop-mortises by hand, going to town with brace-and-bit with augers and chisels (my preferred method), or perhaps using Forstner bits on a drill press.

I can say that the rest of the base is excellent, it is not lacking for strength, accuracy in milling, and the handles are quite sturdy for a base at this price (at least the one I received) with the exception of the depth gauge. The tiny piece of milled metal that sits on your depth bar really should sit flush on the face of the scale if not within microns of said surface. It certainly leaves something to be desired and I have owned cheaper router sets with better features in this department.

I am going to undertake an investigation of this problem with the locking lever and see if perhaps it is not because fine wood dust has managed to find its way into the guides/bearings on the guide rods and thus making a slick, silty surface on which the cam/lever cannot grasp.

HOW CAN IT BE IMPROVED?:
It is my opinion that a milled, 6061 or 7075 aluminum lever coupled with stainless steel, aluminum or even mild steel wedges could remedy what ails this base, something similar to that mechanism used on older Powermatic lathe tool rests (back when they were made in America).  NO, this isn't a 7539 plunge base which warrants greater quality for its price; however, the noition that subpar manufacturing/design/engineering/parts is acceptable because your customer is only buying a $100.00 base is absolutely unconscionable. Ray Kroc once said, ""Take care of the customer and the business will take care of itself."" Indeed, this still holds just as true today, however, we, as American consumers, seem to be relegated to be content with mediocrity. Its a disease plaguing the tool industry.",2.0

"I have been the owner of a model 330 Speed-Bloc sander for some forty years.  When it became unusable recently, I decided to buy a new one, rather than rebuild the old machine, and purchased a new unit.  After about one hour of light, on-off use, stopping only to change paper, I noticed the sander overheating; especially at the rubber base plate and metal backer, making changing paper a bit uncomfortable.  This was something I never experienced with my old (Rockwell branded) product.  This continued the following day with some added problems.  The machine would suddenly jump to one side or another, and exhibit a rattling noise somewhere inside the case.  Tapping the side of the housing stopped this condition for a short time but it would start up again after about 30 seconds.  Letting the sander float, or putting some downward pressure on it made no difference.  We old-timers usually viewed this as a bearing problem.

With regard to the housing itself, sharp edges at the switch opening, and at the top capwhich is misaligned with the body-- make the unit uncomfortable to use.  Again, this is a new experience for me.  The matte finish on the housing is a dust magnet, making the machine a bit slippery, and does not clean up easily.",2.0

"Very thick very old paint will gum up the disks.  My house is 100yr old.  I had to torch the paint off then use the tool. I kept a wire wheel on a angle grinder to de clog the disk.

The tool will not remove pain from the lip of the clap boards, nor the last 3 in of the board.  It also can't get the lowest board in some situations.

What do you do about nail heads?  You can't go pounding them all in on 3"" clap board or you will split it.  I did one side of my house one year and the second the next.  All the nail heads rusted on the first side through primber and two coats of quality latex paint.  On the second side I painted all the heads with derect to metal paint.  This worked, but it took a long time.

More recently, the front spring clip came apart so I'm out of luck unless I use adhesive backed roll sandpaper now. Eventually I'll sell it and look for a better quality sander - maybe a dewalt.

It slides in the two holes but good luck tightening it and having it mounted tight with stability.  Adding this straight edge  makes the router awkward, out of balance, and heavy.

It will allow the router to twist and ""jump"" unless you really torque the screws and force the guide well against the router base.  For long reach jobs, it would be smarter to clamp a straight edge on the work piece.  For close in work, clamp a short strip of wood to the router base.  This you can trust and do cheap.  The edge guide itself is short, narrow in height, and will not permit larger bit diameters (I wanted to use it for a slot cutter for bread board joints on a table top.)

"Before I tell you why I do not like this router I guess I should first say that I am a huge fan of porter cable products. I have two of their H/L 8 hole orbital sanders, there older model two base router kit, two belt sanders and their 5"" orbital 1/4"" right angle sander. I have used these products a lot and they have not let me down. So, after my old and discontinued Sears Craftsman Professional 3 1/2 hp plunge router was dying I decided after a lot of research to buy this router. I mainly use these routers in tables that I have built with products from Rockler. I decided on this style instead of the Bosch because I was tired of dealing with a plunge style router (even though you can dissengage the mechanisim on Bosch's) and wanted to go with the twist style like my 1 1/2 hp porter cable router. First impressions when I received it was how heavy and solid it felt. I didn't like the bolt design to unlock and lock the router but I was okay with it initially. Besides the bolt I also noticed that the speed selection switch seemed a little too loose for my liking. Nothing of a big concern, but wished it had a difinitive clisk on each speed (maybe too picky). Now I had it in my router table and was using it to make 48 42"" high raised panel doors for a customer. The rails and stiles were poplar and the panels were MDF. My bits were Freuds and the panel raising bit had an undercutter. I bought two of these. The rails and stiles went well, but I did notice how the motor would wind up and down when the wood was going through the bit. No issues other than that for this part, but it went down hill from there. When using the panel raising bit I chose to make three pasess at the proper speed so I would not tax the motor too much. I had dust collection above and below the router at all times, especially with MDF. About 1/3 into the panel bits the router was sounding rough. Every 8 panels I would let the router cool down and I would vacumn out and around the router, but after the second batch of panels it sounded like the bearings were getting rougher. Needless to say when I finished the next day my new router was sounding bad. I finished the job and was finished with the router. Under warranty, it is now being fixed at my local PC dealer. I called amazon and since it is past the 30day policy they would only refund me 80% of the total bill. I am very bummed out about this and hopefully I just got a lemon, but my old router served me for 14 years of light to moderate use and never had a motor problem. Oh well, I have to wait and see from here.
UPDATE.....03/21/14
  While my router was out getting fixed under warranty I needed a 3hp router to continue with my projects and decided on a Bosch and I am happy I did.  I will write a review for it soon, but it is smoother, quieter (just a little), and has some great features for a plunge router this size.  My porter cable does run better since I have gotten it back from the service department at my local pc repair shop, but since I have gotten the Bosch I only run panel bits on it not the PC.",2.0

Come on -- what's wrong with 1.5 or 3.5?  Who the heck designed this base anyway. A mixed bag for a lot of bucks.",2.0
"I am disappointed with this purchase.

I was looking forward to having a great new tool to work with this weekend.  I've never owned anything by Porter-Cable, so I was looking forward to a quality tool.  But I disovered problems that made me spend a couple hours trying to figure out what if anything is wrong.  Now I'm going to have to find out how to get it repaired or just send it back.  This, I'm sure, will take another couple hours and maybe I won't have the tool for several weeks.

The problem is that the extended blade guard rubs up against the saw blade.  The edge of the saw blade comes very close to this guard.  It has very little clearance on one side and a lot of clearance on the other side.  It makes contact when adjusting the depth of cut.  I really don't want to see what happens when the blade is spinning at 4,500 RPM and hits this guard.  Not to mention if I get a blade with thicker carbide teeth.

Other problems:  I had to add a little oil.  After following instuctions to check oil level, I determined that some gear oil was needed.  Also, there is some cheesy looking stop bolt on the bottom of the saw body that contacts the sole plate at the deepest cut setting.  This looks like it doesn't belong.

The manual is very poor.  The diagrams are hard to read.  I had trouble identifying parts.  I had assumed that Porter-Cable would be made in the US.  Wrong.  Made in Mexico.

I wish someone made a quality corded trim saw.  I'm probably not going to use it enough to justify a rechargeable system.  Also, I think I would be a little more careless with a cordless cutting tool.",2.0
"I bought this router thinking that it would have no problem cutting raised panels based on PC description of the product.  When I received the router I tried cutting raised panels in red oak with a  3 1/2"" panel cutter, the router stalled and had to be reset. I thought something was wrong with it so I called PC and they sent me a new one. It did the same thing.  You'll have to take at least 4 passes and even then chance burning the wood if you use this router. It worked great on all other bits except the large panel raiser, which is why I bought it. I could've spent a whole lot less for a router to use with my smaller bits.  When I contacted PC about the problem they informed me that that was the design of the router circuitry to stall if too much load was applied.  Having to take 4 passes in red oak is a bit excessive. I've had the router for 2 years and ready to throw it in the drawer and not use it.",2.0
I expected a series of graduated diameter general purpose guides.  What I got was what appears to be a collection of guides made for individual special purposes.  There was no indication in the advertising of the diameter of depth of the guides and I would not recommend them unless you know in advance of this information.,2.0
"This kit is just average. Although all the inserts fit well, they are low grade metal, and without a centering locator which should always be supplied with one of these kits, the inserts are difficult if not impossible to center, resulting in worn out bushings.

"I've had my speedmatic for a couple of years.  It seemed to have a lot of power but would often freeze up while panel raising - even in MDF and making multiple passes.  I hate the locking screw and it did eventually strip out just like every other PC router I've owned.  I found that a vice-grip C clamp worked better and faster.  I also had the dust problem on the threads.  I learned to remove it often from the base (table mounted) and dust it off and spray it with silicone.  That seemed to help.  I fried it last month while panel raising and had to go back to the small 691 model to finish up.  I've had the 691 for 10 years and can't seem to burn it up although the base (is not as high qualified).  PC offers a lump sum rebuild for ($$$) but I'm not going to do it mainly for the principle of the matter. I think PC needs to do some updating.  Their design is so last century.

"I've been using this router for about a year now. I bought it as dedicated router for a fancy ""Norm Abrams"" style router table. I have used it a fair amount, and am sorry to report that it has not held up well, despite the fact I've treated the tool with the utmost respect.
The main problem is with the height adjustment. There's a large ""screw-thread"" mechanism between the motor housing and the base that adjusts the bit height when the motor is rotated relative to the base. At the time I bought the router, other reviewers pointed out that as the motor heats up, the casing expands, making it difficult to adjust the bit height. There's also a tendency for dust to get lodged within the space when it's used upside down in a router table. This exacerbates the tendency for it to stick.
Once it starts to stick, the soft aluminum housing begins to get scored. Once that happens, it gets scored some more, which causes it to stick some more, and so on...At this point, I find it very difficult to adjust the bit height at all, and even more difficult to change bits while its mounted in the router table, since that requires the motor housing to be completely unscrewed from the base (unless I go through the tedious process of separating the router base from the router table)
I can state with conviction that since I was aware of the potential for this problem before I bought the router, I've treated it with great care. At the time I bought the tool I believed that with careful treatment and good sawdust hygiene, I would avoid the pitfalls the others had experienced. Time has proven me wrong however.
It's difficult to simply recommend against buying this router, since there are no other good choices for a great router table setup. In all other respects, it's an outstanding router. It's unbelievably smooth, and since it so heavy, it absorbs most of the bit vibration. This translates into an incredibly smooth, precise cut. And since it is immensely powerful, it's possible to take deep cuts. In practice, it operates like something between a router and a shaper. Simply wonderful!
So - would I buy it again for my router table setup?  Probably not.  And for these reasons: 1) Bit changes are a pain in the A. I'd look for something with a more convenient height adjustment mechanism, so that bits can be changed easily while its upside down in a router table.  2) The tendency for dust to collect between the housing and base is a real problem. Its just a design flaw. The router wasn't designed to work upside down. 3) The soft aluminum used for the housing is crap. I have an old PC router with the same height adjustment mechanism, but the housing is made of steel. After years and years of use, it still works OK. So why did PC switch to aluminum?
Good luck in making your decision.",2.0
I'm a huge Porter-Cable fan and I was disappointed in these bushings.  I feel that the plastic case they came in was cheap.  Also the bushings weren't labeled on the actual bushings just on the plastic container.  For the money I would recommend searching somewhere else for guide bushings.,2.0
"I prefer brass. The Porter Cable guides are fine, they install easily, center easily, and perform flawlessly,, Most of the time. Just once in a while though, they fail completely. Steel, no matter how you protect it, will eventually corrode. Mine turned white and rusted, not all over, but on one side or the other. My guides often get removed from the case and hauled out to the job-sites while attached to the router. Early, foggy mornings and those sudden summer-time cloud bursts, expose my tools to far more of the elements than I like. So maybe,, it's my fault. But brass just hasn't let me down yet.

 Search ""brass template guide set"" and be amazed at the difference in price and the fact of the quality of these ""no-brand"" guides. Occasionally you may need to shine them up a little, but being solid brass, that's not a big problem. I've used both steel and brass on door hinge templates, dovetail templates, stair tread templates and strike plate templates. Brass just slides easier, smoother. On dovetail templates, especially plastic and soft aluminum the brass guides show less wear on the surfaces that the guides contact.

 I'm sorry P.C. ,,, I can't recommend these guides.

 I saw a review with a problem, the steel guides were too long and reached past the bottom of the dovetail template. With brass you can simply file the guide down to size to get the right length. Simple.",2.0
"Porter Cable 42000 Template Guide Kit

I've had a 42000 template guide kit since the mid 1990's.  The set works OK, but my advice is to buy another brand.  The P/C kit comes in a cheap & fragile hard plastic case that must have cost all of ten cents to make and the components are held in place with inexpensive cardboard separators.  In addition, after a dozen years or so, every component in my set had corroded terribly -- the metal looked similar to very old aluminum storm windows, pits and all. It's not clear why this happened, since they've never been outside the basement workshop, and no other tools corroded.  The corrosion caused significant resistance when screwing on the lock-nuts. Steel wool reduced the roughness of the corrosion, but the pieces still look dreadful.

The three largest guides in the P/C set are too long for numerous dovetail jigs, such as the Leigh jig.  It's possible to modify them to work with these jigs, by hack-sawing the excess length off the offending guides, flatten the cut end on a grinder and sanding the edge smooth.  A no-cost approach.

If you want steel guides, the Milwaukee's 49-54-0700 set comes with a nice case, and the steel finish looks a whole lot better than P/C's.  Unfortunately, the three largest guides in the Milwaukee set are also too long for many dovetail jigs

In any case, brass is a better material for guides than steel, because brass is easier on a rotating router bit if it ever touches a guide.  Once, near a day's end of routing doors for hinges, my template's locking ring came loose, allowing the guide to touch the spinning bit, and the locking ring to rub against the router-bit lock nut.  Since the guide and ring were brass, no noticeable damage to the bit or router occurred.  Had I been using any steel template with a steel locking ring, the bit or router could have been damaged.  Try ""brass router template"" via Goggle - and buy a kit made of solid brass, in a decent case, for less money than this set.

"Bought this saw yesterday based on my long and happy experience with several other Porter Cable Tools, even though I had trouble with the blade change in the store. Error!  Practice at home got me sore fingers and frustration. Finally figured out (actually, my neighbor figured out) that if you pull the blade out at an angle to the side while pulling to the front and squeezing the tabs (!)it is easier to remove - not easy, but easier.  Insertion remains a problem.  Unacceptable for ... saw.
Oh - 6'1"" 240#, in construction for 20 years; never actually been accused of being a wimp, but I am getting older.  Not with this tool though - going back for the Bosch tomorrow.",2.0
"As was stated before, the blade does not track parallel to the rails.  If you don't cut wide boards that require you to use the slide mechanism, you can adjust the 90 degree detente to actually cut 90 degrees but then your other detentes will be off due to the blade being toed either right or left.  Whether you adjust the dentente or not, engaging the slide will reveal the discrepency one way or another.

One of the nice features of a slide in addition to capacity is the ability to choose how you make a cut. When a blade goes through wood, the back end or where the blade emerges from the cut is where you get tear out, or damage to some degree.  The slide and chop ability gives you more control over the quality of the cut as you can do a number of combinations to reduce damage to the back end of the cut. However with this saw, if you want to use the slide you'll always be figuring out how to compensate for the error. Also, when cutting to length, when you use the slide you will still have difficulty cutting accurately.  Lining up the tip of the blade with the line drawn on the wood will not give you an accurate cut length wise.  More material is taken off because as you draw the blade through the wood as either the front end or back end of the cut will take off more depending on which way the blade is toed.

When making a miter cut, in order to get some sort of accuracy you have to experiment with the angle because you can't trust the 45 degree  detent.  Since the cam lock will want to fall into the dentent if you try to make too close of an adjustment, you are severly hindered in getting that accurate angle.  Also, the mis-aligned blade will cause burn when making miter cuts.  Perhaps Dewalt's new 12"" slider will not have this problem.  This issue really limits the functionality for any kind of decent woodworking and carpentry. I sold mine and will be getting the Makita.

Update.  I have since bought the Hitachi C12LCH (no slide).  I decided to save a few bucks.  Makes a very accurate reliable cut (when using a good blade), though i do miss the features a slide gives.  The only issues i have with the Hitachi are small and related to features.  One other note, having used the Hitachi for the past 4 months or so, has really given me a new pespspictive on just how much of a hassle and how poor that 708 was.

Also, the error in alignment was substantial at 1/16"". If i could i would revise my grade to one star.",2.0
"I am not a contractor, but a homeowner who is building my own house.  The DW708 is an excellent tool when it is new; however, over a short period of time, with inconsistent use, the slides get loose and does not cut an accurate angle.  You must keep the locking screw snug which is not the way it is supposed to operate in that it is then difficult to slide without this screw being loose.  It also has no dust protection in the table bearings and eventually becomes difficult to move the table from one angle to another.  Again, I do not use the saw everyday so I am confident that anyone who depends on this tool daily to give them accurate angles would be disappointed after a short time.",2.0

"For some time now I have heard people rave about the DW 12"" slider BUT I do not agree. I have used them on site for 2-3 years now and I really don't like them. First problem you can't disable the set degree lock. I have spent many valuable mins trying to get the lock to stay 1 degree off the set angle only to have the lever lock fail in the middle of the cut causing the saw to buck!! that alone is enough to throw this tool away. It is dangerous! The lever lock can be tightened (by flipping the saw OVER!) but it comes out too easily and too often. The next prob is the looooooong arm that is vulnerable to passers by and if it is dropped it will bend ( I have seen it ). Now onto the slide it self, there aren't any bearings!! there is just a whimpy screw that comes loose as well. How can a professional rely on a piece of equipment that is in constant need of retuning? Yes the 2 way tilt is nice but...  I am not bitter, DeWalt makes a great fixed compound mitre I have one but as for their slider it is dangerous, inaccurate and wears poorly",2.0
"I am a huge fan of DeWalt products and own a dozen or so  DeWalt tools. This light was a disappointment. If you want to use the battery as a base and point the lamp at something the flexible shaft can't retain it's position. Worse yet, as the light starts to sag the whole thing can topple. The problem is the flexible shaft is not very stiff. The light output is very bright and remains charged for a long time.",2.0
"I bought the 708 over a year ago and I wish I had tried to return it sooner ( one year warranty). I had only used it to cut 2x4's when setting up my shop along with other rough work, but I noticed it always pinched near the end of the cut. I thought the lumber was just  warped but after I started to build my kitchen cabinets and finding that the cuts were not square I put a straight edge on the fence, it was nearly 1/16th  off in the center. Not only that but the base was at least that much low as well. I've checked some floor models at Home Depot and seen the same problem. I have now basically half a saw because I can only cut from the right side,having to make two cuts because if the board is too long it'll bind. I called Dewalt, the rep said he had heard of problems with the fence but not the base and then told me to call the local service center who said since it was over the warranty period he would have to charge me, but it would be no more than $250! Gee thanks. Also the blade is worthless I replaced it with a 96 tooth Freud. It is also underpowered, mine is the 13 amp. Overall a terrible value and poor quality to boot.",2.0
"Mechanically, this is great. The flex shaft is convenient. Takes 18V battery, which I already have for other Dewalt tools.

"I love Dewalt, but somebody skimped on the design of this thing.  I originally bought it because it flexes and wraps and it's portable.  Really, that's all the pros of this light.

"This saw was quite a disappointment.  It is just not accurate, and worst of all, the bevel adjustment moves no matter how tight you try to get it.  It seems that the bevel angle gets altered after every cut because it won't stay tight.  How professional is that?  I didn't pay this much for a tool that requires this much work.  I will definately stick with the teal tools from now on.",2.0
"I was in the market for another compound miter saw and decided I wanted  the best. I am a contractor and place a heavy demand on my tools and  equipment. I read the reviews, researched the tests, even tried one out(2  cuts on another contractors jobsite). Cost was not an issue, I wanted the  best. Well I now own a DW708 and I must say I am very disappointed! The  extended height fences are constantly in the way,you have to remove them  instead of flip them out of the way like one of the other models I have.  Anyone who owns a piece of equipment that requires the removal of a certain  piece to perform basic functions knows what happens to that part. The  tightening knob on the fence will not allow the saw to bevel to 45 r. at  max miter. The whole head sags when the bevel knob is loosened. The knob  itself needs to be tightened 1 complete turn or more and the same for  loosening. Unlike the competitions 1/4 turn leverlock. And best of all !!!!  the blade shaved a nice flat surface on the fence the first time the blade  was set at 45 r. bevel and 45 r. miter.....a pleasant surprise. And for  anyone who is buying one of these, order 2 wrenches because the cheasy  holder will ultimately lead to the loss of the original. O.K. maybe this is  a small detail but on my particular saw the DeWalt sticker on the motor is  upside down..not a big deal but while I'm at it. And to top this gem  off...not 1 accessory!! no bag, no hold down clamp, no extensions.  Again...unlike the competition. Don't get me wrong I own many DeWalt tools  and will undoubtedly buy others but until this particular model undergoes  some major improvements......SORRY......NOT IMPRESSED!!!!!!!!!",2.0

"I have had this saw for about a month maybe. I have done a couple small projects and it works very well. It WAS nice and quiet.
Until today.
I started hearing a knocking and recalled seeing a video on this being an issue of a screw that likes to loosen itself towards the back inside. The arm that comes off of the motor to be more precise. They say it was an issue that would need addressing every so often.

Well I figured this would be my problem although it is only a month or so old with relatively light use.
I figured I would open it up and use some loctite or a jam nut to keep me from dealing with this again.

Well I open it up, (really annoys me to no end that I have to take this apart this soon.) I work on my own tools and equipment.
I don't have the time or patience to find a repair place and wait for it to be fixed (maybe).
I also don't want to end up with somebody else's used machine in return.
I am a contractor so maintaining and repairing my own equipment is a no brainer for me.

Any way, I get it open and find that Dewalt did in fact fix this issue. As a matter of fact they put a jam nut on the bolt.
Ok, this is not my issue because it is nice and tight.
So I check around inside to see what is loose or broken.
I check all of the bolts and find that ALL 4 of the motor bolts are very loose!
Everything else seems to be ok. We will see tomorrow. I didn't have any more blue loctite so I will get some tomorrow and put it all back together and see how it goes from there. I will put just a light touch of it on the threads. Hopefully that will work.

I guess now that they fixed the one bolt from coming loose, now the motor takes the vibration and its bolts come loose. :)
Either that or they simply did not torque them properly, in Asia of course. I have nothing against the Asian people but I see a lot of garbage work from their factories. When they first switch manufacturing over to there, things commonly go bad. Including this product. I think I read they had problems with the tables early on in the transition over to the Asian factories with this tool.

As I said I am a remodeling contractor. Most of my tools are the black and yellow, Dewalt. I would rather count how many of their tools that I do NOT have than count what I do have of theirs. I like Dewalt a lot and I have invested deeply in their tools. In general they are very good but a few of their tools I use constantly have some very glaring issues, but In general they are very good.

So as to why the 2 stars?
I have had this this thing a very short time and I am already having to take it apart and fix it.
There is NO reason that these screws should be loose, especially this early on.
Regardless of reason. Improper torquing of the bolts, lack of a thread locker, design or what have you. There is no excuse.
They are not the cheapest tools, they wanted to jack up their profits by moving to Asia so I give no free pass to them.

So take my review as you will, good or bad. It seems to be a good scroll saw. It has been around for a good while.
But who knows how yours will come. I hear the switch is pretty weak and fails a lot. I don't know. I may not know because I use a foot switch.
By the way, if you do get one of these, buy a foot switch. It is a no brainer and I would definitely say a necessity. Thank me later.

If Dewalt wants to reimburse me some way for having to fix this, I would change my review. I don't see that happening so it will probably stay this way.

Good luck",2.0

"While this trimmer might be fine for quick roundovers and the like, it lacks the refinement and precision necessary for fine woodworking and production work. Careful observers will notice that the base and motor are not perfectly perpendicular to one another. There is too much slop in the height adjustment mechanism and set knob. Too, the base itself is not perfectly flat (place a sheet of 400 grit sandpaper on a flat table and run the base plate over it a few times. High and low spots will quickly become apparent.) All in all, the 7310 is very underwhelming in its quality and precision. As far as the ""Rotozip"" style trimmers go, the DeWalt and Bosch models offer better quality and refinement then this PC, though they, too, suffer from some of the same problems.
By far the better alternative is the tried-and-true Porter Cable 310 production router. This model has long been a favorite of professional cabinetmakers (the guys in my shop own two or three each), but it is somewhat unknown to the woodworking public at large. It is not made for mass market consumers (Home Depot/Lowes don't carry it), and PC has instead promoted the 7310 trimmer as its mainstay trim router. The 7310 trimmer, however, is but a shadow of the 310. Read some of the reviews on the 310 and you'll see what I mean. The 310 is truly a fine machine. At $100, the 7310 is not a great value. At $159, the 310 is worth every penny. Spend more now and you'll be very satisfied with the knowledge that you own the very best. More importantly, your work will show the wisdom of your choice.
Sadly, Porter Cable no longer sells the excellent offset, angle, and other optional bases for the 310. If you need these you can acquire them used or new-old-stock, but they are getting harder to find. The premium prices of these trimmers and optional bases found on Ebay attest to the loyal following the 310 has. These bases are available for the 7310, but you will still have to deal with the inferior design and quality of that trimmer. Again, go with the DeWalt or Bosch if you need a complete trim kit with all the bases. If you don't need them, get the 310 and you'll be set for life. You'll be glad you did.",2.0

"This is a nice light but I would by far choose the regular pivoting DW908. My snake light came apart in one of the sockets about as soon as I got it.

The pivoting light you set or lay over and just tilt that head to where you want it to shine and it stays there.

Very disappointing. I could have built a better fence for what I paid. Not up to Dewalt standards. Stamped metal is not flat and as others have mentioned....adjustments are not smooth.

In addition, I am having a little trouble finding what the increments on the micro-adjust represent.  I guess I can hack my way through a project with this guide but if I was a Pro, I would be annoyed. This guide feels like it was designed as an after-thought",2.0
"Unit is not much better quality as one of those old $5 plastic two-D-cell flashlights from the 1970's.  Mine arrived all wobbly from bad shipping-packing, so the switch did not stay on without careful wiggling to get it exactly into the ""right"" spot.  Also, the lens cover was falling off, and I felt it might strip the threads if I tried to screw it on too tightly.  I returned it for replacement. Quality is not ""DeWalt"" but it's okay for the price.

Functionality is pretty good.  It is very nice to have the heavy battery as its base to set it on ground and bend the flex-neck to face the light into exactly right position.  Not too much range of motion to move light head too far from over base before it falls over, though.  Light and lens is simple cheap-flashlight style, nothing precision or fancy, but it does put out a decently-even spread of light in a circular pattern without dark spots.  No beam pattern adjustability.

Basically it is a borderline-cheesy-quality product but serves its function adequately.",2.0
"bought to work on my car in a dark garage. The battery base hardly gets the lamp on it's feet unless you have a long irregular surface. there's one spot on my engine (over the fuse box) where it can stand.

even then, the wire that holds the light up does NOT support the weight. i'm always having to leave the cable in a weird position so it does not succumb. it's very frustrating. the reach of the arm is practically zero as i always have to leave the lamp dropped somewhere. it can never be raised on the metal arm.

Look at the pictures. see that the ONLY pic with the lamp raised it's almost vertical? that's the ONLY position the arm will hold. deviate one degree and it falls to the floor in slow motion.

i'm now using it as an expensive lantern around the house for when the lights goes out.",2.0
"Received this today, and after testing this light by leaving it on for about an hour, the beam developed a multicolored blue band around the edge.  This is due to the plastic reflector overheating and becoming discolored.  I opened the light up and the plastic had a burnt smell to it.  Basically a poor design as the light is unable to handle the amount of light / heat that the bulb produces over a normal period of time.  Do not recommend purchase of this unit as the reflector issue ruins what is otherwise a nice light.",2.0
The DW919 is unstable and falls over when the neck is extended forward past a certain point. You can bend the lower neck back and the upper neck forward to partly compensate for this but this limits how far the light can be extended. Also the neck is not stiff enough to maintain all positions of the light. DeWalt need to improve this product.,2.0

Very inconvenient bit depth setting combined with bad machining of adjustment parts made the tool extremely difficult to use. There was a strong burning smell after less than one foot of routing.

"I have a small CNC wood routing machine and am unfortunately stuck using this particular router because the mount on the CNC is built to accept them. So far, I've purchased probably 5 or 6 of these because they seem to be burning out at an increasing rate. The latest one I purchased barely lasted a month before developing a bearing screech and intermittently losing power which is disastrous on a CNC machine that doesn't know whether the tool is running or not and continues to plow on ahead, ripping itself apart. I'm not sure if Porter-Cable outsourced production of this item to another company or factory or what, but I feel like each router we buy dies more quickly than the last, which is strange because we've been really gentle on the machine and use it less and less due to these issues.",2.0
It's a nice little tool and it would probably work fine timming laminates.  But my use is to machine circuit boards and it had too much play in the spindle for the kind of work I needed to do.,2.0

"This product has. Multiple issues and absolutely does not do the job. Sven after bolting down on its 3 axis it still has crappy vibration. Two issues that creates problems.

"Maybe this wasn't designed specifically for my router, but I've found it to be fairly useless thus far.  I end up setting up my own fences rather than rigging this up on the plunge router.

"I purchased this tool largely on the reputation of PC - and my experience with some of their other tools. I've had it for about a year or so and have used it on a number of laminate trimming projects and as a small router with regular wood bits.  In use, the product works well.  It has the power I would expect from a small motor and the long cord length is nice.

It's getting to the use part that I have a beef with.  As mentioned in some of the other reviews, the base adjustment is poorly designed.  Trying to do fine adjustments of the bit is hit and miss.  There's a knurled wheel to adjust the height and a locking knob.  The problem is that when the locking knob is loosened enough to move the base there's way too much play in the base.  Consequently, you can't really tell where the base will end up until you tighten the locking knob.

I've also had the problem where the collet won't release the bit after use until I tap the bit a few times.

Maybe I underestimate the ease of designing a motor with a switch, but that seems like something any tool company could do.  It's the stuff that bolts onto the motor that makes the difference between a great tool and one that's not so great.  Unfortunately, this one falls into the latter camp.",2.0
"We bought this drill to upgrade from our weaker, cordless drill. I'm a 25 year old woman, with quite a bit of experience with power tools, and this was just way too strong for me. The version we got didn't have variable speeds, as some folks mention in their reviews. The speed was only: crazy high. It kept slipping out of our screws, and was impossible to use unless you were in a position to put all of your body weight into it. Heading back to the hardware store to exchange for a variable speed drill.

"I bought this unit because my 50's model 22"" Delta/Milwaukee scroll saw is near impossible  to get parts for.  I was somewhat skeptical after reading some of the reviews but decided to get it because the price was very good. Assembly and set up was easy. The unit was packaged very well and there was no damage during shipping.  The only issue I have with this saw is blade alignment.  Side to side adjustment was easy, a set screw on the left side of the top and bottom chuck makes quick work of it. The front to back adjustment is another matter. With the blade installed as straight as possible ( as far forward in the bottom chuck and as far back in the top chuck as possible), it was still 3/32"" off. Holding a piece of wood to the front of the blade and rotating it by hand the blade would move 3/32"".  I took the saw to an DeWalt authorized repair shop. They had the saw 4 days and told me it was fixed. When I picked it up I again put a piece of wood against the front of the blade and rotated it by hand. It  was better but it still moved about 1/16"". When I Showed it to the counter person he took it back to the repair guy. Minutes later he brought it back and said the repair guy says it cuts like a dream, he obviously doesn't know the intricate cuts a good scroll saw can make. Sensing I was not gong to any satisfaction there I took the unit home, patched up my old Delta/ Milwaukee and finished the project I had started.
Don't know what my next move is yet.",2.0
"Before buying this stand, please note - 1) Once fully assembled - the stand - ON IT'S OWN - is unstable and very wobbly (especially the rear single leg).  I will admit - the ENCLOSED instructions (AFTER YOU GET IT)  -  describe the last step for ""rock solid"" stability is bolting it into your floor.  My point is : only the ENCLOSED instructions say this - not the Amazon description.  Don't expect it to be ""rock solid""  -  UNLESS BOLTED TO THE FLOOR!  To maintain some form of mobility - I'm forced to concoct a fix which is not all that hard to do, but it's the idea you'll only know this after you receive the stand.  Most other stands (upon finished assembly) need no further stabilizing.  2)  The metal gauge/thickness is borderline okay.  Not like the old days...that's for sure.  Close call - but I will keep the stand and complete the ""fix"" because it's probably easier than the entire return process.",2.0

Pros:
Easy to assemble the parts provided.

I should have noticed that this one was not LED powered.

I probably should have read the existing reviews closer. Someone else mentioned that the 18 volt light wasn't that bright. It works and in a tight dark place of course a  working light that will stand up and has a swivel head could be useful. Just disappointed in the light intensity and pattern. The pattern resembles much older flashlights verses most newer ones brighter tighter light.",2.0

It was made in China.  I told the lady at the register that as soon as I go through the line I'm opening the box and if it is made in China I will return it immediately.  I ended up doing just that.  Opened the box and looked at the saw and the saw said ""Made in CHINA"" in the same place that the display model said ""Made in USA"".  I returned it, and walked over and bought the Makita instead.

I'm not sure if this is a ploy by Home Depot, or by Milwaukee or what, but it sucks.

"Graduations on fence are just stamped into the sheet metal - not what I'd call ""highly accurate"".  Appears to be about 1/16 per graduation - but it's so coarse, I wouldn't trust it.  Plan on making test cuts to verify your settings.

The fine adjustment dial (which was the main reason I bought this fence) is a bit of a joke.  There is a graduated ring (0..9) but no way to lock the ring to the knob - bump it once during series of a ""precision cuts"" and you can kiss your zero point goodbye.  Maybe if it was a bit more of a friction fit... but mines pretty easy to move.  3 options 1) Live with it and be careful not to bump it.  2) tape the knob down once you decide where ""zero"" should be.  3) superglue.

Speaking of the graduations on the adjustment dial - there's no tick-mark to line it up to (at least I don't see one).  Options - 1) pick a spot to use as your zero point 2) make a mark with a paint pen 3) use a small file to make a small notch.

The fine adjustment dial itself - there's ZERO documentation on how much it moves the fence per turn.  Just a bit of fiddling around it LOOKS LIKE 1 full turn is about 1/16. The operative word is ""ABOUT"" - it's not 1/16.  I'm not even certain it's repeatable. So if you back off 2 turns, then try to get back to a previous settng by going forward 2 turns... the backlash in the screw will probably throw you off a good bit (I haven't tested this yet).

All the lock down knobs seem to introduce a bit of flex when you crank them down - yet another negative impact on accuracy.  You could ""dial out"" that inaccuracy if the fine adjustment were better engineered.

Locking knobs / for the rails do seem to clamp down pretty securely with little to no slop in the fence once they are locked.  Reminds me of the way the wingnuts lock the fence on an old Stanley 45 plane - it was good enough 100 years ago...

Locking knob for the ""fine adjust"" <cough>  You need to be certain that you lock this down (all the knobs ""bottom out"" with a fairly positive feel - so you'll know when you are locked) If you forget this critical step, the fence alignment will move around during the cut.  DAMHIKT.

Vacuum attachment - can't say too much about it - I'm making 1.5"" deep dado's about 5 inches in from the edge - the vacuum port doesn't help much in that scenario.

Instructions:  There aren't any.  Just one page of legal CYA.

Packaging - it's a pretty big box for just the fence and a couple rods.  Waste of cardboard (aka dead tree).

Overall verdict:  If you were looking for a real ""high accuracy"" edge guide with dead-nuts 1/64 precision right out of the box - this ain't it.  If you mess around with it, you can probably work out the calibration for the fine adjustment down to 1/32 or so.  And if you are careful, plan your work and allow for test cuts to verify each change in settings - it can give you fairly accurate, straight cuts.

Dewalt could/should have done better.  They are part of the same conglomerate that owns Porter-Cable (and Delta, and Black & Decker).  The PC edge guide is the same price - but a much more robust and accurate design.  Too bad the PC guide won't fit the Dewalt routers (at least, not without some serious modification)

One tip - run the guide on the WASTE SIDE of your cut if possible, so any slips don't ruin the piece.  If you need dead-nuts accuracy (ie. you don't have a ""waste side"", then you need to be very careful. Run a couple practice passes before you commit.",2.0
After using orbital sanders for years I decided to get the random orbit.  I have been a big fan of Dewalt and did not hesitate on purchasing this tool.  The dust collection for the most part does not work.  The sanding qualities are first class.  But six inch paper is hard to find. But I stocked up when I bought the sander.  I have had to replace the switch after it quit working.  Overall It sands well but fails in the dust collection department.  Dewalt could do better.,2.0
"I have had this tool for several years now and bought it mostly because of the Dewalt name. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to expectations. First, 6 inch hook and loop pads are becoming harder to find. It seems that 5 inch pads are the current craze, especially adhesive pads. Secondly, this tool is noisy and heavy. It is hard think of it as a finishing sander. The collection bag is a joke and must have been designed by the team of Moe, Larry and Curly. The wire that gives the bag it's shape and stiffness poked a hole in the fabric the second day I used it. Very poor design. Not worthy of the Dewalt name. Its only saving grace is that due to its weight it will take rough stock off quickly.",2.0

"Pretty crappy work light. Not bright at all, very yellow and dispersed beam. For a flashlight it's fine but for a work light it's trash. There is no hook or other attachment so you can hang the light to go hands-free. Because of the battery it pretty much has to rest standing and that's where it really fails as a worklight. I was working on my car engine and tried to rest the light to angle the beam where I was looking. The light kept falling over and pissed me off so much I chucked it at the ground. Surprisingly it still worked so I tried to get back to work, only to have it topple over again and piss me off again so I chucked it at the ground again, only harder. This time the head assembly exploded. Even more surprisingly it seems to be ok except for the broken bulb. I might get the LED upgrade but it probably isn't worth it since the light is terrible as a work light. I'm still a huge Dewalt fan but not a fan of this light.",2.0

Had no end of trouble getting the thread cutting stud into the base and then had to make supports to hold the two parallel bars up and level with the table surface, then the screw that retains the endstop on the length stop was screwed in that hard  to the length stop, the surface on the bar was damaged because it took that much force to restrain it in a vice to be able to undo it.

In my opinion, they messed it up considerably and a white like this should have some flood do it",2.0
"Maybe YMMV, but I found this jig to be kind of awkward and not useful. If I were to get a similar jig again, I would get one that braced itself around both sides of whatever piece I was working on.

What they should have done is offset the holes so they could be pushed in for storage. Other saws do this, its not hard.

Used it to mill ship lap siding.  I works but the design is such that chips jam in between the base and the fence and push it out of alignment.

"First I want to direct you to go read impartial reviews of the most popular circular saws done by a large crew of framers at [...] , this is a very helpfull site. My review is as follows : I bought this saw new to replace my old beater, and I must say it has excellent power and is built very solid, great quality, it effortlessly cuts through everything I have used it on. BUT it's one big problem which is so annoying that I am unwilling to use it anymore, and will sell it because of, is that it seems designed to direct it's stream of sawdust directly at your face. It blasts chips and dust at your face and under your chin and down your shirt collar. Every time I use this saw I end up leaning out of the way in the most akward positions just to avoid this. I have used many circular saws and never had this problem, sure you will always get dusty but nothing like with this one. I hate this saw for this reason alone. Keep in mind that this saw is a ""blade on the right side of the motor"" unit and it might be better for left handed users as far as the dust in the face problem. I must admit I have not heard this problem mentioned by anyone else in any reviews so maybe I'm crazy, but I know can't make another cut with this thing. I will be replacing it with a Porter Cable 743-K(Blade on left) saw, which was the top pick at [...] and is the lightest available. Good luck.",2.0

Three 7 1/4"", one 8 1/4"", and a 10 "" chop saw, and a new 10"" compound slide miter which I love! I highly recommend all Makita tools.

"DeWalt tools are not great, to reveal my bias up-front. This one, however, is especially bad. The fence is a piece of stamped steel that is not very precise. Two plastic (ABS, I think, not even nylon) rectangles cover the fence and then a shoddily cast alignment mechanism sits off the back end. The alignment mechanism can rotate about 10 degrees in either direction along the stamped steel fence (not intentionally, either, it just sucks and is imprecise) and there is a lot of slop in the whole design.

One of the worst attributes of this guy is that because it's so loose and sloppy, you can't get repeatable measurements - even if you align a clamp on a workpiece and then expect the fence to act as a ""stop"", the distance from the router bit to each end of the fence can shift slightly as you use the tool, so your results end up being slightly off at all times. Really pretty horrible, considering that routers are precision tools.

The only reason this gets 2 stars instead of 1 is that the steel rods were fairly straight. I know it sounds trivial, but that's apparently a lot to ask for with DeWalt. Seriously, buy a different router/edge guide if you can.",2.0
"IF YOU NEED A FENCE FOR A DEWALT DW625 BUY THE BOSCH RA1054 FENCE INSTEAD.  I purchased the Dewalt DW6913 fence years ago to use with my DW625 Dewalt plunge router.  While I really like the router, and still consider it one of the better routers available,  the fence was a severe disappointment.  The two sets of guide rods( for different Dewalt router models) where well made, however the main body fence is pressed steel and was inaccurate and poor quality.  The fence seems to ride along the surface of the work at an odd angle like the metal wasn't formed exactly right .  The fine adjuster works but feel clunky.  Even with the fine adjuster I don't trust the fence for very precise cuts.  I was originally going to purchase a Microfence router guide but found the $200 cost prohibitive.  I later found that The Bosch RA1054 Deluxe router edge guide I have also fits the Dewalt DW625 router.  This router fence has similar features to the Dewalt and a similar price but is far better constructed.  Unlike the Dewalt, the Bosch fence's main body is cast aluminum like the older Dewalt( and Elu) router fences.  My only gripe with the Bosch fence so far is that it's made in China.

"This summer I completed a week long Marquetry class at a prestigeous US woodworking school. We used DeWalt Scroll Saws bought about 5 years ago. The table top was machined as smooth as glass. I decided to order one. I just received my new DeWalt Scroll Saw. Before I ordered I read customer comments about the poor finish of the metal table since DeWalt shipped production from Canada to China. I thought how bad can it be? Now that I received the saw, all I can say is WOW!! It's bad -- really bad.  The table looks and feels like it was ground with a carbarundum stone grinding wheel. The pattern is in two large arcs that intersect. If you run your finger nails over it, you can chip or file them. I moved a piece of veneer back and forth over it and it created saw dust. I own 3 large DeWalt tools in my shop and several of their hand tools. I Can't believe a company like DeWalt, with the reputation they have for producing quality products has not taken action to correct this deplorable flaw in their product. Before you order this product on line, be sure to go to a local retailer and check it out before you buy. Shame on DeWalt!!!",2.0
"Purchased in Jul 2011 and it ran well, making smooth cuts with very little vibration.  in December 2012 machine began rattling and shaking making it impossible to use.  Blade was all over the place.  Took it to the factory authorized dealer in Orlando, and three weeks and 280.00 latter I picked it up.  Ran ok, but not great.  Three weeks later it began the same problems.  Returned to dealer again.  Worked well for about 3 months, but same symptoms are beginning to return.  Sounds like it is on its last legs.  Beside those problems, I have had to buy some parts that broke totaling about $75.  Conclusion:  if your budget allows go for a better quality scroll saw such as the Excalibur.",2.0

"The face of the edge guide that touches the workpiece is a problem on the unit I got.

It has two pieces, basically split vertically in half if the router is also vertical.  One of my pieces is bent slightly towards the workpiece, or perhaps one piece is bent slightly away.  It still works, but honestly is my most disappointing purchase as far as quality goes; not good for very accurate cutting.",2.0

"DeWalt 'asianizes' yet another product.  As a somewhat advanced furniture maker this accessory will not hold up for me.  The dust collector nozzle has already broken albeit it does not affect the performance of the guide. Not near as robust as the guide that come with Bosch routers, but it won't fit the Dewalt 621 plunge router which is perhaps the best plunge router on the street. The guide looks like it was stamped out of a chinese license plate. The guide works for now,which is about all I can say.

"Well I read a lot of reviews about this saw since it is a substantial purchase for me. I agonized over spending this kind of money. Things have been a bit lean lately.
I read the negative comments about poor quality control but sort of poo pooed them. After all,as a general contractor, I own a lot of dewalt tools and am very happy with most of them, I figured I'd not have any problems surely those other guys had done something wrong.
Long story short: Opened the box this morning ,put it together in about three minutes,. turned it on..... only slow speed! Damn! fiddled with it ...no help
Called Dewalt they referred me to the closest ToolBarn. I called and checked with them . ""sure bring it in ""they said.
Got there They say "" hmmmm we'll have to send this to dewalt and it'll be twenty bucks non refundable to take it."" something they failed to mention when I called them to confirm!
I ended up taking it to a dewalt facility in San Diego where I now get to wait two weeks to drive back down and pick it up!
I figured that'd be better than returning through amazon and getting another lemon!
Why in the hell did Dewalt ship that tool without testing it - no inspector label. Its not like it was a $50 drill!
 I guess some bean counter at corporate must have made the calculation that it is cheaper to piss off a bunch of customers than it is to pay an inspector! good luck with that!
and shame on Dewalt for recommending TOOLBARN.",2.0
"I have been scrolling for 20+ years. Not long ago I bought the 4th Dewalt DW788. Still Disappointed! I bought my first Dewalt about 10 years ago. worked great (low vibration/blade shake). At the beginning of the second Year it started surging and screwing up, I took it to a qualified repair shop. He said the motor was shot. Replacement motors are well over $200. So I bought a new Dewalt. 2 years later, same problem, so this time i bought a new motor. One year later that stopped working. I have now bought my 4th DW778. It has a terrible front to back blade vibration that I can't adjust out of it. Good design, NO reliability.
I would love to buy the next better saw out there but at twice the price what will I end up with?",2.0
"I found that it was necessary to keep retightening the chuck if the operation involved any amount of vibration, like using a hole saw in plywood. I have a DeWalt drill with a keyless chuck and it stays tight in the same circumstances.

For some reason DeWalt includes a cheap plastic storage case with some drills but not with others. The cases are made of very flimsy material with crude fasteners. Buying one for a drill that comes only with its cardboard box involves spending nearly $40.  Milwaukee and Makita provide sturdy plastic cases with their drills so I don't know why DeWalt does not do the same.",2.0

I have wanted this scroll saw for ages. I was given one for Christmas. It has been in the shop 5 times since Jan. Here is the many things that have gone wrong. The upper blade stroke and the lowerstroke don't match up so the piece you are working on has to be turned over to complete the cut to get the waste area out. The table holes don't match the screws that attach the table. The speed control can suddenly start off fast then slow to the speed it is suppose to be at. You can't turn a proper tight corner it will be perfect on top and rounded out on the bottom. The blade holder underneath will not hold the blade it releases the blade even when the you are not cutting anything and it's just running. I had hoped this would be my dream saw. I paid over 500.00 for this saw. I have lost over 800 just in the last 2 months because I couldn't complete orders because it was in the shop. I am currently banging my head against the wall because parts for it are on back order to fix the blade holders. The only good thing about this saw is the repair shop is very nice and polite to work with.,2.0
"I was so excited to receive my new Dewalt Scroll Saw, however since I recieved it back in November of 2010 I have had nothing but problems with it.  It would just stop working for no reason, I took it to the approved warranty shop which is 30 miles+ away to have them call me and tell me that nothing was wrong with it, well I brought it home and proceeded to use it and it stopped working again, I was so mad that I hit it with my fist on the work table and it started up and ran so I continued on with my project and numerous times it would quit and numerous times I would hit it with my fist and it would turn back on.  I took it back to the shop and they could not even get it to turn on, they replaced several parts on it and it is working again, however the tension lever does nothing my blade is not taught like it should be.  I am so frustrated and would Dewalt to send me a new one.  I am going to write to them next.",2.0
"I have been using this model saw for roughly 20 years and have been a fan of Dewalt tools for about the same length of time.  As a finish carpenter it had a lot of features that I liked and has proven rather durable.  It seemed that I had finally given the current one enough abuse so I picked up a new one.  I needed it for doing precision work on a cabinet project.  Although the manual stated that all of the adjustments had been set at the factory, upon removing it from the box I double checked because of the accuracey I need.  First the bevel angle would not zero by more than a degree, and then I discovered the sole plate was warped and while one rail was parallel to the blade the other was not.  This makes the saw completely useless for my needs and to a certain extent if the blade can't be made parellel to a cutting guide this could cause dangerous binding.  First Black and Decker bought Porter Cable and has made it a mediocre product and I fear they are taking the good name of Dewalt there too.  Perhaps this was just a lone bad one, but just comparing the quality of the sole plate with the one on my current saw, which I replaced a few years ago, I see a difference there.",2.0

"I LOVE my other DeWalt portable tools, have a small, but growing collection. I got this because I already had some 18volt batteries. This light doesn't come up to the standard of those other tools. The balance is poor, with all the weight in the big 18volt battery, the amount of light emitted is OK, but certainly not bright. For this kind of money, and from DeWalt, it should have been an LED. The swivel head idea seems to be basically a cheesy gimmick. I'll be keeping it but wouldn't recommend anyone else buying it.

Bottom line: the thing needs a complete redesign to be a part of an otherwise good family of tools.",2.0
"Meh. I thought this light would be a lot more versatile than it turned out. The head rotates but it's really hard to get it to aim exactly where you need it to. Once the battery is on it is pretty heavy and bulky. Brightness is weak.

Product arrived on time as advertised with no problems.  Shipping was outrageous.  I didn't note it at the time and would not have ordered if I had of noticed.  That was my fault.

"We've been using these saws in our middle school wood shop for the last five years.  In that amount of time, I've lost track of how many times I've had these in for repairs.  It's more of a hobby saw that can not stand up to serious use.  In addition, one saw that we purchased, stopped working a week after we took it out of the box.",2.0
"Overall, I've been disappointed with the Delta Sidekick miter saw with the integral stand.  Almost from day one, I have found pieces of the stand which have fallen off.  The screw that the blade guard pivots on was not seated far enough and starting to wobble after a few weeks of use.  This was an easy fix, though because I just replaced it with a longer screw.  The next thing that happened was that the screw that holds the blade guard on (back and top of the saw) broke off rendering the guard unusable.  I had to remove the blade guard which makes using this saw a little unnerving.  I thought at the time of purchase I was saving myself a few bucks but you know the old adage - you get what you pay for!",2.0
"I bought this really wanting to like it, because I had a big set of 18v tools and a collection of batteries, and several of the other lights that I am happy with.  But, it doesn't really ""carry"" comfortably, to carry it while walking around outside (I to live in a rural area will no street lights) you've either got to hold it out in front of you (which is kinda tiring on the arm) or twist the light around to shine straight ""up"" so that it can be held as a normal flashlight, but then the battery hanging off the back keeps it way off balance.

So, the ergonomics aren't great, I'd be willing to work around them if the bulbs didn't blow out at the smallest tumble. And, then they want over $9 for a pair (amazon.com pricing, good luck finding them in the store).

I really wish they made a decent LED light to use the 18v battery. I'm not going to start buying dewalt tools that use a different battery any time soon, if ever.",2.0
"Essentially this adds up to having a $60-ish workhorse powerhouse of a battery on the base, with a rather cheap flashlight attachment that is worth maybe $5. I've had this light hanging around for a couple of years from a combo set. It actually works well enough, though I don't often need a worklight. We recently had a 4 day power outage and this was great while it lasted both as a very bright flashlight, and to point at the ceiling to give some nice general non-glare room illumination.

It only lasts about two hours on a charge is the problem. If anything screams out for an LED bulb, this is it, but at this point DeWalt doesn't even offer that as a separate bulb. They do sell a 12V LED worklight which sounds just awesome, but I don't have the 12V system, I have the 18V. With an LED this would never burn out the bulb. This one will last maybe 10-15 hours which is not what you want in an emergency light with no spare. Also if you drop this light the bulb filament will probably break, LED's are much more robust. Moreover, with the same brightness it would go probably 8-12 hours on a charge or more. That would be pretty much my essential emergency light. I would buy two or three.

Though the gooseneck probably looks like the better design. What really kills this is that the head ought to swivel so it could point downwards while standing upright on the battery base. You could work at a table or workbench with the light pointed at your work. But this only swivels from straight up to horizontal, which is really not all that useful.

In short, wait for them to offer the gooseneck with an LED, and get two, it will be super.",2.0

"If you like to saw out a few items in the garage then this will work for you, but don't expect it to perform day after day in a
woodshop.  First be careful of the blade holder.  It is made of caste iron and if tightened too much will break.  A replacement takes weeks to get.  The blade tension lever will wear out which requires you to tape the lever into position. We have also ""burnt out"" two motors in a eight month period.
Having said all that it realy is a good machine for the hobby person.  The blade is easy to change, the table easy to adjust, and the variable speed is handy.  Further, Dewalt has been very helpful in their customer service.  We have also tried the comparable Delta saw, and find the Dewalt easyer to operate.
In its price range, I would say it is the best available.",2.0

"I was very excited to get this light...initially, I liked it. Out of the packaging, I hooked it up to the 18V battery and it worked, emitting a fairly bright beam. The sales ad says that it comes with an ""extra"" bulb, which was not included. I emailed Amazon regarding the issue and they sent a 2nd light to my address, instead of sending a bulb or two (?). It is worth mentioning the the re-ship did not have the extra bulb either. I had pretty much decided to just purchase the other light as well, thinking I could use one and leave one in the work truck as a spare. Then, I was using one of the lights, hit it pretty hard with a board I was using in an attic, and it fizzled. I went and got the other light, used it the rest of the morning, then went to use it in the afternoon and it was burnt out too - with little to no abuse (that I can remember). I sent both of the lights back - they aren't as durable as they should be. Instead, I ordered two of the flexible-head lights (Dewalt 18V). A few of my friends have these and have had no issues. I will leave a review for those as well when I have had time to put them to the test.

"I'm using this for a Sears contractor saw. My major gripe is the steel around the pivot foot flexes. When I push down the pivot it only lift fixed feet about 1/16 of an inch, the rest of the lifting action is absorbed by the flexing Steel.  This wasn't the case at first, it's gotten worse over the past month. The other gripe is the assembly. I knew about having that glue up your own one and a half inch stock but if I had to do it over again I don't think I would bother.
  Maybe for a lighter machine this would work for table saw I would not recommend it.",2.0
"I'm a little perplexed at the high rating for this one.

I chose it because of the price, obviously, but also the design. I wanted to do the terrible thing I should never do and put a drill press on a mobile base, for reasons I won't bore you with.
It's a very squat drill press that isn't as top rear heavy as most, and because this is a design that lowers to flat, (like on my laguna bandsaw) rather than stays mobile until you lock a wheel, I thought it would be the one.
The tool in question was around 280 pounds, and I found out the hard way that you can't edge the tool onto the base using cardboard and slide it over. The steel is super soft and I bent the front edge down, even though I used wooden wedges to raise it up and over.
I thought it was a little odd when I was tightening the wheel bolts and without even feeling it the whole space crimped together. I had to loosen them and bent it back out. It's REALLY soft.

Despite what others have said, there are the correct number of bolts. You just have to be careful about which ones you use and for what. The instructions are terrible. The contrast is set so high on the copy that it's blurred and hard to make out diagrams.
For whatever reason the parallel wheels don't use the exact same carriage bolts that everything else uses, despite the frame having square holes to accept them, and it seems logical that many use up their bolts and then think they've run out at the end when it comes time to add the final piece (the foot pedal and swivel).
The wheels use regular hex nuts.

I think when you figure in the hardwood for the frame (1.5""x1.5""), and the very soft steel brackets with open ends on every corner, you might come to the realization that this isn't as great a bargain as it first appears.
I had enough scrap to not have to buy the hardwood, but if you need to purchase wood, you would find an all metal solution far superior and for a similar cost.

Overall, this is a harbor freight level of quality with extremely scratchable and unprimed painted parts, and while I did get the correct number of bolts, the quality of the hardware isn't there. It's cheap.
I used maple for the frame, and it's remarkably bouncy once locked down. I'm okay with a little bit of movement to sacrifice for a mobile base, but this is a little more than I'm okay with.

Oh one other slight gripe. The foot pedal has a tendency to stay flipped up when you lower the tool back to the ground.. You can adjust the tightness from rattling around to almost completely locked, and it seemed like the mechanism could have used some kind of spring return here..
It isn't terrible, and it will work, but I won't be buying another. I cheaped out, and I got what I paid for.",2.0
"I have had a DW-911 for several years and wish I had never purchased it.  It charges batteries okay but only if the radio is turned on which is inconvenient if you want your battery to charge overnight.  The radio is almost useless inside a building unless you are working beside the radio station you want to listen to.  As one reviewer wrote the best thing you can do to improve radio reception is to throw away the antenna and put a length of copper wire in the antenna hole.  I have talked to DeWalt twice and they admit they  have a problem, but don't have any plans to do anything about them.  That kind of response is very bothering to me since I used to consider DW a top of the line manufacturer.  If you need a charger buy a charger.  If you need a radio buy a boom box.  If you want a neat looking black and yellow box that looks like a radio buy a DW-911.",2.0
"I put a Laguna 1412 bandsaw on this base which weighs 258 pounds, under the stand's rated weight.  When the stand is raised the metal corner pieces flex quite a bit before lifting the corners.  This causes the rubber feet to only lift a small amount off the floor, and in my case one foot still rubs.

Otherwise the stand assembled fine.  There is a misprint in the directions, it mentions the user having to drill 7/16"" holes but there are actually only eighteen; four for each corner bracket and then two for the caster wheel.  There are twenty overall but the two foot holes are 5/16"".",2.0

On a Job site or  garage I really don't care if it's Stereo or Mono, just a clear signal. My  cheap pocket radio with just mono ability picks up the signal fine most of  the time.

This light leaves a lot to be desired. The neck needs to be stiffer so it doesn't droop and the power needs to be increased for a stronger bulb. The amount of light provided by this lamp is weak.,2.0
"The saw is great, the light needs a little work. Unlike what the picture implies, the light fastens at the very back of the saw. The light extends out straight to the front of the saw. Given how far out it has to stretch and with the weight of the light fixture attached, it should be stiffer. After running the saw for a while, the light actually starts to droop down. You have to keep pushing it up. The size of the light head is nice as you can get close to your work without the fixture obstructing your view. The downside of the fixture size is that the bulb is difficult to screw in. There's no room to get your fingers around the bulb. I finally taped a piece of masking tape to the front lens so I could screw it in. I'm not looking forward to replacing the bulb, I don't know how I would loosen it. The unit is made in China but is well constructed. Nothing sloppy about it. Bolts on the saw perfectly using the two rearmost bolts that are already on the saw. The hex key they provide could be a little better fit but it did work.  All in all the concept is a good one. It's a nice accessory to have, makes cutting a lot easier. I hope Dewalt will re-engineer it and bring it up to the standard of their scroll saw.",2.0
"This is a great little saw. Powerful, light, fast and accurate. But if you're not careful you can spin the blade on the shaft. I did on a job rough cutting some 1"" hardwood planks. Didn't really notice till the end of the day that the saw blade was running out of round. When I took the blade off I found the blade had cut a grove on the shaft. This should never have happened, the shaft should've been hardened.
I will probably buy another and be more careful.",2.0
"While the saw works great as I used it to cut through some interior doors I was replacing but it has a big design flaw!  There is a guide plate that has about an inch on one side of the blade and over three inches on the other.  If you were making a cross cut and wanted to slide this guide against a straight edge you would want to use the 3+ inch side to have more support for the saw, right?  The makers of this saw built the motor so low to the guide plate that it cannot slide against anything more than an 1/8 tall.  This is really stupid.  The saw works with the guild plate if you are cutting something thin like plywood, because you can raise the saw up (making the cut less deep) to clear your straight edge. The solution: for cutting something thick like interior doors, where you might want to use a straight edge - you have to use the one inch side.  Not great support for the saw - but it works.",2.0

"I purchased this light for the Dewalt DW788 scroll saw that I bought for my wife.  I have SEVERAL Dewalt power tools and am USUALLY EXTREMELY happy with them. This light is an exception.  It is bright, but that comes at the expense of temperature.  It warms up the work area which might be good in the dead of winter, but not in the summer.

It attaches securely to the side of the saw but the head is TOO HEAVY for the goose neck. It is a very poor design, which is not something that I'd expected from a Dewalt product.  The head and goose neck lower automatically, which is a bad thing. The only way to keep it over the work area is to straddle it over the center bar so that it rests on the other side, making any adjustment almost impossible.  However then it vibrates from the motion of the saw, making it very distracting and difficult to work with.

I will continue to buy Dewalt tools, but had I known about the light's shortcomings, I would NOT have purchased it.  My wife bought an really nice OttLite fluorescent magnifier / light unit that we mounted to the Dewalt stand. It works GREAT!!!!!",2.0

However, we kept using these crown stops and the joints never lined up cleanly, even being coped.  One day I was sharing the saw with someone cutting shelf boards and so I just opted to do the old school double bevel cuts.  OMG!  I figured out the problem.  It was the stops.

"This mobile base lifts my radial arm saw about 1/4"".  My garage floor is not perfectly flat so when I move the saw it bottoms out.  I normally really like Delta tools but this is very disappointing.",2.0
"Unless you need a custom size I'd suggest buying a different base. The actual product itself once constructed isn't bad. It does a good job overall.

But it could easily be a lot better. Let's review.
1) They require using 1 1/2 X 1 1/2 boards. Why not the standard 2x4?

2) They suggest using a hardwood as the boards will be so thin you shouldn't use Doug Fir. Again, if you used a standard size that would not be necessary. A 2x4 doug fir is plenty strong and is about 3$ these days, using a hardwood would be a lot more expensive. I assume people who purchase this product would probably have enough spare/scrap 2x4 in their garage/basement that with a standard size you don't have to make a trip to get the hardwood. I ended up ripping a 2x4 into strips and attaching an additional strip as a workaround.

3) They suggest using a drill press to make sure the holes are perfectly aligned. They weren't kidding. The holes need to be perfect or you'll be spending a long time making them work. I of course have a drill press. Doesn't everyone? It's next to my planer and joiner. [sarcasm] Anyone who has a press probably also has a swank table saw that doesn't need you to provide it's own base.

4) The instructions are almost illegible. It reads like they were typed up from napkin scribbles by a non native English speaker. The author clearly did not actually build the product. You know the old joke about ""Step 23, insert grenade housing into shell (see diagram k3 on page 72). Step 24, After you turn section A base 1/4 turn or grenade will explode."" That's what reading them felt like. At one point I struggled to undo a step because the next sentence described something else I had to do first. There are pictures, but they are so low-res they are almost worthless.

Eventually I tossed the instructions and just put it together how it made sense to me. Once I did that it went a lot easier.

If you attempt this, I recommend buying the hardwood. It will help. Read the instructions all the way through twice. (Reading them aloud to yourself might help. I was constantly re-reading as I went and referring to legends on previous pages to make sure I had it right and I still made a few boo-boos.) Cut the boards as directed. Then lay out the pieces using the boards and the metal connectors under your saw and mark where you'll be drilling with a pencil. Then drill the holes, using a drillpress if possible. It will really help. Use a friend's or ask a shop to drill the holes for a small fee. If your holes are even a little off the pieces won't fit. Once you've got the bolts through the holes and tightened you're almost done. Good luck.",2.0

"As a remodeling contractor, I bought this DeWalt model primarily for drywall, and find it way too high powered for that application.  The RPMs are too high for setting screws other in an open field (I found myself dropping this DeWalt tool and picking up my old cordless 3/8"" Makita variable speed reversable all-purpose drill to set screw in corners and along joints where I needed better control and lower RPMs than the DeWalt would give me).  This DeWalt may work for deck screws, but I never gave it a chance for that application before dropping it from my tool collection so frustrated with its drywall application.  Hybrid tools are compromises - If you want a drywall screwdriver, buy one that's designed only for that purpose.",2.0
"I guess its my fault, I bought a new DeWalt scroll saw and figured since the saw got 4 and 5 star reviews the light was safe to buy. I was wrong. I attached this light to my saw and it will not hold its position. There are reviews going back all the way to 2006 with this issue and DeWalt still has not corrected the problem, I am losing faith in the company named DeWalt, it's bad enough they are being ran by the same people who run Black and Recker, but DeWalt had always seemed to build a quality product, but since they made Porter Cable a second or third tier tool company it seems DeWalt may be on the same path as PC is on. It's a shame, too few real companies own too many tool company names. They have eliminated their competition by buying them up and keeping their name, so today you have 5 or 6 tool lines being built in the same factory coming down the same Chinese assembly line. They seem to have sacrificed quality and workmanship to save a buck or two so they can sell their tools in the Big Box stores. DeWalt and Porter Cable use to be top of the line tool companies, a tool you could buy for a little extra cash but would last forever, not anymore.",2.0
"This is the second light you sent, and it doesn't work any better than the first one I returned.  The problem is that it still does not hold itself in place, and just drops when it's extended out over the saw cutting area.  I want to send it back, but I don't have the original box it was sent to me in.  I stopped by the local Woodcrafters store to see what I must have done wrong.....the light they have displayed on their saw is great, it holds itself where positioned, so there must be a good one out there....I'm very disappointed in the product and would love to return it to you for a third try.  NOT good.  let me know if or how to return this reorder to you.  Jim",2.0
My last Dewalt scroll saw work light was everything I could ask for and had no problem ordering another one 3 years later.  This one looks exactly the same but the flexible neck does not want to stay in any position but straight for more than a few seconds.  Somehow they must have changed materials or specifications and got it way wrong.  I will have to make modifications to the saw to try and improve the function of the light.  Needless ot say I was disappointed based on the performance of the one from 3 years ago.,2.0
"What they don't tell you it the limited capacity. I had to modify them to work with 8"" crown.",2.0
The flexible stand does not keep the light in place.  It drifts and is unable to stand unaided.  Planning on contacting the company.,2.0
"I think these would be great for lighter homeowner type tools or tools that are somewhat light to start with such as drill presses and band saws. I actually purchased it for a Rockwell cabinet saw. The saw is simply to heavy for the light weight metal these are made out of. However, I like the concept so well that one of these days I might just go to the metal yard and get some steel tubing and weld up something a bit more stout for the saw. I will probably take this and use it on some other machine. So my recommendation would be it is OK for a contractor type table saw but not a light industrial iron table saw, jointer, or planer.",2.0
"Overall, this is an ""ok"" light that I will probably replace with something else - I should have read the reviews a little more carefully prior to ordering this.  The light's arm is not strong enough to hold the light in the ""up and over"" position I want it to be in - you are basically stuck with it being just a couple of inches away from your work.  That was probably what the designers had in mind as the can is only rated for a 25 watt bulb that is a pain in the neck to screw in (why does it have to be so tight fitting?); I like a lot of light around my projects, and even with every light in my shop on plus this little scroll saw light it is barely adequate.

I would save your money and buy a separate light that cranks out the power - you want to be able to see your work without the distraction of the light can being so close to your project.",2.0
"Easily attached and a useful addition. Unfortunately, the light bulb was defective and I was unable to get a replacement or a refund for the bulb I had to purchase. I could, of course, return the entire device, but why for just a single $5.00 light bulb?",2.0
"the product was made in China, which explains it's quality control problem.  The design is good, but Delta is not watching it's suppliers close enough.  The main problem was the assembly hardware was a mix of Standard bolts and metric nuts.  In a couple of cases a specific bolt would be standard and its matching nut would be metric.  I would probably not buy this product again.",2.0
"I have urgently replaced this base (suppose to be mobile base) by HTC2000. Absolutely no contest. Wheels are too small to keep equipment parallel to the floor surface. In addition, it is not as sturdy as HTC2000; is more expensive and is more cumbersome.",2.0
"I purchased this for my jointer, but after setting all the pieces together on my bench, I realized the smallest width it could be was 16"". My jointer measures 12"". I had to put a plywood base into the finished framework to set the jointer on. I have the HTC mobil base and for now on thats what I will purchace. As with the other reviewers, It's sloppy with the 1 1/2"" boards. The back roller run on the outside edges because of the slop. They tell you to drill 7/16"" holes and that is way to big. For those of you that don't have a drill press, you need to mark both sides of the boards and drill from both sides. This will give you a more accurate hole. I am verry dissapointed with this mobil base.",2.0

"I got these for my girlfriend because she is a graphic designer. She loves them and they work perfectly. However, the plastic piece holding one of the booklets together broke on the first usage...

The case is fine for its purpose.  Too bad the lightwedge is not as good. I guess I will find other uses for the case. It is soft and seems durable.,3.0
I was not as impressed with this book light as I was hoping. It needs more LEDS to actually make the coverage on the page more even. It's hard to get the smudges off the plexiglass. You definently need the protective case to store it in to keep from scratching it.,3.0
"i originally rated this item 5 stars when i first got it. but after using it for a while the lights flicker and the flimsy battery cover has broken one of the little legs that hold it in. it is super bright, which is great and i would love it except for the flickering issue that others have also had. i hope they release a newer version with this issue corrected because i would definitely buy it.",3.0

"I bought this light so that I could read on the long trips my husband and I take during the winter months. I tried it for the first time this weekend, and it does illuminate the pages well. I also like the design in that it does bend really well and is very flexible. It is a quality light.

I guess it comes down to preference as to how bright someone actually wants their booklight. The highest setting was too bright and it hurt my eyes to try and read with it. The second setting (the setting that lead me to believe that it would be more comfortable to read with) was a little better, but still too bright for complete darkness. I ended up folding a thin piece of paper around the light in order to read comfortably with it.",3.0

Eventually all the knocking around wore it out and the back cover wouldn't stay on, so I ordered a new one.  The current version is way too bright even with just one light on.  For anyone who has sleep issues, you know you should be avoiding bright light--like a too-bright tablet or laptop screen--before bed or in bed.  The new bulbs really make the white pages glare--and unlike a tablet, you can't adjust that.",3.0

No as bright overall as I would have liked.  Bright spot and dim the rest of the page of my Kindle.  Constantly fiddling with it trying to get light better.  At least it does attach well to the cover and stays in place.,3.0

Rather disappointed with this light.  The light is not bright enough for me and has a blueish tint rather than a clear light with a warmer tint.,3.0
"I was in the market for a book light that would work well at night and would travel well. The light on this works great and there are two settings, both of which are pretty bright. The ""neck"" of the light is very bendable and sometimes starts folding itself when you don't want it to. Also, it doesn't travel well as there isn't a good way to keep the light from turning itself on if it rubs against something in your bag. With that being said, the light itself does serve its purpose so I still give it 3 stars.",3.0

"Ok well this is certainly mighty and bright - but I don't need the light of a new born sun when reading at night. Even the one-bulb setting is much too strong.

"very cheap, unwieldy",3.0
"This is a really good light, but over time the neck has lost its support. So now, when I'm reading and I set the light on the page, it starts to sink down immediately. It didn't start doing this until I had it for more than two years, though, so it's still a good value for the price.",3.0
"Although I admit it looks like that online, this is NOT pink, not even close.  It is purple.  They do have another purple online and that one is prettier.  This isn't fuschia or any shade of pink.

"Like the other Mighty Bright better, but I'll stick with this on for now. This one had it's bulky battery side on the front, which makes your pages bump up; not lay flat like normal. Also this one doesn't allow you choose brightness, it's just on/off at same brightness. The other Mighty Bright had the bulky part on the back side, allowing your pages to lay flat and let's you use high or low brightness. Oh well. Lesson learned.",3.0
Did what it said the discription was. Not great at the bottom of the page,3.0
"It lights up the book pages well. However, the clip could be much better designed. The lever to open the clip is too short, and awkard to get the clip open an onto the book. The clip unit is quite thick so that the book won't lay flat on a table top. The on-off switch is hard to find, until you get used to where it is in the recess.",3.0
its OK.  I would like it if it were brighter and the angle of the light would span the whole book instead of a page at a time.,3.0

I figured with two settings, at least the high would be enough, but I find it kind of dim, at least compared to my 115V Led, which is what I am used to.  Plus it does flop around quite a bit as one other reviewer noted.  I liked the idea of it being cordless, but it's going to be of limited use to me I think.  I'll probably use it as a keyboard light, attached to something solid like a lap table.  Would have preferred the switch be in the base, as well, where your hand will be going most of the time.",3.0

"So with rare use, this product lasted me almost three years.  What eventually failed was the plastic casing around the head.  It's held together with pressure (think: like Legos) and started coming apart repeatedly until I lost one of the three pieces and then one of the electrical wires, unprotected, separated from the circuit board.  Wish the casing around the light was more durable, like maybe an aluminum casing held together by screws...but then I guess it wouldn't be so light nor as inexpensive.

Postives: The neck is very pliable.  The batteries last a long time (in fact, I never changed them).  The light is bright.

Negatives: The light is cold and a bit too harsh.  It doesn't make for good ambience if, for example, you're reading with the book light and all other lights turned off.

"I bought this for my husband to read at night while we're in bed.  He seems to really like it. It's sturdy, fits his paperback, provides enough light, etc.  However, for the one on the other side of the bed (me), it's actually TOO bright, even on the single-bulb setting.

My hopes for buying my husband a book light were for both he and I to do what we want simultaneously. He wants to read. I want to sleep.  It's just not happening with this light. It's an LED light, which means it's that bright, somewhat harsh light, as opposed to a softer, less invasive light. I literally have to pull the covers over my head because it lights up the room almost as much as a bedside table would. I'm praying there is such a thing as a soft light book light anymore since it's becoming harder and harder to find regularly sized soft light bulbs....

I could see this light being wonderful for plane trips, reading in bed alone, or for those with bedmates who aren't at all sensitive to bright LED lights.

I also love how flexible it is for manipulating to whatever angle you need & that it clips on to things. But it goes through the batteries way too fast & therefore making it rather impractical. the blue color is really a teal, but that was fine with me, the color is pretty.",3.0

Also - it's a little heavy! so it's hard to clip it to thinner books. and it's clumsy.

it does not bend well, so when you adjust it - it doesn't stay... so it's kind of set in one position and it's hard to move it and make it stay to your liking.

i wouldn't buy it again, so i would try something else - something lighter and less bright (less heavy on the eyes)..",3.0
Keeps sliding. Always needs adjusting.,3.0

"As others have mentioned, this is a knock-off and not a true Mighty Bright. I've only had mine a few days and it works OK, but I didn't realize it was coming from China when I ordered it. When I discovered that, I ordered a real Mighty Bright Xtraflex2 from another web site in the US because I was in a hurry. With free shipping over the holidays, it was only about a dollar more and I received it in just a few days. As it happened, they both arrived on the same day, but I'm glad I ordered the second one. On the surface, the knock-off looks very similar, but one thing I noticed is that the goose neck on the authentic lamp is much better. It stays in place no matter how you bend it. The knock off does not do that. It will stay bent to some degree, but tends to spring back a little. I purchased mine to mount on a treadmill console, so that I can read while walking in the evenings. The fact that I would have to wrestle with the neck/head to keep it in position is a deal breaker. I have since put the knock-off in my tool box and have actually used it successfully for putting light on a project I was working on outside after dark. It works and while I'm more or less satisfied with it, it is certainly not worth saving a few bucks. Make sure to order the true Mighty Bright to avoid disappointment.",3.0

Feb 2015:  I haven't used it but for about 3 books since I bought it.  But the switch quit working and now I have to remove the battery to turn it off (and then insert it to turn it back on).  I think for the amount it has been used this is unsatisfactory.",3.0
"I've had this now for over a year.

Likes: it bends, long battery life

Dislikes: the light isn't bright enough to illuminate your average sized hardcover book.
I constantly have to move the light around to see.
When you bend it it doesn't stay there it starts bending back.",3.0
"does it still shed light?

I don't know - but it DOES run the battery down, LOL!

The switch is so sensitive that any little bump will turn it on.  This makes it very nearly useless as a book light.  Being able to take it with so you can read on the bus, train, airplane, or in the car (when someone else is driving) is a huge part of having a booklight.

Apparently the TravelFlex lacks this design flaw.

These have a slide switch and won't run the battery down by switching on while you are traveling with it.

There may be other Mighty Bright book lights that also have slide switches.  I suggest checking before buying.  The light this casts is fine - its just that it casts it whether you need it or not, LOL!

The flex gooseneck also seems fine so far.  The clip works for me (I clip it to the back of my Kindle cover).  But the switch makes it impossible for me to carry it with me because any little bump turns it on, and the inside of my carry bag doesn't really need the illumination.

Given that this isn't really a travel light and one would be best served using it only at home, the optional wall wart for it seems a bit more useful than it otherwise might.  You can get the power adapter here:

This isn't quite the marriage saver that some reviews made this lamp out to be. The LED lamp doesn't put out a very clear light for reading but it's serviceable.,3.0
"Light switch broke after one week and now the light will not turn off.
No problem right ?  These lights come with a 1 year warranty, but who honors that warranty ?  I contact Mightybright.com and have
received no response after 5 attempts including email and direct phone calls.  They actually kept me on hold for 10 minutes, so I called back again.  Operator promised someone would call me back,  but no one did.
I tried the seller (Shoreline Music) but the listed telephone number here on Amazon does not work.
Send a 2nd email today to Mightybrite.
It is a good light when it works, but considering the cost and the bogus warranty, I have learned my lesson; will go back to the least expensive, simplest gooseneck throw-away light.  The last one worked for a year and cost $5,  but you do not have the hassle.

Update: just contacted by Mightybrite;  they promised to send me a new one, fingers crossed

2nd update:  Warranty was honored and the manufacturer sen't a replacement.  Mightybrite should bolster the switch",3.0

"Worked well, but it fell off the back of my bed and is now behind the bed and unusable until we move the bed and fish it out.  Perhaps if it were built with a fishing string attached so it would be more easily retrievable, that would make this product better.  Or maybe if it were metallic and I could pick it up using a giant magnet, then it'd be a better product.  Does amazon sell giant magnets?",3.0
"This is a VERY BRIGHT book light. Even the setting with the single bulb is super bright in bed, which is where I use it. The reason I purchased this was to read in bed with the lights off without disturbing my baby who cosleeps with me. This light is so bright that if it hits his eyes they scrunch up and it looks like he has a spotlight pointed at his face.  I have to angle the book and light to make sure the book blocks the light in order to avoid getting it in his eyes. Not ideal, but I'm not sure there is anything better on the market.

It's also pretty heavy. It comes with three AAA batteries that are heavy, and the metal bendy cord that attaches the light to the clip is also pretty weighty. Given that the first book I was reading with it was a compilation of lectures that was less than 80 pages in length, the weight was enough to bend the pages if I didn't hold them firmly.

The clip is also very stiff. I don't know if it's a good feature or not, but I suppose given the weight of the light it is probably necessary.

I should mention this is the first book light I've owned so I have no point of comparison, these are just my observations: I would prefer a dimmer light made for use in the dark, a lighter (less heavy) product that can be used with shorter books, and a clip that does not feel like it may snap my fingers off if I miss the page and knick a thumb instead.",3.0

"After three/four weeks, the light dims after 5 minutes of use.  Should of lasted longer...",3.0
I need bright white light when reading my Bible.  The unit clips on nicely to my bible and is easy to use.  I would have preferred not having to continuously move the light to aim it down the page as I read.  It came with no instructions so I had to fool around with it a little before i realized that the battery had a protected cover over it.,3.0

It is fine; a little awkward to use. E-readers are a better approach.,3.0

Good little product. Changing the battery requires a small screwdriver...but the light is good. Two levels of brightness. Flexible support. Solid clip.,3.0
"This was a very cute light, but I didn't find it particularly bright enough for reading my Kindle, so most of the time, I just end up using a desk lamp.  The Mighty Bright doesn't seem to shower enough light to cover the entire reading area, and the light itself isn't that bright.  I think I will try another brand next time.  Kind of disappointing considering the price.",3.0

"The Xtraflex2 Led Book Light is a reasonably good light for a dark or shadowed reading area.  The neck is less flexible than I would like and the clip is bulky, as well as, not that strong.",3.0
"More useful with a hard bound book than a paperback.  The clip is pretty thick and the battery pack is rather weighty.  Don't bother using it with paperbacks.  You'll spend more time adjusting the light than reading.

The light has three settings: off, dim, and on.  Also the diffuser lens focuses the light into a cone that doesn't quite cover most pages, causing you to have to fiddle with it as your eyes progress down the page",3.0
"Light in a dark room?  Isn't that what a flashlight does?  I was looking for something that would be just enough light to read.  This has two settings.  The less bright setting is still very illuminating.  Clip is ok, i think a little inconvenient on magazines.",3.0
"I would really like the Mighty Bright more if after a a time it didn't develop problems.
The lite after weve had it for awhile has a problem staying on possibly because of the contact with the adapter connector or sometimes the wires in the neck. We keep purchasing these lites because they're probably the best thing on the market and hoping for the best.",3.0
"I do not think this light is ""too bright"" - in fact, I would have liked for it to be brighter.  I have purchased 5 similar lights.  All the others have a two light option.  If you want the light to be less bright, you have the option of using one of the lights - two for a brighter light.  This product features only one light and doesn't seem as sturdy as the other lights I have purchased that are similar in design.  The big problem that I have with these lights is that there doesn't seem to be any replacement bulbs.  I have had bulbs burn out in all the other lights I purchased even though some are touted to never burn out.  This light was less expensive than the others I have purchased so I figured - what do I have to lose even if it only lasts me for a few months.

I use these lights for one purpose - to have a night light with which to read my Kindle keyboard and yes, they do get a lot of use so perhaps I have used them beyond what their feature promised relative to ""never burning out.""  If I had it to do over, I would have purchased a more study expensive light which is most likely what I will wind up doing in the not too distant future as soon as this light burns out.",3.0
"This merchandise work when it wants to.  I thought that it would fit my purpose for reading at night when my eyes are tired, but not so.",3.0
"It used to be that I could choose a lower or higher luminosity. Not anymore. Other than that, it's a nice little lamp, easy to take along for traveling.",3.0
Battery needs to last longer and perhaps have an adjustable brightness setting.  Great for bed side reading at night.  But still not strong enough for tablet reading with backlid LCD screens.,3.0
"The light is sufficiently bright but seems to weaken after a few minutes, and the distance is very limited. It's fine for a booklight but don't expect to use it to light other tasks.",3.0
Very practical.  I keep it clipped to the book I read at the time as a bookmarker.  Battery life little short.,3.0
"I bought this for my wife, thinking it was the type that takes a circular battery. Instead it is the variety that takes AAA batteries. It works fine and she likes it, but I did not get what I expected.",3.0
"I wasn't terribly impressed. I bought it because so many other buyers said it was very bright and that the light was dispersed well. It is, and there's very little glare, but it's not nearly bright enough for my needs. Maybe I just like a lot more light than most people.",3.0
"Like the light, it does what I want it to, but one of two that I bought died after 6 months.",3.0
I really need the illumination to be brighter.  This is OK but not great.  Maybe the bulbs are an issue?  I'll get new ones and update the review.,3.0

"The clip is extremely large, which causes and issue with it disrupting my zen while reading.  Also the front of the clear light case needs to be darkened, because at most angles it blinds one's eye.",3.0
"I bought 2 book lights one of them is still working.  We have used the lights on 2 trips - one of them quit working this trip so we replaced the batteries and it is still not working.

"It isn't big enough and the light starts bright, but fades quickly to barely adequate.. Wish I'd waited and bought a bigger light.",3.0
The light proved to be bright enough but I noticed it faded over time.  It started out great and as a few months went by the light dimmed.  I am still using it today because it really is very convenient but I wish the light stayed as bright as it was when I first bought it.,3.0
"I love the light but discovered the batteries that came with it were dead. I had to wait to use it until I purchased new batteries. That is my only complaint about the light,otherwise I love it now that I have batteries that actually work. My only suggestion would be to not have the batteries in the light but separate when you send the light.",3.0
"So I got this for my girlfriend because she really wanted the pink booklight. However, when we ordered it, it was more of a purple than anything. Very very dark pink if that's what they are trying to sell. So if you're trying to get the pink color, I would actually just buy it in a store so you can be sure you like the color. The light itself works great and is very bright. Still slightly disappointed however it wasn't the color in the picture.",3.0
Its okay but  think it could be made a little bit more sturdy.  I clamped it on my bed frame and it falls off at times.,3.0
"The lamp aspect of it works well and has caused me no issues. Its the clip part that drives me nuts, it hardly stays in one place.",3.0

"I wanted to read in bed without disturbing my husband. Using this light on even smaller sized paperbacks it must be adjusted from side to side, top to bottom in order to light the book. It was not the best for me. Maybe if I only read one or two paragraphs a night it would have been fine, but it was just tricky and aggravating to keep changing the light around. The good news is that my husband slept through it.  And now that I'm back to using my bedside lamp he sleeps through that as well.",3.0
"Bright enough but, not too easy to use for reading in bed, especially for small books. Maybe when sitting in a chair.",3.0

"I got this book light for my kindle. It reflects off the screen really brightly, so i have to angle it just right. It also slips off a lot. It has a really sensitive on/off switch so sometimes I find it turned on with the battery wasting. Overall though, it does what it's supposed to and is good for the price.",3.0
The battery clip are rather heavy and to clumpsy for fixing to a Klindle. The light itself is bright enough,3.0
"I like that it is bright, true to it's name, and that it's purple but I used it once and I was able to use the two bulbs and switch to one bulb and then turn it off. The second time I tried using it I couldn't turn it off anymore or switch to one bulb. I was disappointed I have to take out the batteries to turn it off. It works if I keep trying it, but it's not worth it. It may just be that mine is just malfunctioning or maybe it got messed up in the shipping but I would return it.",3.0
light is good and not too bright for the back of the car for kindle reading kids love it attached to headrest,3.0

It's bulky but nice and bright I have the kindle 4 and just hanging it was a little odd on the leather cover,3.0
"I like the flexibility of this light but it still needs to be adjusted as I am reading a book to illuminate the entire page. It's much better than the old style ones. It probably works best on a hard cover book. On a paperback, it is hard to keep it steady.",3.0
"It is certainly a very bright light. Very, very bright. So bright my husband complains that it keeps him awake. However, I can't take off stars for that, as it's advertised as bright. And the plus side of the brightness is that I can clip the light onto the bed itself to read.

It is, however, heavy. If I'm reading a paperback book in bed, I have to clip it onto half the book so the cover doesn't bend back. I took off two stars for the weight.",3.0
"I just got this and put in the batteries it came with. For some reason one of the 2 light bulbs does not light up when you turn the switch on. And at times the lights won't even turn on at all. I don't know if this is a poor electrical connection or the batteries. I am going to switch out the batteries with some name brands and see if that helps, otherwise I am requesting a replacement. Just a heads up.",3.0
The brightness coming from this light was not what I expected but its handy and can easily be placed around the reading material or laptop.,3.0
"I ordered three or four of these lamps about a year ago, based on the excellent reviews presented here. However, I quickly found them faulty--their power switch didn't always work. In calling Mighty Bright on June 29, 2011, their telephone representative Linda in Accounting said that she was going to send me a brand new factory-fresh Xtraflex 2 in black, which she did. She also said that Angie Franco in Sales/Customer Service would call me back sometime the next week; I don't believe that I received such a call, although I could be wrong. Linda stated that they've never received such a complaint about this lamp. I offered to remit the faulty units for examination but she declined.

Now, August 2012, I again find faulty operation, and again it appears to be the switch. It takes multiple presses of the power switch to turn one of my units on or off, or to decrement its light intensity. Perhaps it's a humidity problem, but if so their phone representative mentioned nothing about it.

Another problem with these units, and a mildly exasperating problem at that, is that the lamp head, once adjusted to remain perfectly horizontal or flat so its light shines directly downward, continually or often begins an incremental reverse journey back to its original slightly twisted position. I often find myself making slight adjustments to the lamp head to return it to its proper lateral position. Multiply this by two, three, or more of these lamps and you have one more product-related headache that you didn't need.

In conclusion, I don't think I'll be purchasing Mighty Bright products again; at least not this particular lamp.",3.0

I bought this so I could read at night w/o disturbing my husband.  It is very bright but I have to keep adjusting it so I can read the whole page of my book.  It gives me a bit of a glare when I clip it to my Kindle and there's very little Kindle to clip it to!  I need the full strength of the light to be able to see comfortably and can't imagine just using the dimmer light!  I can't clip it just to the cover of a paperback because it's too heavy.  I do love the color!  I'm seriously thinking about getting a head lamp in place of this.,3.0
"I find the light adequate if reading in a darkened room, but I wanted it to supplement my dim bedside lamp, and the mighty bright does not work too well for that.  It is not enough light to help.  The clamp part works fine and the light is easily positioned on the flexible arm.",3.0
"I've had this light for about 2 years, and it's still on the original battery.  As others have stated, it does a good job lighting up the book.  I usually keep it at the dimmer of the two settings.  But the flexible arm is very very very loose.  Mine is now to the point where I have to read one handed.  One hand holds the book, the other hand holds the light up.  Without that, it just sags into the book.",3.0
"Nice light overall. Two levels of light are available. It works great with my Kindle and would be good not only for book readers but it also would be great for hobbys where you need to get some specific light to an object, like sewing or maybe working on assembly something in a tight spot.
There is only one drawback that I find annoying. When I pack it in my computer bag, the slightest contact on the switch turns the light on and then the batteries are wasted.  If someone knows how to prevent this, I would appreciate any feedback, but it just seems the on/off switch is so sensitive that it turns on with just the slightest shift in my bag.
Otherwise, the color is great, the light is sufficient on either the low or high setting and the clip stays put on my Kindle and the hardcopy books I read.",3.0
"I use this light for late-night Kindle-reading in bed while the wife is sleeping.  Single LED light is plenty of light in a dark room.  Heh - do NOT shine this around the room with both LEDs turned on.  If you've ever seen a vampire movie, you know what happens when you flash these in your wife's eyes in the middle of the night...  No, she doesn't poof into dust - but somebody WILL die.

A couple of nit-picks:

1) Requires 3 AAA batteries.  I use rechargeables quite a bit and can only recharge 2 at a time...  Require 2 or 4.  (I know; I'm picky.)

2) I did NOT like the clamp mechanism at all.  The handle is slippery and takes a couple of tries every night to get it clamped in place.  If you're not going to move this light all the time, that may not be a big deal for you.  I also use an Oberon cover for my Kindle and have a hard time getting the light to stay in place...

3) Field of light seems pretty wide to me.  Of course, this depends on how high you have that neck.  For my use so far, the light placement gives me a range of light that looks more suited to landscape vs. portrait.

I personally like the long neck, though I've seen a couple of complaints here about it.  For me, that long neck makes it relatively easy to shift the light to minimize glare while keeping the head out of my way.  I usually shift it to the left or right of my Kindle and take advantage of that wide field of light.

On-off switch is easy to locate in the dark.  The switch is located right at the top of the head, over the lamps.  First click for both lamps; second click for just one.  I rarely use both lamps, so can't really comment on the shadows or quirks that LED lights sometimes have with multiple lamps.

Battery life seems fine so far.  I estimate 8-9 hours of use on my rechargeables with no degradation yet.

Good light for the price, all-in-all.",3.0
"I almost feel unfair giving this 3 stars, because no where in the description does it say that it works with a Kindle 3. I guess I had read that people buy it for their Kindles in the reviews. In my opinion, if you have a Kindle 3, and this is what you want the light for, I do not recommend it. It does not stay put well on the Kindle 3's narrow edge. If you secure it, it is blocking the text. Plus, I personally find the whole flexible arm thing very annoying and distracting.

This may be much better for regular books, or other things as the listing states, but since it didn't fit my needs, I returned this item.",3.0
"It's cheap, so that's good.  And it actually worked as advertised.

The main thing for me is I don't like the color of the light itself - it's too high of a temperature, i.e. too ""bluish"" for my taste.  There are so many more options in LED lighting these days, they could have picked a better light unit.

Also, I found it a little unwieldy as a Kindle light, and for any paperbacks as well.  It also has limited use as a clip on to furniture, like a shelf or something.  The clamp part is not very sturdy and doesn't really ""clamp"" all that well.  It's fine if you just leave it alone, though, not so great if you want to utilize the gooseneck for adjusting constantly.

I moved on and got the Belkin.",3.0
"It works and provides great light.  But  clipping this on a paperback is cumbersome, it's heavy and not a one hand affair.",3.0
"I bought 20 of the Mighty Bright black xtraflex LED book lights for use during our church choir Christmas Cantada and they work great!

The lights came with the three AAA batteries that were needed and, so far, they have lasted through 4 three hour practice sessions and the light clips onto our folders very nicely.

There are two settings on the light. The second setting is sufficient for most uses but but we have been using the first setting, which is the brightest setting, because our sheet music is fairly small.

Out of the 20 lights, all 20 worked right out of the package...and are still working at this writing. This is a great all purpose light and I recommend it.",3.0
"Hey, it works. Bought two of them - one for a shaving light in the bathroom, and one for a keyboard light on my computer. I like them, so will you.",3.0
"This light worked amazingly at first; it was bright and covered a large amount of space with light. However, after a couple weeks it started dimming dramatically despite changing the batteries. I wish that the light lasted longer; it would have made this product perfect.",3.0
"I rate this item as only OK because while it's light and portable, easily clipping on a book, the light only illuminates one page at a time.  This forced me to constantly readjust the light from my left to right pages as I read.  Perhaps this would be sufficient light for a paperback, but not for a ""full sized"" book.",3.0
"When I first got this light, I thought it was the best!  It provided just the right amount of light, and stayed where I pointed it.  In the months that followed, however, it started to loose its staying power.  The light did not stay where it was pointed, to the point where it is now useless. Would I buy it again?  Probably not.",3.0
"DON'T BUY THE ADAPTER AND EXTRA BULBS AS OFFERED.  THEY ARE NOT FOR THE LIGHT.  I BOUGHT ALL THREE, THE BULBS AND ADAPTER WERE NOT FOR THIS SPECIFIC LIGHT SO ARE OF NO USE.  I DO LIKE THE LIGHT BUT IS VERY BULKY.",3.0
"If only the neck was about an inch longer.
That way the light would be able to cover easily BOTH pages of a book.
With the short neck, the light is too close to the pages.
My clamp holds nicely unlike that of another reviewer.
Bottom line is that I bought a SECOND one... yes I will use TWO of these side by side.
So they can't be all that bad.
If only the neck were a little longer ...",3.0
Got this for the 3rd generation Kindle. The light is super and strong and would say it's pretty light weight. But I wouldn't say it the best fit for this Kindle. There is really not a good place to put it and it slides off pretty easy.,3.0
"I like the color, like the light, like the flexibility.....but.....the battery cover came off within days and I have turned my house upside down and cannot locate it!!!

"reasonably bright light.
took off 2 stars because clip moves around a bit on paperbacks and i have to manipulate the light frequently to shine it where i'm reading either because it has moved or because the light does not cover both sides of the book.
would love better design that addresses these issues",3.0
"I purchased these to replace the ""Flex Neck"" which turned out to be awful.  These lights are much better but give a glare on the Kindle screen and are still not as bright as I prefer.  My husband has the Kindle cover with light and that seems to work best.",3.0
"Overall, this is a great light. It is fine for a bedside book lamp and I love the double bulb. However, I use it traveling and for concerts to light music. The on/off switch is so sensitive that just a bump in a purse or suitcase turns it on. I will look for a different light for my next purchase.",3.0
"It is too dim which is harmful for eyes. Besides the bottom of the Kindle DX's page is illuminated worse than the top. Cord for the adapter is a little short for me, but the adapter is good overall.",3.0
"The light is very flexible and stays were you put it, and I'm sure that the LED lasts forever, but I still like the soft yellow glow of a traditional old incandescant bulb.  This is too bluish for me.",3.0
"Overall this is a pretty decent booklight. I like that there are two different light settings, I personally like to use the brighter of the two settings for reading and Ilike the fact that both pages are illuminated at the same time. One annoying thing about the booklight is that the neck is way too floppy so that when I am reading and make the slightest bit of movement the light flops to the side.",3.0
"Ok, got the white one but it is no longer out here to leave the review. I just got it today! I got this along with the Belkin. If it wasn't for a flaw in the arm not staying in place that would win. The light is a little too ""white"" on the Might Bright and its major flaw is how bulky it is..... but still a better lighting quality over the slim m-edge light.

OK..... obviously from all the reviews I read we are still waiting for the RIGHT design for the kindle.... come on inventors out there...",3.0
It does what I need it to do but the glare is a little rough. Good for the price.,3.0
"Pros: The LED is bright. The clip is wide enough for book of medium thickness.

Cons: Uses the button batteries (two CR2032 I think). The website or the package does not give any specification on how long the batteries will last. So you could end up buying a lot of button batteries! The LED is not replacable!

Does not come with the power supply, although the manufacturer website mentions this!",3.0
"This was my original review on the XtraFlex 2 back in April 2010:
""Really. If you don't have one of these yet, and you do read books,... do yourself a favor, get one or two!""

This is my new review Nov 2010:
I taught the XtraFlex2 was really good (rated it 5 stars in April 2010) till I got&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brinkmann-809-1033-1-3-LED-Headlamp-With-Case/dp/B000NL0MJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brinkmann 809-1033-1 3 LED Headlamp With Case</a>. Now I think they the MightyBright XtraFlex 2 is good,... but the Brinkman headlamps are MUCH better. The XtraFlex2 I had to re-attach every few pages or so. I had to attach it either to the right or the left of the book, depending if I'm over the half of the book or not, and almost every page I find my self constantly trying to find the most ideal position for best lighting. This problem is solved with the headlamp. You can just skip pages without anything attach to the book! Another point for the headlamp is that the batteries last much longer. The XtraFlex2 (AAA) batteries needs to be replaced faster. Not a big deal, especially if you use rechargeable batteries... but the less you have to worry with batteries the better. I liked the brightness of the 2 led lamps of the XtraFlex2,.... But the headlamp wins again, since it has 3 leds, providing even more brightness!!! And the headlamp cost a few bucks less!!!",3.0
"I've owned every book light ever made over the years but this is by FAR the best one I have ever had!  Very easy to attatch, can reposition easily with the long flexible neck, and uses regualar batteries instead of those expensive specialty ones that are hard to find.  I have not had to replace the batteries yet, and have been using this for a few months now.  The light is very bright, and you can adjust to have one or two bulbs on, so np problem with adequate lighting.  I LOVE this booklight and would very highly recommend it!",3.0
"Purchased this item for my Kindle2.
I wanted to read in bed without waking my husband or toddler with a lamp.

PROS
1. Lights up, as advertised.

CONS
1. The light is brighter than my bedside lamp. I wish it had two settings. The whole point was to be able to read without disturbing anyone else. I ended up putting an infant sock over the end to ""filter"" the light intensity.
2. The switch is very hard to switch... with one hand I have to grab the light head with one hand, hold it tight and flip the switch with the other.
3. Foot print of the clip part is rather large and covers a tiny bit of my Kindle's screen.

It does it's job fine but in the end I'm sure there are better products out there that would be more like what I'm looking for.",3.0
This product isn't built to fit properly for a kindle.  I wouldn't recommend it.,3.0
"I love this light, but I have problems with it turning on inside my case. I guess something inadvertently bumps it, and it turns on. It drives me nuts! They need to make it with a different kind of switch that is more difficult to turn on. Other than that, I would love this product.",3.0
"The light generated by one light is very powerful, but I would have liked to have had the option to use two. After shipping, I paid over $18.00, so I expected the construction of it to be stronger. It seems to have a loose connection because the second light does not come on right away, if at all. (Yes, I do realize that you have to click once for two lights, twice for one.) With all of the great reviews, I was very disappointed.",3.0
"I like the product, but it is a  little clumsy clipping on and off the Kindle.  You can't leave it clipped on, because it will scratch the face of the Kindle and has to be removed each time.",3.0
"This light does what it should. You can clip it to your Kindle; however, you may may want to have a Kindle cover to clip it to so you won't scratch your Kindle (as I did with a different light). I've noticed a light reflection at times on the Kindle.  Also, I've noticed the light turned on accidentally in my bag, so make sure it's always off.",3.0
"If you own a Kindle and find yourself reading in places that aren't always adequately lit this book light is a welcome solution.  It clips on securely and holds on tight.  The two settings give you some options and the light is  very bright and crisp.  As some other reviewers noted, though, the placement of the buttons make them very easy to brush against something in your bag, inadvertently turning on the light, bleeding the power from your batteries. If not for that annoying design flaw I would whole heartedly recommend it.",3.0
"Let me start out with the good: it is very bright, and did what everyone says it does. It is extraordinarily bright, and when reading at night, I used only 1 of the 2 available LEDs. The clip has a good hold to it; the battery lasts forever, etc.

The reason why it only gets 3 stars: I have the Sony E-reader. It comes in it's own leatherette case, which fits the reader very well. This light (when clipped on the back of the case) rubs against the back of the reader. I figured it wouldn't be an issue, as the reader has an aluminum housing, but it did scratch the back of the reader after very slight use! Because of the shape of the clip, there are 2 points where it scratched the reader: the top corner (where you would assume it would) and also about 1.5 inches down, where the clip curves back up.

I ended up having to stick foam double-sided tape (with only 1 of the paper sides removed) on the front of the clip so it would not scratch the reader.

I would imagine that this would affect anyone with any reader.

The light is very bright, and as such, is subject to pretty severe glare. With the Sony reader, there is a (very) reflective chrome strip at the top of the unit which makes adjusting the light that much harder!

Of course, that would be true of most lights that are similar to this design. I do not currently have a solution to this issue. I have considered getting the light wedge case&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cover-with-Custom-Light-Shield-2-Aaa-Batteries/dp/B001DESZWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cover with Custom Light Shield +2 Aaa Batteries</a>&nbsp;but it seems that also has issues of it's own.

All in all, it does what it's supposed to, but it's difficult to adjust for easy reading.",3.0
"the neck is pretty flimsy so you have to move it a lot, also kind of bulky on most books. but very bright with heavy duty batteries.",3.0
"I have to say that the Might Bright XtraFlex 2 is a wondefully bright light.  If I position it correctly, it easily lights both pages for comfortable reading.  It's so easy to adjust that there is never a problem getting the light where you want it.  The price is great!

The problem arises when you turn the page or shift your own position.  This light has a clip that does not secure well to the book.  No matter how many pages you clip it to, it will swivel around and tip to the side.  I get weary of righting it time and again.  The clip is too bulky and I found myself missing the Itty Bitty Booklight that slips so nicely onto a back hard cover or a few pages of a soft cover, and then stays put.  That is the only problem, but it's a substantial one when you're trying to read, thus the 3 stars.  Right now, I'm hoping for a merger of the Itty Bitty and Might Bright.  Perfect light and perfect clip!",3.0
After reading other reviews I was excited to have make this purchase.  I was disappointed - I've had brighter pen lights!,3.0
"The good:  Very flexible, easy to adjust, light weight and long battery life.

The Bad: I feel like I'm constantly moving the light so the area I am reading is light enough.  I find myself adjusting the light every 1/2 page for hard cover books and once for each page with paperbacks. Maybe I'm just not use to the type of light the LED's give off.  I am thinking of getting another one of these lights and having one clipped to each cover in hopes I have less adjusting to do.",3.0
"This light makes sense in one aspect; it has two lights - one for each page.  I really like this design, but that is where the love ends.  The light ""clips"" to the book by wedging the thin strip of plastic between the book pages and spine.  This is dumb for two reasons.  One it is rough on the book and pages, but moreover it makes the batteries fall out because of a serious design flaw.  The bottom part of the light is supposed to clip together to hold batteries in, but it comes apart constantly!!  If this light had a better clip on it that didn't damage the book and would actually stay together in one piece, then it would be a good light.  As it is, it is just a a real pain.",3.0
The light sometimes flickers due to a possible loose wire because when I bend it on it flickers until I relieve it in an almost upright position.,3.0
"My son LOVES to read light or dark so I got this for him for the dark nights hes reading in bed and his siblings are asleep.  The light is super bright, and the the actual system is small and light.

"I would LOVE this book light and rate it five stars if only it worked consistently.  From day one, the book light has been finicky in when and how (sometimes whacking it lightly will help) it wants to work.  Other than that, I love this item when it does decide to work - the amount of light it sheds is great, I really like the shape of it, etc.  I just wish I had remembered to contact the seller about this item before it was too late.  So much time has passed now that I don't think anything could be done at this point, and that's on me.  I never contacted the seller - things kept coming up and distracting me every time I went to do so.

Also, the clip doesn't clip very well to the cover of the book. And I don't like the fact that it doesn't have a charging option.",3.0

"I was looking for a rechargeable booklight as I was going through too many batteries. This is the second one I tried- the first was the moleskin and hated it. I really like this one. It charges fast, holds the charge, clips onto my kindle good and has good lighting for reading. Overall I am happy with the purchase for the price. The only thing I do not like is the neck of the light:  its not as steady or stable so shakes a lot if I make small movements while reading. I own other withit booklights that use batteries and they never did this. Hopefully they can do something about this in the future as it's an annoyance.",3.0
"This light is decent quality and works nicely too.  It recharges in a USB port, and is flexible.  The light beam is strong enough, but not too bright, and fades as it loses juice.  (The monkey charm is removable.)  The reason for only 4 stars is that the flexible stem has lost some of it's stiffness after one month.
UPDATE: Reduced to 3 stars because the connectors are too flexible and flimsy that one broke and the light won't charge.

This COULD BE an awesome product if the manufacturer made it more durable.  The MSRP of twenty dollars is overpriced, in my opinion.",3.0

"I published the review below nearly two years ago.  Recently, CBConcept commented on it, saying ""Your order is not from CBConcept.""

I went back to my order history and sho'nuff, it said ""CBConcept.""  So I wrote to them through 'contact seller.' They replied, ""If you don't like the color, you can get a refund.""  That's rather interesting given that their website says their return policy is 15 days and they publicly denied selling it to me in the first place.

I pointed out that even if I did return it, the picture in the ad still wouldn't accurately portray the color of the product.  I'm still waiting for a reply.

Amazon policy is that we are supposed to review products, not sellers. In this case ""CBConcept"" is both the brand name and the seller's name.  If you do a Google image search on the pic in the ad, all hits are from CBConcept.

There's nothing actually wrong with the rope itself.  It's well made, all the lights light up, etc.

I bought it hoping that it would be the same color as the one shown in the ad.  It's not. I wanted one that would match an incandescent rope light I already had.  It doesn't.

I think that the picture shown is actually an incandescent rope. I uploaded a picture of the one I received; it gives a better indication of the color you'll get.  If that works for you - great.",3.0
It is nice to get an actual rope light with LEDs because the strips are directional. This light has a nice color temperature and glows in 360 degrees. I'm rating it at 3-stars because the electrical connection was faulty when I received it. I am returning it and will have a replacement hopefully within 2 days.

Only time will tell how long these will last, but after nearly six weeks I'm ahead of what I had been using. The only complaint is that the two prongs, which go directly into the light fixture are too small. That is, these are not big enough around, so you end up bending them to get them to stay in the light. This is OK for a reading lamp, but will not work in the light fixtures in our kitchen.",3.0
"12V 20W bulbs with a G6.35 base are difficult to find in our area so I ordered these from CorsLighting.  I received Plusrite tungsten halogen lamps...not the CBConcept brand. Wattage & voltage are stamped on the bulb, unfortunately, the base size, G6.35, isn't...so family members might not remember which base to purchase when a bulb needs replaced.

Each bulb was packaged in a tiny bubble wrap pouch inside its  own tiny box. None were broken even though they were  were shipped in a padded envelope.  The two rectangular metal pieces inside the bulb are not parallel to each other, some lean in or are angled...I don't know if this will affect the bulb's performance.

We installed these in landscape tulip lights.

When installing these bulbs, avoid touching the actual glass capsule portion of the bulb. Your hands will leave oil on the glass, which heats up when the bulb is turned on. This heating causes the glass to become fragile and to break, thus ruining the bulb.

3 stars because I did not receive the brand advertised.

I will update my review if necessary.",3.0
I puller the 1st one out and it was a dud so tried another and it was no good either.  The 3rd one I put in worked so I am not that happy and will see how long the bulb last.  I ordered a 10 which really is now an eight pack so we will see.,3.0

"These lights (450 lumen MR16) appear to be sensitive to heat build up even though they are advertised as a replacement for halogens. I replaced these in metal fixtures that had venting holes at the top for its previous 50W halogens. After the lights had been on for a while, one of them started flashing on and off. This was the second incident with these lights. A previous one had started to flicker after it had been on for a while.

These LED lights get quite hot. My workaround was to remove the UV filter required by the halogens to allow heat to escape a little easier. I think this may be sufficient. Most of the lights had been doing OK and only 2 seemed to be on the margin. The previously flashing light worked fine after it was replaced without the UV filter in place. I assume this was because it had cooled down by then; I have yet to leave them on for an extended period.",3.0
"Love this lights as they are nice darker blue and bright.
However, if you use it as a spotlight near your garage it will interfere with the remote signal. You won't be able to open the garage unless you are very close to the garage door. Took me a while to figure it out and lots of google research. LOL",3.0
"Much dimmer than the 20Watt bulb it replaced. Less expensive, but I don't want to wait for all 10 to burn out (70 years if they last as long as the OEM bulb).",3.0
"I received these bulbs less than three weeks ago to use in my under the counter lights. When I installed them I noticed they were slightly dimmer than my older, much more expensive lights but I didn't care and it wasn't a big deal to me. However, I just noticed that one of the bulbs I replaced has already blown out. I'm hoping some of the others will last longer, but if they don't then these bargain bulbs won't end up being much of a bargain for me.",3.0
"These bulbs have been OK for our under-counter lights in the kitchen. Quality is somewhat lower, but they work and the price is very good. The only real complaint I have is the shipping cost. I bought four 10-packs of the 20-watters. The shipping cost was nearly $20! CBConcept charges $4.95 for each 10-pack, even though all of my order came in one small box that weighed only about 10 ounces. About the same time, I got an order of another product of the same weight, also coming from the same area of California and mailed USPS first class, that cost less than $4 for shipping. However, even with the high shipping cost, the bulbs are a deal compared with paying nearly $5 a bulb at the hardware store.",3.0
"These work ok in the under counter light fixture, but they are dimmer than the one we replaced.  It may be that these are halogen and the original was xenon.  So far we've been unsuccessful in finding a replacement that is as bright as the original and I've paid much higher prices for what appears to be the same light output as this product.",3.0
"I thought I was buying the little bulbs for under-cabinet lights (purchsed at Home Depot) but got a bit more than expected. These bulbs DO FIT within the body of the light but are fatter and longer than other G8 bulbs. It may very well be my misunderstanding because there are sooo many varieties of light bulbs these days. Perhaps ""G8"" designation is not enough to set them apart from the small (regular?) ones? I will research this when I ran out of...6, 7, 8 left ;)",3.0
"The size maybe my own fault but they are a tad larger than I needed for my recess lighting light container from Ikea. Thought I ordered the right size G8, but it may not be right or just a discrepancy with the Ikea product. Either way, great value for these and product came quickly.",3.0
These bulbs last only about a fourth or a third of the usage hours as the bulb i had previously(used with desk lamp). They're ok..,3.0
"With under-counter lights, the bulbs plug in fine and light up.  However, I cannot fit the light cover back on.  Unfortunately, they are useless for my application, and when I bought them in 2011, they did not have the size issue in the reviews--may have switch manufacturers.  I wish they had fit, they are a great price (saved 75% over local store)!",3.0
"For the price... you can't go wrong but be aware that not all G8 bulbs are the same size.  The pin size is correct but the glass bulb itself is larger than the bulbs I've purchased in the past. Therefore, I cannot put the cover back on the small lamp that I ordered these bulbs for.  I gave it 3 stars because there isn't any mention of the size being larger than standard G8 bulbs.",3.0
The bulbs arrived quickly and in good order so no complaints there. The bulbs have very inconstant life times. The last set of bulbs I put in had two out of the three burn out in a few days. Some of the bulbs last for a reasonable time but the majority do not. I've been working through the 24 I bought over the last 6 months so I have a fair idea of what to expect. I'll be switching back to the Feit Electric bulbs which are more expensive but last much longer with few 'duds'.,3.0
"Great price, but first one didn't last long.  Maybe all 10 make up life of original.",3.0
"I had a hard time locating 120V LED rope lights that could duplicate standard white incandescent rope lights.  This worked well, and the base price was acceptable.  However, the company added a shipping charge for EACH rope light, even though all were mailed in a single package.",3.0
satisfied,3.0
"Super Bummed  :(  Bought for over cabinet lighting and though it's bright and shows ambient light that I wanted, the lights put off a BLUE color.  Its not worth the money to ship back, so I'll throw it in with my Christmas decorations I guess.",3.0
I have to agree with the other reviewer.  These decals are actually pretty translucent and just don't stand out (my wall is turquoise).  Looking at the picture I would have thought they were bright white and they are not.  They are also very glossy and when the sun hits them there is a glare which makes the design invisible.  Too bad too because I absolutely love the design.,3.0
They look really bright in this picture but when i put it up on my lilac colored wall it doesnt stand out as much..,3.0
Did not need them as they came with the light fixture. I have an extra set when I do.,3.0
"These work well enough, though I'm not terribly impressed by the lifespan of the bulbs, and one bulb was burned out on arrival.",3.0
"I wish I hadn't bought a fixture that requires these.  They are bright but don't last as long as I expected, and are a pain to put in. Use thin latex or similar gloves, since it flashes out if you get finger-smudge on them.",3.0
"These have worked well, but the front glass piece has fallen off of 4 of them so far.  They fall of when it's on and hot, and have melted some spots in the carpet.  The front glass should be the UV filter as well, so this is not a good thing to lose.  I may have gotten a bad batch, but now I'm ordering the more expensive name brand bulbs to replace the ones that have lost their glass.",3.0
I bought these for a lamp that needed a G9 25 watt bulb. I found that this bulb can get very hot. So I would not recommend it for a table lamp.,3.0
"The first batch I ordered sometime last year were fine. In this latest batch, 2 have already died less than a month in. You get what you pay for. I would not buy these again.",3.0
They are hard to change I think.,3.0

"Love the low price, but they are not as bright as the ones that came with a light fixture I bought.",3.0
"they burn out really fast but they are cheap. so the question is do you want to pay more and bite the bullet or try your luck sometimes they last for a month sometimes a few, there is no regularity but they are pretty reasonable in price.",3.0
great price,3.0
When I open up the plastic around the bulbs I notice glass. 2 of the bulbs was shattered. Be careful when opening. We kept them and the rest work great.,3.0
"Pro:
Good value as they are cheaper than most brick and mortar retailers
They are as bright as the OEM ones that came with my Ikea track light
Packaged nicely in each cardboard container

Cons:
As others have mentioned, they may not last long at all. Two of my bulbs popped within 1 day of installation. I used a glove and made sure to not touch the glass surface much.
Packaging on shipment could be better, got it in a padded envelope and we all know how tossed around a lot of packages can be.",3.0
"I bought 24 of these bulbs.  They all worked, but weren't very bright.  I did a side-by-side comparison with with a Phillips bulb and these were much dimmer than the Phillips.  They were OK, but since it is the primary lighting source in this area, I needed something brighter.  I ended up spending the extra money and getting a brighter bulb.",3.0
"We got these to replace bulbs as they burn out in our kitchen overhead lighting. Compared to the ones that came with the assembly, these bulbs don't put light out on the sides and they put out a LOT more heat... to the point it can become uncomfortable standing under them when they're pointed directly at you.",3.0
"These are ok for the price. They're definitely not as bright as the OSRAM bulbs I got from Ikea, and seem to have a warmer colour temperature.",3.0
"I really  can't rate these bulbs and do justice to them.
They are just not the kind of bulb I needed, I needed a frosted type bulb.
I am sure these bulbs are of good quility and will work great for what they were made for.",3.0
"I don't really have anything negative to say about the bulbs themselves. Ikea sells only one bulb of this style for use in their  lighting fixtures. The bulbs here give light that looks mismatched when placed alongside Ikea bulbs (maybe they don't have the same 'color temperature'?).  Ikea's price for their bulbs is pretty good, but as far as I can see, they can't be mail ordered.",3.0
"I just received these bulbs and replaced my first one in a recessed light fixture from Ikea.  It works, but the light is not as bright as the 35W bulbs from Ikea.  I'm fine with using these up, but I won't get more.",3.0
I mistakenly viewed this item and saw three bulbs so was quick to order them as replacements. I was dismayed to find a single bulb in an envelope a few days later!,3.0
led better,3.0
"I had this and installed on my Range hood, and it popped after a month.
But when I installed several on my ceiling light, it works fine and so far still ok.

Don't know what's going on but overall the quality is ok since the price that you can only buy 2 pcs in Hone Depot,
and here you get 10 pcs. worth the price.",3.0
"They put out good light, but burn out quickly. I've had to replace the bulb just about once a month.",3.0
"These halogen bulbs work and are very inexpensive.  However, they give off much less light than the previous 20W bulbs (used in kitchen hood light).  I'd estimate, these give out light similar to a 10W bulb.  It's only been a couple of weeks so I can't comment about durability.",3.0
Bulbs work great but one of them already burned out after only a couple days of use. Expected them to last longer. Good thing I have extras.,3.0
"First two lights I used blew within a few days, but now they seem to be holding out.  Cheap enough and I have enough that I don't really care, but still....",3.0
I'm looking forward to when these lights will be available as LED bulbs.,3.0
"We have a five-bulb undershelf light. We have used up two bags of these little bulbs, since they burn out frequently. The price is right but you will be replacing them more often than you should have to.",3.0

Don't last long,3.0
too big didn't fit,3.0
"Good bulbs, just hate that they are not led bulbs.  Get very hot.  Quality is good, I got these as, that is what our RV originally came with, but they will melt a light fixture when left on too long.  LED are much better, but these have a very intense light if that is what you are looking for.  Make sure that the fixture is off when replacing bulbs these will burn you very quick as soon as they come on. Also make sure you use a napkin or something to put the bulbs in with or wipe them clean when install is complete.  The oil residue from your hands will cause them to burn out quite quickly.",3.0
Priced right but seems to blow out too quickly in my landscape lighting configuration.,3.0
"Though this came with 10 pieces, all were dim. The ones at walmart cost the same for 2 pieces but bright as day. This one is NOT recommended. Get the one at walmart",3.0

"Good products but with inconsistent quality.  I bought 20 of those bulbs.  Most of them work out OK as advertised.  One of the bulbs was dead on arrival (no lights).  Another bulb seems have troubles fitting in standard G9 socket (tried 4, 5 different ones and just can't go in).  Just installed most of them ... looks great while working.

Using this light in a Christmas decoration. When I ordered them I thought I  was getting the open faced lights. But I received the sealed lights instead. But because they were so cheap I didn't send them back. So far it seems to be working. But of course now I must wait until next Christmas to see if they still work.,3.0
super bright! easy install.,3.0
"Looks great, but about the last quarter of it went out after 2 uses. Seems poorly made.",3.0
"These bulbs work fine and last, but the size is slightly larger than a standard, name-branded MR11. If space is tight, these may not fit. The length from the base to the top part of the reflector is about 1mm too long.",3.0
Ordered these in May and have gone through 9 on 4 fixtures. Since I was spending $8.00 for 2 bulbs at the hardware store - and lasted about the same time frame - I am very happy with these for the price. I gave 3 stars because I still feel a bulb should last more than 10 weeks. I use these for outdoor lighting and leave them on from dusk till dawn.,3.0
Don't last long.,3.0
Theses are good for the price but don't last very long as with many bulbs in this category. I've handled the bulbs with gloves as not to get any grease on them but still last only about a month with use running at 4 hours a night but for the price I would buy again,3.0
Great. Works like it's supposed to!,3.0
"Good price, but frankly a little too dim for my application (bathroom vanity side lighting).",3.0
Price was fair.,3.0
"I used these to replace oven range hood lightbulbs. They did the job at a low price and now we have plenty of extras. They did not appear to be as good of a product as our old bulbs. Our old bulbs at sharp points on the two pins and provided a snug fit, whereas these have rounded points and don't seem to sit all the way in the receptacle. Overall, these do the job but next time will probably order a different brand. Of the two i tried, both worked.",3.0
They don't last that long but neither do the ones you buy at Lowes for ten times the price.,3.0

"Do burn out really fast, but for that price you get a lot of lamps.",3.0
"Cheap, it works though",3.0
"Great product for the price.  I read that you should plug these in using a tissue (so that the oil on your hand doesn't get on the surface which could get hot and burn.

Plugging these in just seemed to be a bit more cumbersome than I had imagined, but in the end they work great and are priced well.",3.0
"For the price, I guess is okay.  I did have one that is broke as soon as it is snap on light.  A little fragile.",3.0
"light works fine, but when compared to the original halogen light we have that came with the light initially, these are obviously dimmer, although the original bulb are the old ones that we have been using for over 1 year already.",3.0

"These are cheapies/unbranded/generics... We have a light in our dining room that requires 16 of these lights (hanging chandelier). We put new ones in and in about 2-4 weeks, a few of them are already out. The rest lasts a few more months and our light isn't always on (just for dinner and sometimes at night). But with 16 lights, we don't bother changing them until at least 10 or so is out. Buying these ones don't last as long but they're much cheaper than the ""branded"" ones and from what I read, those ones are a hit or miss anyway.",3.0
Works fine.,3.0
not quite as bright as the expensive original ones but very usable,3.0
"For the price these are great.  But they seem to be of lesser quality than the 'branded' bulbs I accustomed to.  The glass cracks easier (I broke one or two when inserting into base) and the metal contacts are not bendable to any degree.

With that said, I would buy again... but maybe that's because I'm a cheap-a$$  ;-)",3.0
"These bulbs are working for me, but they are rather crudely made.  One of mine blinks every few seconds and I will replace it today.  On the other hand they do work if you are careful and give very good lighting for this cost.",3.0
"Really great price for so many bulbs. Buying just one at the local hardware store costs about $6! At 10 for $12, this is definitely a great deal for anyone who needs a bunch.

However, I noticed they took a while to warm up. I had four of them installed in a vanity in the bathroom. When I turned on the lights, they were very yellow. After about 30 seconds or so, the color got whiter, but still too yellow for me. I thought it was my eyes playing tricks on me so I tried several experiments, such as standing in the lit hallway so my eyes were already accustomed to the brightness and then walking into the bathroom and turning on the lights. They still started off yellow and eventually turned whiter.

I also tried letting the bulbs warm up a few minutes, turned them off, and quickly turned them on again. This time they didn't start off as yellow, because they were already warm - proving that they do need time to warm up.

Note: the color temperature listed on Amazon is 3000K, but the box says 2800K.",3.0
"Although we knew prior to purchasing that this light can be very hot, we didn't anticipate it to be too hot, that it cast a rainbow like glow in one of the sockets in our light fixture. The bulb got burnt. We are not sure though if the bulbs caused it or if it was the light socket. Lights bright with a warm tone that is not too yellow.",3.0
"I purchased a 10-pack in March of 2013 to replace a bulb in a cheap Ikea lamp that had the same bulb for five years.  At the time, I wondered what I would do with 10 of them since I can't imagine the lamp lasting 50 years.  Since then, however, two of these new bulbs have burned out.  They are cheap, so that doesn't matter, but it seems wasteful and it takes time to replace them.  I'll look for better-quality bulbs when I run out of these.",3.0
"these are ok, we purchase a lamp a few weeks before, but the  bulbs had blue tips on them  and were brighter ,have looked everywhere, unable to find the  ones with blue tips",3.0

So much for quality control in China, I suppose, but considering the price I guess they'll do.",3.0
"The halogen lamps burn out in a matter of a few months in my landscape lights, so I got these cheap ones for replacements.  They last just as long as the name brands.  Hopefully, after the last one burns out the LED versions will have dropped in price.  The LED bulbs use 1/8th the electricity and last longer, but cost about 15-20 times as much.",3.0
One of 3 lights went out. Ordered this to replace it. Installed and seems noticeably dimmer than others still in the lamp,3.0
"The bulbs came all in one small ziplock bag, with no markings of any kind on the bulbs or anywhere else. So far the one I plugged in is working, but it is hard to tell if it is 20w or 10w...
Good price, so it's worth a try I guess.",3.0
"These are direct replacement bulbs for my landscape lighting. I'm not thrilled at how long they last...not very long. I'm sure there is a mixture of quality amongst the bulbs and some will last a long time, while others may blow in a day or two. Because they are so inexpensive, I can live with replacing them until I hit a winner.",3.0
"10 of these for less than the price of 1 at the local Depot.  Only issue is that the glass at the terminal area breaks easy, and I mean real easy.  So push in\out only, no micro twisting to get a better fit, etc.",3.0
"Works great with my various IKEA fixtures. I lost two of these, however, because the base cracks under almost no stress. Be sure to insert these lamps perfectly in line with the socket in your fixture. Any stress on the pins will be enough to crack off little flakes of glass, and it might even break the whole bulb. Order extras and be very careful inserting these.",3.0
"These seem to work fine, and they're certainly cheap enough, but I can't use them.  The bulb flares out at the base slightly instead of being straight all the way down, and I can't place the glass globe/protector back over these lights in my fixture.  If the lamp you want to use these in has a small clearance around the bulb, these won't work.  I should have known that for 1/10th the price at BigBoxHomeStore there would be a catch.",3.0
I waited over a month for arrival of this product. They were ordered for back up so luckily I didn't have use for them but be ready to wait... and walk yourself into the post office to sign for them.,3.0
I purchased this product to fix a Avon Christmas House that needed a light.  This was the correct bulb but the two prongs that you use to plug into the base on the ornament were bigger than what these had.  I was able to get it working with a little ingenuity on my part. (I glued a small piece of wire next to the thin ones that were on this bulb)  So far it works fine.,3.0
I purchased these bulbs at a phomonial price.  The adage you get what you pay for applies here.  They light.,3.0
I purchased 20 of these bulbs for a new installation. I installed 16 of them and one failed as soon as I turned them on. We'll see how long the others last.,3.0
the fish and coral are pretty (though tiny). the decals are less sticky than others i've had in the past.,3.0
The decals were very inexpensive and decent quality.  They are smaller then they look in picture.  I may order another one and combine them for better effect.,3.0
THIS PRODUCT WAS GOOD IN COLOR BUT DIDNOT STAY WELL ONTHE WALL IT CONTINUED TO CURL UP AND COME OFF THE WALL. I HAD TO BUY SOME ELMERS SPRAY CRAFT GLUE TO MAKE THEM STCK BETTER.,3.0
I was expecting them to be more like clings but they turned out to be stickers. My coworkers have gotten a kick of how I have transformed my cubicle windows into aquariums.,3.0
It is cute but it looks better online than it does in person in terms of color. I probably would not purchase this again. I find the Roommates brand to be superior in quality.,3.0
Had a weird strobing flicker,3.0
"Seems like a good product, but I cant use them because their height is more  than the mr11s their replacing, so they don't fit in my landscape light. Height on these is 38.5mm or 1.5"" for what its worth. Would have thought there was a standard for bulb dimensions.",3.0
"Purchased these to replace 3 halogen downspots for a wide interior art alcove, but these are more suitable for a garage or landscaping.
The cold LEDs have yellow overlays that attempt to simulate warm 3000K but come off as cool 4000K.
The yellow overlays result in an horrific yellow ring at the light cutoff before the cool spread, and the spread is much wider than an halogen MR11.
Going back to the old halogens, pricier, dimmable, softer - these are simply too harsh in every aspect for my usage, they'll find another use.",3.0
"NOT DIMMABLE.

Bought these to replace a fixture that previously used GU4 MR11 Halogen flood lights. These fit perfectly, GU4 base, but are not dimmable. They wil simply strobe and flicker.",3.0

I have puck lights and need this type of bulb. Rather expensive.,3.0
"These have been in use now for about a year.  About half of them have burned out already, and they don't get used very often.  While they are a good price, they definitely are not the longest lasting bulb out their.  The color temperature of them is good.",3.0
"The vendor delivered the product in a timely manner and it was in good condition.  No complaint there, but these do seem to burn out faster than I would have expected.",3.0
Great price lights works great and I don't see why must pay so much more for name brands that don't add anything more,3.0
good price for working lights.,3.0
"This item looks really good from 6+ feet away, but when you get closer you can see that it's a little cheesy looking. I was surprised that there's a hint of glitter in it, which makes it look more like it is for children, than the chic settings they show in the picture. The bark of the tree looks like a water-color painting while the leaves and flowers look more realistic, like a cross between a drawing and a photograph. I think that that contrast is kind of nice because it adds something more to it. That said, it is really good looking from further away and not too hard to put up. It doesn't come with directions, but it isn't too hard to figure out from looking at the pictures.",3.0
"I bought this for my 5-year-old's room. It's a very pretty design, sort of a acrylic/oil painting look. I didn't detect any overt sparkliness on it. If it stays up, I think it would be appropriate for any female room (and it's keeping me from having to paint pink walls). It is slightly transparent.
It was relatively easy to put up on my textured walls (flat paint). There were some slight issues with the sticker material not coming off the backing easily in places because the die cut didn't go all the way through.
It is coming up a little on the 'trunk' part -- I'm not sure if my dusting the wall was enough to get all the smutz up. I'm going to try doublestick tape. The rest seems to be adhering pretty well.
I have it coming across the wall horizontally and it is as wide as a twin bed.",3.0

"So many of these stickers are long and very skinny. Putting them up was difficult and if they curled back on themselves, they removed the image from the places they stuck to. I found them difficult to remove from the walls too. Didn't damage the paint, just difficult to get a fingernail under them to get it started.",3.0
"These are very cute stickers.  I would not recommend them if you are looking for something to move around.  They are extremely thin.  I was afraid to tear them when pulling them off the paper.  A few had tears from me trying to remove them.  The flower stems were the most difficult to pull off.  After I had placed the potted flower on the wall, I noticed it was slightly crooked, and tried to pull it off, it tore.  I had hoped to be able to reuse them in another room later, but I don't think it will be worth the time it will take.  You will need to be VERY careful if you want to remove them and reuse.  For the price, I can live with how thin they are.  If you plan on reusing in another location, it is not worth it.  FYI, my wall has a matte paint finish.",3.0
"I purchased this item for my 3yr old daughters room. It looks really cute but they don't stick as well as other brand decals. I have to keep pushing them back on around the edges. We purchased another brand of flower decals at the same time and they stick perfectly fine. Another thing I don't like is that the edges are clear and are shiny so they look like stickers, where the other decals don't have that and look more painted on the wall.",3.0
"These are cheap for a reason. The first set I received installed no problem, however I couldn't get one light to actually turn on. I checked and rechecked the polarities, and I had the wires connected correctly. finally I got the his to work, but it would only work for 10 minutes at a time and shut off. I called the company and they sent me two new ones, rather quickly I might add, and that was nice. But after receiving the second set, I installed them, they both worked great.. For about a day. Then sure enough I was having issues again. The reason I'm giving these three stars, and not less is simply because even though I was disappointed in the product, the customer service was excellent.",3.0

"It did passingly on my iPhone, but it wore down to unusable on the first use and left some quite large openings since it wore to the point where I had to use the thicker, less delicate, parts of the tools.

The screw drivers, however, are well worth the price of the entire kit.",3.0
"These were a little less than what I expected. The parts came loose in a zip-lock bag with no label of any kind. I got exactly what I paid for, cheap tools. That said, the seller advertises correctly. Two plastic pry tools, 2 mini screw drivers and 2 picks and a suction cup. I just expected the pry tools to be a little beefier.

"Item arrived from shipper in appropriate time, within 3-5 business days. Every item in this tool kit is okay, except for the screwdrivers. The screwdrivers aren't secured to the black handles, causing the handle to rotate by themselves as you try to remove screws. Screwdrivers are defective.",3.0

"As is typical with all halloween props/costumes that you purchase nowadays, the quality is extremely poor.  However, if you hang it in a window or on the wall as it is designed for and do not handle it frequently, it should last.  I do see problems with storing it during the off season as it could easily become damaged.  A suggestion would be to perhaps store it in a suitcase (hard case only).

Other than that, it does light up sufficient enough for affect and does not make any annoying sounds when lit.  Also, it is NOT battery operated so you have to deal with a power cord.",3.0
"I have no idea why Porter-Cable doesn't include one of these with the their 75xx series routers. I admit that the big routers would overpower most really delicate bits, but there are too many bits that are almost impossible to find in 1/2"" size. Since my 7518 is the router in my router table, this collet is an absolute requirement.

Enough complaining. The good news is that the 1/4"" collet is inexpensive and easily available. It works perfectly, of course, and is as solidly built as you would expect from a Porter-Cable professional tool. It also fits the 6xx series routers, in case you misplace one. So if you are like me and have four routers, you need one for backup in any case",3.0
"I bought this to replace a lost collet in our Porter Cable router.  The collet does not hold the bit and ""self releases"" while the bit is in use.  I have many Porter Cable tools and have always had good experiences with them, I believe we received a defective collet, but I didn't find out until we were beyond the return period.  I would advise potential buyers to test replacement parts immediately.",3.0

"my old one was worn out ,so  this is perfect timing as I will not have to search for a new one",3.0
"This is a great collet, but I am giving it three stars only because I had to purchase it to begin with.  I bought a top of the line Porter Cable router which came with a 1/4"" and a 1/2"" collet, but the 1/4"" collet was defective and didn't even fit a 1/4"" bit! So I had to go spend an additional $20 to get this thing because the quality control was nonexistent on the router I purchased.",3.0
has a serious design flaw. When the is no cutter in the collet and it is pushed down it becomes stuck because of a relief cut in the router and collect. The collet get caught in the relief and cannot be removed. I had to grind on the slots and then crack the collet into four pieces and remove the pieces one at a time. This happened when I put the router on my bench with the empty collect sticking below the base. Could be simply fixed by eliminating the relief catch point.,3.0
"Of course this is a great functioning product, which Porter Cable is well known for. But I have a real problem with Porter Cable not including it in their router packages. I spent over $300 on my router, and I only got the 1/2 collet, when I needed the 1/4 inch. Both ought to be included with the router, come on Porter Cable, don't be cheap!",3.0
"Overall the Porter cable 8620 12 volt battery pack is mediocre at best. The contacts on the pack corrode quite frequently, causing costly downtime to clean them up, and one of the units in the set of two failed only days after the warranty expired. On a positive note, the one hour charging time was a plus, and the flashlight-drill combo worked very well. I would have given it a 5 star rating, despite the contact problem, until the unit failed prematurely. (In my opinion). I used the tools only periodically when power was unavailable or awkward to get to...it is certainly not going to break the bank, but a disappointment to fail so quickly.",3.0
"A company like Porter-Cable should realize that the ""Out of Box"" experience for any product includes GOOD instructions.
Porter-Cable gets a big ""F"" for the ""manual"" that comes with this product!

I rated this product a ""3"" because Porter-cable went the route of using a cheesy, generic, instruction pamphlet-style manual that requires a magnifying glass to read...sort of like those manuals you get with cheap alarm clocks but bigger in size to cover alot of products. It covers router and plunge-base products and allocates about 4 lines to converting your (6902 motor in my case) to the plunge base. You really have to hunt for these 4 lines.

I almost sent the unit back because I followed the scarce directions and my 6902 wouldn't slide far enough into the plunge base. ""Finally""...I figured out that taking out the ""Motor Clamp Screw"" (allen head) completely with the small plate and barrel-nut it attaches to, allows the 6902 motor to slide all the way down and be seated correctly in the plunge-base.
Re-install the ""Motor Clamp Screw assembly"" after the router motor is in the plunge-base.

Directions say to loosen the ""Motor Clamp Screw"" approximately 1/2"" but that's not enough. Not the best design as it takes patience to use the little allen wrench supplied to re-tightened that ""Motor Clamp Screw"".

If your planning on going back and forth alot between fixed-base and plunge-base; save yourself the aggrevation and just buy a plunge router to go along with your fixed-base router.

Once I completed the install...no problems. Worked very well as advertised.",3.0
"it was idiotic to send a thin, light, 4 inch piece of steel in a box so that it would take forever to arrive (supposedly it's been sitting in Trenton 15 minutes away for 3 weeks...check the tracking) AND IT STILL HASN'T ARRIVED!!!  It could have been sent efficiently and cheaply in an envelope by 1st class and I would have gotten it in a few days.
GRANTED, after I complained 3 times and wasted WAY OVER 10 bucks worth of time (that's the cost of the blade) you kindly sent a replacement.

"I read in bed every night and I have tried almost every kind of book light out there. I have ones that clip onto the book or hang around my neck or clip to the headboard. This is definitely one of the better ones. You do need a fresh set of batteries to get a good, even light, but that's understandable. It puts the light right on the page just where you need it, which is difficult to do with the clip-on lights. It's nice that it doubles as a bookmark too. The only caveat is that you pretty much have to hold the book with both hands.",4.0
"This little light saved my marriage.  My wife awakens at the slightest light.  I on the other hand need to read in bed to relax so I can fall asleep.  The Lightwedge allows me to read in bed without waking my wife.

"The first paperback lightwedge I purchased from Barnes and Noble as a present.  When I tried it out; it worked great.  The light illuminated the whole page evenly. Therefore, I decided to get another one for myself.  The second lightwedge, though it appears to be the same product as the one I purchased earlier, does not shine uniformly over the glass.  It sends two streaks of light from the bulbs with an area that does not overlap so the middle and edges of the glass are dimmer.  If I would not have seen the first lightwedge, I don't think I would be as disappointed as I am with this one.  It is still better than the awkward clip ons, less annoying to those around one.",4.0

"Much better than other brands.  $20 bucks cheaper if you buy direct,  plus you'll have real warranty.  Amazon is a 30 deal,  after that Good Luck.  The ratings are always less than advertised.  Plastic in/out connection are STUPID.  The instructions are horrible.  I'm keeping it only because the other types are horrible.",4.0
"We already have a whole house tankless system that works great. Except. The kitchen is so far from the unit that waiting for hot water was wasteful. Which is why I plumbed and re-wired the house to install a POU in the kitchen.

While it is great at heating water I think maybe I should have researched a bit more.

I didn't realize that ""point of use"" does not always mean useable pressure at that point.

I think I should have purchased the IR-14K220 POU as a minimum for single point of use. The IR260 is barely enough to be a hand washer.

The part about using 1, 2, 3, or 4 heat elements in the IR260 is dreaming. Any less than 4 and you may as well not turn it on.

I would not recommend this unit for a kitchen sink (which is what I bought it for).

However, all things considered, It was an easy install, I like the IR concept for longevity, And if you need very little pressure with your hot water this would be the unit to buy.

I will find a use for it somewhere, but first I have to save up enough money to buy the IR-14K220 that I should have bought in the first place.",4.0
"This unit is great.  Instant hot water at our kitchen sink.  I was initially concerned that the temperature reading was 64 degrees but the water at the facet was hot.  Called their friendly, toll free customer service and was told that the reading is C not F since the unit is sold world-wide.  The manual just says ""temperature"" reading.  Gave the product 4 stars because of less than clear manual.  I consider a manual as an integral part of the product experience. Otherwise it would be five stars.",4.0

It's fine but not what I thought I had ordered. I really wanted Pantone GG5103 Plus Series Color Bridge.,4.0
The product is as indicated. It arrived on time without defect. Pantone is definitely getting cheap with their products. The paper it is printed on is not up to par with the books of just a few years ago. Also it can be hard to color match the bottom swatch in a light booth due to its vicinity to the book hinge.,4.0
"As a designer, I don't quite get the numbering system, I've never taken the time to try to understand it. It is always a bit of a mystery.

"A lot of people don't like the new chromatically organized colors. I find that it definitely helps with choosing colors, but slows you down a little when looking for a specific color number.

My only complaint is that the paper is very thin. I feel like I am going to rip the paper ever time I use the book. I know I will have to break out the scotch tape in the near future.",4.0
I almost gave this 3 stars. I'm that disappointed in the stock the guides are printed on. How much extra $$ would it have been to go with a heavier stock? This is too easy to crease. Packaging is good. I've posted closeups for anyone interested in the chromatic reordering (no flash used).,4.0

"While A. Cavada had their Mighty Bright light break in 4 days, it took me about 7-8 years before the same failure to my Mighty Bright clamp hinge occurred last week. I've been very happy with it all these years, although lately I've been wanting one that has a little warmer color which is supposed to make it easier to go to sleep after reading at night than this pure white LED model.

The long stalk from the clip to the light allows you to get more distance between the light and book, and so this can illuminate a college textbook sized book, even in low power mode with 1 LED turned on. It seems to run for quite a long time with one LED, using batteries. I've never needed to buy the AC adapter. Even with the clip broken, it will stand by itself on my nightstand and hold the light up while I'm getting ready for bed after my wife has fallen asleep.

However, after 7-8 years the stalk has gotten slightly limp, and while it will still hold position if you don't move your book too much it can shift easily if you move the book or light too much. I used to be able to roll over from my back to my side and the light would stay on the book, but now after wearing out over the past several years of usage I can't do that without the light sagging on the stalk and pointing elsewhere.

I had a good run with it for years, and I'm not sorry I bought it. But this time around I'm going to buy one with a warmer color LED, and I might as well try rechargeable while I'm at it.",4.0
"A good reading light, easy to travel with. It has two brightness settings and I hardly ever used the brighter one. The fact that it can bend means you can direct the light away from other people on a plan or a bus for instance.",4.0
"A nice little light for reading in the dark/in bed. The LED packs a punch! You'll have to move it around a lot as you read and change page sides, but it is very flexible and easy to move around. My one constructive criticism is that I think the clamp could be improved, it is really thick and chunky plastic and not necessarily the optimal design for clamping on to a book. It's not terrible I just think there is room for useful innovation in functionality. It took quite awhile to arrive, as well. But I like it overall and glad that I purchased it.",4.0
Great. Smaller than I thought but fits great in my mini backpack.,4.0
"Excellent light with one major flaw. I've owned two of them and the switches on each have worn out after about two years. However, this light is very inexpensive and I'm willing  to replace it every couple of years if it becomes necessary to do so.",4.0
It's compact design does make it a little heavy when clipped to a paperback book.  The fact that it can stand on a flat surface can come in handy.  This light is very bright even when on the single bulb setting.  I cannot speak to the concerns of some regarding the position the on/off switch as I have not traveled with the light as yet.,4.0

My wife and I use it for night time diaper changes now, because this thing gives us off more light than my night stand lamp lol",4.0
Light is nice and bright. Flexibility is pretty good. The option to use one or two bulbs is pretty cool too. The only reason it's getting 4/5 stars is because the clip that you need to squeeze to open it is soooo smooth and it always slips from my baby-soft yet manly fingers. That's really annoying. A little bit of texture on the clip would give it a better grip and make squeezing the clip a little easier.,4.0
It's great but turns on inadvertently if in my purse!,4.0
"Yes, good product for the readers.",4.0
"This thing is the perfect size for doing anything at night. We use it for reading and use it on clip boards for various things. The clip is really strong, and doesn't fall off. The neck is flexible too, but again, not fragile.

There are two brightness settings, and there is a significant difference between the two.

The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because it uses 3xAAA batteries. It goes through them pretty quickly, but that's kind of relative to your expectations and experiences.

To me, it should last longer, but to others, it may be fine. I think it'll use a set once every 3 months, with it being used every night, for about an hour.

I simply solved this problem with Eneloop rechargeable batteries.",4.0
Works as advertised.  My only complaint is that it's a bit too heavy to work easily with paperback books.,4.0
Very bright.  The batteries it comes with are sadly lacking though.  They only worked a few days before the light was too dim to read by.  I put new batteries in and it's been great.,4.0
Its good for reading and as a night light also. It is pretty bright and hooks onto most surfaces just fine. No complaints.,4.0
"The light works great. It does seem a bit dimmer than my old one. I would like if the clip were much thinner, it's very chunky and not good to leave in the book when you're not reading it. It is a better deal than buying at Barnes and Noble as well.",4.0
"I struggled with which book light to purchase, since the other reviews had me concerned over how many LEDs to get, soft or bright light, big or small, etc.  All tough decisions without seeing the product.  My main goal was to have a reading light at night while allowing someone else in the same room to sleep unaffected.  This book light has only 1 LED and it is BRIGHT.  After purchase, I couldn't imagine getting a light with 2 or even 4 LEDs.  It's fairly directional, though, so there isn't a ton of spill off of my book.  I was also concerned I might need something bigger, as the description indicated this was small, but honestly it's perfect, and any bigger would have been annoying.  The only thing I may have preferred was a ""cool"" light option, since this is a very bright, white light.  But overall, I think size and amount of LEDs is good.",4.0
Love this little lamp. I can attach to my outside chair and read in the evenings. Just what I wanted. Nice and bright,4.0
This book light definitely does the trick but I find it TOO bright. If sleeping next to someone who wants to sleep this will NOT work. It illuminates the whole room practically and even my own eyes against the white paper were tearing up it was so bright. My solution was to wrap masking tape a few layers around the bulb and that softened it but its way too bright. Too much of a good thing,4.0
Very nice light for reading at night,4.0
"After getting by with a $4 book light from Walmart for about a month, I decided I was worth more. I checked out a couple of different options, and read quite a few reviews concerning these by Mighty Bright. I went with the XtraFlex, as many noted that the two settings available on the XtraFlex2 were unnecessary, as the first setting was bright enough.

This light is DEFINITELY bright enough, but not so much so that it ruins that sort of, immersive reader feeling. As others said, the LED is key and provides even light that will cover two pages. The neck is easily maneuvered but stays in place. The only issue so far is that the battery pack is pretty bulky/hefty. If I ever need another one, I might try the travelflex because of this, but honestly, it's not a huge deal and after slumming it with the cheap one from Walmart, I am living the dream right now.",4.0

"The light is nice and bright and the clip stays put on my Kindle. Only problem I've had is that the thing drains batteries really fast. I use it a lot, and I have to replace the three AAA's at least once a week. The light gets too dim to be useful if I don't.
I'm wondering if lithium batteries would last longer.",4.0
Got this to put next to diaper changing station and it works great. Light is very white and plenty bright. Not for those looking for a softer light. All in all happy with it,4.0
"This is a great little light. Very good gooseneck...good quality. Clip is a little bulky, but not a problem. My biggest issue....not really even an issue, is the batteries it comes with are super cheap and I recommend not even bothering with them. I was disappointed in the amount of light it gave off from the beginning, but figured it was inexpensive and that's as good as it gets. Anyway, i went ahead and put new batteries in with hopes it would make a difference and WOW!!!! Huge difference...it was never this bright out of the package. So....ditch the cheapy batteries like I said and you'll have a really nice light.",4.0
"I got this for my bf who likes to read in bed to get sleepy. A lot of times he falls asleep with the light on, which is why I got this.

After he clipped it onto a steady surface and it didn't move, it was wonderful! It gives him enough light to read (almost too bright if too close) and is much better than the harsh lamp light, for me. If I'm not looking in his direction it feels like moonlight coming in from the window. Great buy!",4.0
"Used for contemporary worship setting. These last a good long while with fresh batteries, simple two-LED setting, and can be used for multiple things (books, music stands, etc). I would recommend these to other musicians.",4.0
"Works well for reading.  Energy efficient, given that I've been running on the same low-efficiency rechargeable AAA batteries for the past several months.  Two settings are nice, but if anything, the low setting is brighter than necessary (I'm sure this varies by user); you can practically illuminate a room with it.",4.0
"Good, long lasting book lamp for my bookworm children. Each have one of these and they stay up late every night reading. Batteries only need infrequent replacing. Durable and reliable!",4.0
"The light works great and is really bright but I would improve two things: 1 - make the light beam wider, it is more of spotlight on the page and only illuminates one small section; 2 - make the arm of it longer to be used on larger books.",4.0
"The clip is a little bulky but it is a great light to read a night. It has 2 settings, the lowest one is even a bit bright for me but will definitely allow you to read in bed at night.",4.0
light is too bright. Bothers my GF. There needs to be a lower light setting.,4.0
Great little light that works well.,4.0
Very good,4.0
Durable and bright light. My kiddo uses this every night to read before bed. The batteries that came with it don't last long so I recommend getting some Duracell or energizer batteries.,4.0
"Bought this book light as a Christmas gift for my mother. I haven't heard any complaints since she received it, so it must be working very well!",4.0
I love this light. Perfect for my needs.  The only design flaw is that I stash it in my bag and the on button gets pushed draining the batteries.  I always take a battery out when I pack it.  Small hassle but worth it for the pluses,4.0
Great light and it takes real batteries unlike most of the others. It is a little on the big side as it weighs as much as most of my kids books but he enjoys the light and having two brightness levels is great. Very happy and still in the first set of batteries. Works great as a bookmark too.,4.0
"Overall, this book light seems to work well. I switch between normal books and my Kindle so I don't use it day in and day out.",4.0
Pretty good.  2 brightness is nice.  Won't win any awards for best product ever.,4.0
good,4.0
I bought one of these lists for my mother and now this one for my husband. Serves it's purpose and have not heard any complaints from them.,4.0
"I was VERY happy with this...until the cover for the batteries kept falling off in the middle of the night! It is well-made (except for battery slot), and, borders on being ""beautiful"". It really lights up the whole bed you are in and lets another bed sleep. I like it...just wish they'd fix the battery chamber",4.0
"MUCH BRIGHTER THAN I NEEDED, EVEN ITS LOW SETTING WAS RATHER STRONG",4.0
Using my light now.  It's clipped to the top of my laptop.  Also clip it to the books to read.  Takes 2 AA batteries.  Bright enough for me.,4.0
"I attach this to my bed frame so I can work on my laptop or read in bed. The light is able to be attached to anything that has a width of 1"" or less. It has two light settings that I feel there isn't a big difference between. Perfect for use in bed if you don't wanna turn the room light. I wish there was more than two light settings as they are too bright sometimes.",4.0
"I bought this as a reading light for my 7 year old when his siblings have gone to sleep. It is easy to use, and the clip opened wide enough to attach to the wooden bed frame. I was hoping the light would be bigger. This size seems more suitable for adults than children. My son was  thrilled to receive it and uses it most nights.",4.0
"Overall, I am pleased with the book light.  If it were possible, I would give it 4.5 stars.  It does not bounce around as I feared.  About the only downfall I have noticed so far is when using it with a full-sized book, it does not light up both pages without refocusing the light.  The light stream also does not shine very bright to the bottom of the page of the full-size book.  Additionally, it would be nice to have some sort of storage case for it.  The price cannot be beat and there is a wide selection of colors from which to choose.  It is the best book light I have found in the last few years.  I would recommend it and would purchase it again.",4.0
"The loghts have good quality construction, in including flexible neck and strong clamp... However the light is way too bright even on low setting for use reading in bed without disturbing your partner. It works best above a reading chair about two feet away from a book.",4.0
"This light is sturdier, heavier, and brighter than others I have used. I like it.",4.0
"This is a powerful little flashlight. There are two settings: 1. Shield your eyes and 2. Burning retinas. All joking aside, it works well and comes with batteries. I read at night in a completely dark room, so it might not be so bad if you have another light source on. Also, it's pretty durable. My kid beats this up on the daily and it still functions as well as it did when I first bought it.",4.0
"I like Mighty Bright's products; I use their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mighty-Bright-Orchestra-Light-with-Adapter-and-Bag/dp/B003B0I09Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mighty Bright Orchestra Light, with Adapter and Bag</a>&nbsp;and am super happy with that. This one, though, isn't so great, at least for the way I wanted to use it: to read comparatively large books with my (relatively poor) eyesight. For that I'd give it three stars, but I'm sticking with four because it's not a bad product as far a single-arm two-LED light goes.

I liked that the gooseneck is supple but strong, stays in place wherever you put it. Seems to be reasonably well-built, it doesn't weigh much. I didn't use the AAA batteries it came with, because I intend to use it almost exclusively with rechargeables.

What I didn't like:

1. When you try to spread the light out across both pages of a standard-size hardcover book, it's not quite bright enough. It worked great when I focused all the light onto a single page -- nice and bright -- but that meant I had to keep repositioning the lamp left and right, over and over, each time I went to the next page. That was the dealbreaker for me. I'll concede that it's probably slightly brighter with non-rechargable batteries, due to their higher output voltage, but again, I'd only ever use this with rechargables.

2. The light it casts has a little bit of a hot halo around the edge. That is to say, it's slightly darker in the middle than it is right around the perimeter of the illuminated area. This bothered me a little, because my pupils wanted to adjust to the brightest spot on the page.

3. The front edge of the bulb housing is another too-bright thing in one's field of vision. I'd probably recommend buying this in black plastic, or even putting a bit of black electrical tape on the tip of the lamp, where it faces you, to act as kind of a visor or blinder.",4.0
Works well.,4.0
Too bright even on second setting. It lights up the room too much when I'm reading and my husband is trying to sleep.,4.0

good light,4.0
Great but wish it ran off of AA batteries.,4.0
"This is a great light, although if you have a sleeping husband who is sensitive to light, it may be too bright and may disturb him. On the bright side - you won't strain your eyes while reading in bed! :)

- Very Bright

- Long lasting

Cons:
- Maybe too bright!",4.0

ok,4.0
"I've had a number of book lights and can honestly say that this book light rocks! The ""alligator"" arms gives you the ultimate ability to adjust the position of the lamp head with the two small bulbs in it.  The reason I did not give this 5 stars is that the spring in the clamp mechanism is darn tight.  Since I suffer from post-surgical CRPS, I've lost soft tissue and muscle strength in my right and left hands and forearms, thus making it a lot more challenging for me to open the clamp.  Discounting this darn disability, I'd wholeheartedly advise the purchase of this great book lamp.",4.0
I added this clip light to my lap desk and really like it. It is easily attached and stays where you put it. I have only had mine a week but I use it daily.  I highly recommend it..,4.0
"Pros: It's gives a decently bright light, and the circumference of its light is wide enough to read. The flexible neck fixes itself in position and doesn't droop. It takes one AAA battery, and the packaging says it lasts 24 hrs. It's very lightweight.

Cons: You can't use this on a 7th-generation Kindle (2014 model). The Kindle's back edges are slanted, and this TravelFlex's clip is too small to fix itself securely onto a Kindle in any way. I tried affixing the light to all four sides of the bezel, even the lower wider part, but no luck getting it to stay still. You definitely would need a Kindle cover to clip this light onto.
Also, it's made in China and out of the box, the whole thing looks really flimsy. I got the silver color, and I can see poor quality in the edges of the plastic parts. Still, since it does a good job of lighting up enough area to read a book, as long as its neck doesn't start to droop or the light starts to dim or blink, I'm pretty satisfied.",4.0
"This is a handy light-weight light that can be used on paperbacks as well as hardbacks. It is has two settings, bright & very bright! I wish it had an even lower setting because it is a little too bright in a dark room for my sensitive eyes. It is also good to attach to other surfaces for use as a lamp, like when traveling.",4.0
Bought it for my kids birthday and he loves it. If they ask for it buy it.. especially if your kid wants to read :-),4.0
I like this little light and it's pretty bright but I only gave it 4 stars because I only used it a couple times and it's already dim as if the batteries need to be replaced. I thought maybe I would've gotten a little more use out of it before I needed to replace the bateries. But still a good light when the batteries are new.,4.0
"2 light settings, lower one is a bit dim, but does the job. A bit clunky to attach to the book and have to keep readjusting the angle, but doesn't keep my wife awake. Definitely does the job.",4.0
"It's a good light, it's bright and seems of good enough quality. However, the clip is very thick so thinner books are harder clip onto, furthermore the paint used on the light smudges onto the pages inside the book which i found to be an unpleasant surprise. So if used for a hardcover or perhaps a kindle would be more ideal than using it on smaller books.",4.0
GOOD,4.0
great reading lite,4.0

It's great so far I have no complaints,4.0
Works really well when we loose power and now I can read comfortably. Happy with the purchase.,4.0
"It's a good, strong and handy light. I like the two settings too. I can see both pages with the brighter light, though its just a little nudge to see the other page with the single light.",4.0
"Mighty Bright is no joke! Even with only one of the two LEDs illuminated it is almost too bright for me - I may tone it down with a bit of paper tape over the clear lens. Been using it around 12 hours or so cumulative, on the included batteries and it is still going strong.",4.0
"My first reading light love is by the same company: mighty bright; and it is the travelflex model.  Actually, if I could combine the light quality of the XtraFlex2 with the design of the travelflex that would be my ideal light. ;) This is hands down the best light quality I have found but the design is a little too bulky and heavy.  I find it to pull on the pages and I find myself adjusting it somewhat regularly as I read. I think this light is best suited for larger, thicker, heavier books.",4.0
"Nice bright reading light
What more can I say?
It makes the pages look at night
Like they do during the day.",4.0
Very happy with the light. My son uses it on his bunk bed. I like how you can set the light to very bright or bright by easily pressing the button once or twice.,4.0
"My daughter and I read every night together before bed and this little do-hicky is exactly what we needed.  We haven't had to change the battery yet and it's been several months.  The only design change I would make to this, is reducing the thickness of the clip because it makes it a little clumsy.  You can't shut your book with this thing in it, and I wish you could so the following night you could just pick it up and start reading.

On another note... My 10 year old daughter has twisted and bent the neck of this thing around into knots, and it hasn't broken.  I was impressed!",4.0
"Great for reading at night after my husband is asleep.  The light is quite bright, though, so you need to aim it carefully so it doesn't shine in the eyes of your sleeping partner.",4.0
Works as advertised but even on the lower setting it's still very bright which can be bothersome for the person you're sharing your bed with.,4.0
"This is a pretty good little light. I've only used it on a book so don't know how it will work on my Kindle. The only real compliant that I have is that the battery compartment is a little bigger than I'd like  but it is what it is. I like that the light is so easy to adjust so overall it was a good purchase. Oh, yeah - I love the green color.",4.0
Love this light!!! Works perfectly for book reading in bed. I bought it for my 11 year old daughter and she loves it. It is bright and also doesn't weigh much so she can use it on paperback books also.,4.0

"This was a gift for my girlfriend who absolutely loves to read, and especially loves to read at night when I am trying to sleep.

I bought this so she can see without keeping a light on.  This product is great for that, as the light is very focused and has two brightness levels.  I will dock it one star though, as it is VERY easily to accidentally turn it on if it is just thrown in a bag.  It should have some sort of switch that makes it more difficult to accidentally activate.",4.0
"Nothing fancy. This product does what it says. However, it's unfortunate that the batteries need to be so large, because it makes the base a bit too heavy. It's really brightmaybe too bright.",4.0
"The light works great, with 2 brightness settings.  It is a little on the heavy side though (weighs down one side of a book).  the green case was a different shade than I had thought.",4.0
"This little light could have two uses. One is certainly as a book like. The other use is as a flashlight in the event of a power outage. It has two settings: ""bright"" (with one bulb) and ""bright as the sun"" (with both bulbs). I found it to be very bright and if you shine it into someone's eyes, they will be left with that blotch in their vision just like if you had looked at the sun. My only concern is the fragile feeling crane like neck that can be adjusted to a position of your liking. Its held up so far after over half a year of use, but we tend to take care of our stuff. If someone (perhaps a wild child) were to grab it at the top where the bulbs are and wring it around with the battery laden bottom portion swinging around, I could see it losing its ability to be molded into a desired position.",4.0
"The light works OK for paper backs, but can be very flimsy on thin books. The 2 LED light is brighter, but had trouble getting even light on both pages, I have to bend the book a certain way to get light to certain areas. I know this would work far better on a hard back book. I would rather read a book on my Kindle or iPad, but if that's not an option these should work for you.",4.0

"I've tried a lot of book lights and this one is really pretty good.  It has two light levels - a bright and a dim.  It strongly holds on to the book.  And the light has a wide ""field of vision"" - meaning that it casts a wide light for easy bed reading in the dark!",4.0
I USE THIS LITE WITH MY KINDLE AS I HAVE LOW VISION AND THE LIGHT IN THE COVER DOES NOT ADEQUATELY DO THE JOB WHEN I READ IN BED WITH OTHER LGHTS OFF.  BOUGHT ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER IN LAW TOO FOR WHEN SHE CANNOT SLEEP AT NIGHT.  iIT IS GREAT!,4.0

"Overall, this book light is great: small, lightweight, reasonably priced (and lovely looking too!). The package also came with 3 batteries for use. However, I expected the light to be much brighter, having seen all the positive reviews for it. It has 2 levels of brightness, but my eyes are still strained even with level 2.",4.0
"I bought this as a replacement for my other Mighty bright which still works after 15 years.  But, it is hard on the batteries.  I hope this LED model will be less consumpting of batteries.  So far the lamp will be a good replacement.  It had a weird glitch where it would not come on and then it would and only one LED would come on.  Seems fine now, if it acts up anymore I just return for another one.  These little lamps get great reviews so I'm hoping mine will serve me for 15 years like my first one did.  FYI, don't look directly into the LED's, they are bright as hell and hurt my eyes.",4.0
"I am a night owl with a wife who isn't. I had been considering the purchase of a book light for about a year to satisfy my desire to read while at the same time not interrupting my wife's sleep.  This light fits the bill perfectly.  The two options for quantity of light offer plenty of options for any use.  The single LED provides plenty of light for reading paper backs and hardcovers without polluting the dark room or waking a partner.  The double LED works well for reading but also increasing the types function: it works well as a task light on a table, a handle held or clip on flashlight, and I have even begun using it as a table light for tying flies.

Great purchase that seems sturdy and well built.",4.0
I like this light. The flexible stem is very useful. I also like that it has two settings for the brightness as the brightest level seems a bit much for me. Also useful for knitting in the car - I attach it to the seatbelt.,4.0
"great light, little bulky having to hang it from book and the neck thing moves a little too easily to where sometimes it shifts while you're reading.  Make sure you have heavy duty batteries or the light is really faint.  My sister bought me the book light that's glass and looks like a page and I prefer that b/c I don't have to move it as often and it's more convenient.",4.0
"It's a great booklight and having 2 brightness options provides the right amount of light.  The only negative is that it's base is a bit bulky but does hold the 3 AAA batteries.

"I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. On our last vacation, we both stayed up reading after my husband went to sleep and the room light was a tad bright to leave on, but we did anyway.

"No idea how it works as a reading light other than it has to be better than the watch battery ones--they go thru batteries like crazy. With this, I was looking for something to spotlight a 20 oz. plant nano for a a couple of hours a night. The batteries it comes with are cheap and fade quickly, but I use brand name rechargeables and get about 15 hours of light out of them on ""high"" before replacing them. I use it on its base and even without that added base mighty bright wants to sell you, this is very sturdy. Never tips over. It's great to spotlight a small terrarium or keepsake under a bell jar, stuff like that, esp. in an area where there is no electrical outlet. Have had it for a month now and no issues. The only reason it is 4 stars instead of 5 is that is took 5 attempts at contacting customer service to find out how many Kelvins it is--10,000K if you're wondering. This was ridiculous as this was something that could easily have been stated on their website or description and ... Read more",4.0

I suppose I thought it might be a bit softer to be used in a completely dark room, however that was not the case. Despite the broken expectation, it is still very useful and it was worth the money.

"Very light and portable book lamp.

This is a reading light that you clip onto your book. Please note that the clip is too small to clip onto your bed's headboard or thing of that nature. I only use this with physical books, and I haven't tried it with Ereader such as kindles or iPad, so keep that in mind.

The light is sufficient for reading when there is no other light sources. Like most LED, it's a white but soft light that's easy on my eyes.

The coverage is good but not great. I did have to adjust it a little bit every time I turn the page. Now, this sounds worse than it actually is. It become an automatic process that I don't even think about after a while. For most books, it can lighten a fully opened book (2 pages) at the same time.(see pictures I uploaded). For full sized or larger sized books, it will not cover 100% of both of the pages. (Again, refer to the picture).

The neck of this light is very flexible and can be easily molded into any shape you want :)

Bonus point: batteries are included!!

Overall: Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.",4.0

"Well, it sure is cute; I really like the metallic blue, goes great in my room. The clamp is a great idea, I have mine clamped on the edge of a utility
cart. That keeps it set back off the edge which shortens the  cable so it barely reaches over the laptop, however it is pretty bright so it lights the far side satisfactorily. I would really like it more if it was even an inch longer. Moving on, the cable is sturdy and so it stays right where you put it, which
my old one did not do. Another nice thing is that it doesn't get hot to the touch which is important when you reach over to turn it off or turn it down.
Two choices is very convenient and the light is totally focused downward so it does not bother your eyes if your face is close by. It comes with
batteries, but after 2 or 3 days of moderate use they were nearly dead, so I would suggest you buy some for a back-up, you might need them
sooner than you think.",4.0
It's great. you really need a electrical cord. Batteries don't last long.,4.0
"Very happy with this lamp. It does the job, my only complaint is that the base(clip) is kind of bulky and heavy.",4.0
"Great light, but a little too bright for my liking.",4.0
"If you are looking for good reading light then do not buy this. If you are looking to read a little before bed and you do not want to disturb your spouse with a bright light, then this is for you. I do like it but can only read comfortably for about 20 minutes with the low light . Good enough for me.",4.0
Great and handy.,4.0
nice product,4.0
Works great on my kindle!,4.0
Light works great and has a hi\low light setting. The arm that the light is attached to is easily adjustable.,4.0
Great book light!!!  A little too bright for my spouse to fall asleep. It definitely lights both pages of my book though,4.0
I like it....works as advertised....,4.0
Works exactly as it should... but its sooooo bright that its unusable if you have a lighy sleeper next to you (like my wife),4.0
Great for that late=night reading in bed - or when others around you don't want additional light.,4.0
"A bit bulky for paper backs, but attached it to the pillow.",4.0
"Works best using the batteries, if your AC outlet is not in a convenient location. Although I prefer regular light to LED lighting, it does the job.",4.0
"Good amount of light, though it does take periodic adjustments to keep it in position to illuminate the entire reading area. Of the available reading lights at this time with out breaking the bank this is among the best so far.",4.0
"Best book light I have owned in terms of brightness.  Not too bright, not too dim.  Overall, a little larger than I expected.",4.0
Birthday present for grand daughter.  She loves it!,4.0
It's definitely bright. A little too bright.,4.0
"Perfect reading light for my daughter's bed. Adjustable arm stays where you put it, and it has two levels of brightness.",4.0
Great reading light that I attached to my son's bed. The adjustable arm adjusts easily and stays where you put it. It also has two levels of brightness.,4.0
Just the best reading  light ever!!!!!,4.0
Bright light. Works well. Small complaint that the battery area and clip are a bit chunky and heavy so it's a little awkward with a small paperback.,4.0
Offers perfect lighting.  The goose neck was a little skinnier than I anticipated but it doesn't seem flimsy so I can deal with that.,4.0
bright and not in the way of reading.,4.0
I use this as a night light on my baby car seat to shine light on the baby just to make sure things are ok back there,4.0
Works fine. Reasonable price. Clip is a little bulky and could definitely be a little smaller.,4.0
"You pay for the color, which I thought would be pink (my granddaughters favorite), but it was more purple than pink.  In any case, it's a very good reading light.",4.0
"The clip is kinda bulky, especially for paperbacks. The light is super strong though, awesome LEDs.",4.0
"Perfect in every way...except that clunky,  constantly shifting clip.",4.0
It makes the whole room brighter making my husband complain at night but I love it otherwise,4.0
"This book light works really well. It's a little bit heavier than my old one, but I see both pages at a time.",4.0
The light is certainly bright enough for nighttime reading. My only complaint is that it is very large. THis is most noticeable when reading paperbacks.,4.0
Perfect for my little girl.  if it gets broke from being missed used will not hesitate to buy another. no issues at all.,4.0
Love it!! The light is bright and works very well.,4.0
Gives off lots of light,4.0
I purchased two of these. One of the bulbs in one of these flickered. I will need to send it back. Otherwise I would have given it a 5 star rating. It was purchased as a gift. I would like one for myself.,4.0
One day someone will invent the perfect one of these.  This is fine but I wish the neck were an inch or so longer so that the bottom of the page were better illuminated.  Full disclosure: I have aging eyes that can't seem to get enough light when I'm reading.,4.0
great for reading actual books in bed or in low light when I'm not using my Kindle or tablet,4.0
Great little light but it is very very bright!! It has two settings but there isn't much of a difference between them.,4.0
"Bright, compact and flexible. All that is required.",4.0
Works well. Can read in the dark. Clip is nice. Doesn't light the entire page though. Needs a wider illumination area.,4.0
"Very bright, perfect.",4.0
"I like the AAA battery replacement. I had purchased book lights that used button cell batteries. However, the cost of the battery was nearly the cost light. I use rechargeable batteries that last a few weeks of heavy use. I would have liked an adjustable brightness to the light. It is bright, I would just like some more control with a lower light level. The battery and clip assembly is slightly bulky, but for the cost I think it is worth it.",4.0
Its really bright! I like it!,4.0
Better quality than others. Use in car to do homework and it light is bright yet small in area.,4.0
"I personally love this but my husband thinks it's too bright even on the lower setting. I do agree with him, but I'm not the one who is trying to sleep so I enjoy it. It's really good quality too.",4.0
Good light. I like that it's bright enough that it can cover both pages but it's also a little too bright if you have a roommate or are sleeping with a partner.,4.0
Terrific little light my daughter used to read on top bunk! It does not get hot and it is so easy to manuver - great product.,4.0
"Pretty good book light.  Hasn't broken yet, so that's saying something!  I just wish it had a even lower light setting.  The lowest setting still lights up my bedroom and isn't conducive to letting my husband sleep while I read.",4.0
"Good travel accessory, especially if traveling with someone who can only sleep when there are no lights on. It is a bit heavy but it is what it is.",4.0
Everything was good except the color isn't the same as pictured.,4.0
I love it. Its a great booklight & arrived early. My only problem is the color; I thought it would be pink but its more of a purple..,4.0
I clip it to my headboard sometimes instead of the book.  Great light.,4.0
Works great.,4.0
Perfect for what I needed and the high/low light options are a very nice feature.,4.0
Bright light with good coverage. This is the 3rd book light I've had and it is definitely better than the others.,4.0
may be too small but cute,4.0
I really like it.  Great for vacations.,4.0
"A lot of light from a small lamp. I needed a small lamp by my bed for during the night when I wake up. A room light would really wake me up, but with the Xtraflex 2, I turn it off and go right back to sleep. It would be a good light to read by. It came quickly and was packed well and I have no complaints at all. It was smaller than I thought but since using it for a few weeks now, I've adjusted to that.",4.0
Light dimmed after some time.,4.0
"Works well, I think it could be brighter.",4.0
"Nice light, works smoothly, well made.",4.0
"Ordered pink but got purple, color difference wasn't enough reason to bother to return, color shade was fine...now if it had been Orange or yellow or green...you'd been getting a return...",4.0
"Reading, reading, reading.  This light illuminates brightly.  Batteries last a while - can even use rechargables to be green.  Only suggestion - the field of view is sometimes more narrow than the book and requires some repositioning.  Minor issue only.  Light is great otherwise.  We have two of these to avoid frantic searches just before bedtime.",4.0
Great Product,4.0
"Nearly perfect. This book light is great for reading at night. It stays put, is easy to adjust and illuminates well. If it could be dimmed a bit more, it would be perfect.",4.0
good clip but light can be a bit bright.  my husband sometimes complains its too bright on his eyes if i am reading and he is trying to sleep,4.0
"Very durable book light.  Previous book lights I purchased lasted 2-3 months due to a run of bad luck.  This one has almost made it a year now, and does not show any signs of slowing down.",4.0
"I love the push button design and 2 levels of light, although even the lower level feels slightly too bright for reading in the dark.  But I can get beyond that because it is lightweight and works well.",4.0
Worked for a while..dead now.,4.0
"Works great as a booklight! However, it doesn't last as long as I expected from reading the reviews. I put brand new, good batteries in it and the LED's kept getting dimmer as I read. It's still a great booklight, though.",4.0
Works well. Just wish it had multiple settings for the light because it's pretty bright.,4.0
works great!,4.0
Got this to read before bed on vacation when family is sharing a room - worked great! Bright enough for me but not bright enough to wake anyone up. Love the flexible neck and clip for getting just the right angle. Only complaint is that even the lowest LED can cause a glare if it's not positioned well. Great buy!,4.0
Works great. Serves its purpose. Very utilitarian. Easy to clip onto books as well as small lips on desks and headboards. I find that the blue of the LED can be a little bit of a strain on my eyes but thats about it.,4.0
I've had this light for nearly a year now.  I only use it when I travel with my brother and I want to read into the night.  The bendable neck allows me to bend the light down directly onto my Kindle DX (large version of Kindle reader) and the light has two settings (low - one bulb and high - two bulbs).  I keep the light focused on the Kindle with the low setting and my brother never knows I'm reading till midnight or later!  I will stand on a table by itself if you wanted a very bright light to focus on your laptop or when reading on a desk top.  The base also has a clip to hold it onto a book.  I've had great use of mine so far.  I've probably used it a dozen time for at least 4 hours at a time.  Battery is replaceable but I haven't had to do it yet.  Recommend this for readers who need to keep their light out of other people's faces.,4.0
My wife likes it.  I wish it were a little brighter and dispersed the light over more of the page.,4.0
"Didn't work, but got a fast refund.",4.0
Very bright and easy to read by.  The stem is a little loose and I have to keep putting it back up over the book the reason it got 4 stars - otherwise it is great!,4.0
This was a Christmas gift. They really liked it.,4.0
"Very lightweight, good amount of light for reading.",4.0
Nice little book light.,4.0
Perfect little light for reading or small projects where additional spot type light is necessary. The clip makes it easy to attach to things without it falling over. It also bends in any position for directing the light where needed.,4.0
Works great!,4.0
"I absolutely love this little light. I would recommend buying the power adapter as it does seem to go through batteries pretty quickly. I tend to use the adapter when I read in bed or am near a power outlet and the light seems a bit brighter w/the adapter. I do have to swivel the light to direct it to either the left hand page or the right. If I'd had known that AND known how much I'd use the light, I would have opted for the version that has two lights on it. But so far in six months of use, the arm has not worn out so I'll soldier on a while longer with the single light. This is a BIG improvement over book lights of years ago - specifically the ""Itty Bitty Book Light"" from book stores in the '80s. Much better and brighter light. Enough light to read without any other illumination.",4.0
too bright ....needs a lower low but a quality product !,4.0
The clip is a bit bulky and heavy but works well.,4.0
"A bit pricey but these are nice bright lights with the option of 1, or 2 LED bulbs on at a time.  Also nice they take standard batteries. After awhile if you adjust them a log the neck will get funky and not want to stand up.",4.0
Bought one for me and for my daughter. We both like it. No problems so far.,4.0
good light,4.0
"Awesome! Perfect for hanging on my bed.

I have accidentally fallen asleep with this on, and the battery has still not died. I have had it for a couple months now!

Reccommend.",4.0
"A little too bright, even on the lowest setting but that doesn't bother me, only my sleeping husband. At least it's better than keeping the lamp on. My husband can sleep a little better with this book light than a lamp.",4.0
"Works just as it should, although at first there was a connection problem since the light flickered. Once I moved the arm around a bit, it was resolved.",4.0
"great nighttime  reading.  gave as a gift and wife uses it every night, and falls asleep with Kindle keyboard and this light on it.  she  obviously liked it from beginning.  PROS:  does the job  and  does it well...
Cons:  a little cumbersome and heavy  for  the book it is on.  but  the  functionality outweighs this.
Recommend:::  yes.
Buy again:::  yes.  within reason.
Satisfaction:  quite.
My Experience Level:  long term, mature.
  enjoy  (-:",4.0
Great product only thing i gelt was it was a lil on the heavier side ...overall pleased with the product,4.0
works just fine and holds up well in the bottom of my purse,4.0
You should change the batteries as soon as you get it. Thought I was going blind. After I changed the batteries it was so much better. Only need to use the one light setting. Love It! Alice,4.0
"I wish the base was a bit more streamlined. Great for reading in any lowlight/ no light situation (bedtime, plane, train, car). Can clip right on to the book you are reading on stand on its own. Long battery life.",4.0
"Perfect to light up a book or laptop. I have it clipped to my bedframe and it gives me just enough light to read and my wife can still sleep peacefully beside me. Note: it's tinier than it looks in the picture, but gets the job done. Batteries included.",4.0
"I bought myself the Xtraflex2 LED book light to use when I read in bed in the summertime. Even though I replaced our old screen with supposedly gnat-proof mesh, the tiny bugs were still flying right through when I used the regular bed light, so I use the clip-on, which is not bright enough to attract the bugs. Unfortunately, if I read for a long time, I begin to get a bit of eye-strain as this light is not quite bright enough for me. I've got cataracts starting in both eyes, so this might not be a problem for everyone.

The clip is very strong and is flat on one side, so you can even use it as a stand on a flat surface. No matter how much I twist the light's neck, it never seems to affect the light.

This light can also be used during power outages, which are fairly frequent where we live.",4.0

"I've had this light for about a week now. My wife works 13 hour days and hates when I have a light on in bed. I picked up this light hoping it wouldn't disturb her since other reviewers stated it was good for such scenarios. I think my perception of brightness is pretty solid, and I don't think my wife is overly light sensitive, and we both think this is pretty bright. It would easily replace my regular bedside table lamp. It has two settings, one with both LED's lit and one with a single LED. I never need more than the single LED, and even that is probably overkill for a normal size paperback. I picked up one of the single LED book lights as well, thinking it may be better suited to this task, but it seems brighter than the two LED, or even the single LED lit on this light. It is definitely a solid product just wish it had more control over the lighting, like a dimmer or something because I still get told to turn my light off, forcing me to read my Kindle Paperwhite which I do not like as much as paper books. Major first world problems going on here. One plus is that it takes normal batteries and not a watch battery or USB charge (I like never having to remember to charge or plug something in).",4.0
"This is a very bright book light - but not in the way that annoys your bed partner.  It shines the light directly on your book in a large enough radius that you can see the entire page of a mass market or trade paperback.  The batteries last a long time.  I like that it has multiple settings - high, low and off (or something like that).  I've even used it as a flashlight when I'm hunting for something late at night.",4.0
I haven't gotten a chance to use it very much. It's a nice light. I wish it wasn't so expensive.,4.0
"I received one of these (the black version) a few days ago and my verdict is that I am likely to use it when reading books at night.

Brief overview:

- 2 super-bright LED's with lenses
- light has more blue and very little red, or yellow (think of a steady neon light)
- uses 3 (THREE) AAA batteries
- 40-hour battery life (claim is made on the package, not verified by me)
- power supply not provided
- relatively long, flexible arm
- can turn on 1 or 2 LED's
- solid build
- a bit heavy but had no problem using it with a paperback

I will definitely use this lamp when reading books at night. I doubt I will ever use it as a flashlight or a work light unless I had no other choice.",4.0
"Works as advertised, good value. Two settings are useful. 2 AA batteries are a good idea , button cells not needed.",4.0
"I was hoping it would be able to clip onto the headboard of my daughters bed, but the clamp/clip is not big enough for that.  Otherwise, it's a good little light.  Plenty bright and light.",4.0
"it's a bit bulky - but it works for me!  experienced the whole ""turning on in the purse or suitcase"" bit..which is annoying - but i just take one of the batteries out.  It is fabulous when i'm at home reading in bed, and want to keep the lights low.",4.0
Quite functional and versatile. We like it. It is light and unobtrusive yet gives plenty of directed illumination right where it is needed.,4.0
"This is a pretty good product. I'm so glad that I finally purchased a book light for myself. The only thing is...it works great with hardcover books, but less so with paperbacks. I anticipated this problem, but was still disappointed by how heavy the base is. Not only does it bend the spine if you attach it to a paperback (because it's so heavy), but it also bends the pages themselves because of the clip. But luckily most of the books I read are hardcover, so that doesn't become a problem too often.

I also wish that it was slightly less bright. There are two settings of brightness, but I wish that there was a third not-as-bright one.

All around, though, this is a great product and I'm pretty happy with it.",4.0
"Gives off a great, bright light. Easy to attach to pretty much anything I'd want to attach it to (currently I have one on each of the handles over the backseat doors in my car, for my son to use as reading lights). Sturdy. Good price, too.",4.0
"My husband purchased my Kindle, cover and this particular book light for me as a Mother's Day/birthday gift this year.  (The green one to ""match"" my M-Edge Kindle cover).

I received the first ligt a day or so after receiving my Kindle and it worked great -- for about TWO HOURS...Then it wouldn't work again.  I thought it was the cheap batteries which came with it, so I changed them to some ""quality"" (name brand) batteries, and it still didn't work.

I contacted Amazon and they apologized for it not working properly, sent me info on how to return it -- along with a postage-paid mailing label -- and I sent it back.

I received the replacement about two weeks later and have been using the replacement light (WITH the cheap batteries which came with it) ever since then and have had NO problems.

I LOVE the option of TWO different lights, to change the brightness.  It's more flexible than other reading lights I have used in the past and I love the fact that I can bend the neck in ANY direction and the lighted area will ""stay put"" where I want it.

It clips securely to my M-Edge Kindle cover.  I'd love to get one in every color.

I didn't rate it five stars because five is ""perfect"" -- and NOTHING is ""perfect"".  Also, I counted a little ""off"" because I had to send the first one back, but I'm happy with the replacement.",4.0
I read paper back books and this is a great light!  I love the two selections of brightness and you can adjust it in many ways. It is kinda bulky and I noticed with this blue one it left a little mark of the blue color on my book page. Nothing that significant but slight smudges. I would suggest using something like piece of paper towel to put under the part that clips to the page of book so the color doesn't smudge off on it. Other then that it's definitely a a great light to read or even other things to use for. I use it for night reading in my bed,4.0
"Oddly this is a bit brighter than I'd like and there's no way to make it dimmer, but it does the job just fine.",4.0
Got shipment quickly and light works well for reading in bed as well as our living room. Is flexible so you can shine light where needed.,4.0
"I got this for my kindle to read in bed before I go to sleep.  It has two settings...bright and brighter.  It works great but it's not what I was looking for.  I had another that I could dial down the brightness but it's no longer being sold.  I gave it 4 starts because it's a good light and the adjustable arm works great...just know that if you want to read in the dark, the space shuttle will pick up on your location.",4.0
"Mine was shipped from China, took about 2 weeks I think, IIRC.  Came with the required AAA batteries.
I clip it to my headboard, about 1 inch thick, it holds on there well.  Two light levels from the switch (press once low, again high, again off).  Flexi boom arm stays put once I put it where I want it.

Solid purchase.",4.0
After reading the reviews it was what I expected.  I use it now to read in bed but will be using it to read in the car when I go on vacation.  I like the two settings.  I would recommend it to others.,4.0
As advertised Came in the mail within a week fast shipment very happy with the product but needed a larger light recommend for bed time on the book reading,4.0
"I think this is a good light. Not too heavy when clipped to a book. I do like to clip it to my head board and the arm stays in the position I put it in. But when it's clipped to the headboard, it's not very bright since it's not right up against my book.",4.0
"This little light works extremely well when I am reading in bed. The two bulbs are a nice feature, however, even with just one light on it's really bright. My husband usually doesn't mind it as long as he turns away when he's trying to sleep.",4.0
"Only complaint is that the neck for the lamp is a little flimsy.  Overall though, I am happy with the product.  It puts out plenty of light, but the light is appropriately directed so as not to light up the whole room.",4.0
"I know that's a weird statement, but I was looking for something bright enough to read by, but dim enough that it wouldn't wake my husband.  It works great as a flashlight.  I only used it while on vacation so I can't speak to it's durability, but it seems sturdy enough, it's small, but doesn't feel flimsy.  Attached well to a paperback.",4.0
This is my second Mighty Bright light as the first one broke after a couple of years of use.  I like that it has two levels of brightness and is very adjustable.  A set of batteries lasts about a month depending on the amount of use (duh). I use mine about 30 minutes a night.  I only give four stars due to the broken clip spring on the original but this one is good so far.,4.0
Works fine and the dual light intensity setting is perfect.  I like the low setting when I'm trying to fall asleep.,4.0
Very nice overall - two brightness settings and a good spread of light.  Works very nicely on my Kindle.  I wish the dim setting was a little more dim - I worry it is too bright and keeps my wife awake.,4.0
My wife likes to use it when she reads in bed at night.  Her hands have arthritis and this is very easy for her to use.,4.0
"It has two bulbs that can turned on together or just one to vary the amount of light output. The clamp is big enough to hold a lot of pages if you want to use it as a bookmark also.
Con: Like every light I have owned it tends to be a spot light. Lighting only one page, so you have to move it from side to side. If I move it up high enough to cover both pages it shines in my wife's eyes as she tries to sleep.",4.0
"my kids put it on their bunkbeds and are happy little campers. it's bright, adjustable and clamps on the side of the bed which is thick. love it, love it, love it.",4.0
"my kids put it on their bunkbeds and are happy little campers. it's bright, adjustable and clamps on the side of the bed which is thick. love it, love it, love it.",4.0
I like how the light can be adjusted and it can be set high enough where both pages of a book (I've actually only tried it with novels) are well lit. There are two settings but both are still pretty bright. Bright and brighter!,4.0
"I bought this item and it lasted me less than three months. It worked great for as long as it lasted, but unfortunately my nephew was playing with it. I am not sure what happened, but somehow the who head came off. I was really disappointed, because it was a great item. To be fair I would blame half of the defect on my nephew and half on the item itself. I would recommend to keep this item away from children or those who do not know how to use it.",4.0
"After I bought a Kindle Paperwhite, I gave my book light to my sister because I thought I wouldn't need it anymore. I forgot that sometimes I like to read actual paper books also. I took a chance and bought this light to replace the one I gave away (which I really loved), and I'm glad I did. It's not as heavy as some of the older booklights I had, so it clips nicely onto the back of the book, even paperbacks if you include a few pages. The light is not too bright nor too dim. I love that I have the option to turn off one of the lights. It lights up the page well enough to read in a very dark room. The batteries have lasted a while, though I've only had it maybe four to six weeks.

I give it only four stars, because I carry this book light around with me, and wish it had some sort of case or some way to keep it a bit safer when I put it in my bag with my books and my Kindle. I'm always worried that it might break or get damaged in some way.  So far this hasn't happened.",4.0
"Almost too bright, actually.  It's so powerful even on the single-light setting that I have to bend it into the crease of whatever book I'm reading so as not to wake up my husband!",4.0
"The product is great (we have several already).

The only negative is that they sent us the Purple not Pink. The picture and description clearly state Pink, We are going to keep it since returning it is more trouble than it is worth.",4.0
My daughter-in-law gave me one for Christmas and I had to order one for my friend because we read a lot.  I use my also in many other ways.  It lives up to its name of Mighty Bright.,4.0
A little awkward to use but great when traveling .  Sometimes have to fiddle with light to get it to fill the page.,4.0
"The good thing about this book light is is that it has two settings and is quite bright.  The flexibility of the neck comes in very handy.  Battery life could be a bit better but other than that, it's a pretty good light.  I would recommend it.",4.0
"Very good light, and I bought this particular kind because it comes with an AC adaptor that can be plugged in and used as such. Very good product!",4.0
"It's a good product, don't bet me wrong, but what I really would like is a reading light I don't have to be moving around whenever I reach to the right hand page or vice versa.",4.0
"Works well. Brighter than expected. The neck and light are both much smaller than I imagined, but I've been able to angle the neck to make it work without waking my wife. The clamp is just wide enough to clip onto the side of the 3/4"" thick top of my nightstand.",4.0
"I originally purchased this to read books, manuals, etc but ended up using it to do work around the house, inside my computer case and in hard to reach places where a bit of light is needed.",4.0
"This little light works and is easy to clip anywhere (to a shelf, the book, a lampshade) but I wish it had a dimmer setting. It does get dimmer as the batteries wear down though. It has been very useful for reading while rocking my baby to sleep and also great for travel.",4.0
Exactly what it said it would do. Comes in very handy. perfect for what i needed. great quality too. Would recommend.,4.0
"I don't use this on books (though I would), I use it on a Kindle 4 6"" e-ink reader (the cheap one from 2012).

PROS

Comes with batteries! AAA are easily replaceable.  ;-)
Very bright - Neck makes it easy to adjust so that there is no glare on the screen. I use the lower (single bulb) setting.
Tight, focused beam - Even though the light is very bright, it's easy to adjust the angle so that it doesn't disturb someone else. Obviously when I shine it out into a room it's like having a flashlight, but when it is hooked to a book or kindle and pointed at the screen the area of effect is reasonably smaller (about a foot).
Light weight - when I saw that it took 3 AAAs I thought it might be a bit heavy. It isn't, I hardly notice the additional weight on my Kindle and weight is important to me because I have arthritis in my hands.
Clamp is padded - It doesn't damage or dent my Kindle's skin. It has sensitive skin :-P

CONS

CLAMP IS BIG for a Kindle. The base is pretty bulky because it takes 3 AAAs. This is great if you want it to double as a standing light, but if you are hooking it to a Kindle e-reader then you will need to get creative because it is easy to block the screen because it's a bit wider than the Kindle edges. I find that centering it on the edge of the top holds it on the most solidly or along the top, but on the side. However, if you are like me and like to lay on your side and tilt the Kindle when you're in bed then the book light can slip off. If you are sitting straight up and not moving the Kindle much it's fine if you center the clamp. But I lay on my side and hold it at an angle so it tends to tilt and eventually I have to keep readjusting it as it slips. I did find a solution, since the clamp is big, and my headboard is less than 1inch thick, I was able to just attach it to my headboard and when I lay on my side I just adjust the light to a good angle and now it works perfectly for me. Clamp size is my only complaint, if it were a bit smaller I'd give it another star.

---------------

Overall it was a good purchase. I use it approximately 5 hours per week for the last two weeks and I haven't had any issues with battery life. It claims that it's good for about 20 hours and so far I'm inclined to believe it and this is using the default batteries they gave me.",4.0
"Okay so, as a book light, it does the job. The light is bright enough to read by but it's not like having a floodlight in your room. The clip is fantastic - it clamps down hard enough for me to clamp it to my bed (wide headboard and it still works) but not too hard, so I can still clip it to my Kindle without damaging it. The thing is, every time you squeeze the clamp, you're essentially pulling on the battery cap thing, so it comes off every time. It's a mild to moderate annoyance, depending on mood ;)",4.0
"BRIGHT light for such a small lamp. With LED bulb, I expect the batteries to last a long time.

Clip works well in most situations.",4.0
Our 9-year old daughter is an avid reader and desperately needed one like this. She uses it every night and this is the second one we bought as the first one fell from her bunk bed and broke. Good product.,4.0
"Bright and brighter settings are both fine for reading.  the product is light and easy to use without instruction.  I have yet to replace the batteries, but it seems like that will be a long time from now.  If I had to muster a complaint, the clip could hold a thicker surface...around 3/4-1"" (19-25mm) it is clearly strained to be opened that far and will work its way off a smooth surface that thick.  Decent value for a clip light and peerless as far as illumination for the size.",4.0
Got this for my mom for Christmas and she loves it.  Really helpful when more light is needed!  Great product!,4.0
It is amazing how many people like the idea of a portable reading light. They are solo handy! I gave one each to three  family members. All seem to really like them. Love the ability to turn on one or two lights. Slight downgrade because they are a bit heavy with the batteries in them.,4.0
I use this light on my Kindle.  It is perfect to use on an airplane or in the car at night.  I really like the fact that it has 2 brightnesses.  I just wish the light came with a protective case.,4.0
came in the color I wanted. great for reading but could use brighter light for my laptop at night hard to see the keys but I do have some eye sight issues.  Would buy a second one as get tired of moving it from place to place as needed. Very natural lighting and sometimes I forget to turn it off so hoping battery is long lasting.,4.0
"What can you say.  It is not real big, it works great.  I guess if you want a light this will do?",4.0
"If you are an avid reader and don't want to keep your significat other up at night, this may just do the trick.",4.0
I struggled between getting this single led or the double. Glad I chose the single!! Light weight and wide beam for night reading. Gets a 4 star because it is a little wobbly when clipped to the book but nothing to really complain about.,4.0
This small light does more than light books. I have it clipped above my compact work desk to help with dark spots. A very good buy.,4.0
"I wanted a light to velcro to a wireless keyboard so i could use it in the pitch black. Works great for that, as a book light i imagine it to be a bit heavy.",4.0
"It is a powerful little light, can bother my wife sometimes in bed so I tilt it away.  Would be perfect with a dimmer, or a lower setting switch.",4.0
"I got this to go with a pink cover for my daughter's kindle.  It will work fine and do just what I need it to go, but the color was a little disappointing.  It looks more like a candy pink in the picture, but it's really more of a mauve and looks okay with the case but wasn't a perfect match like I had hoped",4.0
"These are handy little lights that are perfect for reading in the car or in bed. I bought two and clipped them over the bed in our RV and enjoyed reading at night without having to put up with the heat and glare of the built in lights that were installed above the bed.  I found I could clip mine directly on my Kindle cover and read lying flat in bed if I so desired. When I turned on my side, the light moved with the Kindle, so the reading was uninterrupted.  It has two little lights and you can choose to use one or both depending on how much light you need.  Good buy!",4.0
"Nice little light, not so bright it wakes up spouse, but it's not easy to attach to magazines or newspapers that flop. Better with hardback books.",4.0
"This is my third book light. As long as the batteries are fresh, this is nicely bright. But it seems to use up batteries faster than the previous models, and I find myself having to get the light closer to the page for comfortable illumination. (I am getting older - maybe I need it brighter than younger eyes).
  One thing that is quite nice about this one is the flexible neck - you can get the light to point at opposite pages and even high /low on the page. Also lightweight enough to easily be used with a mass-market paperback.",4.0
"This is an amazing little light with a great grip, but it might be a little too bright! I will never strain my eyes, but it has actually woken my husband up if he turns toward it. Overall an EXCELLENT value.",4.0
"This Xflex 2 light gets a lot of use and is very flexible...so throw away the miners' hat and get this light.  My only critique is that it needs an odd amount of AAA batteries (3),  In an age of featherweight ipads and streamlined technology can we at least make this work on 2 batteries?",4.0
"i bought this as a booklight. it's a great light with one little catch; it's slight larger than it appears in these pictures. I primarily read paperback, and this light is just large enough to encroach into obtrusion. It is by no means large, but when clipped onto the last 50 pages of my books, it is usually too much for the book to support. I also ordered the Mighty Bright TravelFlex, and much prefer it to this one as a readig/book light. This one is just a little to bulge-y for my liking.

Out of the context of it's performance clipped to a book spine, this thing is a great little light. Clip it to your bed, your desk, or computer screen. It's really a great little clip-on LED light.

If you read a lot of paperbacks like I do, take a look at the TravelFlex. I think it's much more suitable for this purpose. If you read a lot of bulky, hard-bound books, or just need a small clip on light for around the house/car, then I don't think you'll be dissapointed with this little gem. I found one fairly cheap from a third-party seller, so it's easily worth the money. Only reason I'm witholding the 5-star rating is because I don't think this should be advertised as a clip-on light for books... but it's still a nice little light.",4.0
"works as expected. very adjustable and nice clip. bright light is a little more ""white"" than I like. the switch is a little sensitive and can turn on by accident in the briefcase if you're not careful.",4.0
The light is the proper brightness for bed time reading. Batteries last for a very long time. The clip is a little thick for smaller books.,4.0
"The light is bright and it clips on to books really well. The only snag is the battery lasts only 30-35 hours, even though it's LED. Makes me hesitate to buy more as gifts even though I find it useful. I use it to read when I am away from a good light source, say while camping or on the bus.",4.0
"A very good product. Very handy and portable and very bright too. I ordered single LED one and double LEDs one, both are very good.",4.0
"This is not a light weight light nor is it particularly small.  However it is small enough to travel with or slip into a handbag.  It stays adjusted, gives me enough even light to read by and is fine for both my older kindle or a book.  The weighted base allows it to stand on its own.  I have used it as a task light and even a night light in the bathroom when I have had company.  My husband loved it, so we ordered one for him as well.",4.0
"Had this little light for a while now and it still works like new. The lower light setting is a bit dim for me, but the higher one is great.",4.0
"I do miniature art.  This clips on my tiny drawing board and gives plenty of light, without getting in the way.",4.0
"I love the fact that the light clip can attach to my pretty thick kindle touch cover and not wobble around! My only complaint is that the light span is TOO big for my needs... it interferes with my husband when he is trying to sleep, because it's SO big and SO bright. But hey, that is better than my last book light... This one lights up the room enough that I can nurse my baby without any other light, i'll put it that way! Great build though so far, just needs to take into consideration of others sleeping while being used in bed! I would go to another room, but we currently stay at a hotel, which is why I purchased a book light, we have no lamp... So the purpose was kind of defeated. Well, at least the name fits it.. Mighty Bright!",4.0
This product says that it is pink but it is more purple than pink. If you want the pink one it is a different # by one digit.  This is 40516 and the pink is actually 40526 so if you are set on pink buyer beware.,4.0
"this is a good product, I  like how it hooks on the book as I read at night time. yes",4.0
"This does the job. No complaints, it's a simple book light that lights up to allow my wife to read in bed or when we travel.",4.0
"This thing is mighty bright. It's too bright in some respects. I lay it next to me and twist it downward to reduce the glare when I'm reading a book at night so my husband doesn't grumble. I wonder if people complaining that it isn't bright enough or that it fails at some point are dealing mostly with a battery issue.

But (you knew there had to be one) the whine from the adapter when the thing is turned on (and even when it isn't it's still there somewhat) is really LOUD in my estimation. I tolerate it because I've yet to find any book light that lasts and this has been the only one that's lasted more than a couple of weeks. (3 months now) I've spent much more on book lights and got much worse products so I think for the price it's worth trying to see if you like it but do get the adapter or you'll be disappointed with the performance. Then determine if you can handle the mosquito whine.",4.0
This little light is bright and really does its'  job well. I bought another one for my other kid a week later.,4.0
"The Mighty Bright Light works as advertised. A was hesitant on buying this product because of what other reviews said about the short battery life. I still went ahead and bought the Mighty Bright Light and read the instructions very carefully because I really wanted to make the best of it and I wanted for it to last as much as possible. It works good and after 2 months of use, its still very bright.
The only thing that I found was a bit of an inconvenience was that on the instruction manual it did say that in order for your batteries to last, you need to remove them ( take them out of the Mighty Bright Light) after every use.
Otherwise it is a great product.
Hope this has helped.",4.0
This was a great find and fit the bill perfectly.  My daughter is in the 5th grade and most of her classmates ended up spending double for the exact same product!,4.0
"I may look for something bigger, or I may just replace the batteries when it runs down, but suddenly I have an enthusiastic pre-teen reader - and that's worth more than the purchase price. Read the reviews - delivers as advertised. Not cheap like some; reliable, good color selection, big clothes-pin style clip - we clip it to another pillow and it works just fine. Cute like a night light but with a lot more to read by.",4.0
hooked to my bed side lamp and gave 100 percent easyer reading with much less strain on the my eyes,4.0
"Overall this is a great little light, the only issue I have with it is that the clip on the back is a little too big. If you're reading from a paperback, the weight/shape of it tends to make reading a little uncomfortable.

aside from that I would recommend this for all of the readers out there.",4.0
"works as advertised, good battery life, nice option to choose one bulb or two, worth the money LED is much better than the old technology",4.0
"This sounds like a silly thing to say, but this lamp is indeed to bright.

In my case (and I'm wondering that of many others), you buy this lamp because you want to be able to read in bed without bothering your SO. The idea is to have a light in your book that doesn't cover all the room.

This does that... and way more. The first time I turned it on at night... it was like we had just moved to Vegas. Now, my wife has told me that it doesn't bother her when she is already asleep, but it definitely does when she is still awake.

This said, I like everything else: very flexible and lightweight, which makes it very easy to hook in your book. Comes with 3 batteries - I don't know yet how long do these last, but so far I've given it a couple of hours and we should be OK",4.0
"This is a great little book light for the money. I have had mine for a while now and it's held up well. It's very adjustable and the clip holds paperback and hardcover books just fine, and the light is more than sufficiently bright. I don't notice much difference between having one or both lights on, but if one burns out, you have a backup. Battery life is pretty good also. I recommend this brilliant little creation to anyone who needs a book light and doesn't want to spend a lot of money.",4.0
"I was looking for an inexpensive small light to attach to an older kindle, this does the trick and the clip works great.",4.0
"I really like how bright it is and I think the battery life if pretty good for the fact my 5 & 7 year old use them every night and leave them on half the time.  They did dim in brightness after a month or so and we just replaced the batteries from December, so I think that's a good life time for the batteries.  it was still bright enough that we didn't need to replace them when they dimmed.  better than most book lights!",4.0
"I like it fine; after a week though, it seems like the light wasn't as bright. Not sure if its just the batteries wearing down and I did leave it on all night a few times. I may purchase an AC adapter and see if that helps.",4.0
this little book light is just the right size for me. Big enough for all of my books and small enough to cary with me in my purse or in a travel bag. perfect for me,4.0
"This is a very bright reading light. The base is sort of heavy, it gets a little cumbersome to hold the book with the heavy light attached to it, but the bendable head and super bright concentrated light is good for the eyes reading at night in the dark like I do.",4.0
"I likeds this product, the only draw back is the length of the neck. I had to adjust the light often. If you use the double light that's works great but is hard on the batteries, however, you can use an A.C. power supply (not included) A fun product and does work well",4.0
"Bright but not a glaring light, 2 different settings and eady to turn on and off, strong clip, cute colors, stiff arm that doesn't flop over.  I use it on my KIndle with a book cover on it.  My only complaints----it takes 3 AAA batteries, which makes it rather heavy.  So if you try to use it on a paperback book, it can be a little tricky.",4.0
I like the product but could be a little cheaper in price. I saw others for a lot less after i purchased this one.,4.0
I've had the XtraFlex2 a bit shy of two years.  It definitely provides good light to read from the Kindle in a variety of lighting situations.  A great improvement from the 'flashlight under the covers' we used so often as kids.  Cons:  after a while the neck tends to waver and roam to its own tune.  Also the prongs that hold the battery cover in place have broken off.  It's easy enough to use tape to hold it together but a bit tedious when its time to install new batteries.  Pros:  price;  two levels of bright light;  practical and not obtrusive.,4.0
This little light is light-weight and works well for a book light.  We travel with it - as either my husband or I like to stay up and read late at night.,4.0
Book light came as advertized. The packaging is nice. I own a might bright book like in green and like it so much I decided to get one for a friend's birthday. Thanks for the quick delivery.,4.0
So far this little light is working well.  It illuminates both pages when attached to the back cover although it is necessary to attach it to large part of the text as well as the cover when reading a paper back.  It seems sturdy and yet is quite flexible.  Time will tell but in the short time since my purchase it has been as the positive reviews here report.,4.0
"Not a bright as I expected, but is an improvement to the poor lighting that I had to read by.  Probably would not be adequate to read by if you are in a very dark place or at night with this being the only light you have.  Was expecting it would light a larger area than it does, but it does accomplish what I need it to do.",4.0
"Love the color!  It has 2 settings of brightness, which is nice.  The highest setting is very bright.  Battery lasts a long time.  I actually used it as a night light during a power failure, so it was on all night long without going out.",4.0
"This book like is very sturdy and bright.  Even though there are two settings (high/low), the low setting is still very bright and lights up the room.  If your spouse is sensitive to light, this would probably distract them.  But it is a great light if you want something bright and sturdy.  The light stays in place when I position it with the arm.  I use it nightly.",4.0
The clamp is big enough to clip to the head board of our bed.  The light is very bright but a blue white.  A warmer color light would be better and more natural.  This allows one of us to read while the other has relative darkness to sleep.  So far the arm adjusts easily and has not sagged or gone limp on me.,4.0
"You can clip it on a pillow if you don't to want to flip the pages without an issue.
Hopefully , it will last for a a while",4.0
"So, like any other man living with a woman, we often don't see eye to eye on the proper bed time. She says 10, I say 12, what am I to do? I want to read in bed so I can get comfortable and avoid hours of sleepless tossing and turning. This little device has solved all my problems. Before this, I needed to read in the living room which really threw me off my game. Now I can even claim this to be ""together time"". This is also why I have 2 TV's next to each other in my living room. I play Fifa, you watch dumb Bethany Frankel shows. Perfect Together Time.  Yes, this is brilliant; yes, I am a great significant other. It doesn't disturb her and I can read in bed in peace while she gets the beauty sleep.

Anyway, the light is good, it attaches well to my 2nd generation old skool Kindle and it is a good source of light with two settings.  It is a little bulky and gets in the way a little.  Size isn't everything I guess.  If I was being a stickler (which I guess I am), I would argue the two settings are nearly identical similar but that seems a little nit-picky. Another important point is that you need to make sure you do not angle the light directly on to your kindle.  It is too bright for the human eye to handle. Rather you should point it slightly beyond the end of the kindle, there is plenty of light to go around.  Wow now I really am whining.  I swear these points are all relevant.

If you find yourself reading in a pool at night, and I don't know why you would be, I would recommend pairing with this product:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Version-TrendyDigital-WaterGuard-Waterproof-Case-for-Kindle-1-2-3-First-Second-and-Third-Generation-Kindle-Kindle-Fire-and-other-6-or-7-Android-Tablet-Blue/dp/B0026GJHVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Version TrendyDigital WaterGuard Waterproof Case for Kindle 1, 2,3 (First, Second and Third Generation Kindle), Kindle Fire and other 6"" or 7"" Android Tablet (Blue)</a>

"nice light but little heavy, to be used with paper books specially if you planning to give to kids. my opinion.",4.0
"I really like the light.  It`s really good for lighting up the keyboard on my laptop. Nice and bright.
My only negative comment is that the clip is very bulky and a little difficult on small, slim paperback books.
I would definitely purchase it again.",4.0
"great, clips well, with the settings were more drastic, there is a bright and super bright.  It works great, but I could do with half the power.",4.0
"This book light is perfect for me use when I'm reading. But it seems like it's too big for a kindle. It's also very heavy so if you're holding a book or a kindle with this light attached to it, it might seem too heavy. Other than that I love how strong the light is.",4.0
"This light works well for reading in bed or during travel, with my Kindle or a paperback.  It is bright, and it adjusts to cover the entire page.  The clip is thicker than I'd prefer, but it is at least sturdy.  I've had several book lights I loved until their clips broke.  I use a book light for an hour or two every night so I go through a lot of batteries, and I've been thru a lot of book lights.  So far this is one of the best I've tried.

I use a second Mighty Bright over the printer in my home office to light up the led display, which is difficult to read in dim light.",4.0
It took some time using it and continues with the same power as when they buy it. It is very efficient and practical.,4.0
I really enjoy this light. It's just enough light to be able to snuggle up with a good book in low light. I've had no problems thus far.,4.0
"I read a lot, especially in the evening and in bed, so this is perfect.  It took me a little time to get used to it though, as it is a little awkward to use.  At first the clip slipped and the neck wouldn't stay put, but it turned out it was the user (me).  I love the purple color, which is why I ordered it, and now that I use it all the time, I can't imagine not having it.  I would definitely recommend to a friend.",4.0
"Despite the cumbersome size and weight of the clamp, this lamp is acceptable and for the price, more. In truth it is kind of awkward when fixed to your Kindle but it works !
Would buy another should tis one expire.",4.0
"I had to return the first Bright Light I purchased because the light flickered. The second one worked perfectly!  It clips onto a book very securely and the adjustable goose neck is very adaptable to the size of the book.  There are a few darker corners of the pages when it is attached but none is unreadable.  I have never used only the one light, have always needed both to illuminate the pages well enough, so don't know why there are two levels of brightness. This has made reading in bed after the lights are off possible for me.  Storing it when not in use is a small problem, not wanting to damage the bulbs.",4.0
A comfortable book light that makes reading easy.  The light is extraordinarily convenient and effective. I have one for use at home and one for each suitcase. My only wish is that the batteries were easier to replace and there was a hard case so the light won't go on when the light presses against other items in the suitcase.,4.0
"This night light put out nice light. Not disturbing to other around you at night. If it were more stable ... meaning didn't move around so much while trying to adjust the light ... it would be easier to use.

Over all a good purchase.",4.0
"The light does great lighting up the kindle screen without glare, but was a little too bright for reading in a completely dark room when other people in the room are trying to sleep.",4.0
"I was not able to enjoy my Kindle adequately when traveling, because the airplane's, train's, or bus's passenger lights were not bright enough for me to read.  So, I ordered this book light.  Wow!  It's not too bulky for the kindle, so I can enjoy my e-reader while traveling.  But, it is also great for my music stand.  I enjoy playing in local community bands, so this light comes in very handy for evening concerts.  I'm about to order more of these lights for use at church.  Lots of AAA batteries, but the light will sure be nice.",4.0
"The light is OK, not exceptionally bright.  Very lightweight and travels well.  I use this light daily and would not travel without it.",4.0
This is a good light. The LEDs take some getting used to. It works pretty well with my kindle. You have to adjust the angle to make sure it gives you the best reading experience. All in all happy with my purchase,4.0
Good book light very portable - sturdier than most - good for my kindle in the dark would recommend to alll,4.0
"I think this light is fantastic!  It's bright enough that I can leave it on the bedside table and still see my book (if both lights on it are turned on), but it's not so bright that my boyfriend can't fall asleep if I stay up late reading.  There are three settings: both lights on, one light on, and off.  I do wish that when the setting is on one-light-on, you could choose which light was on, but other than that, I really like this light.  I'd probably even purchase another one.",4.0
Nice little light but not really bright enough to sit on a table and a little large for attaching to a book. Would probably be best for using  with a lap desk.,4.0
Not much to say about this product.  It is a basic book light.  My daughter likes that it is lightweight and has good light output.  May be better to purchase this at a local store (since they are prevalent) to avoid shipping costs.  Has held up well over the couple of months we have had it.,4.0
"My wife reads in bed a lot and she loves this little light.  It's got two settings on it, low and high and the low setting is really enough light for her.  She doesn't even use the high setting for anything.  This little light is pretty bright.  Best thing is the light is LED so it's not going to burn out any year soon and the batteries are 3 AAA which are inexpensive and commonplace and power this little light for months before needing replacement.  Excellent product!",4.0
"since I enjoy reading at night before going to sleep, I needed a light for my traditional Kindle.  This one works great, my only complaint would be that it is a bit bulky and I have to be careful with storage because the push-button switch is easily pressed and occasionally find the light on, especially if I have packed it in luggage.",4.0
"Nice a bright for reading in bed, though I do have to turn it away from the bed partner because it seems a lot brighter in a dark room. Packs easily for trips.",4.0
"Bought two of these items as Christmas gifts for our grandkids and they were very pleased.  It give them a good incentive to read....or do whatever in their bedrooms when their parents call ""lights out"".",4.0
Love this little light but I read a lot & it burns through batteries. Plan to purchase some rechargable batteries for it for sure.,4.0
"This takes three AAA batteries. That's ridiculously inconvenient. Other than that, I love these lights. They make nice, strong illumination, clip on to my Kindle without damaging it, and are extremely positionable -- they stay where you put 'em, for sure.",4.0

"This light works great, has 2 settings for LED brightness, and has great battery life. My only complaint would be that the unit itself is just a little bulky where it clips on to the ereader. I guess I can see the justification since it would have to be strong to hold the light in place, but just something to think about.",4.0
"I got this light to use with my Kindle Keyboard 3G. It's too big to clip on any part of the kindle comfortably. I've just been putting it on the top corner, but the clip covers part of the screen and it's a bit heavy, so it slides off from time to time. I think I'm going to just use it as a book like from now on.

As for the light, it's very bright and works well. The clip/battery portion is just bulkier than expected.",4.0
Was for the husband and I love it -- he reads (real live books) and I sleep undisturbed. What more can you ask.,4.0
I get enough light on the low setting for reading in the middle of the night.  The neck is very pliable and can be set in any configuration.  I like it.,4.0
"I've tried other lights but really like this 2-bulb book light.  It also softly shines down on the page without a lot of relection.  Some lights only shine straight ahead so don't light your whole page.  The information sheet said battery life is good for 40 hours, but I have not used it that long yet.  It does use cheaper batteries though so maybe this will not be a problem.  It is the best book light I have found to date so would have liked to give it a 5-star rating.",4.0
"very good, bright light - 2 stage /  1 led or 2 led can be fired up depending on how much light you need..  The clamp / base piece is kind of bulky, but thats about it..  pleased with my purchase overall.",4.0
I really like this item. It is small and powerful. The batteries last a long time too. I like to keep mine in a bag in the car and it turns on all the time from the slightest movement in the car- a light touch turns it on. I wish it didn't do that because it really wastes the batteries. If it had a better on/off switch it would be 5 stars for me,4.0

I like to be warm and reading in bed late at night. This light does not disturb my husband and is easy to manipulate. The light itself needs to be readjusted every few pages to cover the opposite page you are reading. The light brightness  is good. Not a bad little device for the money. This is my only experience with a clip on book light.,4.0
"I use it with my original Kindle at night for reading. It's great overall but has the drawback of reflecting the light off the Kindle's screen which can be annoying until you get it just in the right spot to stop the reflection.  Also, I wish it had rechargeable batteries.",4.0
I bought one for myself and one for my granddaughter - now we're all set for the next power outage.  It's convenient for reading anywhere and the lights are very bright.,4.0
I love this mini reading night light. I have dropped several times and it keeps on working. The light is bright enough with dual lighting modes.,4.0
"This replaces an identical light, which I had lost. It is a bright comfortable reading light. It is easy to clip to a book.",4.0
"My church has purchased these for the choir music at candle light services and the brightness and versatility is well received.

I am disappointed on how Amazon handled the sales tax issue -- they didn't.  I submitted the tax exemption form from my church to purchase these lights as a church member.  I could not talk to the Tax Department by phone --only by email.  Customer Service couldn't advise me on how to assure reimbursement.  As a result I am out of pocket for the tax even though I purchased these for my church.",4.0
"Good product. Good shopping.
I recommend this product.
I'm happy with the result of this product. I would buy it again.",4.0
"I would have given it a 5 star but the clap didn't grab my bed frame as I had hoped, regardless the light is good for night time reading.",4.0
i use this light on my document holder at work. It gives just enough light so that i may read the documents as i type. I love that it has no cords so my desk looks cleaner,4.0
"This is a great light for reading at night. I have a baby in a bassinet on one side and a husband in the bed on the other side.
The light hasn't bothered them yet.

My one issue is that the company packaged it not so well and it was broken when I received it. Then it took forever to get a second light.",4.0
"The clip is the only drawback - it it were longer it would fit better.  But we love it - our daughter can read her books
while we drive at night.  No DVDs-electronics etc allowed in my car.",4.0
"This is a great book light.  It also has a High & low light switch.  Its neck is very flexable to adjust to the size of the book or magazine your reading. The book lights clip is very strong, doesn't slide of the book when you put it down.  I'd recommend buying it.",4.0
product tend to be a bit loose sometimes. i thought it would stick on the kindle...however not so bad of a product i guess for its price!,4.0
"I bought this to clip to a music stand.  The brightness is good, and the dual level is a plus.  The light is directional so the audience isn't distracted or annoyed.  These are a good value, although they are inexpensive and the construction says so.  I have purhased these in the past and all are still in use, some for nearly 2 years.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy again.",4.0
"I have a purple one of these that I ordered for myself so I can read in bed while my husband sleeps. It is great. The clip can clip on to a small book cover, several pages, or a nearby shelf. It can expand to about 1 1/2 inches and has foam grips that keep it from slipping (usually). The flexible arm is very useful to make sure the light gets exactly where you want it to be. Directionality is important when you don't want any light shining on your spouse who is sleeping.
There are two levels of brightness but not a huge difference between the two. I usually just use the brightest setting. The brightest setting is reasonably bright for reading a book- not glaring. When held close to a book, the light illuminates all of a standard size book and reaches an inch or two beyond. If you were to use it as a flashlight in the dark (which you will occasionally find the need for), it would reach a couple feet around you with a soft light.
As a book light, it is perfectly designed in my opinion- but I reduced a star because if there is going to be two brightness settings, there should be more of a difference in the settings- but a truly minor complaint.
I bought another one because I kept on loosing mine, only to find it in my daughter's bed. Guess what she is getting for Christmas?",4.0
"I have used this several times now and I do like it.  Stays clipped pretty well to my hard-back book.

Some downsides
.light spread could be a little wider...  gets dim towards the edges of pages.
.the adjustable wire stem part - kind of slowly straightens out a bit after time.  I make it curved... but it doesn't stay exactly curved like I set it.  So after a while I have to adjust it a bit.  Not a really big deal.... but noticeable.

Also be aware that reading late a night with LED-type of blue lights may stop you from getting sleepy.  So if you are reading at night in preparation to help yourself go to bed easier..... you might try instead using a light source with a more warm glow...  like with regular incandescent light bulbs.",4.0
It's a great little light that helps with a ton of tasks.  I'd buy it as a gift.  The flex arm is perfect and stays where you put it.  My only gripe is the clamp.  I've tried double stick tape to keep it in place but it always comes loose.  Still very good.,4.0
"The Mighty Bright has already been to Europe and Asia with me on Business and is a great reading lamp for my Kindle and a great bedside lamp when paired with the Mighty Bright Cradle and Mighty Bright Power Adapter. My only real complaint is the fact that the 3 AAA batteries must be removed before using the Power Adapter. This is a pretty big inconvienence when  using for the plane ride and then having to remove the batteries to plug it in at the hotel.

The light itself has two bulbs and you can turn on one or both of the lights. One light is fine when using with batteries on the plane, I turn on both lights when I am in the hotel and using it as a bedside lamp. As a bedside lamp it is not the brightest, but perfect if you just want a gentle backlight while watching tv or using a tablet etc...

I am not too sure of the battery life as I have only used for about 3 hours with battery on the plane and that was with the cheap batteries that came with it. Those original batteries are pretty close to dead, but I am sure with a good set of Energizers that you would get sufficient battery life, especially with only one light on.

I would definetely recommend this light and would certainly add the cradle and power adapter if you are traveling domestically or abroad. The power adapter is multi voltage and will work pretty much world wide.",4.0
"This book light is great.  I like the fun purple color.  The light itself has two settings of brightness.  I do wish it had a dimmer setting, but it is not a huge problem.  It clips right onto my kindle and lights up the whole screen.  Now I am able to read in bed and not have to worry as much about disturbing my partner.  This reading light will also come in handy for travel.  The price was also excellent.  Great buy.",4.0
"The clip really grips the book, but doesn't damage pages.  Could try clipping it to something else too, just haven't tried that yet.  The light has two levels of brightness, which is a feature I really like.  Easy to turn on and off too.  Illuminates the pages well.",4.0
"This is a pretty great light, but my children love it too. They keep taking it and using it for a flashlight, or clipping it to shelves in sheet and blanket living room forts they are making. I haven't had it that long, but now it is stuck on and it won't turn off. I am repurchasing it because it is worth it, but if one of these kids so much as touches it there will be hell to pay-",4.0
More than enough light. I thinbk that they do eat batteries pretty quick. The light is worth the buck; nice and compact.,4.0
"I really like this light. The ability to change settings from 1 bulb to 2 bulbs is nice. It is easy to attach and adjust on hard covers. I don't read paperbacks, so I can't speak to that. The neck is flexible and stays where I put it. I appreciate that it uses regular batteries in a size that I always seem to have on hand. My only complaint is that it's a bit bulky.

Overall, it is the best book light I've had. I would recommend and I would buy again.",4.0
"I'm glad I opened it and tried it out before I went to the hospital with my husband, because the batteries that came with it were absolutely dead.  After I changed them out, the light worked fine.  The light is bright and covers a page.  Good product, but test those batteries first.",4.0
This clip on light is very bright & flexible. I use it to clip to my easel when painting. The clip is pretty good but slips a little depending on position.,4.0
Beware of product color because this item is NOT pink it is more lavender.  While the shipment was delivered rather quickly which I was please about the color was not my thing.,4.0
It was more heavy duty than expected.  Worked well clipped to a clipboard in a music stand in dark nightclubs.,4.0
"I love, love, love my Mighty Bright book light. Both my husband and I have been using one for many years. Previous to that, I was buying a new book light every few months, because the quality of most book lights is so poor. They would quickly dim, or moving the gooseneck around too much would cause them to fail, or they would just fall apart.

None of this was true for the mighty bright... for 3 years, anyway.

Now at the end of 3 years, the light has finally dimmed too much to read by. The 1-bulb setting no longer works at all and the 2-bulb was usable for a few months until a few days ago. The gooseneck was also getting a bit loose.

However, all things considered, one slightly pricy book light in 3  years (a bit more since I bought the AC adapter, but hey, that still works!) is definitely better than several cheaper ones every 1 year.

My only complaint is, in fact, that the new light is a bit *too* bright. I ""bounce"" the light off the wall or my pillow so my page doesn't glare at me. And yeah, you heard me, the new light. I like this like plenty enough to buy another one now that the old one has died.",4.0
"I have only used this once but the light output is great.  It has two settings and the brighter setting illuminates the entire ""page"" of my Kindle3G with keyboard.  The neck is very flexible. It takes 3 AAA batteries.  The clip opens wide enough to clip to my Kindle and the case together.  The large bulky clip is why I gave it 4 stars...rather bulky for travel.",4.0
"The light works OK for paper backs, but can be very flimsy on thin books. The 2 LED light is brighter, but had trouble getting even light on both pages, I have to bend the book a certain way to get light to certain areas. I know this would work far better on a hard back book. I would rather read a book on my Kindle or iPad, but if that's not an option these should work for you.",4.0
"I have been using the light for several weeks now and I am very pleased overall. I bought this light for two reasons. One was the price and two because it used the less expensive AAA and not those crazy expensive CR batteries. CR batteries are highway robbery!!!! Don't throw you're your money away!!  It has a jack for a power cord, but didn't come with it(???) The instructions are not clear if you could fill it with rechargeable batteries and get the power cord to charge them. Either way, the quality is actually really good. I did not expect much quality at all for this price. The flexible head is very stable and stays put. I am still using the same batteries and the light is still going strong. Mine has a high and low setting. The high (both LEDs) is way too bright for me, but the low (single LED) is just right to illuminate two pages for bedtime reading. The lights are set in the head in a way that makes them only shine down on the page and not in your eyes. The clip has soft foam in it and opens really wide and is very secure. For the sake of fairness, the only two negative things that I can say about the light is that the high/low switch is right in the place where you need to grab the light head to adjust the position, so you end up turning it off or to a different setting while trying to adjust it. The other is that the clip section is kind of big and heavy with the AAA batteries in it and is especially noticeable with paperback books. I expected it to be heavy, but went with it anyway b/c of the whole CR battery deal above. Those two negatives don't bother me much at all. I would still recommend the light.",4.0
"Product works great. Only thing I don't like is that the light is actually a little TOO bright. It is disturbing for other people in the room when all other lights are out. So depending on what you're using it for, you may run into the same problem.",4.0
This product serves its purpose as a reading light.  It clips on tight and weighs very little.  Only dislike is the bulky clip and no biggie.,4.0
"I really like this book light. it's very light weighed, and easily adjusts to any size book. I light the fact that you can select how bright you want your light to be.",4.0
"This light covers the whole page as I read at night without lamp light, and easy to load batteries.  The clip is to big for the perimeter of the Kindle so I have to let it lay on a angle on top.  Not side attachable, but got used to it quik and stays clipped on.",4.0
"Great product.  Batteries are lasting a long time and the light is more than bright enough. The clip could be a bit sronger, but it is still very functional.",4.0
"The light is great, the only downside is it is a push button to turn it on and I have found it sometimes on in my suitcase from the button having been inadvertently pushed while it was packed.",4.0
"This product is perfect for the Kindle. I have a Kindle Touch with a book-type cover. It clips very well onto the back. It has two modes that you can toggle through when you click the button at the top - Extreme Bright & Super Bright. I wish this had a little more subdued light option that didn't bother my wife, but it works well overall and will let you read your Kindle after-hours!",4.0
"I have had previous versions of the Might Bright light, both which eventually fell apart or broke easily.  This one has better lighting (LED), and I am hopeful that the the coiled neck will endure better than it's predecessors.",4.0
got this light just for some late night reading in bed.arrived very promptly and does a wonderful job so far.bright lite and covers about a whole page. light weight and easily manuerable.pretty good for the money,4.0
"This light is great for reading books or with a screen reader like the kindle.
  Easy on batteries.
  Built in lenses provide a very directed, relatively bright light.
  Not a lot of light ""spill over"". (Good for reading in bed without disturbing that lump next to you.)
  Scrunches up real small making it easy to carry with you.
  Optional AC adapter is available for use without batteries or with rechargeable batteries.
  Clamp is strong enough that it stays put.

I found the light to be very adequate for reading but a disappointment as a task light for close work. It just isn't bright enough for this application.

All in all this light is near perfect for what it is designed. I'm very happy with it. You will be too.",4.0
"I like my little lamp, specially for bed reading. It has two lights and you can choose to use one or the two of them. I only would like that it had a larger extension so I could not have to put it on the book but behind the bed.",4.0
"A little cumbersome for the .6oz Kindle I have and sometimes puts an odd glare on the screen so you have to angle it correctly, but the light itself is very bright, white, light. I clip the light right to my Kindle's cover I have on it and it works well that way, but needs to be detached for travel. The light is powerful but not so much that someone sitting next to you is bothered. I am able to read in a dark room while my husband sleeps next to me without any problem. I have had no problems with the neck flexibility as some reviews of lights suggested. I like this light a lot for what it does- worth the price.",4.0
