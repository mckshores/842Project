"When it comes to a DM's screen, the space on the screen itself is at an absolute premium. The fact that 50% of this space is wasted on art (and not terribly informative or needed art as well) makes it completely useless. The only reason that I gave it 2 stars and not 1 was that, technically speaking, it can at least still stand up to block your notes and dice rolls. Other than that, it drops the ball completely.",2.0
"This is one of the worst games I have ever played.  You basically have to come up with puns on the spot.  Not only are puns generally pretty bad, you have to generate puns that are worse than your run of the mill groaners.  I can't imagine many people enjoying it, but it is slow paced and generally does not generate any level of enjoyment unless you're very skilled with the English language.",2.0
"It sounded like a really amazing concept, but when we tried to play it, it fell completely flat. Maybe if we were fans of the television show that the game is originally based upon? But having no ""prior experience"", we tried three rounds (even using the ""hints"" to get people started) and everyone just looked at each other and we decided to play something else. This was a high IQ group, and we often use puns in day to day banter, but the game just fell completely flat. :-(

Sad, because the quality of the box set is very nice, and comes with everything needed to play (pads, pencils, etc.).",2.0
"While my 3 year old son liked th tattos you'd think that a few more could be supplied.  I think there were something akin to 8-10 total.  A few more skull and cross bone flags would be nice.

The tattoos did seem to transfer well but didn't last longer or less than most other temporary tattoos.",2.0
"This is indeed a small book. This particular ROBOT sticker book was at best, OK.
Why? Well, there's really no space to create multiple robots. Stickers are not easy to remove.
Not recommended unless you just gotta have it to entertain a child. But this may only last ten minutes.
Plus side, small enough to stick in purse for travel.",2.0
"I thought this would be much bigger.  It's more like a little stocking stuffer.  My kids were 5 and 9, and neither really took to the book.  I'd recommend it for even younger children.",2.0
"The book is just stickers, it is NOT an activity book. Each sheet of sticker consist of the many pieces to create one robot and there are about four or five robots. So you could create one or multiple robots from the many sticker pieces in this book. There is only one page that doesn't have any stickers and if you are trying to make a robot from the stickers in the books you can only fit one robot in that page.

We thought the small size would be great for their little hands, but If you buy this as an activity book it just doesn't work and I would give it one star because there are no activities in it and your child will need a separate book to put all of the stickers.

If you buy this just for the stickers, they are fun but at $4.00 (current price on Amazon) it doesn't work either, four dollars is a lot of money for these stickers. At that price you are better off buying a sticker activity book from ""early learning"" or ""My Little World"" they are great little books.

I would not recommend this children's book by Dover Publications because of its high cost and very little content.",2.0
"Although $1.99 isn't much, it was disappointing to see this small booklet (4 pages) of stickers. Should have read details more closely.",2.0
They were ok but not really considered it a book. Really small disappointed!,2.0
"Smaller than we thought, kind of disappointed in it.",2.0
The book is only 4 pages and it's about the size of a 3x5 note card... not much fun at all.,2.0
"It's a bit thin, was expecting more. There is a robot in the back and you cover him with new stickers, the stickers are almost like clothes instead of actual robot parts. It would be nice if there was a section of heads, section of bases and torsos and you could combine them together to build unique robots. You are supposed to put the stickers back in the book when you are finished, I doubt that will work with my son. We will see how long this lasts, I am going to guess about 5 minutes.",2.0
this wasn't really what I thought it would be...,2.0
"I sent this product to my granddaughter. The pom-pom maker comes in two parts and is supposed to snap together to create the pom-poms. However, both parts were the same making it unusable. If you can't make the pom-poms the kit is useless. Since this was sent as a gift, I do not have it to return. Very disappointed.",2.0
"At age 31 I found these very difficult to make, I can't imagine how an 8 year old would do it by themselves.",2.0
"I double checked the contents to make sure everything was there but this was intended as a gift. The kit had obviously been opened and the packaging ripped. So it looks used and secondhand, which makes it a bit tacky to give as a gift. And as the instruction book is attached to the box, I can't repackage it myself. I'm giving it two stars because the kit does look fun bit in this case, it was a waste of money for me.",2.0
Hard to put together.,2.0
"Not very easy, just lots of yarn. Maybe for a 10 year old.",2.0
"Cute idea, and the basic steps make sense are are easy to follow if a parent works with the kid. I gave a low review because although my child was excited to take part in this, they get bored when you are doing the work ( trust me you will have to, my kid is in first grade) and the glue provided SUCKS. It's basically Elmers glue and it's just not enough to keep everything together. I can't keep the ears or anything to dry and stay on without falling off. I would recommend hot glue.",2.0
this was a gift for my daughter.  I found it difficult to use,2.0
Rather hard for my 11 year old to do alone.,2.0
"Came book only. If it's just the book, it should be listed as a different listing entirely.",2.0
Cute idea - horrible execution. If you want your child in tears then this is your book. My seven year old got very frustrated with this whole thing.,2.0
"I bought this thinking it would be really fun , but I was disappointed . It's really messy and it isn't nearly as easy as it seems. Also, the glue is useless.
For a 9 year old the instructions are very difficult.",2.0
"I think these might be cute, if they included enough yarn!

My daughter and I sat down to make them, we measured out enough to make a white dog and a black dog and both the white and black yarn was just shy of having enough to make one puppy.  So now we are headed up to the craft store to buy more yarn!  Frustrating when you have already sat down and are ready to make your project right then.",2.0
Instructions are complicated to follow,2.0
They do not bond well together. the head of the puppies do not bond well to the body.,2.0
"item arrived defective so that we had to send back on xmas morn!  The pom-pom maker was made wrong- it had arches with 3 ""male parts"" (bumps) and 1 ""female part"" (holes)... sorry if too much info, but don't know how else to properly explain!  :-)  So it couldn't be snapped together and therefore was unusable.  Should have contained 2 males w/ 2 female parts so all 4 arches snapped together. My husband is very good at engineering, etc, so definitely wasn't user error. Disappointed to sent back xmas present instead of my daughter getting to use it on xmas day....!! Otherwise, the idea is really cute, but their QC should be much bettter to not disappoint their customers!!",2.0
"I found that this card game does the opposite of what it was intended for. It actually has the kids focusing on ways to get angry, etc. instead of teaching how to be calm and act better. It really should have been tested before sale. A better game would have been Calm Dragon. I tried this game on kids that had absolutely no behavior or anger problems and they began behaving badly and getting angry after the second round. I don't recommend this. I am a therapist and I work with kids with anger issues all day long, I thought this might be a good tool... I was wrong.",2.0
"This is basically Uno.  I don't see how they could be useful as therapy tools.  Cute deck, though - we will use them.",2.0
Confusing instructions and its not for 6 year olds. Its boring too. Its asking the same question but each question is worded differently.,2.0
"Its really UNO type game but anger control stuff...I don't like it due to younger children really don't respond well to anger management techniques...they do better with EXPECTATION management instead.  These are ok, but i wouldn't buy them again.",2.0
I purchased this on the recommendation of two therapists working with my adopted children. The children found it boring and put it down half way through.,2.0
I'm an OT and I intended on using it with my aggressive kiddos. I used it once and even I was frustrated with it. It's very repetitive in asking the same questions in different format.,2.0
"It's small.  The legs fold up and it's only 5 inches tall, and then not even quite that.  Plus, you can find this SAME stuffed animal at Barnes and Nobles (this one has the Barnes and Noble tag) for half the price.  Wish I'd looked around first.",2.0
"had a very hard time opening the last super Thursday egg. tried using a paper clip, a nail flier, still  I'm not able to open it.",2.0
"I love the idea, but can't close the eggs even though I left them out to dry. Disappointed.",2.0
Love the idea and premise. My  almost 3-year-old has had a fun time with it  and anticipates it every day.  My biggest complaint is that the first two eggs do you not properly close and it has only been a week since I purchased.  I live in Denver so I know it's not the  humidity.  I'm going to try to return or see if they will replace the damaged eggs. I will follow up with  another post.,2.0
"This is very small. It's just Cardboard , I expected something different .",2.0
Very flimsy.  Get what you pay for.,2.0
"Acquire is BACK!  That is the GOOD news.  The game is a lot of fun, but .... the relatively new owners of Avalon Hill Games have opted to bring out a very cheap version.  A big PLUS is that they added tile holders, but a MINUS is the fact that they are only cardstock and will not take much abuse or use.  This edition has brought back some of the names from earlier editions, but they have changed the values so as to confuse players who have played the earlier versions.  This is one of the best of 'Family' games I have ever played, but I heartily recommend that you shop around to find an earlier edition.",2.0
We really love the 1999 version. this version lacks the looks and feel of the 1999 version. It looks a bit cheap. As far as rules and game is concerned it is entertaining. I would still trade this in for a 1999 version.,2.0
"It is no where close to the old game. I have had the old game since the late 60's. The new hotel pieces are paper instead of plastic. They have changed the titles of some properties. I paid more and got less, but that seems to be the norm these days. I'll keep it because I needed some new money and some replacement cards. However I don't like it and even though it is a super fun game, I can't recommend it to anyone. The quality is not there. Sorry !  I am usually satisfied with my purchases from Amazon.  D Ann Louisiana.",2.0
not that great a game. have only played like once or twice and don't even know where it is now.,2.0
"If you have never played Acquire know that this negative review is not of the way the game is played.  Acquire is hands down my favorite board game.

With that being said... Spend a little more money on an older version of the game where the board and pieces are plastic.  The cardboard pieces of this game will not hold up to use and will slide around the board easily.  I was extremely disappointed when I received this and returned it immediately.  Again, spend some money on even a used older version of this game by 3M or Avalon Hill.",2.0
"I have the original version of this game which is almost 40 years old.  I wanted to get a new game because mine is worn.  I was so disappointed when I opened this game.  It is the cheapest version of a game that I have ever seen.  Everything is cardboard!  The game I have has a nice plastic board with slots in it for each peg to fit in, much like the top version of scrabble.  The pegs in my old game are much like the scrabble pegs also.

The new game is all cardboard.  Everything cardboard!  The board, the pegs, the trays...cardboard.  I am so disheartened.  I thought I was getting a newer and better version of my favorite game of all times.  I ordered three of them and another one for my brother's birthday.  I returned them.

If you can find the old version of this game, by all means grab it.  It is the best game ever!",2.0
"The Game is amazing.
The new version is not.
Cardboard is biodegradable but a ""greener"" version could have been produced with better game pieces. I guess Avalon Hill has beaten us all at it's own board game. They no longer need to cater to the consumer because people will buy even though this version is terrible in comparison to the 1999 edition.
Disappointing but not surprising.",2.0
"Acquire is a great game of luck, strategy, and (like monopoly) can teach people about capitalism. This new updated version from Hasbro does just that. It is a sadly cheap and flimsy copy of the original. The stock certificates are nice done. But the game board is weak, and the tiles are quite simply pitiful. Hasbro will no doubt make money, as no matter the cost to teh consumer, the cost of production must be essentiall nothing. Games are improved by the tactile: the feel of teh pieces in your hand, the way they work on the board, their physicality. This new edition was clearly designed by someone who just doesnt play board games. Sadly, its just cheap.",2.0
The old one has nice plastic parts. This is All cardboard. Every piece. That reduces it's playability a little. It's still fun though.,2.0
"This is a very good game. We enjoy playing it with friends, but the material of the pieces it's a shame. Other versions had better, more durable and three dimension pieces. But you can't find those anymore. I bought it because the game is great.",2.0
"I'm a long time Acquire fan. My friends and I played it for many long hours for years. So I was delighted to see that it had been reissued.

The new version is a huge disappointment. The tiles, trays to hold each player's tiles, and the tiles that indicate a hotel are all cardboard. Worse, they are cardboard that you will have to pop out of a card.

The earlier versions had a board to hold the tiles that had a slot for each tile, which was much more effective.

With the current version, the tiles slide around the board dont' stay in place.

There is no place to hold the cash, so in the box it just slides around. There is no scoring card.

The shares for each hotel chain are very fancily printed, but the printing is so fancy that it is hard to tell which hotel chain the share is for without reading carefully. A simple use of color would have fixed this.

I'm glad I have a copy of the game so I can play with my kids, but its a very cheap design.",2.0
"I wish I'd watched some of the gameplay videos of Ashardalon before buying. As others have mentioned, it's not an RPG, it's a board game. But as a board game, it's a particularly bad boardgame. It's punishingly difficult, and there is little theme. It begs for house rules to clean up the terrible Encounter Card system.

I tried playing aggressively, and was quickly overwhelmed with critters to kill. I tried playing cautiously, and my party was wrecked by encounter cards. It just doesn't feel like a proper dungeon crawl if you've killed five monsters and lost half of your characters' HP before you've left sight of the staircase. It's more like a combat game set in a wacky arena where bad stuff happens all the time. Seen another way, it is like a puzzle game, where you have to balance risk (generally too much) against reward (generally too little), and hopefully survive long enough to reach the objective. But in no way does it feel like a dungeon crawl. And, importantly, it's a poor introduction to RPG elements.

But clearly I am in the minority; this is a well-reviewed game. I simply wish to offer a dissenting opinion. To me, Ashardalon is not fun to play.

I'm selling my copy and I'm going to try Mice and Mystics instead. That looks more like what I was hoping Ashardalon would be, with a balance of teen-friendly story, adventure, and combat, with no need for a DM. I'm also eager to try Arcadia Quest.

I grant two stars in my review instead of one because the bits in the box are FANTASTIC. Excellent miniatures and board pieces. It's top-notch presentation, and looks fantastic when you take it all out of the box.",2.0
"Here is my review, cross-posted from boardgamegeek.com:

I have fond memories of D&D from my youth, that I occasionally attempt to recapture. I remember the sense of vague foreboding conjured by RPG-like board games such as Runequest and Spacehulk. I had read some favorable reviews of the new ""RPG-as-boardgame"" series promoted by Wizards on the Coast, and I was excited to try this. I splunked down my hard-earned cash and amazon duly delivered a hefty box of dreams to my doorstep.

Wrath of Ashardalon and I had some good times initially. My friends and I gamely punched all the cardboard pieces out of the sprues. We love punching pieces out of sprues! It inspires a sense of childlike wonder and anticipation in us! This tile has a Horrid Chamber on it! That dungeon tile has dead bodies! Ooh, I wonder what a flaming sphere does? These cards all have various powers and spells on them! Look, you can play a dragon character! And the plastic figurines were enjoyable, similar to those plastic dinosaurs we all had as kids. Whee!

Sadly, that was the best part of the game. Everything went downhill when we actually started to play.

The game itself is a reductionist vision of a dungeon crawl. It is, unfortunately, so reductionist that is effectively a game of Munchkin, but without a sense of humor. I think the game designers must have sensed this, and to try to add a sense of danger and urgency to the game, they created a deck of sadistic Encounter cards to punish us for playing. (But more about those later.)

The players progress through the dungeon together. At every unexplored edge, they ""kick down the door"" and grow the dungeon by one (1) new dungeon tile, guaranteed to contain exactly one (1) new monster, and possible an Encounter card (which is invariably unpleasant). This game might have been interesting if every new corner of the dungeon had produced a novel challenge for the players to make strategic decisions about together. Instead, the players typically have one power which is the min-max best option for any given monster, and they use it, over and over again. The twenty-sided die is rolled. The monster advances. It does a hit point of damage to the wizard! And then it dies. And drops a treasure.

It's difficult to be heroic in this game. The characters are punished for pushing forward into the darkness. They are also punished for standing still. They are punished for gathering together on one tile, and they are punished for spreading out. There are precious few strategic decisions to be made in this game.

All of this is incredibly tedious and dull. I magic missile the darkness.

The power cards feel poorly thought out, poorly worded, and disappointing. The ""Hypnosis"" card, seems promising: it can cause one monster to attack another! My goodness, a card that allows the players to turn the dungeon against itself! Strategy! But no. Unlike the Scroll of Monster Control item, which replaces a monster's attack on the players, Hypnosis simply supplements the monster's action with it's ""hypnotized"" attack. But can the power at least let the players turn the Cave Bear's awesome Claws attack against the Kobold horde? No, not really. The monster's attack is reduced to a standardized ""Attack +9, Damage 1,"" as printed on the card. Really, this card is a +9, 1 damage attack that only works if two monsters are in the same room. Is this what the game designers intended? Who knows! But hey, that's what it says on the card.

If the player's powers are boring, at least the game designers also gave us Encounter cards. We scrubbed through the rules multiple times, certain we were misinterpreting them. But no: every player will typically draw at least one encounter card every turn. Thus, a four-player band of characters fighting a monster will typically draw four encounter cards every round of combat. Sadly, the encounter cards aren't terribly creative. They all seem to be variants of ""Random thing happens! And everybody takes a point of damage."" Your band of fearless heroes has just spent a turn vanquishing a kobold, and you're feeling pretty good about it. But wait, you turn isn't over until you draw an Encounter card. Oops! The room you're in just turned into a pit! Most of the players fall into it. You do the heroic thing and stay in the room with the pit to help your friends climb out. But lo, on the next turn the pit rolls to attack again and sucks you in!

Many of the encounter traps seem more malevolent that is actually necessary. The spinning ball of blade trap will follow you from room to room. The walls turn to magma! But on the next turn the magma reverts to stone while an alarm sounds, alerting the orcish horde to our presence! A cage falls on your head! Poisonous gas fills the room! It's so zany! The Encounter cards prove to be far more lethal than any monster encountered in the dungeon. The players will come to dread having to take their turn.

We were certain that we missed some part of the game on our first run-through. Maybe we were playing it wrong. Maybe we had misinterpreted the rules. So we played it through a second time, and lo: the game as written is truly terrible. At least, we knew that with a few rule changes, we could fix this game. Instead of making the monsters and traps follow unrealistic instructions printed on cards, we decided it would be better to designate one of our number of administrate all the monsters. And, instead of using the limited characters provided with the game (and, no doubt, soon-to-be-available expansion packs), we would create our own characters ourselves. And, instead of plastic figurines and delightful cardboard squares, we would use our imaginations.

The game is much more fun that way.",2.0
This set looked like it would be a good accessory for playing D&D but turned out to be too limited in the tile selections you get.  It is very hard to create a usable encounter map and the tiles move around too easily causing constant game interuptions (have to frequently reposition the tiles and miniatures anytime movement/action happens).  The set was fun to look at and imagine what you could do with it but when I tried to actually use it I had inadiquate pieces available to complete my maps.,2.0
Got the product in damaged condition,2.0

"It's a cute doll. I thought she would be bigger and that her ""stomach "" would be bigger too. It isn't easy to remove animals from the dolls' mouth.",2.0
I already saw this said many times in the review but I hope adding my review to the bunch will help future potential buyers make an informed purchase..,2.0
I was so disappointed to receive my Little Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly Puppet.  There are no animals for her to swallow!  I was looking forward to using this puppet with the book I bought.  The animals are unavailable and she is MUCH Smaller than the one I had for my classroom a few years ago.  Why would they sell her without the props to complete the story?  It just doesn't make sense!  I planned to use her for my grandson's preschool class and have each child take a turn giving her an animal to swallow.  I am hunting for the animals now...which are unavailable.  Can anyone help?  Disappointed.,2.0
The little old lady is very cute. I am a teacher and I have a different version of this doll that came with all of the animals that go along with the book. I bought this one for a new teacher as a gift and when it cam I was expecting to find all of the animals also!!!! The animals are sold separately!!!!!!! Very expensive for just the doll and then had to purchase the animals. Overall it cost $35 just for a prop to read with a book!!!,2.0
I am devasted!! Got this for Christmas for a grandchild just received it and the box it completely ripped in back!!! NOW what I am not rating for the puzzle but for the packaging! Will you replace it or send a new one..........,2.0
"I thought I was getting a new product, but the box had obviously been opened (and product possibly used) PLUS the instruction manual was missing. The box was torn on both sides and I had to tape it. Not at all happy, but I don't have time to order another one or return this one.",2.0
I was expecting much stronger magnets. I was very disappointed and wish I had purchased Bucky Balls instead. It's very light weight and not all sides of each piece are magnetic. This makes it difficult to be creative and build other shapes.,2.0
"im not sure what i was expecting, but when i got this i was disappointed with the quality. each piece does not feel very sturdy. they are made out of red hard plastic with some magnets glued inside. i feel if one piece fell off a kitchen table onto a tile floor it would shatter. that hasn't happened yet, but its just what it feels like. the patterns you can make are pretty cool though, but i would like it if the magnets were stronger.",2.0
"If you're lucky enough to get the right letters in your hand, you'll probably have a good time. If you happen to get a handful of vowels and Qs, however, you get a lesson in futility. My wife and I did invent a fun game with these beautiful cards, though: everyone draws 7 and then tries to make up a sentence with words that start with the first letters on the cards. Much more fun!",2.0
Bought this for my 9 year old nephew. He didn't like it much,2.0
"Yes, you can find obscure short words to use in Quiddler but it also has a lot of abbreviations that I don't think should be included in the Quiddler game.  Quiddler is much more fun to me just using common words instead of every one nosing through this dictionary to find words.",2.0
not as much fun as I had hoped,2.0
"This was a bit disappointing. My students find it boring, and the letters are hard to understand.",2.0
"It is a fun game with a group, but, I expected the Quiddler dictionary to  be included with the game.  Found out after I ordered that it did not come with Quiddler dictionary.  Tried to order the Quiddler dictionary separate, but was unable to...very disappointed.  Shipping was too expensive to return.",2.0
"Not at the top of my list of very fun games to play, in my opinion.",2.0
"you are better off just playing scrabble. There are more opportunities to be creative there and isn't that what wordplay games are about? I'm still waiting for a game to top scrabble in the ""make words"" game category.",2.0
"The Quiddler cards were warped; wonder if they got wet.  Also, there seemed to be a weird finish on therm.  Other that that they were fine.  :)",2.0
"We love ""SET"" and were excited to play ""Quiddler.""

We found the rules to be absurdly complex.  We also found that playing by the rules was not much fun.

Just to explain - Quiddler is just a deck of cards with letters and point values on them (and they are beautifully illustrated) - it's a no brainer that you can just deal out cards and see who can make the most words, or the highest point words - it's basically like a deck of Scrabble cards.  And, the game is fun if you play this way.

For us, the problem was trying to follow the written directions/rules included with the game - we found them to be absurdly complicated and really not that fun.  We wound up just playing by our own rules.  We enjoyed it mildly, but would probably rather play Bananagrams or Scrabble.

This was only our first time playing so, if our opinion changes, I'll update this review.  For now though, it's a weak 2 stars.",2.0
"The only interaction is that during your play/turn you get to chance to choose from the discard pile and only the card that the person before discarded.  It's also too easy to make words and go out, two rounds is the norm; and the larger the word made means nothing extra.  The high review average for this game says something about the people posting reviews in general.",2.0
"We have not had much time to play this game, it is a game meant for more than 2 players, more exciting with more people.",2.0
"My mom bought this for me at our local bookstore. It sounds like  it would be fun on the box, but once you start playiung iot is somewhat confusing and quite boring. I have tried playing it a few times and just can't seem to find the fun in it. My advice is to not get the game unless you REALLY want to.",2.0
eh.....,2.0
"First of all, the packaging is very deceptive on this product.  Most of it is stuffed with cardboard to make it look like there are more cards in the box.  I can see the game being fun in certain settings, but we did not enjoy it very much.",2.0
I thought I was buying the game as posted in title. This box is only for a few replacement cards. Not worth $10 :-(,2.0
not quite what I would have expected. The number of cards is limited. Still fun,2.0
"The Order of the Stick comic is quite funny, if you have the right background with RPGs so you can catch all the inside jokes. This ""board game"" variation also has a lot of humor to it. I say board game in quotes because you build the dungeon room by room by laying cards down on the table. The graphic design is excellent.

You play one of the characters from the comic, such as Durkon the Dwarven Cleric or Haley the Rogue Archer. Each Player has a set of Schtick cards that represent his or her special abilities. You start out with three of these cards and can add more in play. Acquiring duplicates of these cards gives you Boosts to their listed abilities.

You move from room to room in the dungeon, trying to make your way down to Xykon's lair for the final confrontation with the big bad, battling monsters along the way. Upon entering a new room, you are given one or more monsters to fight by the other players. These monsters have funny illustrations and dialogue taken from the comic, and may have special abilities of their own. You roll a twelve-sided die, add up all relevant modifiers, and try to defeat the monster's attack or defense values, depending on the circumstances. When you defeat them, you get Loot cards. Defeat enough monsters and you can trade them in for more Schticks. When battling monsters, you can also trade the Loot cards you have accumulated to other Players, provided the Loot card has one or more symbols that match the character whose aid you are seeking. This aid boosts your attacks and is often the only way to defeat certain monsters.

There are a lot of other elements to the game, which I don't have the time or patience to list here, except for one of the deal-breakers for me: Players are actively encouraged by the winning conditions and the Schticks in the game to backstab each other. Yet you have to cooperate with each other to have a chance of winning. The result is a game with a really schizophrenic feel. Are you competing or cooperating? Aiding or sabotaging? Combine this with the need to account for all the niggly little ability modifiers that crop up on various cards and which may or may not stack with other monster modifiers and room modifiers and adjustments caused by special Screw This cards that you or OTHER Players may throw into your battles to help or hinder you, and the game play is SLOW.

Moreover, the sheer randomness of the monsters you will face and WHEN you will face them is aggravating. It's entirely possible to be facing extremely tough enemies on the first level that you have no real chance of beating, depending upon how cruel the other Players are. There's no strategy that will help you with this. Certain Player characters are simply completely helpless when encountering certain types of monsters that negate all of their significant Schticks. In addition, the Players themselves are woefully unbalanced. Haley is clearly the most powerful, with Roy probably coming in second, while Belkar and Vaarsuvius are one-trick ponies at a consistent disadvantage.

This leads to a game in which it is difficult to plan, that requires you to add up a lot of different modifiers and keep track of special abilities even though dumb luck is often going to screw you or pull you through, and where defeating the most monsters is no real guarantee of victory in the end if you get back stabbed.

We've played the game half a dozen times, because I want to like it, but my experience has been that it routinely brings out the worst in people, encouraging arguments over the rules, petty bickering over things like ""why didn't you heal or aid me last turn?"" and backstabbing that can bring progress to a crawl just when momentum was being built. In other words, it encapsulates the things I like least about role playing games and compresses them into a brightly colored, visually attractive package. If it wasn't for the humor on the cards I would give this game a ""1"" for actual play experience. It's funny, but I don't see the point in spending four to five hours of often dull play punctuated by arguments and resolving rules disputes just so that someone can cherry-pick a victory.",2.0
This game sounds fun but my teenager hated it and the preteens who played with us got bored of it quickly. The questions are appropriate for kids but really dull for anyone ages 10+.,2.0
"Overall, I like the idea of this bank. However, it is very poorly made and not durable. The lid got chipped and won't work, and now the metal is unstable and bending back and forth on one of the boxes.

I gave it as a birthday present for my son and his birthday was in February. It's only July and I'm already having to think of how to replace it.

Save your money on this overpriced poor quality bank and use 3 labelled jars or something of that nature instead.",2.0
"This is not one box as pictured.  It actually has a paper cover holding it together.  The only way to keep the bank together is to tie the three pieces together with a rubber band, which is very unsatisfactory.  There are other banks with the three compartments that are one piece and work well.  I definitely would not buy this again.",2.0
"I thought this was a fantastic idea so bought one each for my grandchildren. Very disappointed that it is not a complete unit but three completely separate sections. The three sections fall apart and are only held together with the decorative cardboard packaging - this will not last long and having three individual sections seams pointless as they are not very steady without the piece of cardboard holding them together. Very disappointed. Five stars for the concept, two stars for the product.",2.0
When did they switch to cardboard? Cheap.,2.0
Too complicated.  We all got bored and tired trying to understand the directions.,2.0
A very complicated game.  It was advertised as appropriate for age 8 and up.  We have grandchildren 9 years old that would not be able to comprehend all the rules and maze of tracks to use to get to your destination. It did not live up to the product description.,2.0
"Game is fun, but my board appears to be warped. It doesnt lay flat which is annoying as you're trying to place your trains on pieces near the the warped creases.",2.0
This is a great game however when it arrived the box was warped and the first time we played it the board broke. I unfolded it and it broke at the the seams into 3 pieces and I had to take it back together,2.0
All the pieces to this game were not in the box don't know if I would order again or not.,2.0
"Love this game. We were glad to finally add it to our collection. However, by the second time of playing, the board broke. I have older kids who know how to care for games and the second time it was me putting it away gently. On our gameschool site, there were five of us that have said the same thing about a recent purchase of this game from Amazon. I have a request for replacement to the company, well see how it goes.",2.0
My daughter is loves board games but she was not crazy about this game . I also found this game pretty dull,2.0
"I love this game and ordered two as gifts, but when they arrived the boxes were all torn up despite the fact that they were in shrink wrap.  One of them the bottom of the box is almost completely torn off.  These won't be able to be given as gifts.",2.0
"I love the game itself, however this product came damaged. First, the box had many signs of wear, almost as if it was used. The board from the start wouldn't lie  flat. Today the board broke after less than two months of sporadic play.",2.0
"It may be a great game, but the instructions are poorly written and not very clear.  I may take another stab at it another time, but trying to figure out how to play left me with a pounding headache.",2.0
can't figure out the game... instructions difficult so we have been unable to play,2.0
"The game is for 2-5 players but the more players, the merrier. The cities are not all accurately placed on the map which is a shame (Helena is one example). I have it only 2 stars because the game wasn't in mint condition when it arrived.",2.0
Great game. But the board is so severely warped that it's practically unplayable.,2.0
"The game itself is very enjoyable, however - the reason for the drop in my rating is due to the fact that I received a used game that clearly shows wear and tear when I purchased and was charged for a new product.",2.0
"Ordered for my sons birthday, opened it up today to play and the board is damaged.  Before we even take it out of the box the game is already falling apart.  Very disappointed...",2.0
"Like another reviewer mentioned, 14 of the cards in the game I got were incorrectly labeled. I contacted the manufacturer, Days of Wonder, and they suspect I received a counterfeit version. I'm sending back to them for a replacement. I'm surprised Amazon would sell a counterfeit game.",2.0
The idea of the game is great but more than half of our tickets are incorrect. The names of cities do not match the stations marked on the map!,2.0
I got the package and it had two sets of black trains and blue trains missing. I have to send it back. Will update once a get the new one,2.0
Only giving this a 2 out of 5 because I received my game with 4 different colored trains instead of 5. I received 2 blue packages of trains instead of a blue and a black. Other than that the instructions were very easy to follow and fun game.,2.0
"Had to return because game arrived without proper cards to play. There were two individually wrapped decks, however they were both identical; we didn't have any red, purple, green, or black cards, which made it so we couldn't play! Bummer.",2.0
Pretty complicated for 8 year olds.  I'd raise the min age to 9 or 10.,2.0
"Many of the cities on the gameboard are in the wrong place. For instance, Duluth, MN is drawn where Minneapolis and St. Paul are located. Annoying.",2.0
"I really dislike this game.  To me it is a slightly more sophisticated game of Sorry, but a lot less fun.  There is so much luck involved in this game, as the entire game play is based on picking the top card from a stack of shuffled cards to determine where you can go on the Board (thus the similarity to Sorry).  I find there to be nearly no ""strategy"" to this game, with the only real thought being whether to hold your cards until you can make bigger moves or to play them and take smaller railroad routes.

This could be a fun game to play with children between the ages of 8 and 12 who are not yet ready for a full strategy game, like Settlers.

With that said, the board is nice, the cards are quality cards (which is important, because if they got marked up so you could ""tell"" what card was coming next, the game would be even less fun), and even the railroad pieces that are made of plastic seem to be holding up well.  That is why I did not give it one star.",2.0
orderd game by mistake,2.0
The game was received damaged but the outer package was not damaged.  I initiated a return and reordered the game at $6.42 more than what I paid for it previously.  This is for my grandchildren for Christmas so I had no choice but I think this is a pretty dirty deal!,2.0
"The game is expensive, takes a long time to play, and gets boring after the first few turns. The only strategy we could determine was collecting route cards (tickets) since all the routes get linked by other players. I have heard the European version is better but I don't know how unless the rules are different.",2.0
"This product was advertised as ""like new"" yet that was clearly not the case. The box has been cut open, original packaging is missing, and the bags containing the engines have seen better days.

The good news is that all of the pieces were there. The bad news is that this could never have been gifted, as originally intended.",2.0
The game is pure evil,2.0
I guess lots of people love this game.  I just thought it boring and time consuming.,2.0
Took forever to read the instructions. Not a quick start type game. Definitely not for any 8 year old we know. Finally gave up and gave it away,2.0
"I was really looking forward to this game, but found that it was pretty boring and lacked any sort of excitement.",2.0
"The game just isn't my cup of tea, it takes too long to get interesting.  Kind of like a nascar race, the first 3/4ths don't seem to matter, but the last bit is where it gets more fun.",2.0
"I bought this for my grandchildren and  me to play together.  I was very excited to play it after reading all the rave reviews.
After playing it with my 13 year old granddaughter, I'm ready to return it.  We didn't really see what all the hype was about.
I'm sorry I bought it.",2.0
"After reading the reviews we expected this game to be a winner, but we found the directions hard to follow. We only played it once so not sure we were even doing it right. (I gave it to the grandsons as a gift so don't know if they tried it again after I left or not). Bottom line... I don't recommend it.",2.0
This game is expensive for the quality of product received. The directions are confusing and the set up/start is complicated. The strategy of the game is more suited to older kids and adults but the actual play with color matching trains makes it seem like it is for younger kids. This game was a huge disappointment!,2.0
"This game is ok for what it is. It is a simple game where you try and get multiple cards of the same color, to match up with the corresponding colors on the routes on the map. You score points for going from one city to another, scoring more for larger routes. You draw ""destination cards"" that have 2 cities on them, and if you connect them you score bonus points. The game consists of players making their own routes longer, or blocking other players. Not very much to it, and it is really annoying when 5 turns go by and you never get the cards you need. There is a decent amount of strategy in this game, but it is nowhere near as fun as Power Grid, Carcassonne, Puerto Rico, or 7 Wonders. I have tried to enjoy this game, because the hype must come from somewhere, but to no avail. If you want to begin getting into fun board games that are not too difficult, but better than monopoly or sorry that you grew up with, I would recommend 7 Wonders or Carcassonne.",2.0
I got this game as a present and the reaction was not so great even after playing it..too much luck involved,2.0
"This game was highly touted in the publicity I read about it.  However, it too forever to even get the game set up, not to mention trying to understand the complexity of play.  It was waaay too complicated and waaaaay too expensive.",2.0
"Beautifully designed and nicely made but simple to play?  I don't think so.  It has way too many pieces and far too many choices, and frankly I'm not sure that I understand the goal -- which isn't what is expressed in the rules.  I have done a number of those train rides and the routes don't actually go where some of the existing AMTRAK trains (and Canadian Trains) go.  Versimilitude is valuable.  My opinion is that it needs to be simplified and modified...although my opinion is obviously in the minority.  My 8 and 10 year old grandsons liked it but we played with rules that we made up to suit our idea of how it should be played.  And then we spent 10 minutes sorting out the pieces, the cards, and replacing everything in the box.  Mix the cards up and you are doomed!",2.0
"I didn't like this game because you can make your strategy at the beginning of the game and one person can make a move that will totally stop you from succeeding. I don't like games where you cant follow your strategy through the game or that each player has one movement per turn. This was just a frustrating game for me, even when I won.",2.0
"Pretty fun game though not very deep or complicated.  Maybe I haven't played enough but winning seems to be based a bit more on luck than strategy, at least compared to other games out there.",2.0
Is this Elf made out of a felt material or cotton?,2.0
"It's an ""Elf on the Shelf"". The price is shameful, I hated to buy it but my previous one had to be ""retired"", and my youngest kept asking, ""When is the Elf coming?"".",2.0
"Received, but book was printed upside down to the cover of the book. Amazon great about doing a refund. Going to order another one. Hopefully the next one is  fine. Was really looking forward to starting this tradition, guess I will have to wait",2.0
I received my elf within 24 hours of ordering which was fantastic BUT it was the wrong gender. We ordered a male for my sons and received a female. We're making it work but would of loved to of gotten what we ordered.,2.0
"So, I ordered a blue eyed boy, since I have 2 boys, and I got a blue eyed girl... other than that major faux pas, everything was perfect. And it's ton late to exchange since the boys have seen her already. :-/",2.0
"Great product but with in hours of buying this, my debit card was fraud edstrom and used to purchase $700 at a grocery store and also at a restaurant.",2.0
"Im pretty excited to start this tradition. Im not sure what happened but my book box is a little damaged. I know it shouldnt be a big deal, but Ill be saving it for hopefully the next decade and it stinks that it will not be perfect to start.  The amazon box was not damaged so it makes me believe it didn't happen during shipping.",2.0
"The concept is wonderful and clearly a multi-million dollar idea, and the story book is cute, however I cannot believe how chintzy and cheap the actual elf doll is!! If you are going to purchase this, be sure to know that you are paying $30 just to buy into the concept. I was SO excited to get this for my 2 1/2 year old as this is the first Christmas that she sort of understands the idea behind Santa. When I received this pathetic little elf with no feet, clothed in dollar-store felt, my heart sank, b/c I know the first chance my daughter has to get a good look at this thing, she's going to know that this is all a hoax. No child that has gotten a good look at this doll is going to believe that he is Magic for a second-the creepy thing's hands are sewn together& he doesn't even have feet! Furthermore, he is not easily posed or bendy at all, he is just foam and felt- so he is weightless & floppy and he cannot sit on a shelf unassisted. Again the concept is great but in the next year I'm going to try and find a better elf, swap him out & hope my daughter doesn't notice next year that he's different. I have been keeping him so high up& behind things so she can't get a great look at him.",2.0
"Got this to replace our beloved family elf who due an unfortunate accident lost his head. Although this new elf was entitled ""boy elf with blue eyes"" je looked NOTHING life our family elf. Our family elf came to us 10 years ago so maybe they changed? Whatever the case this elf did not work for us.",2.0
"I am a teacher, and I bought this for my students and I to enjoy during the holiday season. I've found that the little elf isn't made well enough to withstand 40 little hands trying to see it. The head is heavy and the rest of the body is lanky, which I understand the point of but it's still difficult. I didn't find the book to be cute as much as creepy. It was a fun tradition for the kids, but for this adult, it was hard to remember to change it every day, lol. I think it should come with a list of fun places for the elf to go.",2.0
i was unhappy with it. because the elf wasn't with it. the book wasn't even wrapped.,2.0
"We lost our original elf and we were very disappointed that this new elf has a different face. Was there a problem with mold, or is it just easier to paint eyelashes on this new face and call it a girl.  My girls would notice the face change so we were force to make up a story that the original elf was promoted and this new elf is his replacement.",2.0
Lame tool to get kids to behave,2.0
We bought this thinking it would be a fun thing to do with our 20 month old son but after looking at it and reading the book we decided against starting this as a tradition.,2.0
"Not a quality item. Like almost everyone nowadays, it was mass-produced in China, and it is of poor quality.",2.0
"The doll is cute, but I hate the book.  It starts off fine, then quickly leads into follow god and follow all laws.  WTF is a book about Santa have to do with religion?  And why tell kids to follow ""laws"" instead of family rules?  Very disturbing. I threw book away and made up  my own story for elf for kids.",2.0
"Quite possibly the WORST tasting protein I've ever had - and that's saying a lot. I originally bought it because I read a bunch of reviews that said it was comparable to Shakeology, which is only slightly a step above in the taste department. Now I get it, it's like plant based, so naturally anything that's really good for you tastes like cardboard, so I'll stick with it and see if it promises anything the label suggests it does.",2.0
She arrived today. I'm so disappointed in her she looks very used & dirty looking.,2.0
"Our 'new' elf was used.  Wasn't even attached to the box, just floating around in there, and the package was dirty.  But, we had fun with Blart.",2.0
Cliche and stupid. I should not drink and Amazon....,2.0
"Did not receive the order as described. I received a dark skinned and brown eyed elf instead of light skinned and blue eyes. Since i was needing it as a secret 2nd elf for another home, it was important to match my current one. But, the one i received was in excellent condition. I did not attempt to return due to it already being December and the need for one. I hid his face as best i could this year. Will have to find another one next year.",2.0
"Someone is laughing all the way to the bank and retiring early, and it's not me.

I hated the book.  The illustrations are ugly, and worse, the words are pathetic.  In a desperate attempt to rhyme, there are some really lame lines and bad choices of words in there.  I find myself paraphrasing every time I read it.  You don't need the book.  You can just explain to your child that  there is a magical elf that helps Santa by reporting who's been naughty and who's been nice, every night.  Every morning he comes back and hangs out in a new spot.  Just one rule: ""You can't touch this - Hammertime!"" or he might lose his magic.

The elf isn't bendy or velcroed or anything, so it was difficult to pose him anywhere except a shelf.  For this amount of money, couldn't you at least make his hands velcro together?

Lastly, my kids were not into it (Age 2 and 3).  Maybe they were too young, or too spoiled.  The elf brought them occasional gifts (advent calendar, chocolate, diecast car, pajamas) - still, the elf got no love.  I will try again next year, but will make our own elf book together with our kids.",2.0
"Stupid elf. Everyone has to have one, right. And they're all named Chippy. This elf looks like something I made in 7th grade home ec. Not worth the money. Make one yourself.",2.0
"Very poor made, cheap material and finishing. Im disappointed.",2.0
"Packaging and book is nice. Elf is of low quality. Made of stiff cheap rough felt. The hands are sewn together not Velcro or magnetized and the limbs do not have wire as the older knee hugger characters have thus making it impossible to keep in a pose or hang on most things that you would need to separate the hands to get his arms around. Mine also came with a rub mark on the cheek where paint had been rubbed off. My 17 month old does love to look at it and make him sit up, but it won't last long if I let him play with it. I was really hoping to be able to pose him more easily as that is the main reason I bought him.",2.0
"Clearly a used product.  The packaging was ripped in many places. It is what it is, but it is annoying to not be able to use the cute box it came in (and not like I can sanitize the doll very well as it is cloth).  Gross",2.0
Not so happy. The whole bottom left side was torn. So now the book won't stay in it's place.,2.0
"Apparently my 4 year old is a much bigger skeptic than most. The tiny tag on the back of the Elf was the only thing it took for him to question the whole idea. We watched the movie before the Elf arrived and even after it was apparent he didn't think it was real, stuck it out for several nights. It didn't fly for us but I have heard from so many families for whom it is a wonderful family tradition. Sadly not us :-(",2.0
"My Grandson got this and because of the movie, he got this one, but all my Great Grands got one cheaper and IMHO better because the arms and legs were wire and extremely posable. However, my Grandson (9 yrs old) loved this elf and his Mom
and Dad had fun using the concept during the Holidays.",2.0
"The book is cute but the actual Elf is made with poor quality.  Not worth the price, you can follow the tradition with any other -cuter, better made- plush toy Elf.",2.0
"amazing that this sells for $30.  the elf is the cheapest toy I've ever bought- it's not positionable, and the arms don't open.  good marketing!!
my son believes he's real, but it didn't stop him from being bad!",2.0
I was expecting a boy elf and it was a girl elf. Too late to send back for it to be effective for Christmas.,2.0
Older version and it's face was dyed red from its outfit. Otherwise came in super fast and had the book.,2.0
The doll is terribly cheap. Cheap felt. A creepy plastic head on cheap felt. They didn't even bother to put a white ball on the tip of the cap to match the elf in the DVD and book. I had to sew one one. The elf has no feet and white stubs in place of hands. I don't know why everyone is complaining about lying about an elf when they lie about Santa Claus too. I'll ditch the book and just tell my kid that the elf comes to signal when Christmas is near. End of story.,2.0
"I Love the idea of this but didn't like the story. We will do the elf with our own version of the story without the naughty or nice aspect. I am not comfortable telling my child that santa will not come if he is ""naughty"". We will encourage striving for the ""nice"" behavior without threats. Is there really any parent out there who would actaully follow through with withholding presents in the case of undesirable behavior? I really hope not so why make the threat. Think intrinsic motivation not extrinsic...",2.0
"NOTE TO YOUNG READERS: I BELIEVE IN SANTA! The elf appears the day after Thanksgiving and is supposed to be used as a reminder for kids to be good, as the elf reports back to Santa every night. So it's marginally 'educational' in that we get the kids to behave slightly better than they may otherwise act. The toy is durable, however it has no feet, just stumps. What I struggle with is the amount of deception you have to go through. First of all, he's supposed to change locations...provided mom or dad remembers to move him...err, I mean he decides to view our family from a different angle (kitchen, LR, etc...). And he's used as a sort-of tool for good behavior, to be recognized on December 25 when Santa brings gifts. (Never touch the elf or he'll lose his magic!) Personally, I think it's a lot of work for an already magical holiday when we celebrate the birth of baby Jesus - and gifts from Santa Claus! 'Forget the elf' is my humble recommendation.",2.0
I feel this item was priced to high for what you get a book and a little elf what a rip off,2.0
"Highly overpriced Christmas gimmick toy.  Packaging is highly deceptive for the size of the stuffed doll.  Would not do it again, even as a gift.",2.0
"While I think that this could be a great family heirloom and tradition, I think that it is lacking a little bit of wiggle room for those of us with younger children.  My two children are 4 and nearly 2.
  The magic of Christmas only lasts a short while and starting traditions early is what makes me feel better about that fact.  This seems to be geared towards older children and I wish I had known that before-hand.  Also, the elf is downright creepy.  I got two of the plush elves and read the book only once.  When I read the part where by you are told not to touch the elves, both of my children looked at me whilst clutching the elves tightly.  I told them that I would send an email to Santa and make sure that they could, in fact, touch the elves (and sleep with them).
  I would make sure that you read the story before you share with your children and adjust where needed.  But I think overall this could be a better product and would not have bought it had I known.  We could have just bought the plush elves and told our own story!",2.0
I expected it to come with the stuffed elf.  The book is useless unless you have the elf and I  spent hours in stores trying to find the elf and never did.  Now I'm stuck with a book I could have gotten at a used book store for a lot less.  Definitely misrepresentation on this book!,2.0
I saw the movie for the first time this year and i never heard before of the elf on the shelf.  So when i read the book i was disapointed because It was mot the same drawing that my kids saw...maybe It should be r-fine so It would be more up to date....and the elf is  litle bit scary,2.0
"After watching the show on TV my 4 yr old daughter just had to have an Elf on the Shelf. So off to Target we go to buy one and I couldn't believe it cost $30! Well being X-mas and all we just didn't have that kind of money to spend on a book and toy elf so I had the pain staking job of disappointing her. But, my step father has an elf that has been in his family for years and he and my mom really wanted my daughter to have one so they purchased it for her. After opening it I can't get over now cheaply made the elf is and can't believe they charge that much for it. My step-fathers elf is so much better quality and actually sits up where you want it to. It's just really disappointing to me that they can't make these (cheaply made) things more affordable for families especially if they are going to make them so desireable to kids.",2.0
"I thought this would be a great idea for my 5 year old and 2 year old.  They both seem to really enjoy ""Hermie"", but I am very upset with the quality of this way overpriced item!  $30 for a book and a the felt elf.  My BIGGEST gripe is that the elf could never go on a shelf because the thing doesn't sit up! What the heck? The whole point is that he is supposed to move from spot to spot but he just falls over and unless propped up will not stay in a sitting position.  So he just is like a limp thing lying around.  In my opinion, very poor construction from the people who made this.  Book is cute and concept is cute-but they need a better elf!",2.0
"Not to be a scrooge, because the kids do have fun getting look for the Elf every morning. But as a parent, I have to warn other parents. Think of how much magic has to be conjured for this Elf to move every single night! Poor, hard-working Elf. It's a delicate house of cards to have Santa's magic tied with this guy. Resist!",2.0
"We heard about Elf on a Shelf from some friends and loved this concept!  I went to the Hallmark store and purchased one.  We loved the book but were so disappointed with the quality of the Elf.  It is not easy to place him somewhere without him tipping over.  He needs wire or something else to give him stability.  The Elf is just made of felt with some stuffing inside and a plastic face.  Since you have to place the Elf in a different area every day, I anticipate it will be frustrating since he will keep tipping over. We haven't shown the kids yet because we're thinking about returning it.  So disappointed.",2.0
"I received this book as a gift and am sad to say how creepy this book/toy is. The elf itself looks like something out of a horror movie...and I'm supposed to let it hang out in my house?! The book has beautiful illustrations, but the story is something else. This elf is supposed to spy on your kids no matter where they are, noting whether they have been good or bad, and report back to Santa. I believe that this is infringing on their rights to be kids. So what if they're bad once in a while...they're kids! Kids make mistakes and PARENTS should be the ones to teach them this, NOT some little toy! I'm all for traditions like Santa, but can do without the elf on the shelf.",2.0
"Okay, so I bought this last year assuming my kids would really enjoy it. ""Frankie"" started to freak them out after a couple of days.  Two of my girls 6 & 9 had nightmares!  Even in the spring they wanted to know if Frankie was in the attic.  lol I heard similar stories from a friend.  Good luck.",2.0
"The idea of the elf on the shelf is fabulous, and I have no problem with the author profiting from her great idea. That said, the book is very mediocre and definitely not worth the money. The elf itself, however, is better than getting an older knee-hugger elf and just going with the great idea (which was what I originally intended to do). I think the author should just sell the elves (with much less packaging) and a small brochure telling parents how to promote the idea, skip the book for kids, and reduce the price by $5.",2.0
"I'm so glad I only spent $20 on the two Kindle book versions and not $80 on the paper versions.  While the books have a lot of info, they are full of gaping holes and the organization is awful.  Finding material in these books is an effort unto itself.  By gaping holes, I mean the mechanics of many tasks are simply not there or you have to spend hours piecing it together.  Example:  While the vampire courts and powers are described, I could find no clear rules on how a vampire feeds.  I had to piece together the mechanics by reading all the related powers and then make a flowchart.  Casting spells caused our game to come to an abrupt halt for nearly an hour as the group tried to figure it out and even then, the GM had to simply wing it so we could move on.  For the most part, it is best to use Fate Core as your guide and then use this book for the flavor.",2.0
"Difficult to use in the eformat, as compared to the dead tree version.",2.0
"The game has potential, but it takes so long to play, there's too few cards in the deck for 4 people to play without shuffling several times, and the gameplay feels slow.  It doesn't play well at a party and the rules are not clearly defined (the use ""player"" a lot and a player could be the person with the card or the person who is having action performed on them).  Playing it with a group of 4 took about a half hour for the first round to be completed, after that we decided that it was best to change to a different game.

You're encouraged to put your cards face down on the table as you match what's rolled on the dice, but if you do that then when someone has a take card they know who to chose from since they have the most cards down.  Or are you bluffing?  Or if someone has a lot of cards face down and you have a chance to change the die, you'll know if it's a good or bad time to do so.

Overall I didn't have fun with this game and glad it was less than the price of a martini.  Avoid this one unless you need something to slow you down.",2.0
"Not what I had hoped. Boring for most participants. I have been through about half of the cards. So far, I haven't found your explanation of  the universal expression ""okay"".

"I was super excited to open up my Party Gras game at my party. I thought it would be a lot of fun but it was a little too simple to keep people interested. The entire premise of the game is you all start off with the same amount of beads and you pick a task from a limited amount of cards to try to get other people to do. If they do the task then you get their beads. There are not a lot of cards so if you want repetitive play it won't last long because you will have the advantage over everyone else because you will know all of the cards.  Many of the tasks are really simple and does not keep your attention so it gets boring really quickly. Also you must have 4 players to play this game so if you have a small family and just want to play it will not work.

This game is fun for a little but I think it is more suited to be an icebreaker game for people who want to get to know each other.",2.0
"When I broke out Party Gras for the first time, it seemed like it could be a fun addition to a party.  Just as quickly, people didn't care about the game and it broke up the flow.

The ""game"" is simple, you try to do tasks on cards and when you do, you get more Mardi Gras style beads.  Sadly, the game doesn't function as a game on its own and when combined with other games or a party, it simply becomes a hassle.  Essentially there will be one person really into it, going around collecting beads while ruining everyone else's attempt to enjoy the party.

It is a fine idea in theory, but the reality of playing it is rather painful.",2.0
"This game could really go either way.  It's pretty sill for the most party, so either you have to be drunk or be in that kind of silly fun mood for this to work.  Or you have to be 13.  Its not a game that you pull out at Thanksgiving for family fun.  And it definitely gets to be monotonous and boring.  There are better games than this.  that being said, since I have it, I will probably yank it out only if the mood of the the big party I'm throwing turns into something silly and for some reason we want to play a game.  Or if I'm trying to entertain middle schoolers.  So basically what Im saying is that it's likely not to get much action in my house...",2.0
The instructions are unclear on how to play the game. Basic knowledge of rules and regulations of football is a must. I purchased this game to spend more time with my son under 10 years of age. I don't know anything about sports. He loves football so this was an attempt to connect with him. I am book smart and thought not big deal instructions will help me. Wrong! To make this easier for those who have limited knowledge to no knowledge of football a step by step instruction guide would be extremely helpful. I attempted to you tube how to play and there are so many versions out there and many videos for other versions but only 15 plus minute video for this product and more a review than how to play.  I will continue to understand how to play the game so I can have the quality time I was looking for with my son.,2.0
It's kind of hard,2.0
I wouldn't buy this again. The rules are hard to understand and my son much prefers Rush Zone which is similar.,2.0
"It is too much luck and not enough of the outcome depends on the player's strategy

I expected more characters than the standard 5 found in the normal starter box.,2.0
"When they announced these stand-alone characters, I was both elated and worried about the end result. When the pricing game out, the worry increased. When these expansions were actually released, the elation was minimal.

First off, the actual game content. The mechanism for this character is interesting and is as fun as all the others from Red Dragon Inn 3. While I like the little player gimmick, I've always felt the original Red Dragon Inn 1 and 2 characters were more subtle in their flavor and not immediately obvious with their strategies like these more modern character decks. It's mostly a personal taste thing, but I would give it a 4 out of 5.

So why the 2 out of 5? Value for the money is pretty awful, as all the parts in this expansion are gimped. The player board is miniscule compared to the conventional boards. Gone are the nice red and clear fortitude/alcohol markers and now it's cardboard. Even the coins are gimped as they are smaller than the original game. While the Allies expansions seem like an inexpensive way to add a single extra player without having to buy another whole 4-player set, the extra player components are definitely 2nd class and no one playing the game wants to get stuck using these components. Plus, particularly with the gold, mixing the regular sized coins with these mini coins just makes a mess of the game flow, really. Some of these component decisions don't make sense at all because the mood marker is a glass drop!

The component quality of the base game is already somewhat marginal, especially in the cards themselves being rather lacking in springiness and zero texture and having a nasty curl right from unwrapping, so these additional cost cuts just really makes it feel like they've phoned it in. Add the insult of an Allies expansion costing almost 40% of what a full 4 player set costs and it is really an unacceptable gouge of RDI fans.

While the character IS fun, honestly it should be priced more around 20% of the full game price considering it's not any more advanced than the decks you get with RDI 3, has no drink deck, and includes components no one will want to use.",2.0
Wasnt that fun,2.0

"We haven't had that much success with games produced by North Star Games and Say Anything is no exception.  That's not to say the games are bad, they're just not a fit for our family.  The instructions are a bit ambiguous and there are too many variables.  How is anyone supposed to know which answer the judge will pick?  It's all a matter of personal opinion, which is constantly changing.  I don't think we'll be bothering with this game again.  It was frustrating for adults and children.",2.0

I am a Speech-Language Pathologist.  I personally love these cards.  They are fun and well made.  But I do not have one patient that likes these.  I'm not sure why.

"The quality of the game is good, and I like the artwork and color scheme chosen. But overall, the game is kind of boring. Yes, the rules are simple to understand, but because they are so simple, the game becomes boring very quick. There is no strategy involved. Played with a group of 4 people and we had to create some of our own house rules to add a bit more structure to the game. For those who like games that are competitive, this one probably isn't for you.",2.0
I took this to a local game night where we often play party games.  The rules seems so simple the group couldn't even grasp that it was a game.  We tried for a while with 4 of us and it just wasn't much fun.  I'll try again with a larger group to see if it's better but I wouldn't recommend this for small groups.,2.0
Some of the choices are silly,2.0
"So I bought this at Barnes & Noble, where it was shelved with the other ""adult"" games. It didn't say age range on the box so I kind of figured it would be similar to Cards Against Humanity. A little disappointed that it was more for kids! Should've read the Amazon reviews first.",2.0
"Our family of four got bored with the game within 10 minutes and didn't finish. My girls, ages 13 and 15, say Apples to Apples  (after which this game seems to be modeled) is more fun. While Awkward Moment sounds perfect for preteens and teens -- a ripe demographic for awkward moments -- it's just not that interesting.

Here's a random hand from the game:

Moment card = ""You're asked to tutor your classmates in algebra.""
Decider card = ""Easiest to do""

So....each player must lay down a card from their hand that represents the thing easiest to do in the ""moment"" of being asked to tutor classmates in algebra.

Here's my hand (I have to choose one of these cards):
1. ""I know you are, but what am I?""
2. ""Use E.S.P. and read minds.""
3. ""Your accent isn't fooling anyone.""
4. ""Bury your head in your textbook.""
5. ""Go walk 500 miles. Then go walk 500 more.""

I choose ""Bury your head in your textbook"" as the easiest thing to do. The decider of this round looks at all the submitted cards and chooses the winner. I end up winning the round. Ho hum.

Some of us tried to submit the funniest or most absurd or ironic choices, but the choices weren't that funny. For example, if I wanted to get silly, I guess ""Your accent isn't fooling anyone"" might be a candidate, but...

Here's another random hand:
Moment card = ""Lots of people at school make fun of a girl who likes to wear football jerseys.""
Decider card = ""Most unusual""

So players have to choose the most unusual response to people making fun of a girl at school who likes to wear football jerseys. My cards are the same as above, except for a new card (#4 below), which was drawn to replace the card I put down in the last hand.
1. ""I know you are, but what am I?""
2. ""Use E.S.P. and read minds.""
3. ""Your accent isn't fooling anyone.""
4. ""Cop an attitude and say,'Don't hate what you can't imitate.'""
5. ""Go walk 500 miles. Then go walk 500 more.""

I guess my most unusual response is to go walk 500 miles. Nobody has anything much more interesting.

In the midst of playing, my daughter asked if we could quit because it was boring....we did.

So...this game has great potential but it's not that interesting, funny, or amusing.",2.0
"OK. Let me clearly state: I have not even managed to play the game yet. However, I HAVE managed to superglue my thumbs to my eyelids.

In all seriousness... the ""assembly required"" for this game is ridiculous. I bought a game, not a model airplane. And some of the pieces (for example: the gunslinger) require the skills of a surgeon and/or a ton of luck in getting the teensy tiny little pieces to fit and glue and stay in place without dousing yourself in superglue.

Guys... what were you thinking? The game costs $85 or so--I'd rather pay an extra $10 and avoid having to buy superglue, clippers and a file, not to mention the crazy hours it takes to put all of these pieces together successfully.

Flying Frog Productions is local to Seattle, which I have taken pride in--this boneheaded decision re: the ""assemble them yourself"" miniatures is an embarrassment.

I hear the game is a lot of fun--I look forward to playing it someday... but right now, I'm so frustrated with trying to fit and glue the little figure's two arm pieces together properly without them falling off, I've lost the desire to play.

If I manage to actually play the game, I'll update my review.

You have been warned...",2.0

Unless you love mapping out combat. In which case, you'll need another game, or some other gamebooks.",2.0
"The game is a decent transhuman setting. The main issue is the authors' obvious political leanings preventing them from treating conservative and Christian subjects fairly. Such as presenting the Catholic Church housing Jupiter bloc as 'Space Nazis'

I don't like this board.  I love scrabble but this board is hard to work with.  It is annoying trying to get the tiles in the squares.  I would have returned it but I kept it for a long time before using it.  only used it once. it is not worth the money i paid,2.0

"A Scrabble game is pretty straight forward, not much can go wrong with it...however, I was surprised to discover how much smaller this version is in comparison to the traditional version...it's about one foot by one foot and the tiles are corrrspondingly smaller. Everything is also plastic. The game title - Tile Lock Scrabble - is a bit misleading as the tiles don't actually snap or lock into place which what I envisioned. There's little pieces of plastic that protrude on all four corners of each letter space that prevent the tiles from sliding around and that's certainly handy but if you pick the board up, say to move to a different location, you've still gotta keep the board flat and steady, otherwise the tiles will fall out, they're not actually locked in.

"Scrabble it is... locking tiles it isn't.  I guess I didn't catch the other review(s) saying the same thing.  Essentially it's good if you're playing on the couch or some unstable surface... but I don't know that it would qualify as a ""travel"" version.  The description clearly states it's ideal for playing scrabble in the car, plane, train, etc. -- if the tiles were magnetic and the board folded, yes it would be perfect travel edition.  If the tiles actually locked in place, it would be an ideal travel board.

As it is -- the locking tiles allow you to tilt the board at various angles (but not far past 45 lest the tiles start falling out).

Only other minor gripe is the drawstring bag is a little skimpy if you also plan to put the tile holders (red long rectangles) in with the tiles.... it's literally 1/4"" too short to safely secure everything.  I wouldn't trust it with my kids packing it up... unless they put the pouch in a ziplock.",2.0
"Tiles don't lock. They prevent sliding around, but it is far from ""locking"" as the title would lead you to believe. My parents have one that truly ""Locks"" so you can even hold it upside down and the tiles stay in place. We used that one all the time and would take it with us when we traveled, still mid-game. We thought that's what this one was, but the title is misleading. Disappointed.",2.0
"This is the cheaply made version of Scrabble.  Cheap cardboard, cheap plastic, even the tiles are not the same tiles as in the classic game--apparently made to fit the ""tile-lock"" setup.  I was very disappointed.  The outer box ripped when I took off the plastic wrapping.  All around: Not made to last.",2.0
It was MUCH smaller than I expected.  Had to return it.,2.0
"I confirm what other reviewers have said. The tiles are tiny and hard to handle, as the ""locking"" is achieved by corner pegs instead of a sunken place so it is not easy to get the tiny, lightweight, slippery tiles into the square. The letter holders are tiny and tend to get knocked over easily if jiggled or if you try to pick them up. The bag is so small that my normal, male hand cannot get into it to pick letters much less put them away very easily. The bag is made of some synthetic that resists flexing, so you need a rubber band to ensure the letters won't spill out in the box. All in all, tiny and cheap. Sure, it is also inexpensive, but next time I'll spend more for a game that I will own for a long time.",2.0
"I purchased this thinking it would do as the box states and hold the tiles in place. It doesn't. Every time you attempt to lay down a new word the existing tiles on the board ""buckle"" up and pop around making every move tedious and time consuming as it takes small fingers to places the tiles back perfectly. Please see pictures I have included. The tiles are plastic and the letters aren't centered which is not a big deal to me. However when playing the first word,  Gone as soon as I laid down the O the G popped up. When fixing the G the O popped out. The pictures will show what I mean. I wish I hadn't been cheap and would have ordered the Deluxe Scrabble with wooden tiles and the elevated plastic tile lock board. This isn't worth the money. It's not even a step up from the flat board that doesn't hold the tiles, as this is a constant game of popping tiles back in that have already been played.",2.0
"Should have read the review....this board and tiles are TINY. Also, they don't really ""lock"" into place.",2.0

I have owned several versions of scrabble and prefer turnstile boards hands down.  I do think a board that locks would be nice, especially around children, but the only version that truly does this is the travel one.",2.0

"Really disappointed after using this game this week. We took it on a trip and tried playing in the back seat of our truck. The Scrabble pieces do not stay in the so-called ""tile lock squares"". Even when we played at a table they got knocked out very easily and are difficult to put back. Will probably not use again so feel like I wasted my money!",2.0
"Smaller board than expected. Plastic tiles, not wood.",2.0
"Based on the name ""Tile Lock Scrabble"" I thought the tiles would actually lock in place, perhaps lightly snap on to the board, but these tiles don't lock on at all.  Instead there are little raised dots on the corners of each square on the board.  Each tile has indentations molded into the corners.  You place a tile on the board and it rests between the dots.  The deluxe edition scrabble board has bezels between the squares that serve pretty much the same purpose as the dots do on this one (but it's twice as much as this one.)  The instructions say that the tiles will stay in place even if the board is tilted, which is absolutely true, but they will not stay in place if the board is bumped or jostled even a little.  The slightest bump and the tiles dance right off their squares.

It says on the box that it's perfect for travel, but I can't think of travel situation where the board might get tilted, but not bumped: certainly not a plane, or a car, or a boat, or on the beach, or on the grass.  And the board is bigger than a laptop and doesn't fold, so it's not exactly compact.

I don't think they should bill this as being good for travel and they should definitely lose the ""tile lock"" nonsense.  This is a good basic, inexpensive, scrabble board for kids or for someone who wants a scrabble board but doesn't want a full sized one.  It is better than just the flat board with no guides to hold the letters in place (the Super Scrabble for five dollars less,) but to call this a travel board is a stretch.",2.0
"I never played many board games when I was younger, but one that I always wanted to try out was Scrabble. This Tile Lock version is the first time I've played it and if anything, it makes me want to give the basic version a shot. The board is tiny, the locking feature doesn't work, and maybe it's just me but there doesn't seem to be enough letter blocks if you want to play with more than one other person.

Playing the game is fun and all, it's just weird that this is billed as a locking version when the feature barely works. If you even barely bump into the table the board rests on, pieces will move. I can't imagine playing this in the car unless you were on a long stretch of smooth road with zero bumps or rocks of any kind.

This is one that we won't be playing much in the future, and I plan on getting a standard Scrabble since it can't be any worse than this. The game itself is fun, not the presentation.",2.0
It was not quite what I expected and is difficult to get the tiles into place.,2.0

My eyes aren't the greatest anymore, so having to strain to read what's on the board is not something I enjoy doing. Sorry, Scrabble, but you could do better than this.

You have to struggle to get the word on the board and heaven forbid if you have to lift a letter to see what score box you are on - all of the adjoining letters will flip out - needless to say it takes the fun out of it. We had a set that had wooden tiles for 27 years and ended up losing letters (and some of the letters were so worn that they were partially deteriorated).

First, although it cost less than in the department stores through Amazon, (I think I paid aroung $19.00), I noted a few days after Christmas it had been marked down to $8.00! The board is quite small, and the small tiles hard to handle. The ""tile lock"" consists of small pins, which are again difficut to manouver the tiles into. Once this item is returned, will order a larger edition with the usual tile ridges and a turntable base.",2.0
"I do like that you can place the tiles in place and they won't slide, but the board is cheap and with a 4 and 5 year old that we are teaching to play and spell, I can see this board not lasting long.  Educationally, it'll work for us, but I wish I had bought the more durable deluxe version.",2.0

This is really just a standard card deck with different pictures. It's not really a new game or anything. Just look up the rules for wizard and use regular cards than wasting your time on this.,2.0
"Just like 3-stars says: It's okay.

Not a serious gamer, nor am I a veteran gamer. But if I wanted to be, this would NOT be the entry-level one I'd recommend to anyone. Pieces are hard to assemble, and are VERY fragile once assembled. You HAVE to have some kind of foam case or other storage medium to place these in that stops ALL movement while transporting. Something will break. I'm not interested in forking out $80-$100 for the actual case, so I haven't even assembled half the mecha. The publisher would have been far better off creating minis that were at least preassembled. I didn't even need them prepainted, just preassembled. Heck, even WizKids gave me a bunch of unpainted but assembled minis for Star Trek: Fleet Captains... and I got a TON more cards and much better rules. And I bought FC two months later and have played it three times as much!

The rulebook is pretty... bordering on beautiful. But half of the information in it is, quite honestly, absolutely useless. I don't need a dozen pages telling me about the history of Robotech, nor do I need the same number of pages telling me the stats for the mecha that the game cards do. It's redundant, and that redundancy came at a cost. The cost was not only a more expensive book to produce, but all that text could have been dedicated to a better explanation of the rules.

And I'll throw out the same thing lots of people have issues with: the color-codes. Please tell me why hex#'s were used, if only to further confuse an already bewildered player.

What should they have done:

1. Preassembled minis... or ones that are only 2 or 3 pieces (and totally ignored the ""let's have a ton of pose options"").
2. Better instructions for the assembly of those minis.
3. More well-discussed rules that take into account:
  a. Beginner/Entry Level
  b. Intermediate
  c. Advanced gamers
4. Posted half the manual to their website (for brevity in the rulebook, and it would have drawn more customer interest to their site)
5. Actually had all the Kickstarter Waves ready to go at rollout (or even half of them!) Super VF? SDF-1? ELINTS?
6. Used better materials in the construction of their minis (brittle plastic is not good for things your are going to be handling a lot).
7. Hired a company to produce (manufacture, not design) the minis that actually produces quality minis for a living.
8. (Seemingly) Cut costs to send out a substandard product with the Robotech name on it.",2.0
"I was really excited for the new Robotech RPG, however after getting the box set and attempting to assemble the miniatures included, I was met with one headache after the other. Many of the miniatures have between 9-25 parts to assemble, the parts are unlabeled and instructions for assembly are lacking at best, and at worst appear to be for an earlier version of the model. There are several other issues involved with the miniatures (such as pieces that are so small that you cannot remove them without their breaking no matter the care you put into removing them) but I don't care to mention all of them here. If you're not an experienced modeler or have incredible patience you may find yourself giving up on the models before actually getting to play the game. Once you actually get into the game you'll be met with a few other frustrations. There's little to no customization available to make you're own squads and you're limited to the squads included. I personally would like to customize my squads using models and units I wish to use but it just doesn't appear possible with the current state of the game. The game itself plays well once you get into it, but it just doesn't make up for the glaring issues which really should have been noticed in play testing. I really hope some of these issues are addressed in the future but as it is I cannot recommend this product.",2.0
"Very disappointing. If you expect to get this, open the box and start playing, you will have an unpleasant surprise. First, it is not a ""board"" game, it is a table top wargame. It comes with no terrain and no scale listed for terrain. (After having pulled out my railroad scale ruler, they are about 1/300th or about half N Scale size, this puts them around 8mm scale. Not much chance of finding good pre-made terrain). The figures are models on sprues, worse than Kings of War for unnecessarily making the model in way too many parts. So far the assembly guide has been wrong once and I've only managed 3 figures ""mostly done"" in as many weeks. (I've put 3 boxes of KoW together and complete in less time).  Edges often don't match up leaving raised lines or gaps. The mount points are often placed in bad alignment and the model leans like a drunken sailor. They should warn you to paint them before assembling, as painting afterward is nearly impossible due to the scale. But if you do then any paint on the aligning posts and holes needs to be removed or they may not fit. I'm not sure but the Veritechs are possibly wrong as well. Mine came with 5 fighter mode, 5 Guardian mode and 3 sprues that look like 6 battloid modes, 3 with flight stands and 3 without, meaning you have extra guardian and fighter figures (2 each) that you can't use.(or an extra Battloid if you're not picky). Worst of all is they use standard model decals (transfers), most of which are so small it'll be hard to cut them out without cutting another next to it.
The rules are pretty simple but scattered and poorly organized. Cards are nicely glossy for erasable markers, but come in 3 different sizes and 5 types making storage problematic. Had they had these done as pre-made, pre-painted models for a few dollars more, it would have been a good quick-play game. As is, unless you enjoy putting difficult models together, I'd say it was a waste of money.",2.0
"Short impressions:  Game is okay.  It captures Robotech flavor / feel.  And if it was JUST the rulebook, I would give it 4-stars.  But the models have questionable design decisions, it is NOT new comer friendly, you are looking at hours and hours of work just to get it to the point you can play with everything in the box (that that doesn't include painting the figures) and frankly, support, communication, and the companys ethics are horrible.  An awful serious of poor decisions from a veteran game company and atrocious attention to making a game appealing to a wider audience, makes this a hard-to-recommend game except for die-hard miniature hobbyists and Robotech fans.  And even then, you may never actually get enough of it assembled to play with it.

Full disclosure here:

I was an original backer that bought a Reckless backing through Kickstarter plus another $500 of add-ons, including the battle foam cases, and numerous items coming out in Wave 2.  That means I have nearly or over $1000 invested in this game thus I have a strong interest in wanting it to succeed.  Unfortunately, the product, and company doesnt deserve backers like me, and this company doesnt deserve your dollars.

Now, if you want my detailed review on the issues proceed.  Unfortunately I can't break out just the problems with the game and product without also talking about the poor decisions and ethics by the company that contributed to all the problems with this game.

I get that stuff happens when a business venture goes way beyond your wildest dreams.  Palladium Books had one of the best, if not best ever, kick starter successes and was able to get the game funded way beyond what was every expected.  That led to delays as the scope expanded.  Got it.  Nearly two years and counting worth of delays now...the project wasn't THAT successful, and Palladium being a small company, with this sort of success, it should have considered either expanding a little or making the development of this game its number one priority.  Obviously neither happened.

However, to their credit, not being a miniatures game company PB brought in experts (Ninja Division [ND] with a great reputation, fantastic games and wonderfully designed miniatures) to help them, and either ND decided they didn't want a competitor with their own products and gave Palladium Books [PB] bad advice, or PB decided to take the ND advice and blow it out their ear.  I speculate it was the latter.

Product models:

The packaging (or lack thereof) consists of loose plastic sprues with small items packaged in loose bags that roll around the too-large box.  That results in numerous broken pieces upon arrival since it was shipped from China.  Three of my four boxes of game had some damage to the plastic model parts.  Now mine were also shipped to an APO, so that might have made a difference as well, but  I expect yours will have breakage as well given 75% of what I have opened has.

The models are poorly designed, very hard to build properly without specialized tools, and take a lot of care to build.  No just snap clicking these bad-boys together.  You better have some good sprue cutters, plastic glue, files, and putty if you want them to look okay.  Frankly it would have been better for PB to go with the Wizards of the Coast model and just do pre-painted models despite the backlash from the die hard core miniature fansif PB actually wanted someone to buy the game who was not a model hobbyist with nothing but hours free time on their hands to build the basic materials required to play the game.  Most of us have schools, jobs, families, or all three.  Gaming comes in somewhere distantly after that.

Unlike what I would wager the majority of people associated with the Kickstarter, I have a plastics design degree from CalPoly San Luis Obispo.  I am sure the information PB pushed to the backers on the design of the figures was told to them by the Chinese company they actually chose to make the models (you can check out the information by looking for Robtech Tactics Kickstarter Updates on your favorite search engine); but the models are horrible in terms of design and layout with questionable decisions everywhere.  Very indicative of using a Chinese company that doesn't do this sort of model design regularly - likely some cheap small firm that produces junk toys for dollar stores.  Some of the injection runner locations are in exactly the worst spots possible.  There is totally lack of any sort of numbering or pairing system on sprue parts.  Three are parts to different models on the same sprue.  There are small, easily breakable parts when you are removing them, and a high piece counts.  Very dense plastic that is difficult to cut without professional tools.  Combine all these problems with a lack of any detailed assembly instructions for models that have multiple configurations and posing options and putting together the models is going to feel more like a 3D Puzzle than a game you are excited to play.  (Incidentally, the lack of any part labeling or pairing on the sprue is the first time I have seen that oversight with a plastic model with this many parts and non-interchangeable parts to the same model, and I have been putting together plastic models since the mid-eighties).  At one point PB suffered a needless delay in development because they had provided 3D renders of the models in the wrong format to the Chinese company doing the mold design.

These are novice choice, not even what I would call high school level design decisions, let alone professional level decisions, which is what should have come out from a company as old as Palladium, especially since they had ND - they guys that do this regularly - doing it for them.  That tells me at some point ND was overridden or taken out of the process, also indicative of a firm that doesn't value outside input from experts, a fact that reflects throughout the product and their way of doing business.
For a game that uses multiple similar looking figures, there is no method identified or provided to label what figure goes to what force card, and no built-in labeling on the bases, so on again, you are left on your own to figure out 1) how to label each identical model, and two, get that label associated on and to the force card that you track upgrades and ammunition on.
Once you get the pieces together (for most people I estimate that will be about 10-15 hours for assembly depending on your skill and patience) they are well detailed and look very nice.  However, they will still need painting unless you just want to play with unpainted figures.  Desperate as you are to just play this point, you might.

Quality control on the plastic was lacking.  The blast templates were supposed to be transparent blue, with the lettering painted white, but apparently they didn't get painted.  Why PB didn't send them back to the company and have them redone, or have the company redo them for free and send the fixed ones out is beyond me  unless PB forgot to tell the company making them they were supposed to have the white highlights.  I cant believe PB would allow a company to produce something that was not what they ordered, unless PB ordered it wrong to start with.  Without the white writing where the information is molded into the template, it makes reading the blast template difficult.  Also, the special faction dice have serious issues with the pips and figures being mis-or-over painted.  Some of dice are more random than others.  In particular the Zentradi dice like to role the same number over-and-over again in a 100 roll unscientific test I did.

Rulebook:

The rulebook looks very pretty.  That is about the best I can say about it.  The layout scatters a lot of the information you need throughout the work, and there is no consolidated lists of modifiers or summary of rules, so that makes getting your arms around the particulars a bit hard, especially when you KNOW there is a rule that covers your situation, or modifier, and you cant find it in the blocks of text.

The rules themselves are just okay.  Not bad, not great.  The rules are fairly traditional and straight forward.  My 12 year-old had no problems figuring out how to play once I showed her.  There are no surprise mechanics or awesome new ideas.  Just tried-and-true solid game design choices.  Uninspiring, but hard to screw up.  Nothing to get real excited about, but nothing to really criticize as well, except the amount of record keeping required to keep track of missile ammunition on cards that are not well laminated (they are really just normal glossy stock and not upgraded to laminated cards that backers were promised.  The force cards are way-way too small for us older folk to use comfortably.  I have scanned them all in and made them much larger, and I am debating just redesigning the record keeping cards completely to make them easier to use.  This is something play testers should have noticed.  Of course we don't know what the play testers did and did not notice because PB never shared that information with the backers to let them weigh in on it, not that they cared what the backers said anyway, if you read the comments in the updates.
Where the rules completely fail is they have the worst Army building system rules ever not published in a book (please tell me how you put together an Army without values published in the rulebook?  Where are the instructions on how to use the cards included with the game and instructions on what all those little blank colored space are for on the force cards, and how the information on the force cards are laid out.  Heck only reason I knew there were special rules for each faction is because I read the draft of the rules which originally had all that information, instead of printed in 7 point font on one card each in the pile of force cards).  If you lose a card that has the point values and possible upgrades for each mecha, or that card is destroyed by pizza, soda, or the family dog, good luck, because that information is nowhere else in the rules.  Worse, some of the figures you can make from the parts in the box don't even have point values associated with them or cards to go with them, so you cant actually field them in an army.

Unforgivable.

Heck, design 101:  PB could have put in a glossary in the rule book.  In zero places in the rules does it define or even talk about what two key terms that show up in the game are: ""MD"" and ""MDC"".  Those abbreviations are Mega-damage and Mega-damage Capacity respectively.  You all know that, right?  No?  Oh.  I thought you might not.  I only knew that because I played PB games in the late 80's and early 90's in high school and PB draws heavily on those roleplaying games for Robotech Tactics, where those terms are originally found.  Imagine the frustration a new comer is going to feel looking for the meaning of terms not even defined anywhere but are critical for playing the game.

The balancing issues for the forces (once you figure out how to build an Army) are atrocious based on the current point system.  How this made it through play testing, I know not.  PB dosent even provide sample armies in the book.  Helpfully they do provide a couple of scenarios to get started, but having played all those multiple times now, those appear to have balance issues as well
There are typos all through the book.  Typos.  Really?  Not one or two, but large numbers of annoying typos.  This is Palladium 2014, not Kevin Siembieda (founder and president of PB) working with a type writer out of his garage in the 1980s.  PBs list of play testers was so extensive; at least a couple of them probably could have been tapped into to read a couple sections each for errors, unless the play testers were all junior high school kids, which would make sense given the atrocious amateur decisions made throughout the design and production of this game.

The book contains a nifty full-color painting guide with references to the actual standardized color value for each models paint job.  But, does it tell newcomers what those random strings of numbers next to the figures in the back are for (the paint codes) and do all those paint codes actually correspond to real paints produced by real miniature paint companies?  No.  Many of the numeric color codes they reference correspond to no commercially manufactured miniatures color that I can find, and I have been making and painting fantasy and sci-fi miniatures since 1990.  I mean, I don't even know what to say about that oversight, except sloppy, very sloppy.  A good critical proofread would have fixed these sort of issues.

That completes my review of the physical product.  Can all the flaws be overcome?  Yes.  Can the models be built and look great?  Yes.  Should a newcomer buy this. No. No. And NO.  Does this company deserve your dollars.  Absolutely not.  I will never back or buy another Palladium project or product again.

I also believe however, that when you buy something, you are not just buying that product, your dollars are supporting a company and the people that run it and make decisions, and what for that I feel I need to review the companys approach to this product, so you as a potential consumer can decide if this is the type of company you want to support with your money.  No review of a product so horribly mismanaged as this one can be complete without some comments on the manufacturers development.

There are numerous times throughout the kickstarter PB revised what backers were told or played games ""like the GenCon vote"" that appeared rigged for them to get the result they wanted (a missing vote counts as a yes???...I would like to see THAT at the American polls [breaking news tongiht:  All registered voters affiliated with a party that didn't show up to vote automatically counts as a vote toward that party's ticket).  Again, maybe that is not what it was, but that is how it APPEARED.

More missteps. They admitted to using VOLUNTEERS to ship the product.  What is this, a small non-profit charity organization pushing out meals to the homeless?  PB couldn't even forecast that it was going to have to hire some temp help to ship this stuff?  Who is making these business decisions (actually it was great  why pay for what free labor will do  it works for sweat shops to.)  If I was a volunteer, I would be wondering why I am volunteering to ship something for a company that DOES mail order for a living???!!!  I bet you THOSE volunteers got some compensation.  It would be hilariously ironic if one of them didn't even back the project but got a boxed set as ""thanks"" before the majority of Robotech Tactics own backers did.

Any my biggest complaint is 2/3d's or more of these issues could have been resolved with better communication from Palladium and by them making better choices (like going with a company that makes these sorts of models all the time - like the one Ninja Division uses, whose models are generally designed excellent) and keeping their promises first and foremost.

For those of you who don't know, only about half of the game is finished.  Being such a big project, much bigger than PB expected, they finally somewhere along the way, figured out they were going to have to split the development up.  So, where are ANY recent Wave 2 updates?  It has been nearly a month now since any information at of any substance from PB on anything Robotech Tactics related at all.  Going a month between updates is frankly unprofessional.

Trolling the old updates, where is the Mirya Queadluun-Rau with removable cockpit at in the design process (Update 62, 14 May 2013) or status on the SDF-1 exclusive that should be over 70mm tall (Update 84, 20 May 2013) or the SDF-1 special bases we unlocked (same update)?

PB seems to gone very silent on any progress, and Chinese company's don't celebrate Christmas, so they can't really use that as an excuse, unlike the Chinese New Year delay they used last year.

There are numerous reasons WHY PB may not have been able to be as transparent as it should have been (mostly related to what they can/can not disclose prior to approval by Harmony Gold who controls the license).  However, PB COULD have told us about THOSE restrictions.

I could go on, but the point is made.  And while these may seem like small gripes, together they are indicative of a company that doesn't care about its base and doesn't have enough professionalism to do things correctly, a company that takes shortcuts. It is evident in this product.

The game does nothing to promote entry by newer audiences and in fact with all the required model building and painting, frankly turns them away.  Since the game isn't designed to be played competitively under the current rules, I see this set going about as far as the game is going to go.  At the price point for the box set, and unfriendliness of the models and rule book, I don't see it selling well, and I don't see the cycle continuing.  And that is too bad, because I was looking forward to a Southern Cross and Invid Invasion set (which at this scale, I am not even sure how you could do Invid Invasion with models like these as most of the mecha will be about 20-25mm tall).

Does the game get some things right?  Yes.  Is it playable?  Yes.  Is the book beautiful? Yes.  Does this game do anything to sustain itself?  No.  Like Battleship Galaxies, it will likely be a great concept that dies with no support.",2.0
"Overall, it's OK.

The Good:  The book is layed out well and looks good.  The rules are straightforward and easy to follow.  The game plays fast and smooth.  The main box contains a good variety of models to field one small force of each faction.  The models, when built, look fair enough.  They look like the mecha from the show....but there is room for improvement.  This game is a good value for your money.  In the end- its a fun game!

Needs improvement:  The models are over-engineered.  There are some pieces that could have been combined to cut down on the part count without sacrificing much detail.  The layout of some of the cuts also needs to be rethought- there are bad seams that require filling and sanding if you want flat areas to actually be flat.  Some of the parts are *VERY* small and *VERY* fragile.  Could be intimidating or difficult for novice modelers.  The information found on the unit cards should also be in the book.

The Terrible:  This game was a Kickstarter project by Palladium Books.  During the pledge period, Palladium Books (PB) promised MANY addition models that backers could order in addition to the box set.  After the game was running late, PB announced that they would produce the game in two ""waves"".  Wave 1 would be the core game and all of the associated models.  Wave 2 would be ALL of the other models that were promised in the Kickstarter campaign.  Wave 1 was eventually finished and delivered in late 2014 (1 year later than anticipated during the Kickstarter) and that is what you get in this game.  As of today (Dec 31 2017) Wave 2 has yet to enter production.  The most recent indications from PB are that they are still ""Getting quotes"" from Chinese manufacturers but the reality is that they do not have the money nor intention of ever building the models promised in wave 2.

In conclusion, if all you want is the game in THIS BOX... its ok.  Not great, but not a waste.  The rules are decent and the models are passable  but are not as good as other miniature games such as Warhammer 40K or Age of Sigmar or Warmachine or X-Wing.  If you want to play stuff beyond this basic box, then know that there is no support nor hope of ever getting anything beyond what you get here.  There is also very little community to play this game with, so finding someone to play against may be difficult.  Just beware of what you are getting into.",2.0

"I was also disappointed with this puzzle, which my husband gave me for Christmas.  While the puzzle-building itself was enjoyably challenging, I was fortunate to be finishing it in a bright room in broad daylight.  There were many dark colored pieces that had nuanced shading, but I never would have been able to see them without the bright natural light.  Artificial light caused glares on the pieces, so it would have been very frustrating to complete.

As for the  mystery aspect, I was more than disappointed.  Yes, I also guessed the ending without building the puzzle, but I can live with that.  The real problem is that anyone with any knowledge about the Titanic, or any knowledge about history in general, will be frustrated with both the storyline and its correlation with the puzzle.  I'm all for suspension of disbelief (like the fact that the puzzle's recent release means that the main character would have been four years old when the Titanic sank,!), but there's no reason to miscorrelate things.  For example, and a very mild spoiler, there is a mink stole in the story that is depicted as a fox stole in the puzzle.  Why?  Additionally, one of the key (and someway senseless) details that you are supposed to ""discover"" in the puzzle picture is so dark that I couldn't even distinguish it.  I would love to add more, but I do hate to put in spoilers.

In summary, while the puzzle's coloration was slightly frustrating, I found myself berating the author and puzzlemakers' lack of attention to detail, both historical and practical.",2.0

Product came cracked on the outer layer and not the protective layer that houses the batteries. I noticed it once the batteries were in and I was setting the screws. My son was already intrigued so I went ahead and gave it a go but I don't expect this product to last long.

While these are adorable- they are not finger puppets.  There is no a place to slide your finger into..... Unless you are supposed to wrap the monkeys arms around your fingers? But that looks weird.

"Big fan of the movie. (I guess that would be the main reason anyone orders this). Straight out of the box, it feels cheap. The cards are on really light stock and feel fragile when you handle them. The player pawns (card-board stand-ups) don't fit together correctly and will not stand up unless you extensively modify them. We just layed them down on the card/space they were on.

All the cards are based on things from the movie, so there is much fun in shouting out the lines as the cards are played: ""The Cliffs of INSANITY!"", but that fun goes away pretty quickly. The rules don't quite explain exactly how to play... There are a lot of holes. I get the feeling that they created the game, but when they wrote up the rules, they forgot to include some of the rules they were playing by. An example of play would have gone a long way to help.

If a tile requires an object to enter it, do you discard the item to enter it or just show it? If you discard on your last action, can you move in on your next? If you discard and then get moved by another player, does the play still count? These questions came up over and over in our play and the rules didn't address them. So we had to come up with house rules. So instead of enjoying the game, we spent most of the time trying to decide how the game was supposed to be played.

We used these cards and came up with a fairly enjoyable game, but I'm not sure how much our game has in common with the way it was supposed to be played. But the creators didn't really let us know how it was supposed to be played. If I had downloaded this game and printed it out myself I would have not been disappointed, but paying for the cheap components and loosely written rules annoyed me greatly.

I would avoid this one.",2.0
"Just play the computer game.  This game is long, contains hundreds of little cardboard bits (but not enough of certain ones), and has way too many rules.  If you like games with those values, it is a good game.  I didn't find it particularly enjoyable.  The rules are VERY well crafted, there were no ""rule says this, no it doesn't"" fights.  For as many as there are, they were straight forward and easy to understand.  But good mechanics do not change the tedious nature of the game play.  We spent 6 hours playing the 30 rounds of the game, and I left before the PVP section started.

One thing that really needs to change is the way the blue monsters are handled.  Only quests give you anything and blue monsters aren't associated with quests, so everyone avoids them and they become pointless roadblocks everywhere.

For the price, the minis should have been painted.  They are well sculpted but many were badly molded and trimmed.  The Wizards minis are farm better quality.

This game is made by the same company that did Arkham Horror, and they are rather similar.  WOW has better rules, but Arkham Horror is far more fun (subjectively speaking, that one still takes forever too but I enjoy it much more).",2.0

"Pros:
-More Arkham Horror cards and locations.
-More Ancient Ones.
-More Characters.
-The Elephant Gun (+8 att, $1 to reload).
-Introduces Guardians to make Arkham a little easier,
-Very manageable encounter cards,
-It's actually pleasant to leave a character in Kingsport.

Cons:
-At least 1 character must babysit this board to keep rifts from opening and other than that there is no reason to be there.
-No gates open on this board.
-It's extremely rare a clue appears in Kingsport.
-The board is made out of thinner cardboard from the rest of the games and feels cheap and moves if you breath on it.
-All the new monsters are hard, increasing the chances you draw hard monsters from the cup.
-The Reporter character starts the game cursed and only can be un-cursed by becoming blessed, by far the worst character in the game.

Final Thoughts:
We love Arkham and we're happy to have this expansion, but its not my favorite and this board will be the first one we remove if we need the space.  The Rifts mechanic is alright they open and move on the board like a monster, you don't go in them and when they move they spawn a monster and add a Doom Token.  The Rifts are an annoyance, when open really accelerate how fast the game ends. I wonder if the creators actually played this board, it really feels separate and waste of a character just to have them babysit the Rift Track because other than that they can't help the other characters win the game. The box to the feel of the boards feels like it was made from a different manufacturer from the rest, from the board to the packaging it just feels cheaper.  This was hard to find and we paid $49.99 at the local game game shop but its not worth anymore than that unless your a crazed Arkham fan.",2.0
"Ideally, when a company creates a new edition of a game, it should be better.  The reality is that they have made all of the pieces of this game cheaper, smaller, and less interesting.  If you can find an original edition, this would be a FAR better choice.  Let the buyer beware:  This new version will not work well with the expansion games.  The cards and boards are different sizes, the symbols are different, the characters and ring are cheap cardboard cut-outs.  There are no improvements here.  It is a good game, but I would recommend that you avoid this new edition if you possibly can.  At the very least, do not buy it with the expansion packs, because you will be frustrated that they do not match and as a result they do not work well together and make this already complicated game needlessly more complicated.  I am returning my copy and buying the older edition.",2.0
"Meh, this isn't really role playing, and isn't much of a game.  I'd look elsewhere.",2.0
"As noted in my other relevant game reviews, I'm I am always looking for games I can play with my fiance.  She is what some would call a ""reluctant gamer"" whereas I am an avid gamer, so I have be careful about what games I introduce her to.  She prefers games that rely at least a little on luck (i.e., not all strategy) and aren't too complex (i.e., where you can learn/remember the mechanic after a game or two), whereas I love strategy and complexity but don't mind a little luck. We also like games you can finish in a single session (or games you can play multiple times in a single session) This game fit the bill perfectly.

Based on what I've read about this game on Amazon and BoardGameGeek this one seemed like a real contender.  And, there were many things we liked about this game.  We liked the theme -- you really feel like you are going on a journey (and that you got to play familiar characters and see lots of familiar faces and places along the way), the fact that it is cooperative, and the fact that we hadn't played anything quite like it before. And, I know lots of other people enjoy the game, and I by no means mean any disrespect to them by giving it a two star rating.

But, after playing it twice with her (and a third time with two gamer friends), we all felt the exact same way... it just didn't feel very enjoyable to us. Most of the game play was good but not great (probably 3.5 stars), but the ending was main problem. After all your hard work (and assuming you are lucky enough to get to the end in the first place), whether you win or lose often comes down to a simple dice roll. This was very anticlimactic. No game should end that way.

Given that there are also ways to lose along the way (in fact, it is quite possible you'll never get to the end... which was not a big problem as seeing how far you get each time can be a worthwhile challenge in and of itself), it seemed to us that if you get to the end something besides a random dice roll should determine the outcome of the game. At best (if things went very well along the way), you may get to make multiple dice rolls which can increase your chances of winning. But, ultimately a dice roll will decide your fate.",2.0
"This is my first board game review on Amazon and I'm starting from the bottom. I bought this game based on the reviews and praise from friends who enjoy many types of board games. I played it with two fellow gamers who are experienced players and none of us liked it. I thought we might have been playing it wrong and I was willing to give it another chance and tried the 1st edition (with the Sauron expansion) with another gaming group and found the same problems.

The difficulty level is too high for me. I like a challenging game...we play Pandemic constantly and lose all the time on Legendary difficulty (we beat it once though) but this one seems pointless. Using pandemic as an example again, we can see what choices we made and how different ones could have affected the outcome, but with LoTR, the random elements of the game are limited. Teamwork is important, but the random card drawing and tile drawing make any extended strategy useless.

I always try to find positives about a game: The components seem well made, but are less impressive than the original version. Also, you can play a hobbit named Fatty.

I want to like this game. I really do. I just don't. There are better co-op games out there.",2.0
the rules of this game are to hard to figure out.they need to have basic instructions along with the detailed ones. We tried to make up our own rules but got frustrated.,2.0
"I had high hopes for the basic game, Arkam Horror. I tried to play it with a friend who loves Cthulu stuff and is a big time gamer. At first we thought it just wasn't that much fun for two, but playing two characters each didn't improve the game. Even though both of us enjoy complex games, the randomness and repetitiveness of the actions, complicated by the vague rules and numerous negative cards, killed our interest.

When I saw that they had released an expansion set, supposedly one with a better rule system, I bought a copy to surprise my friend with for his birthday. I sent him home with both games and we agreed he would study the rules and bring it back a week later so we could play with another long time gamer.

When we met to play the game, the news was not good. My friend had found the rules to be no better and the cards even worse than the first edition. I had to agree. Determined to have some fun, we struggled through the long setup process (around 30 minutes to separate everything out which should give you an idea of how difficult play is!!) and began to play. Immediately the same issues surfaced.

The characters were just as weak as in the previous games. My character spent all of her time running and could never use her powers because her initial spells all required other spells to work. Another character got very strong and we kept feeding him spells and other items so he could defend us, but even his character was killed because there were too many cards that brought multiple monsters to the gates. I have to add here that this form of working together is NOT fun. There isn't enough strategy to handing over cards and clue markers to make the process enjoyable. For instance my character had to give all of the clue markers she'd picked up over the last 5 turns to remove a bad card from the table that would have slowly drained everyone's stamina and ended the game. While the action was noble on her part, it just added to the drudgery because there was no feeling of accomplishment. The next card in play could do the same thing or something worse.

Many of the cards are also way too vague, hard to understand or complicated. All three of us have masters degrees and yet we had to read many of the cards two and three times to come to a consensus of what they meant. This was partially because the cards were either too unrelated to each other or too interrelated. There was also the problem that some cards controlled movement on the whole board and remembering all the limitations that could be on play was a headache and not a challenge. The cards also dealt with random events rather than creating any flow of action toward a common goal. All the places from Cthulu are there, but also all the monsters. This is part of the problem.

Rather than concentrating more on campaigns like the role playing games, it does not contain any real storyline. You go from place to place with no real motive other than to kill monsters and close gates. This simply isn't entertaining enough to make the learning curve worth your trouble. Where is the pay off for the learning curve and complexity? We kept saying...""Where is the fun?""

We ended the game because everyone was dying, as usual. Only one character even made it to the small expansion board that featured Innsmouth (BTW it is about 1/4 the size of the original board and you need a long table to set the board up...Add all the cards in and you need a HUGE table to play).

If it weren't for the beer and pizza I provided, I doubt we would have played as long as we did. This game needs a completely reworked expansion set with a more integrated card system that favors strategic play and fewer, less fragmented story lines. The constant flow of monsters doesn't engage the players enough and it quickly turns into a dice rolling competition complicated by an onerous rule system. I hope they do something to streamline play and post it to their website. I've got an investment of over $90 in this game and would really like to see it become playable...I may end up writing my own rules. The game's creator would do well to introduce some short campaign sets that ditch most of the rules and cards and allow people to have a little fun. We all agreed that playing it was like spending a very bad day at work. This was not how we had hoped to spend a Sunday afternoon.",2.0
"The new investigators and ancients ones are nice, but we never use the board because it really isn't very interesting.  If you use this board you have to dedicate 1 investigator to running around on that board all game and never closing portals or collecting clues.  It's pretty pointless.  We do use the 2 new ""other worlds"" and their corresponding portals.  We just put Dunwich over top of this board to show the other worlds only.

This game only vaguely reminds me of A Song of Ice and Fire.  There is no RPG aspect to this game at all.  It is just a strategic battle game.

Even by those standards, it's a very poor game.  It is imbalanced; there are too many ""gotcha"" cards.  I found the mechanisms tedious and asynchronous.  I play complicated games like Advanced Civ and Republic of Rome all the time, so complexity doesn't scare me.  From turn 1, I just found the entire affair tedious.  I've played games more than twice as long and not gotten so tired of this as I was after 2 hours.

You NEED 6 players. I don't care what the other reviews say, you absolutely need 6 players for the game to work as intended. Without getting into so much the ""how"" I will simply say the balance gets thrown way out of wack. Badly. The game is strongly based on positioning. If there is a shortage of players some houses can acquire insane advantages simply based off of everyone's starting spots on the board.

Get this game if you can get 6 people together regularly to play. If you plan on playing this game with anything less than 6, I would recommend passing it for something more balanced.",2.0

Unlike Eldritch Horror which has clear instructions for two player, and even one player games, this game gives no instruction on how to proceed with fewer than three.  The only way the mechanics of this game could ever work with two players would be for each player to control at least two factions.  Even then, the potential of the game is seriously cheated.  I'm sure this game would be plenty of fun with a few people over, but I bought it for bored weekday nights at home with the wife, so I'm giving it two stars.",2.0

"Let me start off by saying that I love Civilization the computer game. I can think of no more fun or challenging experience in computer gaming than playing Civilization. The battles are exciting, and developing your grand civilization is a rewarding way to spend an afternoon.

The board game reminds you of how much book-keeping the computer does for you automatically.

First is the setup. I bought the earlier incarnation of the Civilization board game from Eagle Games, so I knew that I wasn't in for a simple game. When I saw the dials for each of the Civilization cards, my heart leapt for joy. No more counting coins. Armies weren't represented by individual pieces anymore. The ranking of units looked streamlined. Everything looked much simpler and cleaned up than the Eagle Games version.

Unfortunately, there's still a LOT of moving pieces and cards to this game. Our initial setup took about an hour to get everything sorted out. Sorting through the tech level cards was a bit of a chore because some of the colors look very similar to each other (blue and green for me). There's one space-age card that is special and needs to be kept out. Each of the improvements is double-sided, so figuring out which went to what piece on the market board was challenging the first time around. Then there's the cultural cards and markers, resource markers, government cards, wound markers... the list goes on and on of markers and such. Granted, everything has a place, and is well defined, but it takes some getting used to in order to set up quickly.

Once the game is set up, you place your city, scout, and army, and then begin the game. Unfortunately, by the time we got to this point, I was already thinking if we had played the computer game, we would have been playing about two hours through by now. Had there not been the strong correlation between this game and the computer game of the same namesake, we would have given up long before the two hour mark. My soldiers found a village, and after leafing through the combat rules, we gave up. Alas, the temptation to finally admit defeat, chuck this to the side, and play the computer game was too great.

I'm positive that the rules for this game are vastly better than the Eagle Games version of Civilization. From what I saw, it was streamlined, and potentially a fun game. Be prepared to take over 4 hours to get to the point of having fun with this game. If you have the patience to persevere, you can likely find a great game. Maybe I'm getting older, but I don't have the patience to play a game that takes this long to get to the good stuff, especially when the computer version is a few clicks of the mouse away. And the computer is so much better and faster at set-up, book-keeping, and clean-up.",2.0
"My friends and I attempted to play this game over Christmas break and now despise it. The rule book is extremely bloated -- every rule is prefaced with pointless sentences. There are many pieces to punch out (They are of good quality). In fact, it took us about 90 minutes until the game actually began. The combat system was boring and predictable. Lastly, the game goes on for WAY too long.

If I could, I would get my money back.

FFS is obviously saving dollars in name of sacrificing quality and quantity. Some of the pieces, like the plastic gold coins and the pyramind cones are literally 1/4"" in height and diameter.  The handful of plastic molded characters are at most about 1 inch high as well. The spell and casting cards are all so small they would be small for a 5 year old's hand. The board is quite large, about 3 foot by 2 made of cardboard. Not much here folks, especially for the cost of the game. This is a 12 dollar game at a 50 dollar price.",2.0
"This game has several things going for it. ADVANTAGES:
1. The artwork is quite good
2. The overall look and feel of the game components is aesthetically pleasing
3. The theme is ever present and well thought out

The DISADVANTAGES are too great for me to recommend this title:
1. Too much luck and too little strategy. Most choices are no brainers. The only difficult choice to make is when to go to the inner ring of the game. Even this decision can be based on your current stats in a fairly simple way. If you have <=7 of your primary stat (strength or craft) then don't go because you will not survive, if you have 8-9 go only if someone else is headed that way, if you have 11 or more then go unless you are running very low on lives, fate, or your secondary stat (strength or craft).
  -You must collect strength, craft, fate, and lives in order to ensure victory when entering the crown of command but how much of those you have is based on avoiding dumb choices and being lucky.
  -You may be playing very well as far as choices but be set back very badly while someone who has been playing no better is far ahead and these positions may swap in a few turns based solely on the luck of the roll.
4. The game feels like a mix between Munchkin and Candy Land. Those games both have their place. Munchkin is a funny game that has minimal strategy and is played for laughs and candy land is a cute game to play with kids when they are still too young to enjoy strategy. The problem is this game is probably too complicated for younger kids and is not funny so it looses 2 of the best advantages from those 2 games but retains some of the main disadvantages.

WHO MAY LIKE IT:
1. Kids whose parents play DnD but who are still too young to play themselves. This game is nothing at all like DnD in any way that counts (no role-playing, no strategy, etc). But to a young kiddo it could be a fun way to become accustomed to a fantasy setting, rolling dice to determine victory in battle, and making choices based on stats. There are probably better games that could fill this role.
2. People who played the classic. If I played this back in the day then it would be a nice blast from the past.
3. People who enjoy Monopoly and fantasy but who don't mind a game that has little strategy. This game has less strategy then Monopoly (few long term choices, no trading, etc) but has some things in common (dice rolling is the main mechanic, movement around the board that is continual throughout the game, etc.)

"To start, let me tell you that I own 3 copies of the base game, and one copy of every encounter deck and every expansion.  I have 9 playable hero decks that I play regularly.

My take on the player cards:  Brand is not a great hero.  His ability is limited to multiplayer, and I play a lot of solo games.  I do not use him regularly in any deck unless I am looking specifically for Ranged ability, and even then I usually use Legolas from the base set.  The allies are good with the exception of Keen Eyed Took (so 3 good, 1 bad).  Four of the remaining five player cards (events and attachments) are cards I never ever use.

My take on the encounter deck:  This is a very extremely location heavy challenge.  So, if you can handle that by using cards that clear locations (Northern Tracker in particular) it becomes quite easy.  There are very few enemies and minimal combat.  It is a unique change of pace compared to other encounter packs, but simply clearing locations is a bit bland, and it does not hold up interest after repeated plays.  Note also there is a card in this encounter deck called ""Rockslide"" which is probably one of the most frustrating types of cards that can occur in any encounter deck (probably second to any card with ""surge"").  Rockslide can end a game in a hearbeat, even if you have planned well.

So, 2 out of 5 on this one.  Many other encounter packs are much more worth your money.",2.0

"I've enjoyed the Space Hulk card game, and was looking for an expansion of the gameplay. More space marines to choose from? Sounds great!

And the new marines ARE really cool. They're very powerful, but it's a tough game from the outset, and they're fairly in-line with the stronger marines from the original game (ie, flamer, claws).

But the new cards suffer from a severe drop-off in print quality. They are NOT the same card stock as the originals, and while the art's the same quality, the cards are thinner. They look and feel different, and not in a good way. The differences really leap out at you when they're in the same stack together.

Also, they no longer use the squad tokens from the original game, replacing them with cards (of the lower quality). I regularly used the tokens as markers during the game, so this was NOT a welcome change.

So, just from a financial view, I initially spent ~$20 on the original game, with lots of beautiful, high-quality cards. The expansions are 1/2 of that, with many fewer cards of an inferior quality.

For those reasons, I really can't recommend it as a good value for the money. On the other hand, it's not expensive, and it adds to the gameplay, so if you play it regularly, you'll have fun with it. But overall, compared to the original cards, it's a let-down.",2.0

"I bought this game after seeing some positive reviews and an interesting premise, however things went badly after I broke it out with my gaming group.

But before I continue let me tell you that Infiltration is based upon the Android board game universe (which I have no knowledge of) in a steam-punk feel.

But maybe I can sum it up better by saying; this is a techy heist game where back stabbing and running through a facility stealing information is the ""order-of-the-day"" (much like the 1992 film ""Sneakers"" with Robert Redford, however the game's characters are much more selfish and don't really work together like in the film).

The rule book is beautiful but lacks a lot of information. I have had so many questions about game play and details, that I've had to go searching on the web for answers. Since this isn't a popular game, I've had to go to Fantasy Flights web and email them my questions, which they've never answered (Ultimately I figured out the game).

Since then, the game has sat on my shelf and no one in my gaming circle willing touch it. However a recent trip to Los Angeles, I broke it out with gamers that I had never met, and they all agreed it was one of the worst games ever printed.

Stick with me, and I'll explain why.

Problems with this broken game are;
 - Your character can become wounded by a security guard or a room and this can knock you out of the game. Keep in mind there is only 2 rare ways to become healthy. Extremely frustrating for the player just sitting there doing nothing.
 - If you become the first player to take a turn, you have dominance over the rest of the players by snatching up all the data tokens ahead of everyone else (and one player dominates the game). I call this the ""Mario-Bros-2-Player-Video-Game-Effect"" (where one player runs ahead and gets all the game coins/stars and other goodies). And the second player is swimming in his digital wake. I've won this game and I felt so bad for everyone else, I couldn't wait to move on after apologizing to them.
 - It appears that a ratio of 1-in-5 item cards actually help negate the run-away-player problem (and some item cards really are useless)... but unless you get those cards, your screwed.
 - Layout of the room cards are non-nonsensical and are laid out in an arc? The secret room sometimes cannot be even entered, and this is a problem too.
 - Also, this game has very little strategy or real flavor. Run through... snatch data tokens... run back before the alarm goes off... bam... done... boring.
 - The characters have no special abilities on their cards and every one of them are flat and lifeless. The game maker should of used colored cubes and numbers in place of players names because that is the level of character painted on theme here.

There are other problems with this game, but clearly every time I break it out, people can't wait to finish it to move onto another game.

I have heard the game was designed by the maker of Dominion, a well known and popular fantasy card game, but since I have not played Dominion, this is a mute point with me.

Don't get me wrong, Fantasy Flight did produce a beautiful game and the quality of the pieces are ""first-rate"", but it doesn't save the mechanics and details of game play.

TO END:

Simply stated, Infiltration is completely flat and lifeless. I feel nothing towards it and I intend on selling it soon. Players don't care about the characters and the way the game is tailored players don't care who wins the game. Sadly I feel no sadness when I kill a company worker in the building and some innocent employee getting ""knocked-off""? (Is that necessary? Most thieves aren't interested in murder on top of their stealing crimes). In Infiltration there is no greater alliances with other players and no consequences to almost anything. And when you don't care who wins and when you the player is dead to the circumstances, why play it?

Don't buy it unless you plan to make your own rules. Instead I advise you to go buy ""Can't Stop"" a great push your luck game or ""Elder Sign"" another semi-push-your-luck game. This one is terrible.",2.0
"As a card game, it has a lot of competition these days. Dominion and Thunderstone are excellent card games for a group of people. And for two player gaming you have classics like Lost Cities and Odin's Ravens.

I would recommend any of those games more than Netrunner. They are excellent card games.

Compared to those, Netrunner's gameplay really doesn't measure up. The rules are more complex than they need to be, and it feels like there's too much luck involved. I love the theming and the art is great, but Netrunner overall didn't do it for me.",2.0
"For its $30 price tag, this game felt woefully incomplete, especially compared to other beginner box sets like Pathfinder's.  With its handful of pre-gen characters (no rules to make your own) and just a smattering of NPC baddies to design stories around, there really isn't that much to do with this game.  I honestly think if you're interested in this game then you should just save your money and wait for the full version to come out.  I hate to sound cynical, but it really is obvious between the $30 Beta Rules book, this ""sneak peak"" of the rules (that most companies would give out for free via .pdf), and then the ""real"" version coming out next year, that they're just slowly milking eager fans for as much money as possible.  It would be like charging half retail price for a video game to be part of the Beta, then paying half retail price again for the demo, then finally full retail for the actual game when it comes out.  Who would do that?

Anyway, sorry for ranting so long on their marketing strategy. As it turns out, I found the actual game to be kind of a bore as well.  For instance, the main mechanic of the game consists of building a dice pool of green eight-siders that have ""good"" symbols on them dependent on your characters ability (no numbered dice in this game; you have to use their special dice!), add purple eight-siders with ""bad"" symbols depending on how difficult the task is, then switch out those green and purple dice for more symbol potent yellow/red twelve-siders depending on specializations , then add blue or black six-siders depending on advantages and/or disadvantages the situation might have, and finally rolling all the dice and taking note of how many good symbols you rolled subtracted by their bad symbol counterparts that were also rolled (there's three different kinds by the way).  If you end up with at least a single success you do it!  Other symbols describe how well/bad you did it!  If that sounds really clunky then I'd have to agree with you.  The fact there's only a single set of dice that comes with the game and you constantly have to hand off dice an build these rolls for EVERY action you want to do only makes things worse, and quite frankly, not fun!

My advice is if you're interested in playing a Star Wars RPG then go with the last d20 version put out by Wizards of the Coast before the price on it skyrockets.  If you're set on giving this system a go then wait for the full release ;don't let them dip into your wallet more times than they have to.

Edit:  Just discovered they put out an app that simulates their unique dice.  Wanted to mention it since that would help make the game run smoother if everyone could build their dice pools before hand and be ready when their turn comes up.",2.0

"I am someone who has played games his whole life, my favorite type being deck builders like Legendary, Dominion, and Star realms.  I mainly game with my wife so we are always looking for fun two-player games.  Being a huge fan of Star Wars, and after reading all the positive reviews of this game on here, I was excited to purchase this.  Based on that, I felt some balance needs to be restored to these reviews, as this is NOT the fun game that the high rating implies.
While this game isn't difficult, it IS confusing and the rule book and accompanying videos don't do a hell of a lot to clear things up.  I bought this game last Saturday at noon.  I spent most of the day reading the rules and watching videos trying to figure out how the heck to play the game.  Once I felt I understood I decided to play with my wife.  Upon starting, I found simply trying to explain the attack phase/edge battle aspect really difficult to do without my wife's eyes glazing over.
I have NEVER had to watch videos to figure out how to play a game.  The rule book does contradict itself and leads to confusion, and then watching the videos really don't clarify the rules.  It simply re-states them.  Not a terrible game, and it's actually kind of fun once you figure it out and get it down, but be prepared for a learning curve.  even if you are familiar with gaming already.",2.0
"This game was purchased as a Christmas gift for my 11 year old. On two separate occasions we set it up, read the directions, watched the videos and worked through a couple of rounds. Our assessment was as follows: if it takes so much time to learn and so much effort to remember what cards do what, it's not really a game anymore.  My son, who along with me really enjoys almost all things Star Wars, agreed that the game not so much a game at all but a mind-numbing exercise in learning a mishmash of conflicting rules.

We were about two hours into it and we still were unsure when an action could be played and when it had to be ""paid"" for.  We couldn't figure out what happened if both players ran out of cards to play in an edge battle or what to do if neither team had any cards to play at all.  There is so much going on, you have to read every card after ever single instance of play to see if that card had any interrupt, reaction, etc. that needed to be dealt with at that time or at any time. The laborious process of learning the game immediately reduced any amount of enjoyment that may have been gained by playing it. Games shouldn't be like that.

The rulebook is 32 pages long. THIRTY-TWO PAGES! And then there are several videos to watch on the game's website that attempt to help you through the start of the game.  We found that as we learned the game and even as we continued to practice that we had to have the rulebook at the ready ALL THE TIME and that we kept replaying the videos online to see if we had forgotten to do anything on each turn.  Playing like this gets old quickly.

Look, there are a great many positive reviews and that's what led me to buy this game in the first place.  And some people reading this might cast it off as the ""one"" bad review that is outweighed by all the positives - and that's fine.  BUT, before you do, note that my son is not a stranger to strategy card games. He's played Pokemon and Magic as well as other card-based games and has enjoyed them immensely.  AND, if you're willing to dedicate hours upon hours to mastering the steps and rules for this game, it's quite possible that your experience will be different from ours.  I'm just here to provide the view from the other side.",2.0
"I recognize a *lot* of people love this game. So I kept trying to learn to like it. But in the end, I just don't get the appeal. I suspect (but have no evidence) that people who like this game also like Magic The Gathering, a game I never played. There are similar game mechanics here, so perhaps that is part of the appeal for those who like it.

Problems:
First, the game is very complicated. To me, that's an upside -- it means the game has the potential to be very interesting. The problem is that the rule book is absolutely terrible. You simply cannot learn to play this game without consulting many different online videos, fan-made rule books, or forums that discuss the rules. The rule book is horribly organized and neither walks you through learning the game in a logically progressive way nor serves an adequate reference book when you have questions. I'd rather do my taxes than deal with the rule book for this game.

Second, the base game has decks (identities) and functions that are nearly worthless. Perhaps these identities & functions make sense when mixed with expansions for the game (which I never bought), but if that's true, then the base game should include those expansions from the get go.

Third, and this may be an intrinsic problem with deck building games of this type, players can win or lose very quickly depending on luck of the draw (especially early in the game). Yes, there's skill in building a smart deck (once you have the expansions to make many cards/identities in the base game actually worth something) and yes, once you play many games, better players will more often win. But if you just want to sit down and play one or two games with someone, it can easily feel like the major points are won/lost by luck of the draw. And that's just unacceptable for a good game.

For my money, deck building games like Dominion are leaps and bounds better than Android: Netrunner.",2.0

"Wiz-War is a board game where 2 to 4 wizards are pitted in a death match with at most one possible winner.  (It is possible for all players to die.)  Having played it a few times, I felt the concept and the materials for the game are awesome, but the mechanics could really use some tweaking.
With the right expansion (and correct house rules) this could easily go up 2 points.

How to win:  Be the first to score 2 points.  A kill shot (i.e. an attack which reduces an enemy wizard to 0hp) is worth 1pt.  Having enemy chest on your starting square is also worth 1pt while it is there so, in theory, it is possible to win without a single wizard dying.

1.  Defensive cards are too rare.
The game has 168 total cards.  How many of those reduce/evade damage?  About 20.  You might get up to around 24 if you count items/spells which heal but that's pretty much it.  While the standard rules don't have you using the entire deck of 168 cards, the defensive cards are likely to be reduced at the same proportion as the non-denfensive so unless you deliberately keep all 20 of the defensive cards (which seem to span all 8 schools of magic) and deliberately curtail the offensive spells, the fights are going to be very offensive.  Also bear in mind that your wizard starts with 15 hit points and your AVERAGE attack inflicts about 4 points of damage.  All attacks automatically hit unless the defender has a countermeasure.
So what happens when you're targeted by an enemy?  90% of the time, you have to take it to the face.

This is where I felt the game really fell flat.  I was expecting a game where you summon lots of monsters, create traps and walls to complicate the environment, confuse your foes, etc.  The sky was the limit and maybe you can get a sliver of these, but it doesn't seem to happen much even in a 4 player game.  For a game about wizard combat, the combat typically boils down to sheer attrition and/or who starts out with the best cards.  Very much a letdown.

2.  The mazes are rather small.
Each section is a 5x5 square board and start in the center of your 5x5 section of the board.  So it's not uncommon to start a mere 5 spaces away from an enemy.  If the combat was more engaging, I'd say this isn't all that bad, but because #1 is an issue, this exacerbates things because unless you go out of your way to flee, you're rarely more than a single turn away from being in line of sight of an enemy.  And doors are an afterthought.

3.  Why are the chests so important?
The idea behind the game is ""the Guildmaster of the Arcane Order has passed away and tradition demands a tournament - nay, a war - to decide which spellcaster reigns supreme in the wizarding world"".  Sounds good, right?  So what's the deal with the chests?  It feels like someone tried to merge 'capture the flag' into an arcane pit fight.  You never open the chests, you never get any direct benefit from holding one (although you can certainly throw one for an absurd amount of damage with the right card) or having it in your arcane starting spot, but it can win you the game for some mysterious reason.

I would have preferred there be one chest that is equidistant from all players at the start of the game and if you get that chest back to your starting point, you open it and get a super powerful weapon...basically something that will pull all of the players to one spot.

BOTTOM LINE:  More defensive spells and some tweaking could make this a VERY fun game, but as it stands right now, I wanted to like it, but it's just not where it needs to be right now.",2.0

"Fluxx has been one of my favorite games, and today I gave my copy of Monty Python Fluxx to someone I thought would enjoy it more.

I don't want to downplay the attractiveness of changing the rules, or the initial excitement. But unless you've got an interesting conversation going over the cards, the strategy can be painfully dull. Serious strategy gamers find the strategy a mile wide and a half-inch deep.

In Fluxx (all versions I have played), I would give at least 40% chances of someone who's played an hour and has something upstairs, of beating an expert who is very bright and has played the version of Fluxx extensively. There is some strategy, but I would put it as:

STRATEGY: ""If you can win this turn, then play your cards in a winning way. If you have a goal card that calls for two keepers, try to get those keepers in place and play the goal card last. Never play a goal that you can win in two rounds, because two rounds later the rules will almost certainly be different, and the goal will probably be different, too. And with a couple caveats like that, if you can't force an immediate win, choose a move that won't make anyone else win. If you still don't know what to do, play a random legal move.""

Strategy gamers tend to think a few rounds ahead; chess players almost certainly do. Fluxx is in fluxx enough that serious long-term planning is pointless; new players sometimes get freaked out because they assume there is this subtle, deep strategy that everybody but them knows; one friend thought I let her win in a first hand of Fluxx and I had to work to convince her that she had legitimately beat me and I had not played nicely so she would win. And the strategy outlined above is a one-move-deep strategy quite deliberately. It does not really think two moves ahead, with a few exceptions, because mostly players do not benefit from thinking ahead. A point of enlightenment, and with it both comfort and disillusionment, comes when someone learning the game realizes that what they've been searching for isn't there; there is not a subtle and deep strategy everybody but them knows; there is a lightweight strategy that others know, and experienced players may win just by making emotional reactions to the cards.

Now many people like it; I do not wish to dismiss the people who have said, ""It's a lot of fun that you can try to win by changing the rules."" A lot of people enjoy that, and I fully acknowledge that Fluxx is the sort of game that will motivate glowing reviews. But it is also a game that some people will get bored with, mainly because the strategy is often only one move deep.

Monty Python Fluxx also has slower and longer play than Fluxx 3.2, the other version I've played at length. There are creepers, among other thing, which make it particularly difficult for a player to win. My rough, gut estimate is that games last 2-3 moves long as Fluxx version 3.2, and at any rate game play is noticeably slower. ""Plain Jane"" Fluxx is comparatively more peppy, and some players wince in Monty Python Fluxx when there are two players otherwise capable of winning, but they are pinned by creepers and so the players have to wait for the moment when a player both has ""Plain Jane"" Fluxx winning conditions, AND has gotten rid of slowly accumulating creepers.

I would not discourage anybody from enjoying this game, and it is plain to me from the other reviews that a lot of people really like it. It's just that there comes a time when some of us would like strategy at least two full moves deep.",2.0
"Just to start, I'd never played a Fluxx game before and so perhaps I just didn't know what to expect.

I bought this game because a huge number of my friends and I enjoyed the movies so much! I wanted to bring it perhaps to one of our parties. I tried it out with just one buddy first.

It was very slow, hard to follow, and loads of pausing to read things. This would not work for a party, especially if there were drinkies involved.

I would send it back for a refund if I could.",2.0
"This is my first Fluxx game. So my lack of interest in playing the game after the first time is not related to the fact that it is Monty Python. I love Monty Python. The game is totally random. It has a few fun things about it, like talking with an English accent or quoting lines from the movie. But those instances are rare and most of the time you are swapping cards, just hoping things turn your way. It is sort of like playing War. If you make it a drinking game, it may be more fun. But I lost interest. Maybe I am too competitive. If you like games that require little-to-no skill to win, this is for you. It all depends on your personality and game preferences.",2.0
"This might be good for young kids but the rules, variations and funniness that I am used to in other decks is missing in a big way.",2.0
"Granted, I know there are variant rules that may improve this game some but I've only played with the most basic rules and with those this is a pretty bad game.  It is essentially just Scrabble without a board and no scoring, instead it is a race to place the last tile.  Each player starts with a handful of tiles and begins making words with those tiles much like you would on a Scrabble board except you can rearrange your tiles at will.  When a player places the last of their available tiles they announce ""Peel!"" and everyone grabs a new tile.  This goes on until the final tile is placed and whoever placed it is the winner.

I feel like the game assumes that by playing all your tiles you can go through the bag while filling your opponents stock with tiles they can't play as quickly.  Except the first time you play you quickly realize that having a single tile isn't always as easy to play as a handful.  Plus the game gives you the ability to ditch a tile at any time and trade it in for 3 more.  It's just a nonsensical game where just happening to play the last tile wins you the game by a fraction of a second each time.

Even the argument that it is more portable than an actual game of Scrabble doesn't really hold water nowadays.  Not only does actually playing this game take up much more room than a Scrabble board would, even if you consider just carrying around the pouch of tiles, we live in the age of smartphones, just download Scrabble on your device and play on the go.",2.0
Would have been fun if I wasn't detained for 20 minutes at airport!! Weird!!,2.0
"We like to play Bananagrams, actually, it's our favorite game, but the quality of the titles is not good, those look so cheaper. I paid for a good quality but we are so disappointed I won't recommended to my friends",2.0
"This is a cheap knock-off.  We bought the original game years ago from Target and have enjoyed playing with it for years.  I ordered this one for my son who is going away to college (the other kids voted that he couldn't take the family game with him).  This one is much, much lower quality with hollow tiles.  I was disappointed.",2.0
"We'll play the game because the game is fun but the quality of the tiles is strange. First, they are light plastic not the satisfying material the originals were made of. The tiles are not rounded on the edges but square and they have an indented circle on the underside - I guess to save on plastic in production. Seems we either got a knock off or they have changed the tiles to an inferior material and design. Additionally, the instructions are full of typos and broken English.",2.0
Some tiles are different fonts and sizes!,2.0
"I LOVE this game and ordered it as a gift for someone. It came in the mail with ugly marks on the banana zip pouch. It looks dirty and I'm not pleased. With some dishsoap it sort of came out, but doesn't make a good gift anymore.",2.0

It was kind of annoying to even make words with because it seemed like the letters were all different sized. Bizarre! LOVE this game, though!",2.0
The tiles are made of light material.,2.0
Played twice. eh. not impressed. Maybe you have to be a Scrabble kind of person to play. Word games aren't my favorite except for Words with Friends. I do like the little banana case though. Easy to store.,2.0
This game is really not that fun you basically play by yourself and the other person plays their own thing without much interaction.  Played once.  Never again,2.0
I was very musty like it had been in a wet garage for a long time. I washed the cover in the washing machine and had to wash all of the pieces in hot soapy water.  it took time that buying a new one would have been better and more satisfying,2.0
"I can't speak to the many 1-star reviews that claim they received a cheap counterfeit, as the set I bought elsewhere appears to be authentic with good quality plastic tiles in a yellow banana bag. The quality of the product accounts for most of my two stars. Like another reviewer below, I found the game itself to be seriously flawed by its almost complete absence of interaction among players. I don't mean social interaction, because of course you can chat with others while playing if you like. I'm talking about intrinsic interaction of players as part of the game. I don't need cut-throat competition for fun, but this is a lot like a group of people getting together to each play their own game of solitaire.",2.0
"The tiles in this version are cheesy plastic tiles which don't provide the tactile feedback of the real, scrabble like tiles.

LOVE the game, but I'm throwing this is the trash until I find the real thing.",2.0
I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and when it arrived (today 1/3/14 mind you) the tag says Bananagrams but the actual bag (roughly shapped like a banana) says Banangrams and the pieces are super thin and cheap plastic. I bought it since I was ordering other things too - I'll probably be going and buying the real version from target or somewhere else. I'm pretty bummed.,2.0
"This version of Bananagrams is cheaper because the tiles are lighter and less substantial than the ones I'm used to. They've got hollows in the back and they move around too easily.

I hate how products with good prices on Amazon tend to be inferior versions.",2.0
"Tiny pieces. Maybe would fill half letter size paper, if lucky. Great concept but won't buy again.",2.0
"I thought that the item would have the words and the background to put the words on.  The forest background on the box would be a nice background to stick the words on if it were magnetized.

Our 17 year old son's nickname is SQUATCH because he is 6'4"" 285 lbs of muscle (defensive lineman). I purchased this item to have fun. When I put the words on the fridge, nobody was interested at all.  To plain. No eye appeal.  : (",2.0
"PROS
1. magnets function

CONS
1. They need for connective words like ""your"" and ""and"" and ""then"".  They should have market tested this with real people first !!

"The quality of the magnetic words in this haiku kit is much lower than the original magnetic poetry.  I was looking forward to this as an expansion kit, but the magnets are flimsy and it kind of ruins the enjoyment.",2.0
"pretty sure these used to be heavier tiles.  i ordered these and they're much harder to play with because they're plastic.  wtf, bananagrams?  i'm returning them.",2.0
"The plastic and print quality have a cheap look and feel. I bought a set from a different shop in CA and those look and feel far better than these ones. Otherwise, the toy is great. That's why I'm getting a second set.",2.0
"The game is basically speed Scrabble.  It's fun, and you don't need an hour or two to play it.  But it's a little underwhelming, maybe because there isn't the added strategy the board offers (double letters, etc.)and because it's over pretty fast.",2.0
"My mother-in-law is a big scrabble fan and got this for Christmas. Three of us played and it was so boring.  You all do your own thing creating your anagram, and when someone finishes, they win.  There is no strategy, no interaction, not even any reason to talk to each other!  This is a solitaire game for one person - and if you REALLY want to KILL a party - then bust out the Bananagrams.",2.0
"If you have $15 to spend on a quality game I recommend you look elsewhere.  I must admit I got suckered in with the whole cute banana packaging but when you strip the game to it's core it's really not that fun of a game.  For starters if you already have Scrabble you can probably recreate this game using Scrabble pieces and that might even be more fun because the tiles have point values...in bananagrams they don't.  You simply create a crossword puzzle or anagram in this game and when you finish you yell out Bananas! and games over.  Sure this game can get tense towards the end as you are scrambling to finish creating your own crossword puzzle before your opponent does.  That's probably the most fun you'll have...that is towards the ending of the game.

My problem with this game is that there is no social interaction among players.  There is no chance for dialogue, for intimidation amongst players, or for a chance to laugh among one another.  Why you ask.  Simply put because once the game starts you put your head down and start creating your word puzzle on your own while other players are doing the same.  It's basically playing word solitaire at the same time with other players.  There's a level of coldness in this.  In other words, you lose out on the fun of interaction with others.  This is suppose to be a family game.  Doesn't really seem that way to me.  About the coolest thing this game has going for it is the clever packaging and the easy portability of this game...but then again you can bring playing cards anywhere and have a better time than Bananagrams.",2.0
This was a plastic microscope and didn't last long and without much playing. It broke and we had to super glue it back together. We were disappointed in the quality of this product.,2.0
"I ordered this microscope for my 6 year old son last Christmas. The slides were nice and the microscope did it's job for the most part. The TINY holder is fragile and tough for little hands to maneuver. It was also very hard for me as the parent to get the microscope focused enough to see the slides. Overall, I would not buy this product again. I bought it originally so my son could experience a microscope without spending a lot of money. If I had to do it again, I would buy a standing microscope and spend a little more money for one that was easy to use and geared for kids.",2.0
"Heads Up Consumers: It is small, VERY VERY Small
I bought this for my 8 year old daughter who loves bugs, and gardening and anything that you can do outdoors, while learning. Anyways, when she opened this on Xmas 2010 and I saw the size of this thing and just how much ""filler"" nonsense was in this kit. I was outraged. Make sure you read, then read, and then read some more before buying this item. Unless your intended target for this purchase is 5 or younger.",2.0
"We bought this microscope for our daughter as a gift from Santa.....what a disappointment!!  We had to tell her that Santa messed up.  The microscope couldn't be any smaller and cheaper!  Can't see any image clearly - and the image (slide) will not stay in place long enough to view.

Terrible!!!  Parents - Do not buy this toy!",2.0
the game is ok. I don't like the feeling of it,2.0
"Being a retired teacher, I was excited to buy this for my granddaughter because she was very interested in how the body works. We had fun going through the book and reading the information as we extracted the parts. We did have trouble opening the skull, but it did open. The frustrating part came when we tried following the directions to put it back together. We still haven't been able to get the hips to stay together. The sticky organs are fun, except when you are trying to put them back in order. Their stickiness becomes a con. After the excitement of operating the first time, we've only used it one more time because it's too hard to reassemble it!  Also, I think the hips are defective. The ""pro"" of this toy is the book and information for the body parts as the child operates.",2.0
"Mine came without the heart, intestines, diaphragm, and stomach. How can I get these parts? This was a gift for my daughter and it's missing 4 out of the 9 organs.",2.0
"The organs fall out of this, I cannot keep the rib cage connected to keep them in. It is so hard to put the pieces together, the bones don't connect easily. I am very disappointed in this product and do not recommend it.",2.0
Not worth the money. I purchased two of these for my kids and once the body parts are out it is hard to get everything back in.,2.0
"Disgusting. The squishy organs pick up every bit of dust, lent, pet hair, or carpet fuzz within a mile radius. We threw this away after a week.",2.0
"The squishy organs were nice, and the booklet that came along with this product was great. But the snaps to put the bones back together broke the first time we used it. Some of them already broke.",2.0
Once you put the body parts in place the whole body doesn't close together. Is doesn't snap close. So you can't keep it up right and the stand doesn't fit.,2.0
"The pieces get dirty CRAZY fast, the bones are super hard to hook into place, and the organs also break apart easily.. so if your kids like to squish and pull on squishy things.. the organs will break. Its a good idea for learning and what not.. but don't get this for your kids unless they are older and will really really take care of it and not ""play"" with it too much.",2.0
Christmas bummer.  My almost 6 year old is so fascinated with the human body and how it works so I thought this would be awesome for him.  It doesn't go together very well or stay together.  I finally got all the pieces in place and when I stood it up it all fell apart.  Son was clearly disappointed with it and so was I.,2.0
Anatomically it's OK. Organs are too squishy and hard to put back in place. Body doesn't fit together well. Poorly designed and cheaply made.,2.0
"This was a fun project to do with my daughter for educational purposes, but it was very poorly constructed. It did not come put together, which would have been fine but we never actually got it together. We eventually had to give up and tape it to make it stay closed. The intestines also won't stay in, no matter how you put them in. We tried higher or lower, and they still fall out. I only give this two stars because it did get the conversation going for our human body unit.",2.0
"Although I like this product for the most part, it came with two hearts, and no diaphragm. I opened it today to use to teach a class tomorrow, and am disappointed to be missing a body part.",2.0
"The item I received was not the same as what was pictured/described. My body was not nicely assembled and displayed in a box. Contrary to the product description, I did not receive a 32 page fully illustrated book. What I received was a stapled-together 23 page booklet that was torn on the bottom. The cover was simply paper, so I certainly wouldn't call it a ""book,"" and it was nine pages shorter than was I was told. The body that arrived was a hot mess thrown into the box. The plastic baggie holding the skeleton was half-off the body. The organs were all thrown separately into another bag. The presentation was AWFUL. This was nothing like the product my daughter had seen at Barnes and Noble and requested for her birthday. Thank goodness I decided to open the box a few days early. Replacement ordered, we'll see if it's any better.",2.0
My 5 year old is obsessed with human anatomy and surgery. We saw this toy and he worked so hard to earn it but it is dissapointing. He loves being able to take apart the organs but the toy is so poorly constructed. I it does not hold together and fitting the bones and muscles in is impossible because the pegs don't meet up to the holes. He can't even kep it together to fit into the display stand. Not worth the money we paid for what it promises.,2.0
This puzzle lives up to a lot of the other reviews.  I bought it for our annual family Christmas jigsaw puzzle and it was way too frustrating and not a good one for many hands to work on.,2.0
"I am not a stranger to difficult puzzles; if you check my reviews you'll see I did a 1000 piece puzzle of the Wicked poster, which is entirely solid blocks of color and almost exclusively three colors.  This puzzle, however, is almost as difficult and ten times more frustrating.  The pieces do not fit together cleanly, and sometimes when they do you realize later they weren't supposed to.  I have redone the border multiple times, and have had large sections that I thought was complete only to have to remove pieces and use elsewhere.  The end result is turning out great, but it's taking us much longer to get there than it should.  At several points we're having to turn the puzzle upside down to see if the fit is correct on the back.

If you're a die-hard Harry Potter fan, this puzzle is for you.  If you are a puzzle aficionado, run far from this brand.  It will only frustrate you.  The pieces do not stay together well and the slightest bump dislodges them.",2.0
"This is a fun toy for kids as long as you keep it away from hair, lint, carpets, breathing on it or it ALL sticks to the pieces parts",2.0
This was really difficult to put together and keep the body snapped into place.  I wouldn't purchase it again.,2.0
"Great Idea but it doesn't stay snapped together, so you can't build it and stand it up.",2.0

"very flimsy, organs fall out, very very small and useless.",2.0
Doesn't stay together well,2.0
"We sent it back.  So inaccurate that my child was not going to learn much, and it fit together very poorly. The hard pieces did not mate up to the slots in the shell so it wouldn't stay together.  Book was all cartoonish and cluttered and no good for my visual learner.",2.0
"The parts did not fit into the fram well, and it was extremely difficult to snap the outer plastic casing together.  Purchased this for my ""almost 11 year old"" and while he thought it was cool - he wasn't into reading the book as much as I would have hoped.",2.0
"Great concept.  Nice visual way to learn about the human body and its systems.  3D is great too. My son also really liked the squishiness of the organs.  Made them seem more life like.  But... The negatives:
-There are pegs that hold the muscles and bones in the back half of the clear body ""case"".  The pegs are extremely small and hard to fit into the holes on the case.
-Some bones, like leg and arm bones have 2 pegs.  It's very difficult on some to get BOTH pegs to line up.
-After you get one bone in place and start to pick up the body case to maneuver it to get another bone or muscle in place, the first bone often pops out.
-After you finally get all bones, muscles and organs in place the next step is to put on the front half of the clear body case.  If ONE of the internal pieces is out of place it won't align and snap together.
-While you're moving the body around a bit to see where the ""snaps"" are on the front and back clear body case, the foot or hand often falls out.
-Also, the ""snaps"" on the clear body halves are difficult to connect.  I would suggest practicing clicking the clear halves of the body together before attempting to put in the bones, etc.
-We've had one part of a ""snap"" break off the clear body halves.

After much practice my 8 year old was able to get the muscles, bones and organs in place but he could never get the 2 clear body halves snapped together on his own.

In all I wish the model itself were a bit bigger so the pegs and ""snaps"" were bigger and more sturdy.  I feel this would make it easier to put together.",2.0
"Muscles and bones do not fit properly into the plastic body.  The holes and ""pins"" are not properly aligned to fit together, and so no matter what I did, half the pieces would not secure into the body.  I would not buy this again.",2.0
"This toy looked like a great idea but it is not made very well. This was s gift for my son. He was not happy when the pieces did not snap/slide into place like the directions mentioned. The pegs to snap/slide into place are not lined up correctly on quite a number of body parts, you may only be able to click it into place in one out of 2 locations. The lungs do not ""press snugly into place"" as the directions say, especially since the pegs don't line up.  It was very frustrating for him - every time he tried to get them into place, other body parts that were set, fell apart. The worst part was that when he was as complete as he could get (with some pieces not really connected, but just within the ""body"" casing), he was unable to use the stand. The pegs for the stand and the pegs on the feet did not line up. If the pegs actually snapped together and lined up, this would have been a fun toy to use. Sadly, it was a let down, and frustrating.

My son did like the book, and the directions to put together the human were pretty good.",2.0
"My daughter and I played with it once and had fun but couldn't quite get the body's shell to match up and fit once all the organs were in place. Needless to say, we both lost interest after the initial play time. Not quite worth it unless you have a doctor in training perhaps?",2.0
"While the concept is a good one, the construction needs improvement.  Once assembled, the clear outer body does not stay put together - Parts don't fit well. Poorly made.  Don't waste your money.",2.0
Got for a Christmas Present and this is missing a lot of pieces.,2.0
"There are a couple of PROs 1.  My 6y/o grandson recognized all of the hard and 'squishy parts (diaphragm threw him).  2.  ""It kinda looks cool"" when we had it completed.  NOW the CONs.  1.  Holes for large pieces do not align well and when finally in, release really easily (In fact, the bony foot will not remain in hole when ""body is placed on stand).  2.  The ""squishy organs"" stick to everything (except the model) they touch and collect fibers, hairs, dust, etc.  It literally requires a 'dust cover' as soon as the 'organ bag' is opened.  3.  When the feet are put in the stand, the head separates (the clip on top does not snap tightly).  4.  The educational pizza trip stops at the upper small intestines (grandson was waiting on the 'poop).
The good thing is it was not expensive or I would have sent it back.  My grandson and I had 90 minutes of quality time that is currently sitting on the mantel covered with a Zip-Loc bag pending arrival of a more suitable cover.  I would not recommend this item.  I would have probably given 3 Stars except for the snap issues and the dust.",2.0
"Concept is great, but does NOT work. ""Organ""izer is cute, parts are ewie and squishy, fun to put together . . . oh, that's where it breaks down, literally. You can't put this together. The parts do not stay in place, so you can not assemble this and then stand it up on display. You can put the parts in, but then that's it. Forget the rib cage and plastic housing all together. I was really hoping for a fun way to teach my kid about the human body. This is not it.",2.0
"My daughter received this as a gift. I love the idea of it and my daughter has been interested in the human body lately.

It was not assembled so I did the first assembly before handing it over to my daughter to play with. The peg on the foot broke off immediately and a few of the pegs were angled in such a way that they would not line up with the holes on the skin. I had to bend them to line up and one now looks like two of them will soon break off. The clear skin also doesn't snap shut as intended. Only half snap closed while the others don't work at all.

I have a feeling this will break and be useless in a couple more play sessions.",2.0
"Nice art, nice printing.  Why two panels are filled with a general Forgotten Realms map is beyond me.  Most of one of them is all blue ocean.  Such a waste.

I don't understand why they can't make these DM Screens more useful for these ""kinds of adventures"" rather than solely the specific adventure.  You're supposed to be able to transpose this adventure to other lands outside the Forgotten Realms.  So even just a list of new monsters or NPCs would at least be useful than the map.  Even more would just be stuff related to running the game but broad-use stuff related to giants.

Same thing with Curse of Strahd.  Why not make it useful for raven loft, undead or horror campaigns in general... instead a huge amount of screen space is solely mapping out Castle Ravenloft, which is only useful during a small fraction of the time even for the Curse of Strahd adventure, let alone various other Ravenloft adventuring.

They really kill the extended use of these screens by not thinking about their potential use, both for the adventure in question, as well as use in a broader sense.

The Rage of Demons screen is far more useful for broad under dark adventuring - covering a lot of rules for the various conditions you may suffer... and the map is only one panel.

This Storm Giants one is decent for a few tables it includes - but really misses the mark.  Maybe they should ask a few DMs what they would use?",3.0
"My review will mirror others in that this kind of misses the mark and there are some lost opportunities to help DM's.  I wouldn't advise new DM's to use this by itself.  They should stick to the generic 5e DM screen and just copy/print the other useful information for SKT.
I do like that the information they did put in the screen was relevant to the game and makes accessible some of the frequently visited tables from the adventure book.  I also like the map from the perspective that it contains the page references to the cities and locations. This is pretty useful, especially during Ch 3 of the adventure.
However, there is a very Large amount of wasted space that could easily have been utilized instead of having the whole map take up 2 panels of the screen. The middle of the ocean could have contained info on the Giant hierarchy, the Giant Rune symbols, the Random encounters at Sea table from the DMG, trap tables, or any number of other usefully applicable information to the story.  I would have done away with the Sea portion of the map completely and used that space more efficiently.  In all actuality, the entire map could have been an extra insert, freeing up far more space and making this product far more appealing...or the Adventure book could have included it as a tear out.  There should have been better collaboration on this product.
On a different note, the printing on my copy of the screen was not sized correctly.  The Left and right creases are right over the edge of the words...especially on the Right side.  It is almost illegible when the screen is up and in it's general position at the gaming table.(See attached pic)

I can understand the idea and desire to produce tailored DM Screens for these adventure books, but I don't feel they've truly taken the time to get feedback on their ideas from enough sources before printing. It's coming across as licensed money grab instead of a Value Add product to the adventure line.",3.0

"5 stars for the delivery. Got it in 2 days after I ordered it. Wow!! As for the coloring book itself, the pages are perforated and you can see through them and your crayons/ pencils show through to the other side.

My suggestion is to make the pegs fit a little tighter so the kids can learn skills of coordination, etc when pounding them in.  The pegs are nice and thick for little hands, but just not snug enough fitting to really use the toy as it is intended,",3.0

Four double-sided color pencils (for a total of eight different colors), a black marker (for bolding), speech balloon stencils,  and an eraser are provided.  The problem here is that it really becomes more practice in tracing than actually learning how to draw.  Each exercise is four steps: 1. a stick figure; 2. the pipes 3. details; and 4. ""detailed"" details.  There aren't any transitional instructions on how to actually get from Step 1 to the final image; it is just a visual demonstration.  This book is best for those amateurs with some basic art class experience in terms of knowing how to draw details once they've have made the circles and connecting lines.

Rating: 3/5 stars (No recommended age, as any person's artistic talent will vary, no matter the age.  Instead, a beginning drawing class is best before tackling this book).",3.0
"The quality of the book is awesome. I gave it a 3 star review because, This is a book for someone who is more advanced than a beginner. You can trace mostly. It lacks instructions for the comic book drawing beginner.",3.0
The concept for this is great but even I had a hard time with these. ,3.0
"This kit was very frustrating and not at all something my 7-year-old could do on her own. The puppy turned out cute, but nothing like the photo. We also ran out of yarn, mid-project. The puppy took about 2 hours to complete.",3.0
Super cute but I ended up doing them myself. Too hard for my 6 yr old to do. Not sure what the age is on it...,3.0
"I ran out of yarn, actually ran short while making the second Pom Pom for one dog. Don't even bother with the glue, just use your own from the start (Klutz is useless). The carrier is okay but too small so useless. The idea and presentation is charming and if easier it would be terrific for a slumber party! I wonder if there is an easier way to make a Pom Pom?",3.0
"It's okay. I would rate it as 10 and up . . . . it isn't easy to apply the ears and eyes and have them stay. It's definitely something that has to go on a shelf untouched after making. The yarn that comes with it will not make up many of these, so be prepared to go buy more yarn.",3.0
"This is a bit difficult. There are too many steps and we have to go back and forth to put the head , body together. If you are looking for something easy and fun , don't buy this. It will get you all wound up.",3.0
"This is too hard and for my 8.5 year old to do on her own and even with supervision it was frustrating. She knows how to make pompoms without this kit, so I was surprised that it was hard for her.  She waited 2 years for me to get it for her so it was a bit of a disappointment.  I packed it away for another time.  The quality is good, instructions are decent... so hoping in a few months we can try again with more success.",3.0
niece love these,3.0
I found the directions difficult,3.0
"The instructions were a little tricky to understand, and there weren't quite enough materials included to make some of the dogs.",3.0
"So cute, but this isn't something that children can do on their own.  The only thing my niece could help with was the gluing on of accessories.  She couldn't even ""fluff"" the fur with the included comb because she was just pulling the yarn out of the pom pom.  Don't advertise as a child's craft if children can't do it from start to finish.  In the end, she was happy with puppy that I made for her...",3.0
I bought this for an adult crafter. While she didn't have problems making the pom-poms she didn't have enough yarn to make even one dog. I'm a really big fan of Klutz and I'm disappointed by this kit.,3.0
"Fun project but very time consuming and complex for children. Definitely requires supervision and hands on help. Kit was a little skimpy with yarn. There is enough to make a few dogs, but not repeat colors if any cutting mistakes happen.",3.0
Difficult,3.0
"The instructions are a bit confusing and my 7 year old needed a LOT of help.  Plus there isn't enough yarn included to do any of the solid colored pups.  However, the pups are cute once completed.  If I had it to do over again, I'd choose a different art project for us.",3.0
Book is OK. It was delivered in excellent condition with a little snow on it. But I think I am missing yarn...there was not enough required tan yarn to finish the Chiuahua and my daughter cried. This book is definitely for 8 or older cause it was very hard to cut. It needs the patience of older kids. I should have waited a few years but very cute concept. My child is 6 years and we could only make one dog she was disappointed.,3.0
"This came yesterday and I was excited until I opened the book. Wow, the photos are not very good made of things that aren't very well done. I thought I would send it back but it isn't worth spending the money on the return postage. I can use it but will definitely make MY pups look way better than they did for this book.",3.0
Fun but they are a little hard to make with cutting through all the yarn.,3.0
"My nine-year-old could not do this independently, she watched me do it, and we were happy with the result. The first puppy took one hour to do. The instructions were clear and I had no problems making the pom poms. Perhaps the design of the pom pom maker has changed since earlier reviews. It is a very messy craft and must be done at a table with a cookie sheet under it or the fluff goes everywhere. I agree with other reviews that you really need a glue gun. The white glue is not going to result in a pup that can be played with. My daughter is looking forward to adding the details once the pup is dry -- we have had to glue it three times so far and it is still not holding well enough to be handled.",3.0
"This in an adorable little kit with many great ideas and a kit to get you started. My 7 year old and I loved making a Pom Pom pup together. The instructions were a little vague and unhelpful at times, but the overall idea was great. For the high price here, it would have been very helpful to have a little bit bigger of a starter supply and a video to help those challenged with the written instructions.
My daughter was super excited about getting her Pom Pom pup kit. She worked very hard to earn her money for it. I guess the level of instructions were a bit advanced for her, as they were for me. She had gotten discouraged at one point that we didn't know how to do this. We basically made up our own instructions to finish our first Pom Pom pup, and she hasn't picked it up again.
Overall, it was a fun mother daughter experience with some challenge.",3.0
"My 8 year old granddaughter wanted this kit because she loves dogs and crafts.  She was disappointed when there was not enough yarn to complete the first dog.  We went to the store (three stores) to find additional yarn and bought some which was really thinner.  I could not find the same yarn and she wanted to finish the dog.  When we finally had the dog completed, the yarn I had purchased was stringy compared to the full fluffy yarn in the kit.  At this point she is not excited about making other dogs.  Hopefully this attitude will improve with time.",3.0
"I can see where this is a good kit for kids 8-9 years or older. Ours didn't come with enough yarn to build the first dog, and the glue didn't work at all. I still like the idea enough that I wouldn't give it a bad review. But make sure you keep your receipt or are prepared to return if your kit doesn't come with all the components.",3.0
I bought this for my 11 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She was very excited to make a puppy. Once she started reading the directions she became discouraged because they were to hard  to follow. This would be a fun project with adult supervision. Maybe when she gets older she will try the toy again.,3.0
"My daughter wanted this so badly. So she forked over her allowance and bought it. We've used Klutz books for ages and usually have great success. This one was a bit of a dud. It was really difficult to make the pompoms using the enclosed pompom maker. They kept falling apart and once you've cut the yarn, there isn't any way to fix it except to buy more. I've done crafts all my life but I just couldn't get how they wanted the pompom maker to work. My daughter failed and so did I. When it became unfruitful, she gave up. Since there are others who have made it work, I can only assume we were not doing something right. But if this is for kids, it should be fairly easy.

Unfortunately, it has not been touched since the first few tries.",3.0
"Great questions. Cards are kind of large to be using with children. There are almost too many questions to play one on one, which is how I use it and had intended.  It would be better in a group setting for the number of questions.",3.0
This game although it appears to be like Uno and have an easier play method it was still too time consuming and wordy for my children with learning disabilities.,3.0
"was useful, but probably better for younger kids",3.0
Can be kind of difficult to play. Rules aren't very clear. Described as being like UNO. UNO is easier to play and for kids to understand.,3.0
"My son loves the books, but was very disappointed in how cheaply this is made.  One of the wings was half ripped off within the first couple days of normal play.  nothing some needle and thread couldn't fix, but now the other wing needs repair as well.  Too bad it wasn't made better, but I think all parents realize that toys are not built the same way they were when we were kids.",3.0
"The Pigeon is cute, obviously.  I just did not appreciate seeing an price tag of $11.95 on the item after being charged $25.",3.0
"My Child LOVES the Pigeon books and LOVES this pigeon, however after only one week of gentle use, the neck is ripping open.",3.0
"It's an adorable accessory to the books I got for my niece. The quality seems fine and it is soft and plushy. I didn't read the details in depth enough because I was under the idea there would be a miniature version of the book included. Turns out thats just the tag, which happens to state an $11.99 price... So I'm baffled as to why it cost nearly $20 instead. Really would recommend just going to Barnes & Noble for this.",3.0
I Like it but the eggs are very difficult to open and some won't close back up again after the first time.,3.0
"I really wanted to love this, I like it ok. The eggs themselves are fine.  A nice product.  Although the biggest egg has actually become quite loose and doesn't stay together if you are handling it.  I wish the painting on the cross egg was a little more practical, or rough looking.  The cross Jesus was crucified on was not pretty, like the egg painting.  I find the book itself to be too wordy.  I used it with three groups of preschoolers and it was hard to keep their attention.  They could only look a the egg so long and the words in the book are too long for the looking at the pictures.  I don't regret purchasing it. I know I will use it but most likely will just tell the story or cut out parts of the book.  I do think the cost for what you get seems a little steep.",3.0
"I love the product and the concept of the product. It's simple enough for young ones to follow along. The eggs (especially the smaller ones) were much smaller than I anticipated. Also, I was very disappointed in the quality of the book. When I received the book and opened it for the FIRST time, the binding was already coming off entirely. This is very disappointing as I wanted this to be an annual tradition with my kids as they grow. It looks as though the book will not last. Poor quality.",3.0
Great puzzles for toddlers to put together by themselves. The puzzle itself is not the best quality however. The pieces fall apart within a few weeks.,3.0
"They are super cute but I've had them for quite some time now (maybe 6 months) and several of them have fallen apart, and a few have broken. The cheapo plastic letters have held up much better. These are okay but I don't think they are worth the price.",3.0
"These are nice enough, but probably not worth the price. I didn't love how it's missing certain letters. Not one ""P"" so my child could spell her name. Also missing other basic letters, while giving a few too many Qs.",3.0
These are super cute but it doesn't take a lot to wear them down. I have them on a magnet board in my daughter's nursery. Just from the few times I've moved them around they have dents in them and the paper is coming off. They need to be more durable.,3.0
These are cute and colorful but with a normal amount of use they start to show wear because they are esentially made of cardboard.,3.0
They did the job I needed them to do and that was to teach my daughter her basic colors. But I expected more colors than what they had. It is 54 cards but 9 colors and 6 shapes. If I had purchased it to teach my daughter her shapes I would have been VERY displeased.,3.0
"It's an OK product, the marker is not good at all.",3.0
"Laminated and sturdy with clock hands that work well. The marker is in great condition. ******Check the size,****** It is small enough to fit in one hand. I do not recommend this for teaching a group of children as the product is too small. It works well for one on one.",3.0
"I ordered this product after some consideration. I had played the original Avalon-Hill version with a friend who had a copy from his childhood. The game itself is fun and different from other finance games. On the older version that I played, the game tiles were plastic and fit into a grid to prevent slippage. On the new version, the game tiles are made of a cardstock and there is no grid. This is an annoying difference only when you are trying to play a game near animals or small children. Otherwise it's fine. This version of the game is available at a lesser cost than any of the originals on Ebay, so if you want it, snap it up while it's available!",3.0
"This updated version of the board game classic has both some strengths and some weaknesses.  The board is flat and the tiles are a very light cardboard, so bumping the board is a problem.  This is a step down from previous editions with indented plastic boards and hard plastic tiles that plugged into them.  However, the player trays for holding the tiles is a nice touch and the new stock certificates have both a nice look and feel.  The graphics are nice and the box is small and light, which is good for portability.  Given the relatively low price, I think it is a decent value for your money, particularly if you don't already own a copy of this excellent game.  But if you do own a previous edition, there is no need to pick this one up.",3.0
"Nothing super fancy about this game but it's still fairly solid. We are big gamers and have heard of this game for while and the ratings are pretty high for it so we thought we'd try it out.

The board itself is pretty boring and I thought I would like it or it would be too math oriented because of the buying and selling of stock but that's not the case! It is actually really easy in that regard. And it's surprisingly satisfying matching up your square to the letter/number spot on the board. Not very complicated game play but still played well.

Overall, a decent game. I would say it's not a regular in our game play but we do bust it out on nights when we don't want such an intense game or when we may have gaming newbies for its simple play.

My only concern is that you need to not loose a single piece otherwise your game play will be messed up so if you aren't good at keeping all your pieces this game may quickly get passed over because of lost pieces.",3.0
Not as sturdy as the other versions but it works.,3.0
Everything is cardboard and the 500's and 5000 dollar bills are almost identical in color. Prepare to spend 20 minutes punching out cardboard squares after opening. I honestly think most fans of this game could probably do a better job themselves at making a better game board.,3.0
"My mom already owned an Acquire game but she always commented on how poorly it was made. So, I thought I would get her a new one for Christmas. The quality of this one was not much better. Her old one had cards for each player to see how much each hotel cost to buy according to how many tiles it had. This one did not even have that. I expected better quality for the price I paid for it. It didn't even come with a bag for the tiles. I think she was disappointed.",3.0
Really cheaply produced cardboard playing pieces for the cost...,3.0
"Not as good as the original 3M game.  Very disappointed with everything being a cardboard cutout.  And it would be easier to collect all the pieces after playing if the board folded the other direction.  But, we still manage to have fun playing with the family.",3.0
"I've discovered that I'm really ""new school"" when it comes to my board games.  Except for Boggle (and a couple Chess boards and a novelty version of Yahtzee), this is the oldest game I own by more than 30 years.

It's very watered down for my usual tastes.  Gameplay consists of playing tiles on a board to start, expand, or merge hotel chains.  Then you buy stocks, trying to predict which ones will grow so you can buy as low as possible and sell them for huge profits by the end of the game.  The player with the most money at the end wins.

I think this game is certainly better with more people.  It can accommodate up to 6 and that may be too many (I've never played with that number) but with 3 or fewer it is too easy to run away with the game.  More players offers more competition and gaps between your turns and dilutes the available stock.  With three you can see what tiles you have available and buy up huge amounts of stock early before other players have time to react and attempt to thwart your plan or prevent you from a big pay-out.

I've enjoyed Power Grid and have intended on playing a deeper economic game for some time but this certainly isn't it.  This is much more shallow an experience although it does play reasonably quickly and may fill a shorter time slot if players are looking for a quick buy and sell stock game.",3.0
This game is very cheaply made from cardboard.  Probably worth the extra money to purchase the classic set if this is a game you like to play.,3.0
"I used to play the original Acquire as a kid when it was sold by 3M.  One of the things that I really liked about it was that the tiles fit neatly into plastic game board.  However, this new version is very cheaply made and tends to be frustrating not only to put together but to play with as well.  The game play is still fun, but the quality sucks.  WotC can and should do better.",3.0
"firstly, this game is EXCELLENT! the previous editions have used much better pieces, but this avalon hill remake is absolutely terrible. EVERYTHING IS CHEAP CARDBOARD, INCLUDING THE TILE HOLDERS >.< the only thing they did well was the stock cards and the board, which were of a durable finish and construction. money is just standard paper, nothing to write home about.

i had a bit of a panic on loosing 2 tiles, but fortunately i used some extra cardboard from the cut outs to make new ones, but this game really is like scrabble: loosing a tile ruins the entire game.

Fun/Gameplay = 5/5
production 2/5

overall, 3 stars.",3.0
"For a company that was able to roll out Magic: The Gathering Trading Card Game with all the strategy packed into those cards, this game is lacking and misses the expectations that I had set for Wizards. An interesting game to help to explain to young adults about how Mergers and Acquisitions might work at a very basic level in this world (M&A being a large section of open job opportunities in the world at this point) but very basic, one track strategy, and lacking in overall fun honestly.",3.0
"My board games group had fun with this, so I bought it.  My family is devoted to Settlers of Catan, but it can become a bit obsessive.  (One of my friends refers to the game as Greed.)  I thought Acquire, which is also (obviously) about acquisition would at least be a break.  My group, however, had a lot of guidance from the man who brought it.  So I will hae to see how it goes with me stumbling over the rules.",3.0
"We've been playing acquire sinc 1990 almost every week. Initially we had used the original version from 3M. Then we bought the hasbro version, that is the one we like the most. We bought this last one to be an aditional, since we are using one like this and the hasbro version to play.
I really recommend the game. It is amasing.",3.0
"The game itself is really fun.  Acquire has been around for over 50 years and it's the same game it was 50 years ago.  However, the quality of the materials of this product are terrible now.  Instead of a durable plastic grid board for which the tiles are played upon in older versions of the game, you now get this cheesy piece of cardboard.  The pricing information for each company is no longer an individual card given to each player for reference.  There is only one and it's imbedded into the cardboard playing grid - so it's a real strain for everyone to view.

I really wanted to rate this at least 4 stars, but the durability of this game and ease of play forces me to downgrade the overall rating.

Look for older versions of this game online.  You'll be much happier.  I've played both the bookshelf version (from the 60s) and ""galaxy"" version (purple box).  Both of these versions used quality material.

If you've never played the game before, then you probably won't be disappointed because you'll have no comparison.  Don't misunderstand me,  The GAME IS REALLY FUN - it's the product materials with which I have issue.",3.0
"Acquire is a truly brilliant and fun game. It requires strategy and planning and can be a lot of fun. I bought this game because so few people have heard of it and it's great to introduce people to. But this edition is terrible. Previous editions had raised plastic boards and 3D pieces that locked on the board and looked nice. This is all flat cardboard tiles that slide around the board and both look and feel cheap. The previous (1991) edition sells on eBay now for $130, way beyond any reasonable price range. If you love this game, this cheap cardboard version is your only realistic option until the makers finally decide to make a good quality edition again.",3.0
"The game tiles, board, and tile stands are all made of paper. After using few times it will not sustain. Paper board tiles will move on the board making the game messy and inconvenient to manage. Its a shame what they have done to such a brilliant game.",3.0
"This is a good game to kinda get ideas about stock trade. I played this game with my students, and I found that the students who interested in business had more fun playing this game. It takes a little bit time to fulling understand the game and the strategies. It could take long game for one game if everyone is thinking a lot. I had a game lasted 2 hours.
The concept of this game is pretty simple, buying stocks at a lower price and selling them at a higher price, and try to be the majority stockholder to get the bonus. In the end, people who gets the most amount of money wins the game.
It is a good game, but I may not want to play it very often.",3.0
This game was a little fun...not super fantastic although my husband enjoys it a lot more than I do. A few things are different from the original like colors and the names of the hotel chains. A great game for someone who is very detail oriented.,3.0
This D&D board game offers a pretty fun cooperative campaign.  It is compatible with the old 4th edition D&D and not the current 5th edition rules.  It is also compatible with the other similarly shaped and sized D&D board games so you can choose to mix 'em and make your own house rules and campaigns with them.,3.0
"This is a standalone D&D themed board game that you can play with 1 to 5 players. Yes, that means you can play the game by yourself, and I recommend doing so the first time you play so that you can get a handle of the rules and be in a better position to help others in the future. This single player aspect is actually what drew me towards this game. I love D&D, and I love board games, but my wife only occasionally plays games. So this was something I could play on my own. However, I was a bit disappointed that in the scenario booklet that comes with the game there is only a single scenario for 1 player. All of the others say you need at least two people. Bummer.

That aside, the tiles and cards are all excellent quality and I have confidence that they'll hold up well. I was truly impressed with this. Conversely, I was a bit disappointed in the figures. They're made of a soft plastic which is fine for the more solid figures, but doesn't work so well with things like swords that end up being really flimsy and bent in odd angles. They're not poorly made, I'm just not sure the soft plastic is a better choice over a hard plastic.

The game itself is extremely challenging. And I mean *really* hard. I'm sure there are harder games out there, but this is by far the most challenging board game I have ever played. Every single turn you are under attack, there is never any rest. More often than not, you will be under attack from two different sources *every* turn in the form of a monster and an encounter card. Each monster you kill gives you experience which you can 'spend' to counter the encounter cards, but you need 5 exp to do so and monsters give 1-3 exp each and generally take at least 2 turns to kill each and that's if you hit both turns. So, you can counter 1 encounter card every 4+ turns (usually more like 6) however, you also need 5 exp to 'level up' your characters which you can only do if you roll a 20 or get a special treasure card.

My family all found the challenge of this game to be just too much. As an example if you're playing a cleric, who in D&D wears heavy armor and usually a shield, has an AC of 16. Well, most enemies have a +7 to +11 to their attack. That means they have a 60-80% chance of hitting you, and many enemies cause a 'dazed' or 'poisoned' trait to also be added. You don't even want to know about weaker armored units. Numerous encounters and enemies will also do damage even if they do miss (just less than if they hit). Because of these insanely high chances your characters are pretty much *always* loosing health. If even a single hero dies, it's game over. We haven't been able to win a single game yet. Clearly something isn't 'clicking' with anyone of us on just how to win at this game, but the result is that none of us enjoy playing the game and it's now collecting dust.

I can only recommend this game to people who enjoy a tough challenge and want every scenario they play to be a nail biting experience.",3.0
"This game gets some things right. The components are well manufactured and will likely last for many a playthrough, the system is simple and pretty easy to master. Beyond that, it's just mediocre at best. The gameplay is shallow, lacking anything but the most superficial of narratives, the character development/leveling and the combat system are oversimplified to the point of dullness, the environments are monotone, and the theme is superficial. Markers and tiles just feel lifeless and nothing compels the player to keep playing once the thrill of repeatedly rolling a d20 (the ONLY die in the game) wears off (which probably already has or you wouldn't be reading this). Little flexibility in character customization, no damage randomization, a shoehorned encounter system that typically throws out non-sequitur attacks and penalties, and lackluster scenarios that read like 7th grade recess fiction. I will say that the minis included in this game are well modeled and of good quality. I think this is where the game gets its five star ratings. Once the thrill of opening and looking at a box of toys wears off, though, you are left holding one intensely flat gaming experience bag. I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a solid dungeon crawler, because this one is just not quite it.",3.0
I bought this game based on advertising in another game called Lords of Waterdeep.  Wrath of Ashardalon is very different and may not be for everyone.  The game mechanics are quite different and so far I don't feel it has the same level of entertainment as Waterdeep.  One attraction of Ashardalon is that it can be played solo but I feel it is a little too simplistic in its gameplay.,3.0
"About a month ago I began to play dungeons and dragons, I have never played until then and it was interesting. So I was hoping I could brand d&d to my family so I bought this game. This is completely different then role playing. It is way more challenging and not as fun. But ad for a board game it's ok. Very confusing at first and probably still. Hope my rant made sense!",3.0
"It is ok because the game is a tad too mechanic, almost soulless. If you are into hack and slash, then this may be good for you but there is no room for role playing (not even a tiny bit) the cards have the briefest descriptions, and most basic imagery. Neither of which stimulates imagination.

The nice thing about this huge box though are the minis. Tons of very high quality minis...",3.0
"Wife and I played our first co-op crawl and had fun. Single die (1d20) to roll for everything!

Rules leave a little to the imagination witch is a bit frustrating when it comes to board games like this. Not that you'd expect EVERYTHING to have been answered, but there are some empty spaces in the rules that just slow down the game when you can't find what you're looking for and have to ""vote"" on it.

It's been mentioned before, but the tiles are ultra bland. All gray squares or brown squares. Not at all pretty. Functional, but ugly. Also, I tire of the excessive use of ""customized"" counters in these games. TONS of little pieces to keep track of in baggies that would better benefit as extra dice in the box or some form of spinner to dial in my HP. Get creative on how you track consumables in WoA and you'll save yourself some grief. My wife and I use appropriate size dice for health instead of handfuls of ""HP"" chips.

All in all still a really fun game. Minis look pretty good. I think the makers of Descent put more effort in their product in terms of miniature and dungeon tile quality/detail, but that's a competitive game. Get this if you like co-op dungeon crawling. It's still worth it. I'll be getting the follow up, too if that tells you anything.",3.0
"Pros: This game has helped reintroduce me and my friends to table top games.  We now get together to play table top games once a month.  Setup is fairly easy.  Gameplay is quick.

Cons: Rules are vague at times.  After playing three or four dungeons it became boring and we found ourselves.  They try to change things up, but pretty soon every dungeon feels the same.  Also, it is so predictable.  Every room has a monster, drawn from a random card.  I know that a random monster sounds like the opposite of predictable... but you know that behind every tile is a monster, so you plan strategy accordingly.  We moved onto Descent, Arkham Horror, and real D&D.  As well as the Game of Thrones strategy.",3.0
"I have a wife and kids & I don't have time to be apart of a gaming group, thus I really don't play D&D type games. I also live in a rural area where finding people to game with is difficult, especially for people who like something more than party games. Furthermore, I have been really tired of video games and wanted to play some board games as a break from all that.

I stopped playing D&D when I was a teenager, because some idiot would ultimately become the strongest player/character thus intimidating other players and then turning on everyone either killing them, or making them his slave during game play. I eventually quit because I was so unhappy with these confrontations. No matter who the group was, these negative effects seem to occur.

Recently I have been quite interested in the new D&D board games that have been produced by ""Wizards of the Coast"". After watching many reviews on youtube, I decided to take a leap and buy ""The Wrath of Ashardalon"". I like the idea there is no dungeon master and you could play this solo.

Box Opening/First Impressions:
My first impressions upon opening the box was that of a kid at Christmas, with lots of beautiful pieces. Dungeon tiles, to amazing artwork on the cards, very nice looking rule book, etc etc. The figures could be used for your regular D&D games and are high quality for plastic models.

All the components are sturdy and well made which should stand up over time.

Game Play:
I have played many scenarios and I would prefer a bit more narrative. They give you the overall game feel about a village needing help from a dragon and then there is a few sentences about the scenario you have chosen, but not much more.

However, I am a bit disappointed. ""TWoA"" seemed rather simplistic; draw a monster card, move, kill, deal with a ""encounter trap"", rinse and repeat. You don't really gain much XP, treasure or much for killing monsters, traps or any other deed. I have heard this game was BASED upon the 4th Ed. D&D rules. Much of the game play was simplified as well. I guess this is my concern and I have tried to remedy this with some alterations.

Playing games like World of Warcraft and Skyrim has made my idea of what a fantasy gaming should be? Because in many video games there is much more to do to keep you vested.

I know I can hear some people say, that there are other scenarios like ""rescuing villagers"", but really the different scenarios are much the same. I have heard you can use other pieces and elements from the other D&D board games.... but... I just wish there was more depth here.

I have been altering the game to make it more flavorful and interesting like making more Encounter cards. I have taken the 3 good cards in that deck and made more of them (treasure, healing potion). Thus making the characters deal with more than just being attacked at every corner. I also have bought real metal coins for treasure so the ""clinking"" sound of loot makes it more fun. I plan more altering in the future to keep the game fresh and fun.

In Summary:
As Tom Vasel (from the Dice Tower) said in one of his game reviews, ""people often don't like games due to their preconceived ideas they have or what they wish a game would be""... and I would generally agree with that. I do enjoy this game and I appreciate the quality of the game pieces and artwork. This game basically has made it possible for someone like me to run a D&D type game, even if I am a bit disappointed, I still enjoy this game. The price of the game is a bit steep for being so old. Still, the good replay value, the quality of the pieces made it a fairly good deal.

One quick side note: Check out Mage Knight board game (by WizKids), another fantasy game that is awesome and good for single players.",3.0
"My 1st biggest disappointment with this box set is that it needed about double the number of sheets.  There's 10 sheets and they are double-sided, but most of the ""other"" side aren't very imaginative.  In fact, most of them are plain cement tiles.  There are some cool useful tiles, but only one of each.  Such as a bookshelf that's 2x4 but there's only 1 tile like this.  There should have been more doubles of these kind of tiles.  There's a web that's 2x2 but only 1 again.  Really disappointing.  There definitely should have been twice this many sheets.

So if you've got nothing else to decorate your mat this is a good start but if you've already got plenty of decorative tiles you should pass on this.",3.0
"First the good news. Dungeon Tiles Master Set - The Dungeon is nicely packaged. It comes in a box covered in dungeon tile graphics. It also reprints many tiles from out-of-print tile sets. With this one product, you should be able to create a variety of dungeons. The cardboard stock is good and the tiles can be easily separated.

Now onto the bad news. This tile set contains only 10 sheets. The box is large enough for twice that many sheets, so it has a cardboard insert. It's always disappointing when you open a package and half of it is empty space. Most of the tiles are reprints from previous sets. There are some new tiles, and some of the front/back combinations have changed, but the vast majority of tiles are reprints. More new tiles would have been nice for this new release. The graphics on the box is boring. It's the basic gray dungeon square over and over. And actual dungeon would have been cool. Somewhere a mention of this being Dungeon Tiles would have been nice. The box is of such a size that once you punch out the tiles, you cannot lay down the tiles without having gaps. If the box was just a little bit longer, you could have laid down enough tiles to fill the inside dimension. Why do I mention this? Without filling the box, tiles will move around and get banged around. I used previous sets to fill the box. You can stand on end the 2x2 and 2x4 tiles to fill the end gap. The lack of attention to detail is what I find disappointing.

So overall, I would only recommend this set to new DMs. If you have previous sets, skip this purchase.",3.0
"This is a good looking set of generic wilderness tiles, but the variety isn't very good. The old Games Workshop Dungeon and Wilderness Tile sets from the 80s were far superior. Nonetheless, I'm sure they will be useful on the odd occasion; I'm just glad I only paid $20 for the set.",3.0
exactly as billed great purchase,3.0
"The master tiles set was a great idea but as a whole, they're disappointing.  Dungeon (this set) is the most useful in my games because the environment is the most varied. But even this set suffers from esoteric images that I've never used more than once. The Wilderness and City sets are practically useless because the tiles don't have very much variety and I would rather just use a battle mat with wet-erase scenery drawn on. On the plus side, they are well-made, durable, and vibrant. Having a sturdy box to hold them all is also nice.",3.0
Pretty good box. Thought there would be a little more to it.,3.0
"It's an alright enough set, I was expecting some better tiles, like small rooms and such, but for what it has, it gets the job done.",3.0
"There are lots of pieces that come with set that work really well for expanding and fleshing out the other dungeon tile sets.  You can create some interesting maps with this set by itself, but it really works best when combined with other sets.  I would still consider it a must by though, because it gives you so many options when fleshing out dungeons.",3.0
"Three stars or five? Depends. This your first tile set?

First thing, for those who might've missed it -- check Lance's customer images in the upper-left corner of the product page to get a sense of what this box contains. I started to type in a list, only to find he's got it covered (and pictures beat a list any day).

3 stars: I've owned tile sets since forever, I buy a set or two each year maybe, and... I got this thing as a gift. It's okay, it's mediocre. Three stars. You won't find any tiles in it that really inspire you, and you won't find anything in it that lets you construct something inspiring. If you normally use a wet-erase-marker battle mat with inch grids, you'll probably find yourself pulling these tiles out only infrequently (it is nice to have gray bricks or green grass to walk on sometimes).

5 stars: You should buy it if you don't own tiles or a battle mat. Hands down. Five stars. Buy it immediately. (Oh, and if you don't own miniatures, also consider buying the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monster-Vault/dp/0786956313/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monster Vault</a>&nbsp;product just for the sheets of monster tokens.) I say this because, when first assembling a collection of design stuff, quantity makes up for quality. And this has quantity. In something like a decade of tile-buying, I think, I've never seen a decent mediocre-but-not-bad all-purpose starter pack for anywhere near this cheap. There's a fair amount of bulk here. You're getting about *twice* as many usable tiles for the price, compared to the apparently short-lived themed 4e tile sets. I pull these tiles out mostly when bulk constructing a room set, or putting together basic groundwork. If you don't have a plastic battle mat, this set is far cheaper than a single medium-quality battle mat, and you should be able to build all the rooms, hallways, etc. you want, unless you're building some huge labyrinth that will stay put together for multiple gameplay sessions. When you're starting out lots of big basic rooms and connective tiles for passages between the rooms and a handful of tiles for each common D&D setting are *exactly* what you need.

Why I'm going with 3 stars, rather than averaging 3 and 5 to get 4 stars: What the world really needs is a super-huge ""random variety of tons of interesting small odds and ends"" tile set. That would be incredibly valuable; even folks who print tiles off the Internet could use access to random inspiration. And while a few huge rooms and hallways printed from Internet pics can look decent and play well, 1x1 flimsy paper tiles just skid around on a map. I didn't expect this to be that ""tiny random curious things"" tile set, but they could've easily included a couple large sheets of 1x1 and 1x2 new interesting things lying around and charged $2 more.",3.0
"I really like the design, artistry, and variety of the tiles in this set. Unfortunately, there are never quite enough of just that one tile that I need a lot of, such as a room with 10 treasure chests (like a massive version of the money-making-game from Zelda). Understandably, one set can't possibly have all the tiles you need for every encounter, but this set does a decent job. DMs using this set should keep their encounters on the simple side if they don't want to spend half an hour hunting for tiles. I love the fact that you can use wet-erase markers on them!",3.0
"I have quite a few sets of most of the Tile sets that have been released to date.  I was really looking forward to this set and I must say I was disappointed.  Quality-wise, from a materials standpoint its just as good as the all the previous sets, but the tiles were rather boring and uninteresting.  Most I already had from other sets and there was really nothing that made this set stand out or make me say ""cool"".

All in all, I would say a very middle-of-the-road product.",3.0
"This game has two expansions in it.

Skullport kind of sucks

Undermountain is pretty cool",3.0
"I love the base game of Lords of Waterdeep - what a great intro game with awesome theme and as a bonus - easy to teach and learn. I was really excited for this expansion to come out to such a beloved game. Sadly, this expansion was disappointing and I've owned it over a year now. I can honestly say this expansion makes my group of friends not want to play Lords of Waterdeep at all. Not only does it add significant length to the game, but it's just not very interesting, or game changing. I like that there are two different expansions in the box, and you can chose to play with one or both at any given time. I must admit, there are a few really awesome new Lords (which was much needed since Larissa Neathal was clearly overpowered in nearly every base game we'd play.) I think that perhaps there is a bit more added strategy in that in one of the expansions, there's tokens you take that can neg you points. The other expansion just offers larger quest cards and buildings. The board game collector in me will never give this expansion up, but I can say it's not essential to your enjoyment of Lords of Waterdeep.",3.0
"The game play itself is great. I was just surprised at the careless quality control. The game requires you to mix cards from the expansion with the base game. But the new cards are of an ever-so-slightly different size and can make shuffling feel awkward. They're also printed upside down, which isn't a huge deal during the game, but when all is done, you then need to separate out the expansion again. Each expansion card has a tiny little icon that is hard enough to notice as it is, but combine that with a deck where the cards are facing every which way because the upside-down expansion cards make it impossible to maintain any sort of order, and separating the cards gets really annoying. The types of quests are also sometimes different colors than in the base game. If they're following the same design as the original, the cards should have been the easiest things to get right, but they completely botched them. But I'd say still worth your time because it is a good game. I just will dock a star for the stupid cards.",3.0
Wish they were full sheets but still great. My daughter loves stickers,3.0
"The stickers are just like in the photo. Very colorful and comes with 5, long strip of sheets. These are paper stickers and tend to rip off as you peel them off the sheet. What upset me the most is that this sticker pack only cost 1.00 at the POUND store. Which is the same as the $1.00 section at Target!! The price here is ridiculous.",3.0
"The stickers were very cute, and my three-year-old daughter love them. But as far as stickers go, they were not so great. The stickers kept separating themselves from the sheet and it sort of made them difficult to peel. Probably would not order ones like this again. But, like I said the stickers were really cute.",3.0
"The One Ring is a very innovative RPG set in Middle Earth between the time of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.

In order to play it you need occasional reference to die rolls. Specifically, you need a 12 sided die (Called a D12 by the cognoscenti) and up to six regular six sided dice (D6). The game comes with one set, but you will likely need more.

That's what you get in this boxed set: One D12 Feat Die, six D6, all in a black/dark gray on off-white color scheme. I asked about different colors when I bought my set and was told that there are no alternatives to this one. Oh well.

Why can't you use ""ordinary"" dice of that type? You can. You'll need a crib sheet to make the D12 into a proper ""Feat Die"" but other than that you are good to go.

Why bother with these expensive dice then? Well, the D12 Feat Die is properly marked up with opposed faces for the Eye and Gandalf runes for one. That matters to some people. If you use some D12 you have lying around you'll be using the ""11"" and ""12"" faces for those special results and they aren't going to be on opposed faces of the die. Big furry deal, right? But of course, everyone had better be using the *same* faces for those runes if there isn't going to be an almighty real-world fight at some point. The real die avoids this issue.

Also, the D6s are marked up so you can quickly tell the ""1"",""2"" and ""3"" faces from the ""4"",""5"" and ""6"" faces which makes evaluating successes very quick indeed. Not only that, the ""6"" face has a special meaning sometimes and it is elaborated upon with even more detail making for unambiguous and easy recognition of that event, should it occur.

None of these are show-stoppers for using non-specialized dice, but consider: if you introduce a lot of new players to a One Ring game, how much easier is it to explain the mechanics of the die conventions if you are using this set? A convention GM would consider these money well spent I think. I do.

Besides, you should use the right dice for the job or you will annoy and vex the Dice Gods. Nothing good comes of such reckless behavior.",3.0
"Doctor Who: The Card Game was created by Martin Wallace and is published by Cubicle 7 Entertainment. The first edition of this game focused more on the adventures of the Eleventh Doctor while the second edition that we purchased covers the Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh incarnations of the Doctor. The game supports 3-4 players.

The game has players play the role of the Doctor and his Companions as they try and defend the Earth from a whole range of alien adversaries as seen on the show. All players start with a location card, that represents a place that is in need of defending and each location has a declared point value that will come into play at the end of the game.

Players will have a mix of good and bad cards that can be used to defend your locations or to attack other locations. So while you are focused on playing more valuable locations and seeding them with defense cards, you also have a chance to put rival locations under threat, so in this respect players are also playing the roles of the various adversaries of the Doctor. And this is one of those quirks of the system that weirds me out.

Whenever an Attack card is met with a Defend card (which is played face down initially), players then start comparing the numerical values written on the cards to determine who wins the battle. If the Attacker has a higher value, then he gains control of the location until the player can retake it. If the Defender wins, the attacking card is discarded, but in general so is one of the defense cards. This also gets you a Defended token for the location, which counts towards victory. So you can see you'll constantly need to play defense cards in order to maintain your defenses against other players.

The biggest innovation of the system is the fact that cards sort of go back in time since at the end of your turn you need to be able to pass 3 cards to the player whose turn precedes yours. On average you'll have 5 or more cards in hand during your turn so you'll only really get to play two of them unless you spent your time points to draw additional cards. Tie points are earned through locations and other card effects and are generally used to draw more cards during your turn. The passing of cards does allow you a limited degree of strategy as you'll have some idea what cards that player will have once his turn comes around. But the fact that this process goes backwards in terms of play order makes the potential benefit of this ""knowledge"" a little limited.

The game's main redeeming value lies in the cards themselves since they feature various notable characters from the series. The second edition is especially squee-worthy since it involves most of the show's recent history since 2005 save for the more recent developments with the Twelfth Doctor. And the various abilities attached to these cards generally fit well with the characters, which does help make things more fun.

It's really the whole PVP aspect of the game that makes things feel a little weird since you are both defending Earth as the Doctor but also attacking it as the aliens. And why this was the final mechanic for the game confuses me a little since you'd think that they could have figured out a way to balance things out better. Plus the fact that the game requires a minimum of 3 players because of the card-passing mechanic does somewhat limit how easy it is to get a game set up.

Doctor Who: The Card Game is not a bad game, but it's also not quite as fantastic as all of us Whovians hoped it to be. You'll still have fun with it though, at least among your fellow Doctor Who loving friends.",3.0

"This was fun to play with. The magnets aren't as strong as Geomag or Supermag toys, and as a result interesting arrangements can't keep their shape.

"I have been wanting one of these for a year. I finally got it and I was buzzing with excitement! I wanted this because I was tired of being bored in the car so I was hoping that this would solve that problem. It turns out it actually did, for a little bit. Here's why:
PROS:
1) It does use a lot of imagination
2) I like the idea/concept
3) The individual pyramids are a good shape for making
4) I like the ball it makes when all pieces are together, I can even throw it in the air and catch it and it won't break
5) It is very addicting and fun at first, provides days of fun
CONS:
1) The magnets aren't strong, and you can't play with your creations without a piece falling off (I couldn't even shoot some hoops with it!)
2) The pieces get lost very easily if you aren't 101% careful
3) I got very bored of it after the first week of using this (maybe because I used it too much :)
4) There isn't a very wide variety of things to make
5) Can get very frustrating when making something because the magnets misbehave a lot (like ADHD)

After making a few patterns over the course of a few days, you and your kids will grow bored by this thing. It's more like a toy you'd buy on a lark at a dollar store; ""It looks fun, and it's only a buck.""

At this price range, I expect some longevity or some real true fun, and this thing provides neither.

"I heard things about this being a revolutionary creativity toy, and I was born to fiddle with stuff like this. On receiving it, the pieces feel and look really cheap. I know it's a toy, but it's not something I'd be proud to have on my desk.

As for the creativity aspect of the toy: I had a few hours of fun with it, but don't feel there's as much potential as people say. The magnets do not make strong connections unless you have the pieces aligned in a very specific way, which means that more precarious creations will fall apart. I'm having 1000x more fun with my NeoCube, which I ordered at the same time.",3.0
"I've had this toy on my desk for over a year now and have played with it enough to know what it is capable of being molded into.  The oddly shaped design of the pieces means that besides the ball or a diamond-shape, anything else you create is too weakly connected to be handled.  This is because there is only one tiny magnet on each face of the pieces.  For the (high) price of this toy, you could buy several lego sets and have more enjoyment from combining them into various arrangements.",3.0
"I know I'm going against the grain giving this only three stars but it is a little frustrating to work with.

I've had plenty of hands on tactile 'toys' and this one should have delivered but it really falls short in comparison.

The object is to rearrange the pieces to an unlimited amount of variations including 'real' or abstract shapes. The problem is that the magnets are not really strong enough so they tend to slide around way to much to hold a shape. We have made a bunch of star shapes (we being my kids age 6 and 11) but even they are running out of ideas. The best thing is if you drop the ball, it shatters into 30 pieces.

If you like tactile things, I would recommend Bucky Balls (sometimes known as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Magnet-Balls-Magnetic-Ball-Puzzle/dp/B003D7CFTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Magnet Balls - Magnetic Ball Puzzle</a>).

"I recently got two of these balls for my cousins for Christmas. They're 8 and 11 years old and I was excited to see them tinkering with what seemed like a ""brain"" toy.

The ball is well constructed and provides a fair deal of entertainment as you mess around with how the pieces fit together. The packaging includes a nice booklet about the ball and certain shapes one can make. Unfortunately I found these 2D pictures to be next to useless. What's more is that every shape they showed was very similar to the fully assembled ball. And this brings me to the chief complaint.

There just isn't much you can do with these! I tried and tried again with my younger cousins, I'd sit down and say ""Alright, we're going to make something totally different from the ball"" but quite literally every time I tried, I'd come back to the same shape. This is because the pieces are naturally pretty odd and unfortunately don't fit together in lots of interesting ways. And like the other critical reviewer said: if you attempt to make something that doesn't ""lock together"" but is only held together by the magnetic attraction, it will be so slippery and flimsy that you can't do anything with it. The magnets are generally very weak, designed only to pull each piece together for the ball.

At this point, I would immediately recommend my favorite desk toy, a cube of neodymium magnet spheres. However, they're very dangerous for young children prone to swallowing them, and not really worth it for any younger kid that can't keep very good track of all 216 magnets (which is very necessary). So, I'll put the decision on you. If you're an adult, I promise you'll enjoy a magnet cube more. If you're buying for a young kid though, this is a good first foray into the world of magnetic tinkering toys. Just keep the cube in mind when they get a bit older.

Although you might learn something about solid geometry on an intuitive, hands-on level, my fascination with Ball of Whacks plateaued out after about 20 minutes of 3D recreation. It's pricey for the amount of time you might find yourself working with it; I might suggest ShapeScapeS for the neighborhood of $30, for someone who wants an interactive curiosity piece laying around when company comes over.

We have a friend who plays Scrabble this way which sucks all the fun right out of it. We enjoy Five Crowns - same company - much more!",3.0
It is an OK game.,3.0
cards don't seem like thell hold up for ang length of time,3.0
We prefer the other SET Enterprises games.,3.0
Bought this cause it reminded me of Harry Potter but unfortuantely I was a lil old for it...i will prob giveaway to the younger kids.,3.0
I honestly cannot give you an honest review since I bought this for a Christmas gift and have nopt heard any feedback from it!,3.0
It is a little confusing to use at  first.  We will try to use it again and reread the directions.,3.0
Didn't find the instructions to be very clear. Have heard good things about this word game and plan to enjoy playing it when instructionbs are deciphered.,3.0
I expected the card game to be a little more difficult than it is.  We wrote new rules to make it more challenging but only played it once or twice.,3.0
"Way too complicated for a kids toy.  We threw away the instructions and basically played Rummy with it, but spelled words.  I could see this being a fun drinking game for adults but my nephew lost interest pretty quickly.  The cards seem durable.",3.0
"Quiddler is an exceptionally easy make-words game. It is good fun for families with pre-teen kids, and there is just enough to the game to enable the parents to enjoy the experience in the family group setting. But 3-4 adults playing with no kids would be bored by this game.
Why play Quiddler when your kids could play BananaGrams with you instead?

The game is like the Rummy card games, except there is no playing off the cards layed down by anyone (remember, Quiddler is simple, even simplistic). Unfortunately, there are no big point swings in who is winning vs losing. In Rummy games the leading player can get stuck with lots of penalty points in the next round. In theory that can happen in Quiddler, but in practice that is rare.

The cards are of high physical quality, except for one problem: the point values printed on the letter cards are in an unnecessarily small font. This means that a person who benefits from reading glasses cannot play without the glasses. There was plenty of space on the cards to make the point values larger.

A possible flaw in the rules is that the game sometimes motivates you to not want to form All your cards into words and succeed in getting rid of all your cards. In the few times we played, luckily we did not hit a case where every player was unwilling to end the round. The underlying cause of this flaw relates to my earlier comment that players rarely get stuck with several unplayable cards in their hand, for which they would suffer many penalty points.

From this same company, their game SET is better.",3.0
"Good for a couple fast games, but much better if played creatively with house rules: the original rules get old pretty quickly.",3.0
It took quite a while to figure out how to play this because the directions are very poorly written.  I think we are finally playing the way that it was intended; just hope we can remember the next time we bring it out.,3.0
"This card game is a great exercise if you want to show off your broad knowledge of 2- and 3-letter words.  It is like scrabble.  My family played with 7 people, but it took a while to learn the rules collectively.",3.0
"I am a huge fan of Scrabble.  I bought Quiddler so my girlfriend and I could play it together, thinking it would be Scrabble-like.  Unfortunately, for seasoned Scrabble players who know most 2-letter words in the Scrabble dictionary (ab, mu,mi, xu, ...) this game is boring:  the reason is that one can do a ""lay down"" of all their cards on the first or second turn practically every time.  If you are a Scrabble player who regularly scores in the high 300s and who knows a lot of 2-letter and 3-letter words, I doubt you will enjoy this game, because it is all luck and no strategy.

However, for kids, or others who don't know the many 2-letter and 3-letter words in the Scrabble Dictionary, this game may indeed be fun.",3.0
This game was interesting and fun to play. It was a bit complicated four our 7-year-old; but making the small words was still fun for him. Might be more interesting and competitive among a group of adults.,3.0
Kids had fun!,3.0
somewhat fun but not very exciting,3.0
"I got this as a stocking stuffer for my husband for us to play. I thought it would be a thought provoking game where we would discuss the question, but instead found we would just ask it , answer it and move on. Probably more our fault than the game but doesn't really give us much of a sense of ""fun""",3.0

It was disappointing for the niece who received this game.",3.0

"3-1/2 stars. I bought these cards on a whim for a dinner party, that actually ended up being cancelled do to storms. Later I would discover this isn't the sort of question an answer game you wish to play while eating or drinking because of the hazards of choking. Because of laughing and maybe some gagging if you have a weak constitution more than  once I asked  what, was that? Unsure that I heard the question right. It's an okay.",3.0
The kids had a good time with this game.good for a group to get the laughs going. Easy to plat.,3.0
"Bought this for a 17 year old girl.  Cards are probably more appropriate for tweens or younger teens, esp with today's technology, these cards just didn't hold an older teens interest.",3.0
I didn't realize that this was just a little card game (no bigger than a deck of cards). And my grand-daughter already had a copy.,3.0
This was a stocking stuffer for my husband and we have yet to use it but it's kind of an odd game and you lose interest in it kind of quickly.,3.0
"We played this game as a family over Thanksgiving.  There should be a way to randomize which question is asked off every card.  Otherwise, what happens is children in the 8-11 year old age range ask all the questions that have to do with nudity and/or bodily functions.  The fun quickly pales for adults.

If we were playing it again, we would probably set up a randomization system -- colored straws or colored disks to draw, and then ask the question.

Some of the discussion is fun, and I think some of the value of playing with a family is that older people can sort of show younger people how decisions can be complicated.",3.0
"PLayed on bus trip.. KInda boring. Not especially for adults, i guess.",3.0

It's a good game for a 7 year old grand-child who loves to play board games and cards. Easy to travel with.,3.0
"I wish that the individual compartments could not come apart. It should just be one piece and not 3, that way you don't need to keep holding them together with the rubberband. It just makes it kind of inconvenient.",3.0
"We love the concept and it's worked as far as teaching my daughter the basic idea of Saving, Spending and Sharing, but I think a little more money could have been put into the actual product itself. I feel a little ripped off for what I paid and what I got, but I do feel like it was worth it, if only to teach my daughter these valuable financial and life lessons.",3.0
"Good customer service, but the elastic band that comes with the three jars (to hold them 3 in place together) does not last over 6-8 months. I first thought it was the sun hitting on it through the window, so I moved it away, but the replacement ones that were sent to me by the company (free of charge- thank you) did end up the same way months after replacements. Otherwise, it's a good educational tool and works quite well.",3.0
"A good teaching aid but I think the price is a little high so only giving 3 stars for good education and 2 stars off for being too expensive. Honestly, I was forced to buy this. Otherwise, I would've just buy 3 different piggy bank at a much lower cost that would do the same thing.",3.0
"I loved the idea of these, but unfortunately the execution isn't great.  The lids are very difficult to get off, and once you take them out of the cardboard sleeve, they don't hold together, so you end up with three separate and oddly-shaped containers.  It's okay.",3.0
Not what I thought. I do like the multiple slots as we teach our children about the different important things to do with money but the jar isn't connected. The three colors are separate and only held together with a big band. I wish they were held together better than that. Besides that it works fine. You can remove the lid from each of the canisters.,3.0
The kids like it,3.0
"I love the concept of this... I do. And this looked really nice from the picture. But the piggy bank actually separates and the yellow stripe around it is a rubber band... not a fan of it. It just seem like for the price, it should be held together better.

Each section does open easily by an adult, but my toddlers haven't figured that out and I don't think they'd be able to do so easily which is nice (it's kept out of their reach so we haven't put that to the test).",3.0
For the price I wish it was a bit larger and sturdier.,3.0
Good learning tool.,3.0
"I really like it but mine didn't come with a rubber band OR a passbook, so I'm a little annoyed.",3.0
"I like the idea of a child's bank that has separate compartments for saving, spending, and giving. However, this bank is actually 3 separate banks which are held together with a rubber band. Needless to say, my child lost the rubber band, and now the 3 banks just clunk around on the shelf.

Rating it a 3 because, yeah, it's just OK. I really wish Amazon would have had a single bank with 3 columns in stock when I ordered.",3.0
"We've had this bank for about a year now, and I just noticed that the rubber band is deteriorating.  When putting the band back around the three jars, I noticed cracks and splitting in the band.  It won't be long before it breaks completely.",3.0
"Let be begin by saying we received this promptly. I was a bit disappointed when I saw the quality for the money spent. Cheap, easily destroyed plastic.",3.0
"As many others have stated, for the price you can probably make something yourself, but the concept and design are nice.  Helpful kit for teaching young kids about money.",3.0
"This is a nice and attractive bank, but it's just tin, and in retrospect, since I shopped for this item in an attempt to help my son save and manage his money, a wiser move would have been to save the $25 and create our own bank using empty cans or jars. You could decorate three cans or jars with felt or fabric and they would do the job just as nicely. At 5 my son could care less if the money were kept in a fancy or man-made bank, but he would've had fun creating his own bank and I would've felt a little less guilty not having spent $25 + shipping and handling on this. The plus is that the 3 sections fit together nicely and thus do not take up much space. I'd give this a higher rating (for the value) if it cost $10 less.",3.0
Really excited to receive my game. But unfortunately the outside of the box was damaged when I received it. A corner is basically ripped off. Im sort of a board game freak so this made me sad.,3.0

"Me and my wife bought Ticket To Ride as our Christmas board game and we loved it; its simple enough that it only takes 10 minutes to read the rules and get started, but there is still plenty of strategy involved to win the game which is great for my families competitive nature. The only complaint I have is how poorly the game was quality controlled. We take very good care of our board games and always put the pieces back in the plastic bags they come in. This game came brand new with a dented box, printing defects all over the board, and an inconsistent number of trains in each bag. We didn't notice the difference in trains until our first play-through and counted them.

Pros:
-Simple rules for quick understanding of the game
-Quick 45-60 minutes to play
-Strategy based with some elements of lucky drawing
-Fun for adults

Cons:
-Quality control (see images)",3.0
"LOVE THE GAME. I took off two stars because when I received the game and unwrapped the shrink wrap, everything on the inside of the box was covered in a fine white powder, like baby powder. It was really strange and a little unsettling.",3.0
"Like the game, however wherever this came from the box was already damaged.  It appears as if it was crushed.  For that, i am deducting stars.  The game itself is definitely worth 5 if them though!",3.0
"In terms of gameplay, I really enjoy this game and I think it's a lot of fun. Simple, yet lots of strategy involved. The reason I am giving it 3 stars instead of 5 is because the game didn't come with the correct number of pieces. There are suppose to be 45 train pieces/color (plus 2-3 extras), but only one of the 5 colors came with the correct number of pieces. I had to convert some of my extra blue pieces into ""yellow"" pieces because even with the extras, I did not have 45 yellow trains. Other than this production error I have no qualms with the game.",3.0
Giftee liked it.,3.0
"The cards are very small. Not sure why, but it does make reading them and playing take a longer for folks with bad eyes.
Some of the trains weren't molded properly either. There are several partial train pieces, and some trains with holes in them. Still works good, just not visually or aesthetically pleasing.",3.0
"It's a cool game if you wanna be around friends and family and have nothing else to do.
Gets boring after a few times but still an exciting game.",3.0
We actually just opened this game up and realized we received two bags of black trains instead of one black and one blue. -.-,3.0
"I've played this game and love it, however, it arrived defective. It came with an incomplete set of cards; specifically, it had the correct *number* of cards, but half of the cards were repeats! This makes the game completely unplayable, as half of the train car card colors were missing (we only have blue, orange, yellow, and white; missing black, red, green, pink, and wild cards).

This was particularly disappointing since we had planned a special game night, but were unable to play the game!

Amazon was helpful in rectifying the situation as best they could; we were unable to contact the game company directly because the phone number was based in France.",3.0
"Ticket to Ride is okay.  It's obviously a gateway game.  At the time that I bought it, I was new to the euro gaming scene.  I didn't buy it because I was on the fence about wanting to play such games, but because it was known to be such a popular game.  Since having bought and played so many deeper euro games, I kind of wish that I hadn't bought this one.  Sure, it's a good game, but definitely for the lighter gamer.  Still recommended, though.",3.0
"The game itself is very fun, however the copy I received contained multiple misprinted route cards with the cities labeled not matching the cities pictured. Unfortunately by the time I had an opportunity to break my copy out the return period had passed. I would rate it a 5 if not for the faulty cards. Buyer beware and don't assume your game will arrive without flaws.",3.0
"So we love the game. However, my 3 stars comes from the fact that our game came with no little colored wood markers that you move around the outside of the board. We had to steal from our monopoly game pieces. What really makes me angry, is that we gave this as a gift, but by the time we all opened it to play it for the first time, that's when we noticed the missing pieces.(not going to open a box to inspect inside for missing pieces before I gift it to someone) however, the time to return/exchange was already past, so we are stuck with an incomplete game.",3.0

More than half the objective cards were inaccurate.,3.0
"Nice game with quality pieces and game board. Good for teaching children planning/goal setting, organizing and implementation. It was an expensive game in comparison to my usual game purchases.

The game is wonderful. Santa brought it for my children for Christmas and we have played it about 10 times. The problem is that the top of the box has already had two of the corners split. Only my wife or I open it. This is frustrating for a game that should last for years.,3.0

"Gameplay: You collect trains cards until you have enough of a set and then play your trains to connect cities. Each connection scores points. Route cards connecting two cities (ex. LA to Miami) on a longer route through many additional cities (ex. LA to El Paso to Houston to New Orleans to Miami) will give you bonuses when the full route is complete (or penalties if not).

The Goods:

It's fun. Not first or second or third choice fun, but it's fun.

Replay is there due to the randomness of route cards.

Light game. Not a lot of strategy so really anyone probably 12+ can pick up and play without much explanation.

Probably a good intro to someone who has never played anything other than Monopoly or Risk (although I'd suggest base set Carcassonne to that person).

The Gripes:

It's basically just Rummy with trains.

The cards are tiny. So small in fact that it is impossible to shuffle. You have a huge stack of over 200 cards half the size of a Post-It and are somehow supposed to get these cards shuffled? Way to cheap out on the cards Days of Wonder. Then I'm expected to purchase an expansion set to get the exact same cards (with a couple extra routes) only full size?! Nope. Big money grab.

30-60 minute play time is a bald-faced lie. Unless that means PER PERSON. Then it is pretty accurate. If you rush though you could get 30 minutes per person. To me, a light game with light rules should have a light playing time. The longer games should be complicated.

8+ is out and out wrong. While it's not that difficult for an adult or teenager, an 8 year old struggles to draw cards and compare that with his/her 3 route destination tickets connecting cities like Los Angeles to Miami and Winnepeg to New Orleans and Dallas to New York. Can an 8 year old really decide if it's better to connect LA to Phoenix or Dallas to Houston or Dallas to Little Rock? No. An 8 year old can play this game, but an 8 year old can never win this game. And a group of 8 year olds playing would struggle mightily. (I will add 8 year olds and even younger can play Carcassonne successfully.)

Not very satisfying (if that makes sense). Regardless of whether or not you win, you have the sense of ""well now that's over"".

Bottom Line:

If you just love trains... Buy it.

If you want an intro game... Go for it.

If you want a game people will ask to play... Skip it.

If you want a TRUE family game (8+ but adults love it too)... Buy Carcassonne.

All in all, good but not great.",3.0
My grans and their friends love it.  MM,3.0
Rather long and slow.,3.0
"This game is very simplistic and the gameplay isn't all that fun. We were very excited to get it because we love trying new games. Basically, each turn takes between 1 and 3 seconds and you take like 200 turns trying to make a railroad on a limited number of spaces while other people are trying to make a railroad as well to different cities. The problem is that there is very very little strategy involved because there are so many ways in which you can build a railroad that it's nearly impossible to block someone. So everyone just connects the cities on their cards and basically whoever started with the highest randomly drawn point cards wins the game.

If you have young kids though this is a great game because of how easy it is, the rules are simple. As long as your child won't try to eat the plastic trains, they are old enough for this game.",3.0

"This is a better game than my score might indicate. I am disappointed in changes that have occurred since the original game came out, I wish I had realized they had modified the game play... I would have found an older used game.
My biggest complaint is in regards to the tiny little game cards used in this version, for the price they should be standard playing card size.",3.0
The game itself is great but the box arrived with a huge 6 inch rip at the bottom of the box. Super embarrassing to give as a gift for Christmas.,3.0
"Other reviews probably give a better overview of the rules. They are basic: draw matching cards, play them to make trains. This is a simple game to play, and does not punish the novice for participating. However, that does not mean it is easy to win.

To understand the game, here are a few salient points of strategy:

1) Resources come in the form of randomized cards, and there is no maximum hand size. Resource control, or card advantage, is an important part of many games, and the game rewards you most greatly for holding out to lay larger sections of track at once.

2) Your gameplay is mostly dictated by the ticket cards you must choose between at the beginning of the game. If you do not carefully plan ahead at this stage, you will lose to the person who has done so. This game does not reward spontaneity, but planning and diligence.

3) Certain portions of the board easily crowd. Your actions will conflict with other players' actions. Other portions crowd more slowly, but once a route is closed off, there are few other options.

4) Do not rely on the ticket cards to win you the game. Pay attention to other ways to score.

5) This game is not chess. It is highly random and sometimes frustrating. Play it for the company.",3.0
"Kids would give this game 5 stars. Mom would give this game 1 star. Kids say it is a lot of fun, but the mom can't stand to listen to all the fighting and yelling this game creates.

"It is fairly obvious after playing 5 or so games that whoever gets a cross-country route is virtually guaranteed the win.  It makes the expansion pack very appealing.

"I used to own Ticket To Ride.  Then I discovered the Trans Europa board game and it's much better.

Ticket to Ride has a lot of pieces that are pretty nicely made.  And the game was fun in the beginning... but eventually, after 10 games or so, I realized many people adopt the same strategy of ""hoard cards.  Make all your moves at once to win.""  After you realize that... it's not so amazing any more.

If you like/love Ticket to Ride, I highly recommend the Trans Europa board game.  The concept is the same, building tracks to connect cities, but it has fewer pieces, the rules are simple enough to play with a 6-year-old, and it's waaaay more fun.  When someone wins in Trans Europa, everyone all goes ""ooooh!! I was *soooo* close to winning!"".  Because the rules to Trans Europa pretty-much mean the games will always be close at the end.  Plus, the games are shorter, so you can play a couple times and get that fun ""sooo close"" feeling again and again.

Ticket to Ride is good.  Trans Europa is Better.  (last time I moved, I gave away Ticket To Ride and brought Trans Europa to my new home.)",3.0
I had played the game settlers of catan and was excited to try this game out. It is fun and a good game to play with those who do not like to play strategy type games. That said there is really not much to this game just collect colors and place the tiles on the board. Games like Settlers allow a little more variety by having you collect multiple items and being able to trade with others. I would like to try to Europe version which is said to add more variety into the game. Overall a fun game that is very simplistic in nature.,3.0
"Not my favorite game, but it's ok. The mechanics are good and it stands the test of time by being just as enjoyable the second, third, or tenth time as it was the first. My biggest ache with this game is that you have to spend so much time concentrating on what you want to do that you don't really interact much with the other players. For a game with such simple mechanics, it should be more inviting. If I'm going to play a game, it's just as much for the company as it is for the game itself.",3.0
"I don't want to sound like a complete pessimist here. I still did enjoy this game pretty well, and I love board games of all types! I was just disappointed to buy and play such a highly acclaimed game to find that the mechanics don't allow you to do much.

I play a wide array of games with lots of different people, so i know that casual games do have their place. My group has found that games like Pandemic or King of Tokyo are still simple enough to draw new people, and they allow for more fun game play. Ticket to Ride is a pretty good family game, and it could still be fun to play with groups of friends... I'm just looking for more in a game.

Even some of the people who were new to games didn't feel that there was a lot you could do in Ticket to Ride and didn't find it very exciting. I know lots of people love this game however, and it may be good for other personalities. I would rather go for games like Pandemic, Carcassonne, King of Tokyo, Castle Panic, Scotland Yard, etc... I always loved train games too though, so this game will still be played, it was just a little disappointing.",3.0

"Bought it because my wife and play a lot of games together.  It has a lot of hipe.
It is interesting and some fun, however not very challenging for us (age in 70's).  Maybe better for group play than for two.",3.0
"Not the best nor not the worst. From other reviews I was expecting more strategy but all it is, is basically picking up cards and laying trains on the board. Would not tell people go out and buy this. Definitely would not have spent that much money on it had I known that's all it was. Other reviews were misleading. My 4 years old grandson does enjoy playing with the trains laying them on the tracks. So I guess it was ok as it entertains him for a little while.",3.0
"I got this game, in part, to helps 5th grader with his geography skills.  It is definitely going to achieve that, but it does take awhile to play with kids.  Plan on about 90 min. Instead of the 30-60 that it says on the box.  Good game though.  My 2nd grader loved it .",3.0
"I chose this game because I was tired of hearing grandchildren play Monopoly.  After playing several times, they became bored with it.  It was an expensive fail for me, but probably it's a good game for kids who love games.",3.0
Good Idea But a complicated game to learn and the scoring is extremely complicated. We have played it three times. and just about have the hang of it !,3.0
Several components of the game are missing compared to Europe version. I would not recommend this one. Europe version is great!,3.0
Much easier to read the cards and play the game.  Will be buying for each family this year for xmas.,3.0
For all the talk about how great this game was i found it to be pretty boring and rely on luck more than i would prefer.,3.0
"Purchased to do with my 8 yr old son who loves trains.  We were overwhelmed by initial set up and figuring out what we are supposed to do. We never completed the game. There were 3 of us, two adults and my son to play.  We will try again another time.",3.0
"The game itself is OK.  It's simple and easy to explain, and there are some interesting interactions.  I do enjoy the geography aspect of it.

My first complaint is the game play seems a little too slow.  In our games, we probably all spend around 10 - 15 turns at the beginning just taking cards, building up massive hands that are difficult to hold and sort.  Taking train cards 2 at a time, with 8 different colors, it just takes such a long time to get the 5 cards of one color you want to start laying track.  It seems like the 5 face up cards quickly get to being 5 cards that no one wants, so they just sit there unused for the most part.  People build up massive hands because they are hesitant to reveal where they are going until they can build multiple routes at once, for fear of starting, then getting blocked.

My second complaint is that the plastic train pieces are cheap and too light.  Because they are so small and light, they are a little difficult for an adult to manipulate.  I would have much preferred painted wooden pieces like the roads in Settlers or the pieces in Agricola.  These plastic train pieces just give an overall below average tactile experience.",3.0
"The game looks like a good way to teach youngsters some geography. But the complexity of the rules and the poorly-written instructions will rule out all but Mensa-qualified kids under twelve and certainly intimidate most others. Older kids who might finally figure out how to play will probably find the game itself a bit juvenile. And the smart-phone ""app,"" grossly-overpriced at $1.99, which purports to explain the game to newbies is totally bogus.",3.0
This book is geared for older children and even adults.  The stories are good but not appreciated by most young children.,3.0
"After reading some of the reviews before purchase, I had pretty high expectations that my family and I would like this board game.  I'll tell you up front, I am not a board game person, but was looking for something a little different and a lot different than the violent video games that PS3 only seems to have available.  It seems PS3 video games are mostly violent, but that's another review.  Anyway, my 10 year old and I started playing the game.  It took about 10-15 minutes to read through the instructions, set up and begin playing.  Game play is relatively easy, once you get the instructions and for me, it was a little mindless, once you got into it, but relatively fun.  Actually, I was a bit bored, but my son seemed to like it for a few minutes.  And that's all we needed because after about 20 minutes, we were finished and I was handily defeated.  Overall, it's an ok game, but as I said, I've rarely enjoyed board games as a whole.  It is easy to set up and easy to play and probably would be more fun with more than two players.  The game itself looks well-made.  The graphics on the board and cards are well-done and do not look cheap.  The box is printed in several languages (on the same box), so initially, that confused me thinking I was purchasing the non-English version.  Although we should now be used to having more than just English words printed on most all things that we purchase these days, it was still a bit confusing to me.",3.0
"The game itself is of high quality, but after reading the directions, it proved too difficult to play with older people and younger kids so we will wait until we are with people our own age who are able to get the strategy of the game.",3.0
"My aunt likes this game so sometimes I get roped into playing it.  I guess there is some strategy involved.  You get to make choices like which color card to select and how aggressive to be keeping the rail line cards you have to build.

But then it just feels like you are playing it alone.  I don't often find myself fighting with another player to get a specific line, even with 4 or 5 players.  There are lots of alternate ways of building the lines so even if it happens you can get around it.  The most interactive part usually involves two people dueling to get the longest contiguous rail line which scores extra points.

I think the fact that you don't truly know what the score is also hurts the competitive spirit.  You can't calculate whether you are winning or not since you don't know how many cards the other players can score.  You just have a general idea, so you don't know when you should start making risky plays to catch up--but honestly, when the game is close to finishing you don't really have an opportunity for risky play--the risk is mostly in the rail lines you keep that you have to build (because not finishing them means you lose points.)

I guess I just feel like there are better solitaire games I could play instead.  And if I have a group of people together I'd rather play something interactive.  (Pinochle, Fury of Dracula, heck even Monopoly has more excitement.)",3.0

"Hi,

This is my review for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ticket-To-Ride/dp/0975277324/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ticket To Ride</a>.

I know that there are a lot of people there who love this game. Unfortunately I don't feel this way.
You have to pick up a lot of cards in this game, and it becomes boring. I also don't think it requires a lot of skill to win the game. It can be a good family game if you intend to play with your grandmom or your really small child as I'm guessing even the children need more stimulus than this game can offer.

Anyway,this is my opinion and I have to mention that I played the game on 3 players until now. MAYBE it will become more interesting in 5 players, but i doubt it.
And it is pretty expensive from my point of view.
So if you are looking for a stimulant board game, my advice is to keep looking.",3.0
"I bought this to play with relatives over Thanksgiving & we all found it intriguing.  But...I was expecting it to be more fun to play & it wasn't.  You had to focus on your cards & the routes that other players were taking.  There didn't seem to be any element of surprise or fun.  It can introduce children to strategy & risk & make them think more about geography & distance in traveling, but there's very little math & not much skill involved.  And there are so many game pieces (trains) that can get lost.  In the end, I would have rather chosen a party game to play than this board game & it would likely have cost less, too.",3.0
"PROS: Easy game to learn, Educational for US. Geography, Moderate luck factor.
CONS: Not recommended for avid game players. Only moderate strategy.

Ticket to ride is fun, it's got some strategy to it, but I've played better. In fact, the European version adds a few more variants that greatly improve on the game. I would recommend this game for beginners. For highly competitive game board fanatics, one or two plays of this version and you'll move on. Best just to skip to the European version.",3.0
Easy & fun game for awhile. But does get repetitive and boring. Catan or Roborally better choice for the money.,3.0

Super expensive for what it is. The elf is tiny. I admit the presentation is very nice. It comes in a beautiful decorative box with a book explaining to kids how to act with the elf and the history behind it.

"Kids are loving this tradition but with so many tutorials out there explaining how to put wire in your elf's arms and legs so it bends, and Velcro on it's hands so it can do more, why haven't they come out with a newer version that does not require people to jerry rig their elf so it does these things?",3.0
"It's a nice presentation, but should cost like $19.99. Elf is decent quality, but you can see all the glue lines and cheap stitching. There are no wires in the Elf, so not as posable as I expected. Buy the cheaper ones available on amazon if you don't need or want to book. The book is cute until you get to the full page illustration of praying childern, no good way to skip this part without having to explain what they are doing. The book is still usable but if you don't want introduce your kids to religion, you can to glue the pages together. The story still makes sense. I was hoping for no religious message. We love Christmas but prefer to keep it secular. Please don't post a bunch of hater ""war on christmas"" responses.  I have no problem with merry xmas, or with others having a religious celebrations.

"First off, I LOVE elf on the shelf.  So this year when we couldn't find out elf, I quickly reached out to my friend Amazon to get one here in time.  Now here's the down side, I ordered the exact same elf (listed on our box). So imagine our surprise when my daughter came down eagerly looking for ""buddy the elf"". She instantly stopped , stared at the new elf and said that's not buddy!  To make a long story short, we found the original buddy cleverly hidden away in a closet that no one goes in.  We compared the two eleven and she was right.  THEY CHANGED THE ELFs just a tad.  But enough for a little girl who will spend hours whispering to her jovial friend.  She named the new elf lucifer, and he will probably show up next year to make buddy pulled more outrageous pranks.",3.0
Love the elf! Wish the legs had wire or something in them to keep them stiff,3.0
"Before Christmas we saw these everywhere. On a whim, my husband bought one from Target, but he didn't realize the plush one was not the same as this one, so he went and got this one here on Amazon. Once we got it, we did a few shots with it, but got bored fairly quickly, so he got put on the tree and remained there until it was time to take the tree down. Maybe we'll try again this year, but we'll see. It's a fun idea, I like seeing all the photos on social media of what mischief the Elf is up to, but I just don't think it's for my family. As for quality, the body is made of what feels like cheap felt and I really wish his limbs were moldable/positionable with internal wires or something so that it would make posing much easier - maybe then we would have used him more, but I guess we're to lazy to do it manually!",3.0

"I love everything about the Elf tradition except that Elf is not posable.  You have to insert wire into his arms and legs which is hard to do now that they sew elbow and knee joints in.  Without the wire he will just lay there.  So be prepared to do a little Elf surgery and have some wire handy, floral wire will work.  Once I get mine past the joints I'll let you know how, if I can do it without unstitching.",3.0
The case arrived with the elf loose in the box.  The wires that hold him were undone.  The stickers were unattached showing that someone previously owned/opened this elf.  The elf and the box were in good condition.  The book was also in perfect condition.  I wasn't going to be picky and return the product since there was nothing wrong with the elf or book.  My kids love the elf so I'm not going to give a bad review.,3.0
"This seemed like a good idea at the time, nice tradition....until you are in the the thick of it.  The biggest issue is that the book makes the rules and you are then stuck moving this thing every single night for basically a MONTH...night after night after night.  You WILL forget to move it...more than once...more then twice...many, many times.  You will become an expert liar!!  Um, he didn't move because the weather was so bad last night...your behavior wasn't good yesterday so he stayed to give you another chance, he's sick...etc.  We have had ours for 7 or 8 years and I have considered some evil options to dispose of him.  (mwah ha ha) For me, it would be more manageable if it was only out for a week or two, but the authors of the book take away the option of making your own time frame.  I tried to hold off this year until a week before Christmas but our son saw an elf at someone else's house and then wondered where ours was, why didn't he show up the day after Thanksgiving?  Luckily our nephew suggested that maybe they only come if you have your tree up.  BRILLIANT, that is what the book should say!  If you put your tree up the day after Thanksgiving and love everything Christmas, then that works for you...if you put your tree up much later, then you don't have to worry about this elf for a full month!  BURN THE BOOK and make up your own time frame.  I am signing off...to go stage a skiing accident.",3.0
"We had a mishap and our lovely one-eyed Pitbull was jealous and decided our elf Rocko should look like him.  He ate his face.  We had to order a new one.

We had to tell our daughter that Mrs. Claus fed our elf too many cookies and he gained a little weight overnight when my daughter noticed he looked different!

"This elf is really cute and we decided to name him dash. He is fun but I believe he needs feet and hands to do more with him, There are so many rules that come w him and my kids question how he is able to do the things he does. Not so sure they believe he's magical. It's fun for really young kids though",3.0
Very cute but his collar came unglued.  Fortunately I was able to repair with my hot glue gun but a little disapp,3.0
"Never in my life have we felt so threatened by this sketchy toy. We tied it to 8 balloons and let it go because we were scared to dispose of it any other way, fearing it may haunt us for ever.",3.0
"I think this is a really cute idea, and I like the book (despite some of the illustrations appearing a bit ""messy""). However, I do wish the elf was a bit better quality and perhaps a bit more decorative. It's so dull-looking; it reminds me of something you'd buy at a craft store that is intended to be decorated. And the quality is... well, dollar store quality. But I guess it serves its purpose. I only wish I could get my 3-year old son to be as interested in it as I am. :(",3.0
"Before I bought it, I showed a picture of the doll to my 3 year old asking him if it looked friendly or scary as it does look a bit creepy to me. He said friendly so I went ahead and ordered it. I hadn't read the book before and I have to say I didn't care for it at all because:
1-The writing isn't great, the rhyming is poor. No Dr Seuss here.
2-I don't really like the message that the elf is there to spy on you and report to Santa....especially when most parents make the elf do naughty things like TPing the Christmas tree, how does that make sense that the Elf gets to be cheeky yet kids have to be on their best behaviour?
3-The Christian aspect of it...ok sure it is Christmas, a Christian holiday but they would reach a wider audience without it.
So...the reason I'm not hating this product in the end is that my kids love to go look for the Elf each morning. I just plop him in a different spot every day (guarding the christmas cookies or presents, holding the TV remote etc) where he's just helping to make sure everything goes smoothly and everyone's happy.
Now if I catch him plotting with Woody and Buzz on how to destroy Christmas, I will not hesitate to burn it. Burn it with fire.",3.0
"This thing has a painted, molded plastic head plus 20 cents worth of felt and stuffing. It is not ""poseable"" really - you have to find some way to fix it in place for a lot of hiding spots. Still, my kid genuinely loves looking for it every morning. I wish it was priced more around the $15 or so it seems to be worth with the book, but I guess her joy makes it worth the $30 I paid.",3.0
"I really just wanted the elf so that I could mess with my husband.  For what it is, it is ridiculous expensive.  The elf is simply a plastic head attached to a felt body.  I might have been okay with paying that price IF the elf had wire in its limbs so that it was easier to pose.",3.0
It's a great idea and the kids love him. The more creative parents are the more fun the kids have with it. The only negative for me was its $21.00 price tag. I feel it should have been under 10. But I would buy another.,3.0
This elf was created by the CIA and NSA to help brainwash younger children it'd okay to be always watched by big brother. It teaches that it is not okay to question the magic and touching him will cause bad things to happen.,3.0
"It's everything you would expect to get with an elf on the shelf, however when I received mine there was a rattling noise inside the elf's head. Something is loose inside his head rattling around. Other than that, it's exactly what I ordered. The rattling noise isn't worth me sending the elf back, but if I had bought this at a physical store, I would have exchanged it.",3.0
The book is great and it was packaged nicely bit the elf itself was pretty generic. I thought the quality was very cheap. I could have done a better job buying fabric and making one.  I wouldn't have paid full price for it.,3.0
The item is great but it arrived with the elf on the shelf box binding was ripped about 3 inches.  It still latches shut but It isn't going to last the long haul. I will have to tape it...That was disappointing.,3.0

For a $30 stuffed doll you should be able to pose it however you want. I was expecting it to be bendable but it isn't. So if I want to make a Pinterest project out of it and spend another $10 I can insert wire into each arm and leg and glue a little velcro on the hands and call it good but I feel like this is such a waste of money. Half the time you wake up at 3 a/m and realize you forgot to move the dang thing. Kids did like searching for it each morning though ;),3.0

"I purchased this doll because so many of my friends were using it with their kids and having a blast with it.  Unfortunately, as soon as my son saw it he was a little freaked!  He said it is scary looking.  Maybe it is kinda creepy.  He did not like the doll or got into it so I put it away.  Maybe it's not for every child...  Great idea though.",3.0
"For the price, I expected a little more. He is made out of felt and he doesn't even have feet.",3.0
I like the idea and love the book but I find the elf to be very cheep in construction. I'm not sure how long its going to hold up.,3.0
"Actually, no problem with the book and video (which I bought last year), but the fact that the figure of little Chippy appeared on the shelf literally terrified my grandchildren (2 and 4).  They don't like the idea that he might start to fly in the night around the house!!!  I had to ask Santa to call him back to the workshop!  He might come out on the shelf again when the children are older.",3.0
My son thought this was going to be a real elf. He pointed out that it's just an elf decoration. He's not even 3. This is a big problem as we try to convince him Santa is also real - and not a figment of his parent's imaginations.,3.0
"I love the idea of the Elf story/nightly visits etc. But I was very surprised at how cheap the elf itself is. It is difficult to position and pose w/o excessive use of scotch tape etc. It has no hands (felt flaps) or feet...Wondering why they didn't at least put a light wire frame inside to make him posable... Still, with some extra dental floss and tape to fasten Elf in position, we've been having fun and the kids love it--That is what is most important.",3.0
"I'm giving this 3 stars because in theory this is a great concept with good intentions. Which is why I bought it despite the reviews about children being afraid of the doll. Unfortunately, my three year old was one of them. When her girl elf first came out of the box, I could tell my daughter was trying to decide whether she liked it. By the time I finished reading her the storybook, she had pushed the elf under the blanket and didn't want to look at it again. I asked her the next day why she didn't like her elf, and she pointed at its face and said ""I don't like her eyes and cheeks. She looks naughty. I don't want her to look at me."" This, despite my leaving out bits of the story that involved the elf telling on bad behaviour. Perhaps the makers need to look into designing a more child-friendly face for the elf? Some semblance of feet would be nice, too.",3.0
"it was sent on time, delivery was fine... the people selling it are not to be held accountable for the next bit.... however...  it is made very  errrmmm.... cheaply. It will likely not last for the lifetime of the child - which is kind of what I wanted. No shoes on the elf (I had one as a child and he had at least FELT shoes!)
the kid enjoys it - which is the most important part.",3.0
"I have a 3-year-old and considered entering the insanity that is ""Elf on a Shelf.""  In reading reviews, I discovered an alternative:  ""Christopher Pop-In-Kins""  Our local library had a complete gift set of both mischievous elf stories and companion elves.  Here is a comparison..

THE STORIES ARE INCREDIBLY SIMILAR
I am utterly stunned by the similarities in the two stories.  In fact, I am amazed that the author of the ""Christopher"" book (written in 1985) hasn't sued the ""Elf"" author (written in 2005) for plagiarism.
  *  Both elves have been sent by Santa to keep an eye on their assigned child/children and report back to Santa
  *  Both elves relocate within their assigned home each evening
  *  Both elves are not to be touched by the children in the home
  *  Consequences for touching either elf is the same--he/she will have to go back to Santa for awhile
  *  Both elves are to return to Santa on Christmas eve
  *  Size of books are almost identical

""CHRISTOPHER POP-IN-KINS""
  *  Illustrations are more vivid with a lot of primary colors
  *  The story is narrative in fashion
  *  The book spends most of the time explaining why Santa sent him to your home
  (Christopher was sad and wanted to see the children who the elves had been making toys for, so Santa decided to use Christopher as a spy, of sorts.)

""ELF ON A SHELF""
  *  Illustrations are more subdued and resemble dry water colors with a lot of peach/orange/rust
  *  The story is told in a rhyming fashion
  *  The book spends most of the time telling the reader about the actual process of hiding each day

COMPARING THE ELF FIGURES
  *  For something that is to be a family heirloom and last year after year, both elves are remarkably lacking in substance, quality and design.  If I saw these sold as Christmas decorations in a store, I would never even consider buying either one.  It's a shame because elves and Christmas figures can be so cute.
  *  Both elves are of passible quality
  *  ""Elf"" is about 10-inches tall and quite lanky;  ""Christopher is about 8-inches tall, but much more substantial
  *  Both elves arms and legs are very very thin and wiry
  *  ""Elf"" has very long, very thin legs;  ""Christopher"" has shorter thin legs with more substantial body and large boots
  *  Both elves have a soft plastic head/face/hair
  *  ""Christopher"" also has soft plastic boots, hat & scarf
  *  ""Christopher"" looks a bit more cute and cartoon-like
  *  ""Elf"" has more of a sophisticated pixie look
  *  I find both elves to be pitiful and would like to find an alternative somewhere else

PROS
  *  ""Elf"" - You get to name your elf
  *  ""Elf"" - Elf comes in a variety of eye/hair/skin colors and choice of gender
  *  ""Elf"" - I found the relaying of the story a bit more cleaver and engaging because of the rhyming

CONS
  *  ""Christopher"" - I find his name (Christopher Pop-In-Kins) to be rather hokey
  *  ""Elf"" - You can now purchase a number of accessories for you elf (skirt, apron, etc.) While some may find this to be a positive, I find it to be a great example of marketing vultures.  (Dear Company: Put some more time and money into making a decent-looking elf in the first place so people don't have to pay even more for a half-inch semi-circle skirt to try and jazz up a sorry looking felt figure.)
  *  ""Elf"" - I am pretty disgusted by the blatant plagiarism of story and idea.  I mean, could they have at least made him a reindeer or snowman?

BOTTOM LINE:  I really Really REALLY wanted to like the ""Christopher Pop-In-Kins"" book and elf better.  I really did.  This author would seem to be the initial person behind the idea, and I tend to go for the little guy.  However, I found myself more interested in the ""Elf on a Shelf"" book--probably due to the cleaver rhyming.  I also liked the idea of being able to name your own elf.  I would probably give the illustrations in the ""Christopher"" book a slight edge due to the colorful pictures.

As far as the elf figures go, it is really a matter of personal preference.  Their length and quality are quite similar, and I think either one would work well in different hiding places and poses.  They have such different looks that one is bound to appeal to a person more than the other.

I will probably go for ""Christopher,"" simply because he looks different than every other elf in everyone else's house.  Not to mention, I would like to support the camp of the person who came up with this idea so long ago but didn't seem to have the marketing power behind her.

I thought this would be the book and the elf like the picture showed but it was just the book.....very disappointing,3.0
"I got this at the suggestion of my sister-in-law, to try to curb the behavior of my five year old son who was, shall we say, a little strung out on Christmas Cheer. I'd read mixed reviews, but since these seemed to be mostly musings from parents feeling guilty about resorting to an overpriced gimmick to discipline their Christmas-crazed offspring.

So...the elf arrived, thankfully while my son was at school. My first thought: I paid this much for a glorified Christmas ornament? My second thought: that thing looks like it will come alive and kill you in your sleep. My third thought: maybe the book will redeem the whole thing.

It didn't. In fact, my five year old himself can write a better story, rhymes included. However, I'd paid for the creepy Christmas ornament, and the book of dubious writerly credit, so I was darn well going to use them! I put the elf on a ledge above the TV (sure to get noticed there!) and waited to see if my children would run screaming.

So when DS got home from kindergarten and settled in for a long winter's Spongebob session, he immediately noticed the elf. 'Look! He's here!' (We had done a little group elf call-out earlier in the week to plant the seed.) 'Why yes he is,' I said. DS, with distinct disappointment, 'But it's just a toy!' Me, starting to sympathize with the agonized parental soul-searching reviews, 'Uh...he just LOOKS like a toy. But he watches what's happening, and at night he flies back to the North Pole and tells Santa what's been going on all day.' DS: 'Are you sure?' Me: 'Of course.'

Meanwhile, my ten-year-old daughter is looking at me like I might have lost my mind, and my son is clearly trying to decide whether or not to believe me. 'Well what's his name?' asks DS. 'Um...you get to name him.' DS: 'But he must already have a name. What is it?' Me: 'I don't know. So you get to give him a new one.' DS: 'How about Tim?' Me: 'Tim. Perfect.' Then I ran to the bedroom to recuperate from the shameless lies I'd been perpetrating.

But here's the thing: it worked. DS hits his sister? 'Tim is watching!' He immediately apologizes. DS chases the dog with a nonstick saucepan? 'Tim is watching!' Saucepan clatters to the floor. During the lead-up to Christmas Tim developed the ability to hear DS even when not physically present, and I became his deputy, just in case any non-home-based bad behavior went unnoticed.

So yeah, it's overpriced, creepy and of dubious ethical legitimacy, but it works. I'll probably even bring it out next year. If it doesn't kill me in my sleep first.",3.0

"My kids were so excited for this elf to arrive. They cannot touch it as the books says so they do not know how cheaply made this is. It has a thin piece of cardboard in the legs and is really low quality, not what I was expecting for $30.00. This is, as someone else posted in their review, something I would expect to spend about a dollar for at Goodwill or maybe the dollar store. Definitely not worth what I paid.",3.0
"I purchased this for my one year old so that we can start this tradition next Christmas.  I ordered a Blue Eyed boy elf, and when we received the package it was a Brown Eyed  Dark-skinned elf.

"Admittedly, I had read some negative commentary not too long ago on the cultural/spiritual value in having a sneaky little spy roaming around in our home first, only to discover that my wife had actually bought this ""Elf on a Shelf"" and put it into effect just last night. As the co-parent and father of a wonderfully innocent and extremely bright 5-year old, I was concerned about what mixed messages he may get out of feeling like his every move and behavior was being monitored (not necessarily a bad thing but I also want him to feel comfortable in his own home). So I put aside the negativity I'd read about.

All I know is that our boy, who used to wake up either at the hour my wife and I do (or usually just after our morning shower), is now tiptoeing around the house at the crack of dawn whispering to himself while looking around for this elf.

""Go back to bed _______. Even elves need rest and sleep."" To no effect.

Is it cute to see your child 's eyes wide with curiosity (and hopefully not fear) in dim light whispering to himself? Yes. Is it exploitative of the people behind this product or cynical of me to deride its commercial intent? Maybe. My feeling is of bemusement at this time, but I can totally see a ""tradition"" a-brewing. You can make this elf to be as bad as you want to.

If you keep a healthy balance between the true spirit of Christmas with having a little fun (you can certainly create your own character if you don't want to contribute to anyone's wealth), then it's not so bad. And bless my dear wife for being the elf's co-conspirator and who handles the nightly chore of creating the circumstances and changing the location of this thing. I've been sort of a bystander on this, and to confess, she DID explain this to me several days ago but I'd kind of tuned it out. But I now want to be ""in"" on the mischief.

On a surface level however, I wish the manufacturer had made this elf a little less creepy-looking, but I translating mischief on a purely physical level has its limitations, but I guess that's what the book is for -- which I enjoyed.",3.0
"Once your kids hit about 10, they will find this silly.  My older kids laugh, and remind me to remember to move the elf.  My youngest loves it-- I wish I did it when they all were young.",3.0
"$30 for a small stuffed animal that could be worth maaaaaaybe 4 bucks. The book is nice but it isn't one you can read over and over. It's pretty much once and done. Would be easier to buy a toy elf and email yourself a homemade powerpoint with the instructions/rules and have the email be from Santa. It is super fun to decive your children and place the elf in various positions and in the middle of activities. Charlie Brown is probably fuming over this commercialism of Christmas. Ours had been opened before we got it. It wasn't ""used"" but the tape and packaging was opened and reused. The first person was too lazy to undo the complicated twisty ties it is secured with and just ripped it through the cardboard.  Maybe it was used but everything was clean.  Either way I am bitter with the cost. I should have been able to get this for much less. Also don't take your kids to the bookstore or they will see the display of elves for sale and you'll have to come up with something quick to cover your behind.",3.0

"I have not actually purchased this item yet as I think my son may be a little young yet, I am considering it for next year.  I agree that the idea of the elf being a ""spy"" is counter-productive to the Christmas spirit; but it is all in how the story and tradition are presented.  If it is presented in a fun and light-hearted manner there should not be many issues.  If your child doesn't like the toy then feel free to return it or sell it.

For those out there that feel the elf is a horrible spy used to manipulate thier children's behavior and is a ""narc"" to Santa on the naughty behavior of the children in the house, then I guess we should all stop singing ""Santa Clause is Comming to Town"" too.  For those who may not be familiar with the song, it was written in 1932 and originally did not pitch well as it was a children's song.  The only songs to eclipse it's popularity have been ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"" and ""White Christmas""; two of the most beloved and traditional Christmas songs out there.

Here are the lyrics to ""Santa Clause is Comming to Town"":

You better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list
And checking it twice;
Gonna find out Who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!
O! You better watch out!
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

So, how much difference is there really between the idea of Santa being able to watch you all of the time and knowing if you have been naughty or nice; or creating a fun tradition for little kids and having some fun with the various mischievious things the Elf on the Shelf could get in to?",3.0
"We introduced the Elf on the Shelf to our almost 3 year old son a few days ago. So far he has really enjoyed getting to know our new visitor. I love the idea of this product, but I don't totally LOVE the product itself for a couple of reasons:
1) I thought the legs and arms would be more posable. It seems there is a magnet in the hands and a weight in the torso that keeps the Elf on the Shelf. I wanted to get a little crazier with my poses - but since you can't wrap the arms or legs around anything, it seems all he will do is sit most of the time.
2) Our Elf's hat was off when we received him. There was a glue line around the head of the Elf, so we will have to reattach his hat ourselves.
The idea is cute and it will definitely be a new tradition in our home. I just wish the Elf were a little better made.",3.0
"We had these little guys around the house during the holidays when I was a child.  No book.  Just the elves.  I picked up a few of them a loooong time ago.  I don't know where.

"I bought this last Christmas for my then 5 year old daughter. She did enjoy the story but didn't buy into the doll watching over her behavior.

So funny though that some are seriously afraid of the elf doll. LOL! But yeah, I do find that this product is overpriced. If I paid a little less then I'd be more satisfied I think.",3.0

"I introduced this to my 4yo son this year. He was leary of the elf at first. We read the book and while the story was nice, it took a little coaxing to get him to warm up to the concept. Is it real mommy?  I'm scared mommy. What saved the day was the cartoon/animated story that play on tv this year. It put it all in perspective and my little one was fine after that. I brought the elf out for about 4 nites which was plenty for a preschooler. I am sure next year will be much better. If I remember correctly, the elfontheshelf.com will send us periodic updates on our adopted elf, so when he returns next year, it will be familiar.",3.0

If I were to do it again, I would buy the book secondhand and buy a cuter looking elf from another store.",3.0
"I think the idea of Elf on the Shelf is a cute idea. The elf face is a little creepy though, its eyes peering to one side. Also, it is very hard to get it to stay sitting on it's own somewhere. It needs a heavy bottom or wire inside it's arms and legs to be able to form them. The kids do have fun trying to find him in the morning, if I remember to move it. The book is nice, has a cute little story rhyme.",3.0
"Elf on a Shelf is a cute concept to encourage eagerness and good behavior in young children for Christmas, but it's a bit overpriced.  The package consists of a hardcover book with the Elf's story a little felt and plastic elf doll that is a throwback to the Christmas decorations from 50 years ago.

I purchased the Elf of Shelf package from our local Hallmark store 4 years ago.  It was $25 then...still overpriced.",3.0
"Okay, here is the real deal on this product... The story is cute, the website is also cute, the doll is not the cutest by today's standards but is very reminisent of vintage Christmas ornaments. Things like my grandmother had and that were handed down to my mom when I was a little girl. If his felt were more worn and dingy, you would swear it was a family heirloom. His face is especially like the dolls and decorations from the 1930's to 1960's. Those people who get creeped out by the whole ""watching you"" aspect really do over analyze the whole good bad thing and being watched. How much emphasis is put on your child's good and bad behavior is left up to you. If you harp on the kid day and night that the elf is watching them and he is gonna rat them out to Santa, then it could make the kid paranoid, but if you simply state that what he does is help Santa keep an eye on things then you will be fine. I have 3 girls a 2 yr old, a 5 yr old and a 6 yr old. My oldest is very much a lover of all things magical. Faries, elves etc. She doesn't over think it, because she loves the magical aspect. My 5 year old is a thinker, she wants to know why things work where they go, how it happens etc. So she does over think it a bit and has her doubts. My oldest wants to believe so much she tries not to question it too much. Both girls love searching for him in the morning though. I try to keep it interesting and make my 5 year old wonder a bit more by setting the elf up in interesting situations... I put him with his head in the cookie jar with one leg propped up like he was searching for a snack when the sun came up and turned him back into a doll. I put him in the chair with the remote control in his lap and the TV on like he caught a show before morning... The kids think it is hysterical that ""Max"" is wandering around the house entertaining himself when he comes home from the North Pole. If you are the kind of parent who thinks discipline is a bad word, you don't let your kid ever drink juice, video game toys are evil and candy is the work of the devil, then this would probably not work for you. Your fragile under fed children will probably crumble at the idea that someone might find their behavior unacceptable or have horrible nightmares at the thought of an 8 inch elf coming to life and skipping off to let Santa about their behavior. He might report how Junior, in an unmedicated ADHD rage attacked his little sister who was sick in bed with the mumps, because she is unvaccinated. They have ""good"" parents who never tell their kids no, never allow those evil voodoo doctors to pump their kids full of life saving behavior balancing poisons and only allow them to eat natures candy like organic bananas and blueberries.

In other words it is a fun silly little thing to do with your kids if you are not an imbalanced, conspiracy fearing, child cottling, freak! Enjoy it, they only believe this stuff until they are about 8 or 9.",3.0
"This is a fun toy as I have heard about it long before I ordered it.  But what is up with the cheapness of the elf?  There are no weights or sand in it so you can actually place it on a shelf or other surface and have it stay.  It is light-weight with no weights in it so it is difficult to get it to stay in any place.  I was very disappointed in that aspect.  A very cheaply made elf for the price.  Ah, the price.  That leads us to the book that comes with the elf.  Now my kids LOVED the book.  I just wish and always envisioned that the elf would be of a bit more substance as we are to sit him upon varous things in the house and have him sitting up brightly waiting to be discovered.  It's more like struggling for him to be upright, leaning him against something so he doesn't tip over.  I mean, REALLY?  Cute idea but they need to make a better product.",3.0
"This book is good for 1) people who haven't read the books; 2) really cannon-oriented games; 3) people who don't want to stat out every monster.

I think I've actually used the book twice during my game, for reason 3 above.",3.0

The idea is great, but it's not really worth the money. If I could do it again, I would just buy a cute elf doll from a craft store for a couple dollars and tell the story instead of reading the book. You can register your elfs name on the Elf on the Shelf website, but it doesn't do anything fun after that. You just enter in the name and that's it, nothing special. You can upload a pic, but I've never been able to get my photo to load. Maybe the site just gets overloaded. Bottom line, buy an elf doll yourself and save the $30.",3.0
"Bought the product(elf and book)at a Hallmark store with the same price. It's not cheap but I thought it would be great for the kids since I've read more positive reviews than negative. I would have rated this product 4-5 stars only the elf is tiny about 8 and 1/2 inch(you have to see the elf for yourself)from the tip of his hat to his feet. Could've made him more sturdier. I think I paid for the book instead of the elf. My kids,ages 7 and 5 like the idea of finding him though. My only problem is that I have to lie everytime they ask questions. Sure it reinforces good behavior but like the one reviewer says what happens after December 26? I wouldn't recommend this as a good Christmas tradition if you ask me.",3.0
"I'm with some of the other low-star reviewers...I don't want an elf hanging around the house so it can go tattle to Santa every time my son misbehaves or makes a mistake.  I think positive reinforcement is a much better approach to managing behavior.  So I think this toy has some value IF, and only if, parents change their approach to using it.  I would personally skip the book altogether and tell my son how the elf is visiting the house and can't wait to go tell Santa all of the good things he's doing.  And when he does those good things, tell him how happy his elf is.  Leave out the negative threats.  Honestly, if this elf is the only reason your child stops bad behaviors, what are you going to do when December 26th comes around?

PS - I also love one reviewer's idea of leaving a new Christmas story with the elf each day to read together as a family.  Another positive association with the elf for the kids!",3.0

When I was done, she said she didn't like the elf and asked me if it could go to Santa's house and not come back here.  I think it's a really cute idea, but maybe if the elf doll was a little...cuter looking(?) it would work better.  That or she just doesn't like the idea of a doll watching her all the time, not sure I blame her on that one.",3.0
"The Elf on a Shelf -- A Christmas Tradition gift set contains not only a beautiful storybook but a North Pole scout elf and collectible box.

The concept behind this unique children's book is brilliant. Through the book, children are told a story about their magical North Pole scout elf, which they get to name. Each night after the children are fast asleep, the scout elf flies to the North Pole to report to Santa. Then he returns to the children's home in the middle of the night and lands in a new location within the home.

This book and elf have the power to turn every morning into an exciting adventure. Children will excitedly search the home to discover the elf's newest landing spot (note to parents: don't forget to move the elf at night). In addition, the elf makes for a great behavior incentive-kids don't want the elf to give Santa a bad report. Genius!

"If I'm being honest, I must mention that although this game specifies 'thirteen and older' as its primary audience, the reality is that twelve and under kids are most likely going to enjoy this game. It's a party game that families can play, but accomplishing the tasks on the cards is more like kid-oriented fun. Gathering beads in order to win is the object, but unlike the real Mardi Gras there is no ""adults only"" behavior involved. I rated the durability high, but again this is a game that should appeal to younger kids - who are prone to losing things like the strings of beads or the cards. The game comes in kind of a cool clear, soft vinyl case. I liked the ""mind control"" category the best, which entails a little more subtle strategy that getting someone to refuse to pick your trash or finding someone who likes vampires more than werewolves. This is a game I can't imagine bringing out very often and its kind of expensive for what it is.",3.0

"I initially got this game out at a family get together thinking that it was some sort of board game, it's not. But that doesn't mean that it isn't fun. It just takes a little planning ahead to make sure you get it out at the right time.

The next time we had a big group over I got the game out ahead of time and knew how to prepare for the get together. I would definitely recommend this game for larger groups since the reserved dynamics of small groups can really impede the fun of the game.

We had a fun time stealing beads from each other for all sorts of silly reasons. We also learned a lot about each other and I would recommend this game as a fun ice breaker for parties where people don't know each other very well.

In the right situation, this can be a very fun game, just make sure you break it out at the right time!",3.0
"This game is a little different! My family was excited to see it on Christmas Day and wanted to play right away. We discovered that this is a game that is best played with a larger crowd, especially if people don't know each other well or are meeting for the first time. Because some of the tasks in the game require that people be open to approaching strangers, and also open to doing/saying some pretty random things, it's not a game for the shy - AT ALL. We thought that it was fun, but would be much more fun in a true party circumstance. I have to say, though, that there are definitely adults who would refuse to do some of the actions printed on some of the cards because of the silliness factor of the actions. Definitely know your crowd before using this game, or it will very possibly be a flop. Another thing that concerns me is that someone could throw the game by just refusing to do whatever they could perceive as someone else's attempt to steal their beads - I mean, what competitive person is NOT going to be sensitive to others being competitive, suspicious that someone is just trying to steal their beads? For that reason, this game might be an anti-ice-breaker. So, I guess the game is pretty average, overall. It's a good idea, but will not work in some circumstances.",3.0
"Intended for 4 to 12 players, Party Gras encourages interaction with family, friends, and even as an icebreaker or supplement to any party, celebration, etc. Action cards provided players with a mission to fulfill, thus the goal is to take away beads from your opponents and accumulate as many as possible to win.

The idea is very good, but the layout and structure of the game could be vastly improved. The action cards were occasionally awkward and made you think ""Did they just put that in the card?"" And, that's certainly not in the good way. There weren't enough rules and motivation to keep players into the game.

"This game has some good possibilities in a large group as a means to get people talking and mingling but as a family game it was a dud.  The concept was better than the follow-thru.  It was more of an annoyance than a game and most of the participants continued to play only as good sports accomodating the hostess than because they had fun doing it.  The ""activities"" are kinda lame, not really very imaginative, and if you already know everyone (as in a family) them many of the challenges are just not there.  I could see using this at a block party, church social or a very tame method of corporate bonding exercise, but really, the most creative part of the whole package was the name. Meh.

"Party Gras is one of the many, many party games out there and, as such, leaves somethings to be desired.

But I found that the fewer the people, the less fun and the more you know each other, the less fun as well.

I think this would be great for a new staff initiation ice-breaker or similar circumstance because it forces interactions between people and, if the possibly offensive questions are removed, can be a lot of fun for nearly everyone. For a smallish gathering however, I found it not so good.",3.0
We tried to play this game New Years Eve with some folks over 50. It really wasn't very successful in that age group. I guess we are all a little too inhibited. :)) Would probably be a good game for the under 40 crowd.,3.0
"Party Gras is a great party game.  Players can range from teens to lively adults.  The game comes packaged in a clear, durable plastic tote bag versus the typical game box.  The plastic case makes it easy to transport from one party to the next.  The bright, festive, eye-catching colors is what drew me to this game.  I think that most groups of 4 or more will enjoy playing this game if the participants are outgoing and have a good sense of humor.  This game is not for introverts or for someone seeking a high educational value from a game.  Party Gras is a great ice breaker, good humorous family/friend fun, and a welcomed change from board games that keep you seated.  Start the holidays and new year off with something different...Party Gras.  If you tire of this game, just find another person that likes games and do an exchange.",3.0

"I had a similar version of this game as a kid, and this one is not far from it.  However, one negative about this version is that it does not break things down to 5-yard increments like the older version.  You have to actually count out from every yard line and that gets frustrating as you try to figure out what a 15 yard penalty means from the 27 yard line on the very small board they give you.  The game can be fun in the sense it can change on any roll  - but ultimately this is a game you break out when the kids are really bored or when adults want a different party game than beer pong.",3.0
"Let me preface this by saying that I've only played 2-3 games so far by myself.  The game is well-designed and fun to play.  The dice are of solid casting and very clear to read.  The book of score sheets is fairly well-designed as well, though including a golf pencil with the set would've been nice.

My biggest complaint about the game is that it's extremely random.  Of course, given that it's a dice game, that's to be expected.  I guess even real-life football has a bit of chaos to it, with fumbles going both ways, penalties, etc.  I suppose my disappointment with the game is that it's not really ""strategic"" at all.  You're completely at the mercy of the die rolls.  As it is, you're rolling three dice with a number from 0-3 on them, and the ""big play"" die which has numbers in the double-digits and ""TD"" on it.  I think it'd be better if you could choose to roll ""rushing"" dice or ""passing"" dice, with the appropriate yardage counts on each.  At least that would add a little strategy.  Or perhaps have offensive and defensive dice.  Maybe they'll go that route with the next version of the game.

I'll update this review later after I've played more and against actual opponents to see how I think of it.  One plus for the game is that you can download a PDF of the score sheets, so you won't have to buy a super-expensive pad of sheets again once you run out.",3.0

"There's no question that this elf is way cuter than the ""Elf on the Shelf"" elf.  My kids love him and all that he does and he brings great joy to our home.

But the book is awful.  My 3-year-old has an uncanny attention span for books, but he just doesn't engage with this book, which is amazing considering how much he loves Christopher.  The illustrations are incredibly dull.  Christopher looking sad outside a door.  Christopher looking sad in a chair.  Santa talking to Christopher.  Christopher holding a candy cane.  Santa talking to Christopher.  Santa still talking to Christopher.  Christopher smiling in a chair.  Really?  So much opportunity gone to waste! Christopher tells Santa that they finished all their toys - perhaps show other elves and lots of toys or presents wrapped? He talks about wanting to see kids like Santa -  show picture of Santa with kids sleeping. ANYTHING.  It's also the wordiest book ever, which might be fine if there were interesting pictures to look at while it droned on.  But you can just read the first and last sentence on each page and it doesn't change the story AT ALL for nearly the whole book.

And BUYERS BE WARNED: My other complaint is that the authors failed to give the children the opportunity to name this elf, so my other close friends and family who like the way this elf looks are now going to confuse things by the fact that Christopher Pop-In-Kins will also be appearing in other homes as well.  Hmmmmm.  I really haven't figured out at all how we are going to explain that away when he goes several times per week to a few homes where they have the same elf with the same name that is currently sitting in our home.  If they were smart, they would have had a few elves who wanted to go to children's homes.

In hindsight, I actually wish I had thought about making my own storybook that would have been a plagiarized merger of Pop-In-Kins and Elf on the Shelf.  So for those ambitious parents out there, my advice is buy this elf, but write your own story to get the best experience with it.",3.0

"I have a 3-year-old and considered entering the insanity that is ""Elf on a Shelf."" In reading reviews, I discovered an alternative: ""Christopher Pop-In-Kins"" Our local library had a complete gift set of both mischievous elf stories and companion elves. Here is a comparison..

THE STORIES ARE INCREDIBLY SIMILAR
I am utterly stunned by the similarities in the two stories. In fact, I am amazed that the author of the ""Christopher"" book (written in 1985) hasn't sued the ""Elf"" author (written in 2005) for plagiarism.
* Both elves have been sent by Santa to keep an eye on their assigned child/children and report back to Santa
* Both elves relocate within their assigned home each evening
* Both elves are not to be touched by the children in the home
* Consequences for touching either elf is the same--he/she will have to go back to Santa for awhile
* Both elves are to return to Santa on Christmas eve
* Size of books are almost identical

""CHRISTOPHER POP-IN-KINS""
* Illustrations are more vivid with a lot of primary colors
* The story is narrative in fashion
* The book spends most of the time explaining why Santa sent him to your home
(Christopher was sad and wanted to see the children who the elves had been making toys for, so Santa decided to use Christopher as a spy, of sorts.)

""ELF ON A SHELF""
* Illustrations are more subdued and resemble dry water colors with a lot of peach/orange/rust
* The story is told in a rhyming fashion
* The book spends most of the time telling the reader about the actual process of hiding each day

COMPARING THE ELF FIGURES
* For something that is to be a family heirloom and last year after year, both elves are remarkably lacking in substance, quality and design. If I saw these sold as Christmas decorations in a store, I would never even consider buying either one. It's a shame because elves and Christmas figures can be so cute.
* Both elves are of passible quality
* ""Elf"" is about 10-inches tall and quite lanky; ""Christopher is about 8-inches tall, but much more substantial
* Both elves arms and legs are very very thin and wiry
* ""Elf"" has very long, very thin legs; ""Christopher"" has shorter thin legs with more substantial body and large boots
* Both elves have a soft plastic head/face/hair
* ""Christopher"" also has soft plastic boots, hat & scarf
* ""Christopher"" looks a bit more cute and cartoon-like
* ""Elf"" has more of a sophisticated pixie look
* I find both elves to be pitiful and would like to find an alternative somewhere else

PROS
* ""Elf"" - You get to name your elf
* ""Elf"" - Elf comes in a variety of eye/hair/skin colors and choice of gender
* ""Elf"" - I found the relaying of the story a bit more cleaver and engaging because of the rhyming

CONS
* ""Christopher"" - I find his name (Christopher Pop-In-Kins) to be rather hokey
* ""Elf"" - You can now purchase a number of accessories for you elf (skirt, apron, etc.) While some may find this to be a positive, I find it to be a great example of marketing vultures. (Dear Company: Put some more time and money into making a decent-looking elf in the first place so people don't have to pay even more for a half-inch semi-circle skirt to try and jazz up a sorry looking felt figure.)
* ""Elf"" - I am pretty disgusted by the blatant plagiarism of story and idea. I mean, could they have at least made him a reindeer or snowman?

BOTTOM LINE: I really Really REALLY wanted to like the ""Christopher Pop-In-Kins"" book and elf better. I really did. This author would seem to be the initial person behind the idea, and I tend to go for the little guy. However, I found myself more interested in the ""Elf on a Shelf"" book--probably due to the cleaver rhyming. I also liked the idea of being able to name your own elf. I would probably give the illustrations in the ""Christopher"" book a slight edge due to the colorful pictures.

As far as the elf figures go, it is really a matter of personal preference. Their length and quality are quite similar, and I think either one would work well in different hiding places and poses. They have such different looks that one is bound to appeal to a person more than the other.

I will probably go for ""Christopher,"" simply because he looks different than every other elf in everyone else's house. Not to mention, I would like to support the camp of the person who came up with this idea so long ago but didn't seem to have the marketing power behind her.

Let the Insanity Begin...

Merry Christmas!",3.0
I bought this for my nephew and it was not what I was looking for.  The story book that comes with it is totally different story than we had already used with the other kids in the family.,3.0
He wouldn't even let us take it out of the box (he's 4).  We had to call Santa and have him come pick his elf up and take him back to the north pole.  My kid was freaked out that an elf would be spying on him.  We got this one because I thought it was cuter than the other ones.  I thought he was cute and the book was too.  Maybe next year my son will let him stay.,3.0
"Well, I must agree with my 3.5 year old ""that book is boring"".  I get that it explains the story of why he hides, but it just kind of drags on.  And the illustrations lack creativity, huge pictures of simplistic things take up an entire page, the book doesn't even need to be that large, it could have been pocket size and sufficed in telling the story.  My kid was a bit wary of the elf at first, it definitely took a good week of hiding/searching before I even saw her get a tiny bit excited about finding him.  Its a bit funner now.  Not sure if it will stick as a tradition.  I like that the elf has bendy arms & legs, but I wish his feet weren't so bulky, and his weight can make it hard to hang him from smaller objects.",3.0

Also the spine on the book was ripped away from the front cover.  It will have to be glued back on.  Luckily for me I have a friend who can repair it.",3.0

"UPDATE: Unfortunately, after nearly 2 weeks we found that our oldest two kids still did not like the elf and were scared of it.  We thought they had warmed up to the idea.  Our daughter continued to be afraid of it, so we explained to her that it was not real and was just a fun game.  Her 4 year old mind had a difficult time understanding and believing that he wasn't real.  We decided to forego anymore drama and gave the book and elf away :(  We certainly tried to make it work.

We still think this is a good product and fun tradition.  We would recommend it to anyone, but want to warn people that some kids are spooked by the idea.

------------------------
ORIGINAL REVIEW

We purchased this instead of Elf On The Shelf since it was cheaper and because we have friends whose kids were terrified of that one.  A number of reviewers mention that as well (although there are a ton of good reviews too).  There weren't as many ratings on this one, but none of them gave it a low rating due to their kids being afraid of it.

We have a 2 year old boy, 4 year old girl, and 7 year old boy.  The 2 year old LOVED trying to find the elf from the get go.  The older two kids however were scared by the concept, but warmed up to it after a few days.  This will certainly depend on the personality of your children.  We have some other friends whose kids adored the idea from the beginning.

Here is a little insight about our kids personalities and how we got them to warm up to Christopher the Elf.

Our 7 year old son is very smart, literal, and science minded.  He doesn't like to be the center of attention, will not wear a costume for Halloween unless it is something associated with a real-world profession (ie: fireman and astronaut). He loves reading science books, books about records (ie: guinness), and even sci-fi/fantasy.  He has never wanted to sit on Santa's lap (I suspect he knows Santa isn't real), he avoids life-sized Disney costumed characters like the plague, and was terrified of the idea that the tooth fairy would take his lost teeth (we had to write notes to the tooth fairy).  This elf had a similar effect, even though he was certain that we were the ones moving him around.  After 1-2 days of him being scared, we reassured him that indeed we bought it and that it was all pretend.  We also asked him to help us hide Christopher at night.  Slowly he has taken to this and is okay with it, although I wouldn't say he looks forward to it.

Our 4 year old daughter listened intently to the story and immediately had a ton of questions.  ""Is an elf going to come to our house"", etc.  She said she was scared and didn't ever want the elf to come to our house.  First thing to note about her personality is that she obsesses about things on her mind and is very dramatic (positive and negative).  Sometimes it is difficult to tell whether she is truly scared of something or just being dramatic.  For example, she gets so excited to ride roller coasters and wants to ride them all (including loop coasters that she is big enough to ride).  Everytime we're riding them she screams for us to hold her tight and on every single picture she has the most terrified look I can imagine.  Afterwards, she talks excitedly about the ride and wants to ride more.  The first time she saw the elf on the top of one of the bookshelves, she was especially scared.  After a few minutes she calmed down and was okay with it although she kept looking over at the elf.  Before bedtime, we had to write a note to the elf that he should never go into the bedrooms or bathrooms so that she felt more secure.  The first morning our daughter woke up and looked around for Christopher and found him...immediately she shrieked and ran down the hall screaming that she didn't want to see the elf.  We calmed her down and she was okay for the rest of the day but kept looking at the elf (I think she thought it might move).  The second night we put him above the front door holding a cookie.  She was the first to find him and was still a little apprehensive, but took pride that she found him first.  She also liked that he was holding a cookie (she has quite the sweet tooth herself).  She even said that she liked the elf that morning and thought we should leave out a biscuit him to eat later in the day.  Since then she very much looks forward to trying to find where Christopher is hiding in the morning.

In the end, we are glad we bought this and it will be an annual Christmas tradition.  It will be interesting to see if they warm right up to the idea next year or if we have to go through the same drama :)",3.0
"I played this game with my 4-year-old son. (It is designed for children ages 3 and up.) I almost gave up entirely, at first, because my son was fascinated by all the different parts of the game: the tornado, the little chips/coins, and so on. Once he settled down, we began to play. One problem I found was that it was impossible, for both me and my son, to touch our ear to any of the letters. I used to play Twister as a kid (and this game is an educational twist on Twister, since they have to be able to recognize the alphabet), so I was interested in the physical aspect of the game; however, we had no success with getting our ears to touch the mat. The creators of the game could have limited themselves to hands and feet, or added elbows and knees.

The tornado motiv is fun, but the footprints that signal the end of the game seem superfluous to me.

All things considered, a fun and educational game. But I think that the creators tried too hard to distinguish it from Twister (which was simpler).",3.0

"I took a 3-Day Saturday Boot Camp that used these flash cards along with the companion book and workbook. All three items helped me pass the exam. However, PMP Exam Prep, Eighth Edition - Updated: Rita's Course in a Book for Passing the PMP Exam was also very useful.
The flash cards are okay. I didn't find errors but I found what I thought were incomplete cards. Some cards required more detail or there was another card with the additional detail. This was a little odd to me.

However, I did make my own note cards because I have a need to write things down to remember it. The cards are a study aid. In my opinion they are worth $25. It is nice to have the tools and techniques on a card as you are trying to learn them. The cards would remind me of concepts I had overlooked are did not know in detail.

"I'm a little torn with this product.  The adventure deck is great.  The cards have pretty much the same effects that the long available pdf version has, but it's nice to have a real deck rather than a home-brew version.  Most of the art is new and decent.

However, the action deck leaves a bit to be desired.  My main gripe is that there is only artwork on the face cards.  All of the numbered cards have only standard poker graphics.  For this kind of money and for a more evocative feel, all of the cards should have artwork.  The artwork that is present consists of characters from various Savage Worlds settings. Nothing terribly exciting, and actually, it's a bit blah.

The quality of both decks suffers from the fact that they are laminated cardstock rather than vinyl.  I may be a little spoiled by some of the Bicycle decks I use.  Unlike the previous reviewer, I'm skeptical that they would survive a good soda/beer dousing.  Good vinyl decks with graphics on all cards can be had for under $10 (the Alchemy and Anne Stokes poker decks are good examples of the kind of quality I was hoping for).  That being said, the laminated card stock is a high quality version of that material.

If this had a $14.99 MSRP, I would give it four stars for the coolness of the Adventure deck.  At $24.99, it is a bit steep considering the lameness of the Action deck.",3.0
"Eminent Domain is a fun game combining several popular game elements into one slick package. I enjoy the gameplay, and the components are fantastic, but the game starts to feel the same after several plays.

The reason this is so is that the same cards are present in every game, and the same cards are accessible at the same time in every game. The cards included in the technology stack are always available, and the stacks on the tableau are the same from game to game.

I don't mean to say that every game is identical; far from it. The planets players draw vary from game to game, and these planets determine different strategies. And because the game involves ""learning"" different roles--that is, the more a player performs actions like research, survey, or colonize, the better he gets at it--a player's deck and strategy will necessarily change from game to game. However, even with these layers of difference, there isn't much that differentiates each game experience. My play group got bored with it after several plays.",3.0
"The ""learning variant"" of the game without the technology cards is a bit too lean for me.

At first what I saw was a Race for the Galaxy clone but once it was taught to me and I started to play I saw that while it may have gotten a lot of its influence and ideas from RftG it changed enough of the formula to have its own personality.  The idea of having the different roles you play actually be the collection of cards in your deck is original enough to be interesting and the uses of these roles seems well balanced and implemented.

Where the game fell short is the lack of variety.  Once the game was up and running it became clear that there wasn't enough to keep me interested through even the end of that first game.  There are only really 3 types of planets (ones that gave bonuses to hand size or symbols for boosting, ones that held multiple resources, and ones that gave you huge amounts of victory points) and because of that there aren't very many interesting strategies to pursue during the game.  You could adjust a little bit to take advantage of the bonus symbols or resource slots on your planets but for the most part what you do at the beginning of the game is what you do in the middle and end of the game.  Namely either focus on warfare, colonization, or a hybrid of the two.

Like I said, the game is different enough to be its own thing rather than just another Race for the Galaxy clone.  It's just cripplingly average.

The above comments only refer to the game without technology cards and with the technology cards it is elevated some.  Each player gets to diversify a little more, the research role is more useful, and each player is given more options for goals and strategy.  I always really appreciated the neat mechanic of collecting cards in your deck that also boosted/activated the different roles you could take.  It was an original mechanic that worked reasonably well and with the technology cards the game has more personality.

That said though I think I would always rather play RftG or a deck builder like Dominion over this.  While it is original in its mechanics and has more teeth when playing with the technology cards I feel like the whole thing still boils down to a ""colonize or warfare"" strategy which isn't the most interesting for me.  But with the technology implemented it isn't something I would balk too much at playing.",3.0
"(This review doesn't have 'how to play' info. Others have covered that.)

First off, let me say that my wife and I love Twilight Imperium but can never find anyone else to join us and it takes a long time to play. I'm also a fan of deck building games so Eminent Domain should be about perfect for us.  Unfortunately, it's not... at least not yet!

I frequently buy games on Amazon and when I read reviews for ED, I thought we'd buy the starter and then, if it was fun we'd try the expansion. Problem is,  even though the basic game functions well, it feels incomplete, like a training game to the main game.

There is no way to prevent a rival from succeeding. The only variety is in the random card draw but that is easily rectified by focusing on one or two roles.  Also, you can pretty much play a whole game without bothering with the advance tech cards.

Fortunately, reviews of the expansion seem to say the game offers all of the galactic expansion gaming and conflict we could hope for.  We hope so, because the base game is really lacking.",3.0
"This game is decently fun. It is easy to start playing and makes sense since it is very similar to other card based games (Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity). The main difference is that this game gives you an awkward situation (seeing an enemy, pouring water on yourself etc.) and a different way of approaching it. I imagine it is targeted at a younger audience to teach children how to handle these situations. Overall, a decent game but adults might want it to be a little bit more edgy as it is a very G-Rated type of game.",3.0

"Awkward Moment: 3-8 Players, Ages 12+, Average Play Time = 20-30 Minutes

The box insert was large enough to accommodate the cards and then some, which helped to prevent spill-overs when moving it around as a whole package.  The cards were easy to shuffle, though with two hundred plus cards involved in the reaction deck, you may want an extra pair of hands.  The manual was easy to follow, but failed to include winning and game ending conditions. Luckily, the game is freeform enough to where players can make up their own and quit when they want to.  For a longer game, players can reshuffle the discard piles as the decks run out, just to name an example.

Before moving on to gameplay, I thought I'd quickly mention and applaud the game for having so many variants listed in the manual.  I counted seven different variants for players to try, including ""Double the Awkward, Double the Fun?"", ""The Old Awkward Switcheroo"", ""It's Kind of an Awkward Story"", ""Ackward-Acting"", ""Choose Your Own Awkward"", ""Awkward Momentum"", and ""Decreasingly Awkward"".  Each of them describes changes that are fairly significant.  ""The Old Awkward Switcheroo"", for example, has players drawing and submitting moment cards instead of reaction cards.  ""It's Kind of an Awkward Story"" encourages role-playing and story telling, for those of you who enjoy fictional writing.  I won't go into all of them, but they definitely add a lot of replay value to the base game.

In fact, coming up with our own variant is what made our play experience somewhat manageable.  The moment and decider cards make ""Awkward Moment"" feel a bit more structured and on-task when compared to ""Apples to Apples"". The group didn't seem to care for the decider cards...they felt that they made things overly confusing and too specific.  During one turn, we drew twenty different decider cards and none of them seemed to fit the situation at hand.  After about ten turns, we decided to do away with the decider cards altogether and increased our reaction card hand limit to ten.  This helped things a little, but I'm sorry to say that the majority of the group wanted to play ""Apples to Apples"" instead.  Jennifer didn't seem to find the cards funny, and the specific nature of the game kept us from being imaginative with the cards.  It's worth noting that our group is very sarcastic and witty...this is more than likely why games like ""Say Anything"" and ""Apples to Apples"" work better for us, as they encourage creativity.

At the end of the day, ""Awkward Moment"" is an interesting family-friendly card game that is worthy of your attention.  Its small size makes it ideal for travel, especially when it's going to be used for parties and/or vacations.  The extra variants keeps things from getting dull, giving players a reason to bring out the box a second or third time.  There is a bit of reading comprehension involved, so parents will need to decide if their kids are ready when considering the 12+ age recommendation.  The price tag is listed at $19.00 (as of 7-22-13), which I feel to be fair and on par with other games of the genre.  While our group didn't particularly enjoy this game, that's not to say that you won't.  ""Awkward Moment"" can be too specific for its own good I feel, but that shouldn't stop you from at least giving it a once-over especially if you're a fan of the genre.",3.0
"It's a great concept for a ""mine"" crawler.. they managed to bring new mechanics into it and the overall theme and execution was excellent.. my gripes with the game are more component based..
I have been a war and board gamer for years and I own all of flying frog's games and I was very displeased with the miniatures.. I don't know why they had to do the diy on sprues approach but it was a very frustrating experience trying to build them.. the plastic is very flimsy and they don't fit well when assembled resulting in gaps in the final mini.. I understand doing this maybe for the gargantuan figures, but for the heroes and the small monsters it was just very aggrevating.. I have built multiple war gaming armies and this build was just so aggrevating.. this is one of those games that you want to open and just play because the concept is great, but then you have to unnecessarily have to spend a lot of time building figures that don't even look that great.. I hope they go back to what they did in their last games.. so ovetall I give the game concept, game play and fun factor a solid 5, but I give the components a 2..",3.0
"Love the story, replay ability and quality of card stock.  I also own the Swamps core set and my family and I play both sets combined now regularly.  The models require assembly and I was ready for that after I had bought the other core set last year but the sprues on the City of Ancients were a bit more difficult to cleanly cut and assemble on the Night Terror models.  Still, if you enjoy dynamic tabletop games, the old west, zombies and mutant spiders you'll enjoy Shadows of Brimstone.  Get used to the setup procedure and the game starts to flow quickly.",3.0
"The game is a lot of fun.

Setup is pretty bad, and the learning curve and instructions leave quite a bit to be desired but the game is definitely fun enough to be well worth it.

I think if they could clarify the rulebooks some and simplify setup and initial startup then the game would be great. I really wish they had an app to handle inventory, character stats, and town actions (we ended up creating an excel sheet for this).",3.0

"Now listen, i'm very gentle with books. When I opened this book for the first time just to browse through, the pages attached to the binding simply fell right out. The glue that holds the pages to the spine does not hold over time (or in my case at all). Maybe my book was defective, but after searching this issue on the internet it seems I am not the only one with this problem. Eclipse Phase itself is an excellent rpg, I just wish they made the book in softcover.",3.0
good product,3.0
"The cards are ok, good quality but I did not realize that they were basically just photographs of women with their bare breasts showing and some fully nude is what made it ""sensual"", I think that erotic would have been a better descriptor than sensual because the majority of the photos did not really seem to be exuding any kind of sensuality, some models look pretty awkward actually.  I possibly would have purchased the deck even if it had been accurately described with a different intention behind my purchase, however it is definitely not what I was hoping for and that was a letdown.  Sensuality can involve more than naked females and BDSM scenes.  A few of the cards I can see a goddess quality about them, but the majority no.  (This is just my personal opinion.)",3.0

"I used these on my home buttons for my iPhone and iPad. On the iPhone it works great but on the iPad it stops the covers connection so it does not go to sleep, you have to physically but the iPad to sleep and then you have to be careful picking up the iPad because trying to close the case will cut it back on.

"We wanted to add Scrabble to our board game collection for ages and finally bought it. It's a great game and this version is a solid one. Im not sure how many tiles other versions of this game hold, but this version only holds 8 tiles, so when you get really stumped, you're going to be putting additional tiles on the table.
Pro:
-The ""Tile Lock"" board keeps letters where they are placed (with big dogs bumping into the table, we were worried about keeping pieces where they were played).
Cons:
-The letter tiles, tile holders, and board are all plastic. It makes the components feel cheap.
-The board surface is a sticker over plastic. I feel like any accidental drink spill will ruin it, or it will start to peel off.
Overall, it's the same great game but if you want that taste of nostalgia, this may not be the ideal version for you.",3.0

"Pretty good book with a variety of unique card sleights (palming, manipulating cards in the deck, etc.). These sleights are the 'real work', so it will take a little perseverance. Many of these utility sleights are ones that you ought to know if you want to be a card sleight-of-hand worker.
The instructions are generally clear, but sometimes a detail here and there gets a little confusing. There's a fair number of photos showing how to do many of the sleights.
Sometimes a sleight is a little more complicated than it needs to be. My recommendation is to follow the author's steps in slow-motion with a deck of cards in hand. After you are familiar with the overall effect, you can make adjustments based on what your comfortable with. There may also be other newer methods for learning these sleights if you want to invest in newer card sleight instruction (such as the Daryl Encyclopedia of Card Sleights videos, etc.).
Right now, I'm working on the side steal sleight. He gives a T. Nelson Downs version which has some merit, but it is much more complicated than necessary. The author's own version is a little more do-able. But even the author's method becomes a little too fidgety, so I've made minor modifications to make it work well for me. I start in slow-motion, counting through the substeps to keep pace while I do the move (1..2..3..4). Then I repeat it until I can bring it up to full speed.
If you want to learn sleights for cheap, try this book. You may have to pick and choose through the sleights, and there may be better methods to perform some of these sleights now, but it's not bad for under $10.",4.0

This book takes you from fairly simple to much more advanced drawing techniques. Get it for anyone that is interested in drawing comics that can draw a little already even a child.,4.0
"I'm 37 years old and I just took up drawing again for the first time since high school.  I wasn't that great at it then so I'm not all that advanced of an artist.

This book is the perfect skill level for someone like me.  I mostly can copy things right now, but if I draw something from memory, my lack of skill is apparent. That was my motivation behind buying this book.  I needed to build on my skills and this book looked like the perfect thing to help with that.

The book starts out with having you trace some pictures just to get your hand and eye used to drawing different lines.  I have to say that this may have been one of the most interesting pieces of advice that I have learned from this book so far.  I would have never even considered tracing something in the past, but now I want to go buy some tracing paper and try a little more tracing.

As you move through the lessons they become more difficult.  After tracing, you work on stick figure frames for the characters, next you practice ""piping"" which is where you draw guides for the outside lines, and then finally you move on to the detailing that really makes your drawings come alive.

The book is set up so that you can draw in the book itself.  This is a great idea as well, but this is also where I ran into my issues with the book.

1. It's too small.

At 8.5 x 8.6 inches the book isn't even as big as a standard piece of paper.  It's tough to practice drawing details when you don't have much room to fit those details into.

2. The book doesn't lay flat

The book has a traditional binding so the pages have and arch to them when you try to lay it out flat to draw in it.  You need to press down on the pages to flatten them and even then there is still a little curve to them.  It makes it tough to draw straight lines at times and since I, and the target audience of this book, aren't that great of artists at this point, it really makes it frustrating to do some of the lessons.

If this book had spiral binding, like a notebook, and was larger I would give it 5 stars in a heartbeat.  As it stand now, it's 4 stars for me.  I am still glad I bought it because I really feel like it gave me some good things to practice.",4.0
"I like the book, just wish it was larger.  It is targeted more for kids, than aspiring artist, but it still has valuable lessons in it.

"I'm 32 and really need a hobby, so I bought this kit. The instructions were easy to follow, my only tips are to have more yarn (I ran out of black on the first puppy) and use a hot glue gun. I did this based on other reviews, didn't even mess with the glue that was included.",4.0

"Yes, these are ridiculously cute. Yes, they are fun for kids and adults. Yes, it requires the help of adults. So here's my review on the logistics:  It was quite time consuming for the grooming, styling and getting the shaping right. Trimming the pom poms can get messy. Expect a pile of yarn fur everywhere. Make sure you have comfortable scissors - cutting the yarn down the middle when making the pom pom definitely required some elbow grease. Tuck the eyes as deep as possible into the fur, or else the puppy will look bugged eye. Also, I scanned the paper punch-outs of accessories to print for future use so I won't ""run out."" There's not enough yarn to make all the pups, the white yarn included in the kit was exactly enough to make one pomeranian. The pups didn't fit into the paper dog carrier - I think you have to trim it down a lot more.",4.0

You can make up to 2-4 . You have to use thick yarn thin won't work ( it comes with 4 things of yarn ) . So if you can handle hours of trimming and cutting than get your scissors out, if you have to have a partner than pull 2 pairs out just remember it's hard work and it's so long.",4.0

There is not enough yarn to do any animal that's one color only. That's a mistake on the part of the makers since the multi-colored pets are a little harder to make. The Pomeranian pup had black yarn at the back of her head in the pic I attached.

I think this will continue to be fun for my girls. I might try a hot glue gun for the next pup since the included glue needs a ton to keep things stable & it still isn't as much as I'd like.",4.0

Her mother (my sister), subsequently did all the work, but not without her own share of difficulties. By difficulties, I mean that her pom-pom chihuahua ended up looking like mutated rat, even though she tried to follow all of the steps.

Making one takes patience and an eye to detail. If your child (or sister) is not artistically inclined, coordinated, or can't follow directions, then the end puppy may be deformed. Set your expectations! Even then, you'll have fun and laugh!",4.0
"These are cute and the instructions are relatively easy to follow on most although I would have preferred a little more concise verbiage when doing legs or multiple colors. I feel a mom should have edited the instructions to find the weak areas that would clearly be cause for pause for little ones trying this on their own.
One weird part too is when you finally start to cut the yarn the instructions indicate something like ""you might find the yarn falls to the middle when you are cutting...don't worry! it won't fall out"" when in fact OH HECK YEAH its gonna fall out...unless you position your other hand to hold the middle of the donut appliance firmly to hold the shreds in place.  Not a step for young ones for sure.
This kits realistically seems to make 4 solid color pups and perhaps one leftover mutt but you only get 3 noses (in my case.)

I also ended up using my 85mm Clover Pom Pom maker instead of the one that came with the kit.  The one that comes with the kit doesn't snap together very well and the yarn falls out after it's been cut where as with the Clover Pom Pom maker, the yarn doesn't fall out after it's been cut and the pom pom stays together until after it's been tied.",4.0

Keeps clients engaged while helping them develop anger management skills. The only criticism is I wish more of the cards had questions,4.0
"Used with anger-management group and they like it.
Gave them opportunity to share events in their life with
the usage of the cues on the cards.",4.0
My 12 year old son enjoyed the game - but it is hard convincing him to play. Time will tell if some of the excellent skills portrayed in this game transfer to real life.,4.0
"This game is really great for kids to work through and discuss their anger; however, asking questions in the middle of the game significantly slows play. Some kids become anxious or bored with this. It is a good game to begin discussing anger. Some questions are less important and tend to be skipped over.",4.0
"I love this game for many reasons: it explores all different aspects of anger and offers many opportunities for kids to answer questions about their experience with anger as well as offering techniques on dealing with anger, all while playing a game. The cards can sometimes be difficult for younger kids to hold because of their larger size but I think the size is helpful at the same time for helping kids organize and read the different prompts.",4.0
"This was irresistible because my granddaughter loves this pigeon. It was fairly pricey for what it is, but sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and buy the toy.",4.0
My 4 year old loves this series. I wish it was a priced a little lower though.,4.0
This is a bit smaller than I'd like. It's about the size of a beanie baby but not as floppy. My daughter loves it and it seems to be holding up well.,4.0
"Cute! But it is small if you are looking for something larger.  The size of a beanie baby.  One of the legs fell of immediately, and we had to sew it back on and reinforce the second one, but my daughter loves it, and it has held up after that.",4.0
"His leg came off within a month, but still a cute little thing.",4.0
"The pigeon is very small and pricey, but my grandson loves it so much.",4.0
"My kids love it. It is smaller than I imagined. I think it's a little overpriced for what you get. The 6"" height includes the spindly, floppy pigeon legs, which I didn't realize. I assumed the 6"" was just for the body.",4.0
We bought it as a present so it hasn't been played with but it looks good and appears to be well made,4.0
I would like the pidgeon to be a little bigger as I I use him for an elementary school lesson. But he is so cute!,4.0
"I really appreciate the simplicity of this book for younger children. The eggs are very colorful and attention grabbing for this age. However, the eggs are difficult for children to open.",4.0
This was a very nice Easter story with nesting eggs. I am curious to see how the  nesting eggs  age. I bought a set for two families and hope they will enjoy them.,4.0
This is a great keepsake for a family. Its darling and fun. I love that it is wood and the paint was very well done. I was a little sad to see that when I took ours out of the box it had a big thumbprint in the paint and one of the eggs has a crack down the side. Nevertheless I really like this item!!,4.0
"The egg is a great teaching idea. Some of the eggs won't close,they are warped, but still usable. The book would be better to simply use bible verses and the pictures. It would be better without the poem.",4.0
My nieces and nephews enjoyed taking apart and putting together the eggs and talking about each story that went with each one.,4.0
"Great story! But the book is not real steady. The wooden nesting egg is cool and cute, but you need a little muscle to take the egg apart. We used the egg and the story for our Walk through Holy Week and it was great!!",4.0
"though there was some difficulty at first with taking apart and putting together some of the eggs, that issue was very efficiently resolved by the seller and the book is very nice.",4.0
"Love these magnets, they are adorable! Just a little pricey and not a good assortment of the alphabet; came with one of every letter but gave doubles of not most commonly used letters. Had to come back and by more sets to have all the letters I needed. Would still recommend these.",4.0
"These were smaller than I expected, but they are cute.  I ordered letters and animals.  I will have to wait until my daughter is a little older to use them.",4.0
So cute!,4.0
Really cute & my daughter loves them. The quality is pretty good for what it is- some of the letters had some issues with the wood. Do wish it was laminated or something because I can see the top layer coming off after awhile.,4.0
We like these. Fun durable and good for learning.,4.0
"Full back magnet, pretty designs, great box with a popper closure- my daughter loves playing with them.  They are made of layered wood/paeper with non toxic vegetable based inks.

She doesn't chew them (yet) but if you have a chewer then they would probably not last for a very long time.

Still, for us they are the best I have found.  Very pleased and would buy any of MudPuppy's magnets as a gift.",4.0
The magnet itself should be stronger. It is so lightweight they almost won't adhere to a metal surface. They are really cute & entertaining though.,4.0
"This is a great puzzle.  My kids love that it is not square, but actually the shape of the dinosaur and looks kind of 3-D.  My only criticism is that since it is all mostly the same color, it can be tough, even for an adult, to figure out which pieces go together.  My 5 and 1/2 year old, with some frustration, can put it together by himself in about 15 minutes.  My four year old needs help to put it together.",4.0
Very good and to the point flash cards; many shapes and colors available. Only down side I caught my daughter taking a bite out of the card. Needless to say I would prefer bite proof. Hope this helped you.,4.0
"Cards are great. My baby plays with them. But I wish the paper was harder, so the baby cannot bend the cards.",4.0
"Great product, but it is cardboard. Not as durable as I thought it would be, but it's portable because of it's small size. It works well, and serves its purpose.",4.0
"Stocking stuffer goodie, I am the aunty who gives the books and learning toys. Colorful and use ful to keep my nephew entertained.",4.0
"Great for teaching time to a toddler. I would have given it 5 stars but it is a little flimsy.  It bent during shipping, so I was hoping for something a little more stiff to write on.",4.0
"This isn't a high price item but it is sturdy and really helps in teaching children how to tell time. It is also a great item to bring along when going to the Doctor since it is all together (not a bunch of little pieces that can get lost) and will keep them busy while waiting. The pen writes and wipes right off the board. The hands turn easily enough for little fingers but with use (I admit it was a lot of use) they do get a little floppy so if you hold the board up, the hands fall to the 6:30 or thereabouts. Even so, for the price, it can't be beat!",4.0
"well, we played this game last night at my house. We have all the versions. Our aquire group(4 couples) was countiong the days until we could play the new version.  This cardbord copy of the 1999 edition is as entertaining as the original, however it lacks the 3d feel of earlier versions. I personally do not like it as much. This game  introduced 2 new things: a tile holder (good Ignovation) and the hotels are 2 pices long instead of 1. However  having the 1999 version(our favorite by far) we will never play this new version again.",4.0
"This is a business strategy game where the player has to decide when to buy into a company, represented tiles that turn-by-turn get spread across the playing board. Sound dry? Well, it is a little dry. But it does tell a pretty good story. It is fun to see a little startup company grow into a giant that gobbles up its rivals. There is also a neat mechanic at work where the game doesn't end until a player formally announces that the end conditions have been met, by either announcing that four companies are a set size of tiles, or one company has become too big.

I understand the rating is lower because previous versions of this had a higher quality of components. To me the component quality is alright for the $30 price tag, and overlooked in these complaints is the quality of the stock cards which are of good print. I honestly would not pay for a more expensive version of this game because while I enjoy playing it as a basic game of economics, there are a few problems. The tile draws can be quite random, there is no player elimination but a bad bet early on can eliminate a player from making meaningful plays due to him/her having his money tied up in a company that doesn't get bought out.

Overall, it's a pretty simple yet engaging little game that worth a buy at its $30 price tag. If you're interested in a startup sim with a stock element, then you really cannot go belly up with this purchase.",4.0
"Acquire is what I would call a 'gateway game'.  Most people have played Monopoly, Life, or Sorry.  Those board games give board games the name of 'bored' games (don't get me wrong those 3 can be a low alright).  If you want to bring people out of the board game slumber, buy Acquire.  It is easy to learn and when you get 5 or 6 players, man its tough to win.

The great thing about Acquire is that you might think that you're winning the game then you find out at that the end that you didn't.

Anyways, if you looking for a good, fun, easy to learn game, Acquire is a good choice.  Especially if you're planning on introducing a group to the more intriguing games that are out there.",4.0
"This is a great alternative to Monopoly, in which your success is largely based on luck, in the form of dice rolls or drawing Chance/Community Chest cards. Here, your success is partially based on the luck of the tiles you draw, but after that, strategy takes over. Do you invest in other players' hotels, or only your own? Do you choose to merge with another hotel, or just grow on your own? Do you risk building a hotel so large that no one can buy you out? Because that's how you make money!

I love this game, but my husband won't play it anymore, and I see his point. All 3 times we've played it, he's gotten stuck in the same trap. He formed hotels and bought stock in the early game, until he ran out of starter cash. After that, he didn't draw the right tiles to connect his hotels with anyone else's. So, his hotels never merged, and he never made any more money. Which means he couldn't buy stock in anyone else's hotels. He essentially sat there watching everyone else play, without cash, waiting for the lucky connecting tiles that never came. He acknowledges he probably just had terrible luck, and that scenario probably wouldn't happen again. I wish there were a mid-game rescue rule to help bail out players who find themselves in this position.

I still love this game! I know lots of reviewers are attached to the old-style gameboard in which the tiles slotted in place. I've never played the old style, but the cardboard tiles and board in this edition work just fine. They aren't finely crafted as Scrabble wooden tiles, but they get the job done. I will agree, the cardboard trays in which you keep your tiles are pretty flimsy. Just grab the wooden trays out of your Scrabble box, and all will be well.",4.0
"Let me get the bias out of the way first: my undergrad is in finance.  If you are a finance major, or interested in fiance, stop reading and buy this game immediately.

Background: Remake of the game from the 1960's by 3M of the same name. The object of the game is to profit by connecting two or more squares to form a hotel. If two (or more) hotels end up touching, they merge, with the larger hotel (the one with the most squares) acquiring the smaller one. Money is made by buying shares in hotels and having them grow. Bonuses are paid out to the majority and minority shareholders, and the process is repeated until the squares are all used, or no legal moves are left.

Great strategy game with a enough chance built in to frustrate the best-laid plans. (Invest in large hotels and be cash-poor, or invest in small hotels and hope for a pay-day--lots of ways to play).

Don't let words like finance, shareholders, stock, or merger scare you away. The game is so easy, my six year-old daughter is able to play (with help)--and do well! A great, original game. My friends (who aren't finance majors) love it.

Only four stars due to cardboard construction, and smooth board (which allows pieces to ""meander""--your OCD friends may go nuts). The older versions of this game had a raised grid to keep pieces in place.",4.0
we still play it. people seem to be pretty polarized about this game. some people really like it and some people really don't.,4.0
I've always loved this game. I still like the classic board design better though.,4.0
This game is pretty fun. The only downside is that when I played it was with a large group of six which led to lengthy turns and some people losing interest all together. I tried it a few more times with a three person group and the game went quicker and was overall much more enjoyable.,4.0
"Buying and selling hotels sounds kind of boring on the surface.  But if you went for that knee jerk reaction, you would completely miss this fantastic game.  The game is simple to play, but requires a lot of hard decisions and some memory involved too.
Now some people would complain that this game involves a lot of luck.  It can indeed trip you up.  Because you might get stuck and invested in a hotel chain that never goes down and you are broke for most of the game.  That does happen every now and then.  And it sucks when it does.  But don't let that turn you off to the game.  There is a lot of serious strategy going on here.  Since a person lays a tile down each turn, you need to buy stock in each hotel according to how soon you think it will go down.
So if I love the game so much how come I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars?  Because this version of it is hands down weaker than the old version.  The older versions of the game came with a plastic board where you could snap the tiles into place.  This new version is a flat board that with one bump leads to it being messed up.  Ugh
Still, this game is fantastic.  If you are a fan of Monopoly and want to branch out onto the next level, I recommend this classic game.",4.0
"The pieces are all cardboard, but other than that great game.",4.0
"Great game. Would not recommend for small children because this game requires a high level of attention and understanding. For young adults and above, this is a good purchase. Wish it wasn't all cardboard and had plastic pieces like the older editions of acquire but just an example of being more economic to make cardboard game pieces.",4.0
"Great game!  Has provided my family years of fun.  We had the older version and the game board and pieces are a lot better.  This new version is basically cardboard, but the game is so much fun it is worth it.  Glad they re-released it.",4.0
"I played this a few times with friends and families.
It is for 3 - 6 players but online you can also find rules designed for 2 players.
The rule book is only a few pages and can be learned quickly.
One nice feature is as you add players the game length does not increase there is just less turns for players like scrabble the board eventually gets filled up but instead of words you are thinking of financial strategies. Like all great economic games you are trying to use to the greatest effect your limited resources. If you played the board game stock market and hated it don't worry this game plays completely different.",4.0
"I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the cardboard piece-holders and the fact that they changed the names of some hotels. Otherwise, I mean, its a terrific game.",4.0
"I grew up playing Monopoly.  Lots of people did.  It's unfortunate, because there was this gem just sitting there, begging to be played, but passed over.  Here's what was missed:

THEME
The game is about buying and selling stock in hotel chains, causing chains to merge, and go in and out of business.  Given that virtually NONE of this is represented visually and it looks more like a Bingo board, the theme really stands out.  You really feel like you're doing exactly what the game says you are.

COMPONENTS
This is where the game takes a hit.  If you can, see if you can pick up one of the versions from the 1960's or 1970's.  Those were VERY well made and, as long as you don't need them to be in perfect shape, can be come across for very little.  If you can get one of those, the components are perfectly good.

GAMEPLAY
You have a handful of tiles marked like a bingo board and one central ""bingo board.""  Every turn, you play a tile to the corresponding spot on the board.  If it is adjacent to another tile that isn't already a company, you get to start a new company.  If it's adjacent to another company, that company just grows.  If it's on its' own, nothing happens.  You can then buy some stock in companies which exist, draw back up to a full hand of tiles, and turn progresses.

SOUNDS BASIC, WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL?
Glad you asked.  There's a few twists:

1) There's a chart which shows the value of a company and the price of its' stock.  The more tiles a company is, the more it's worth, and the more it costs to buy stock.  So, you want to invest more in a company, but also want to grow it?  You either need to wait until next turn to grow it (during which, everyone else gets a shot at it) or you need to grow it now and pay more.

2) When 2 companies' tiles touch, they merge.  Having the most (and 2nd most) stock gets you cash bonuses, and then you can keep the stock for the company (as it might open back up) or trade it in for money or other stock.  Being in the right spot to take advantage of those is a HUGE component to the game.

3) After a company gets so large, it becomes ""safe"" in that it can't be bought out anymore.  Getting in on the stock of safe companies is huge, because those companies just keep growing and growing, getting more and more valuable.

SO WHY SHOULD I PLAY THIS INSTEAD OF MONOPOLY
A few reasons:

1) There's a fairly small rule set, so anyone old and smart enough to pick up on strategy for Monopoly can pick this up.

2) It teaches the same principles of investing in the right things at the right time.  Only unlike Monopoly, you don't have so much money that you can just buy everything.  You need to make a choice of what and when to buy.

3) There's still an amount of randomness, and you might have things to do even when it's not your turn.

4) It's a MUCH shorter game.  The game ends when either one company grows too far or every company on the board is ""safe.""  Generally, this is about 45 mins or so, unlike Monopoly, which can last 2-3 hours.

5) For kids, it is a much better teaching tool.  It can still teach addition/subtraction just as well, only now it can teach multiplication (""I'm selling 5 shares for 300 a share, how much is that?""), and chance in investments (every investment isn't always a good one).

6) There's no electronic version with a debit card.

FINAL THOUGHTS
Acquire is a very good, fairly short, light-medium weight game.  It's good for a wide range of ages and, especially compared to it's age and what other board games were at the time, it's incredibly well-designed and strategic.",4.0
"Our friends were very excited to receive this game. I have played once before and it is very educational.
Board games are a great investment.",4.0
"This is an excellent, relatively fast paced game that I have already played multiple times with friends in the first few weeks that we've had the game. The components are primarily cardboard, and the stands for the tiles are pathetic. However, this does not impact the play of the game which is very simple to learn, but is also thought provoking. I really enjoy that no one gets eliminated, so it can be good for families, and there is usually something for you to do such that you don't get stuck doing absolutely nothing as you can in other games. An advantage of not knowing if you are going to win or not is that it allows the game to be fun for everyone the entire time. Great game.",4.0
"I was introduced to 'Acquire' by a friend and found it quite interesting right from the start. It makes you exercise your 'strategy' muscles in the brain apart from simulating memorization, simple math, and sportsman-spirit in a very enjoyable game design. This is in addition to it being a great way to get together with friends on weekends.

The only down side is that the game board and components on the whole are a little fragile, and have started showing signs of wear-out after about a month of use. However, for about 25 bucks, it is definitely value-for-money, and one can very easily work around the durability issues by handling stuff with care.

All-in-all, 4 stars out of 5!",4.0
"Whenever I see this game on my shelf, I get a disturbing visual of Quark's big head from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. I then picture him playing Tongo with a bunch of other Ferengi...a game that deals with buying, selling, acquiring, and other things you'd normally see on the Wall Street floor. Don't ask me why...I haven't had my coffee yet this morning.

Acquire: 3-6 Players, Ages 12+, Average Play Time: 60 to 90 Minutes

*Note: While the box says that the game is for three to six players, I don't see why a two player variant couldn't exist...if one doesn't already. I'm fairly confident that two players with an imagination who are not concerned about following the rulebook to the letter could make do. I also came across the older Avalon Hill version's rulebook and there is a section for special rules for two players...so feel free to experiment.

Acquire plays a bit differently than the other games I've played. The closest comparison I could possibly make to what I've already reviewed is Airlines Europe. In both games, you're buying stock and whoever has more of certain stocks / colors often reaps the biggest reward when payouts occur. More on that in a minute.

Version & Components

The version of Acquire I purchased is the latest print of the game, by Wizards of the Coast.

I need to get this pet peeve of mine out of the way before I begin. The player tile trays are made of fairly cheap cardboard that you have to punch out and bend to make the pieces assemble. In other words, I had a fun time trying to assemble the player tile trays. In most games I've purchased, tile trays came assembled and were of much better quality.

Some people may not mind the extra work and the game is fairly cheaper than your average Euro-style board game, but c'mon...would it have hurt profits that much to just make the components a little better? Also, the player reference tables were part of the manual itself that I had to cut / tear out. For OCD people like me, the manual just doesn't look right now that pages look torn out of it. I don't see why they couldn't have printed reference sheets separate of the manual.

Previous versions of the game were much nicer looking and of better quality, so much in fact that other reviewers recommend trying to find those older printed versions as opposed to this one. I don't mind average to poor production values if the price is right, but this is just pushing it.

Game Mechanics

The game board is made of up of squares that form a grid, going from 1A in the upper left hand corner all the way to 12I in the lower right hand corner. To the left of the grid are the available corporations that players can form and to the right is the same reference chart you'll find in the cutouts in the back of the manual.

In Acquire, turns are fairly simple. Players place a tile, players buy up to three stocks, and finally players pick up a new tile from the supply. Tiles correspond to the squares / grid on the board...for example...you'd place the 1A tile if you had it onto the 1A square on the board / grid.

When a player places a tile next to an existing tile sitting by itself, that player gets to form a corporation. It doesn't become their's mind you, but they do get a free stock card for establishing it. That player can choose any of the available corporations...though some grow differently than others. Some corporations are cheap to buy stocks for early on but don't pay out as much when they grow in size while others are expensive to buy stocks for early on but payout is big in the endgame.

Players continue placing tiles, forming / growing corporations, and buying stock cards until a tile is placed that causes two corporations to bump heads. This is the real meat and potatoes of the game. A few things happen when this occurs.

1) The larger corporation acquires or ""eats up"" the smaller one. If the purple corporation for example had six tiles and green had three tiles, purple would acquire green. The exception to the rule is if both corporations are eleven tiles are higher in size. Corporations with eleven tiles or more are considered ""safe.""

2) The player who owns the most stock cards in the company that was acquired gains the one time majority shareholder bonus. The amount varies depending on how big the corporation actually is. The player who owns the second most stock cards of the company that was acquired receives the one time minority shareholder bonus. Sorry, but there isn't a prize here for third place, unless there is a tie for second place.

3) Players who own stock in the company that was acquired have a choice to make.

- They can sell their stock for cash now, the amount depending on how big the corporation is.

- They can trade that stock on a 2 to 1 basis for stock of the company that acquired it.

- They can keep their stock, hoping the corporation will form again down the line.

The acquired company marker gets put back to its place on the side of the board and can be formed again later on.

At the end of the game, shareholder bonuses are given out to the companies that are on the board and their stocks are traded in for cash. The winner is the player with the most money after that is all said and done.

The Review

All three kids joined me to form a four player game. Explaining the rules wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I was concerned that the whole buying stocks and acquiring would overwhelm the eleven year old, but ironically he ended up winning the game. He randomly bought stock so that he'd try to have more than everyone else, which ended up working out to his advantage unbeknownst to him.

I focused on buying stocks for two corporations in the middle of the board and would have made a lot of money had one acquired the other...but they ended up becoming ""safe"" and I didn't have much money left to buy stocks in other corporations that could still be acquired. I received a nice bonus at the end of the game for all the stock I had, but my son used the money he earned from his acquisitions to buy even more stock than what I had bought up cheaply in the beginning of the game...so he ended up getting the majority shareholder bonus anyway. He earned so much from a particular acquisition that he just started buying out ALL of the stock cards of particular colors until there were none left.

It seems to pay to have money throughout the game and not to focus on one or two corporations, unless you are sure they will pay out. I was tempted to offer him a later bed time if he'd slip me ten grand, but I thought better of it. The game took us about two hours to play...keep in mind, there was a learning curve and three kids of varying ages involved.

Overall, I really enjoyed the game. Acquire is simple enough to learn but deep enough that players can form strategies in order to outdo the other. The random tile placement throughout the game by players keeps the replayability high. I quickly forgot about the quality of the player tile trays when I started playing out scenarios in my head on how certain corporations might play out on the board.

The kids were actively working out aloud which corporations they planned to grow and were constantly comparing how many stock cards they had of certain colors. They were often on the edge of their seats when a merger occured...anxious to see how it would play out. The older ones took it a step further and bought out stock in the growing corporations, recognizing how much money they could make when it grows even bigger. The younger one just bought what he could afford and random chance worked in his favor. They all stated that they enjoyed playing the game.

I personally recommend Acquire if you enjoy games with a financial theme to them, in this case, stocks and money. I recommend that players have a calculator handy, especially for the endgame. The poor production values (when compared to versions previous to it) might turn some people off, but I'd recommend putting that aside in your mind to enjoy the game for what it really is.",4.0
"We used to play this game back in the 80s with Dad, when it was completely made of plastic. Although the game is intended for adults, who are more careful, still between turns you may want to have some beverages and the new game is made of cardboard which makes it somewhat fragile. The vintage kind, has last for 30 years with dad... I hope mine lasts at least 1 year!!",4.0
"I had a previous version of Acquire years ago when the tiles and tile holders were plastic and the overall construction of the game was better. Even though the game now is all cardboard, it is still one of the most fun to play. Highly recommended!",4.0
"This review is in two parts, gameplay and components.

Gameplay:  Wow, I love this game!  I cannot believe with all the gamers I know that no one else has ever played this.  Way better than Monopoly, much quicker with layers of subtlety and depth that make this easy to learn and very hard to master.  My gaming group always seems to find the time to play a round of Aquire every time we get together.  The hardest part I have found is adjusting your strategy depending on the number of players as this will change how you approach your buying and takeovers.

Components:  I have seen many complaints about the quality of the components of this version, and many of them are founded and some I think are exaggerated a bit.  The cheapest component are the tile holders, definately seen better there.  The tiles themselves are quite sturdy and although they do not lock down like previous editions I don't have that much of an issue with them moving all over the board.  The stock certificate cards are quite good, though a bit more color variety would be nice. The Worldwide, American, and Tower stocks are a little too close in color to each other.

Overall I say this is a great game, certainly one of my new all time favorites.  While the component quality of this one is not the best, if you have never played this excellent game, the price on Amazon makes it a worthwhile purchase if you are taking a chance on an untried game.  Take the leap if you havent!",4.0
"This type of review is always difficult as the game of Acquire is one of the most enjoyable I have played but the build quality of this edition falls exceedingly short of previous editions. Before receiving this edition I was well acquainted with the much superior 1999 version. This earlier version contained a raised plastic tile system much more practical and durable than this newer 2008 version which includes only cheap cardboard pieces which float around on the smooth face of the game board.

The game itself, however, is a fantastic and challenging source of entertainment. A game of strategy on the level of ""Risk"" players must build and invest in ""corporations"" which are then acquired by larger corporations in a continually changing landscape which enables the game to be unique each time it is played. Players must decide which stock to buy and carefully strategize in order to maintain a continuous cash flow and obtain majority stockholder positions in order to achieve a big payout in the end.

On the merit of the game itself I would have given this a five star rating, but the disappointing build quality tempts me to lower that to two stars. In the end, I must compromise and give the overall game experience a four star rating.",4.0
Very fun board game for adults as it requires alot of stategizing and math!  Great for adult game night!,4.0
"Acquire may not be as old as Monopoly, but it is older than me and I can see why it's a classic.  Finally, an economic game that is far better than monopoly could ever hope to be!  I know a lot of people who have owned older versions are upset at the quality of the components compared to earlier versions and rightly so, but really, the game just rocks!  Buy this cheaper version to play, and then go buy an older expensive version to store in your closet, so you can be an Acquire snob saying you have version 19xx something:-)

Acquire is a game about investing in hotel chains and getting the most money in the end, similar to Monopoly, but that is about where the similarity ends.  The game does a wonderful job of creating the experience of investing in stock, simulating growth in value as the hotel chain grows, merging, and fighting to be primary stockholder for huge payouts on mergers.  The gameplay is brilliantly simple, but the strategy and decision making can go way deep!  It is done in such a way that the word elegance comes to mind. Even though there is luck involved in the way you draw tiles for this game, I at least get to choose where I want to move by placing a tile. Whereas in Monopoly, you have to move where the die tells you (roll 'n move) which aggravates me.

In this game you perform 3 simple actions: place a tile, buy up to three stocks, and then draw another tile. When I place a tile, I can decide if I want help grow a hotel chain(don't have to own it), create a hotel chain, or merge a hotel chain.  After that, I have to decide on which hotel chain on the board I want to buy stock.  This is where things get interesting, because you know that if you own the most stock in a hotel chain that gets gobbled up in a merger, you'll get some major moolah.  Of course the bigger the chain is when it gets gobbled, the bigger the payout is. So, you may finding yourself trying to weigh out when you should merge the hotel chain if someone doesn't do it first and whether or not you grow it.  Again, there's a risk involved, because if a hotel chain gets beyond 11 tiles, it is safe from acquisition.  If that happens and you're a major stockholder, then you'll keep growing that ""safe"" hotel chain for the big payout at the end of the game.  When mergers happen, you also have to decide if you should trade your stock in for the new hotel, sell your old stock, or keep it for when you decide to start the old chain back up again.  The game has a lot of subtle strategy as you try to weigh out how you grow a hotel chain or merge it, based on how much stock you own in it or how much someone else has invested in it.

Acquire is just a beautifully designed game and is a lot of fun to play.  This is a great way to teach your kids about investing in stock too!",4.0
"Acquire has always been a fun game. I have collected versions of Acquire from 1st release to present release. I guess I'm a collector as well as an avid player. I have to say though that the latest version of the game has much to be desired in terms of quality. The game hasn't changed so for new players that are interested go out and get it and enjoy it. However if you are an avid player of the game for years, this is the cheapest product quality of all the versions. It's no longer plastic, it's all card board. Every piece from the board to the titles is card board. So if you are looking for a version to just take with you wherever you go and not have to worry about damaging it then get this one because you can always just buy another version and replace it.

So in short, it's the same game it's always been. It's a cheap board with cheap pieces to bring down the cost of the product. I think if Hasbro ever releases this game again they should spend a bit more time on quality durable design and go back to plastic pieces. They should also attempt to make a travel version of the game. I'm personally working on a design for that very purpose. Who knows, maybe with a lot of luck Hasbro might pick it up and use the design. If anyone is going to design a better board then it's the fans of the game.",4.0
"This game is fun. At first I would think this game is repetitive and rather dull to look at. But I am always re-thinking my strategy every time I play.  I try to build up one company sometime and other times and spread out my wealth.  The goal is really not to have the most stock in the biggest company, the goal is to build up smaller companies and have them bought out by the bigger ones for huge rewards. It seams like the person with no high value stocks ends up the winner and you you go huu? how did that happen? The only this that is annoying is that you run out of stock cards and no one can buy anymore or trade out when the company is bought out. I suppose that simulates real life, however in the game it could use a few more cards. Over all this game is really fun, and at not a bad price.",4.0

"Fun game where you build hotel empires, can merge hotel chains.  Overall 4/5
PROS:
 -Requires more than simple strategy (you must think carefully about your plan)
 -Can develop your own favorite approach
 -Stock certificates of better quality than some earlier versions
CONS:
 -Can get behind early in the game, at which point it becomes frustrating watching others whooping you (This has happened to at least one player in every game I've played)
 -Like many games these days, seems overpriced: just contains cards, a board, and cardboard tokens",4.0

"Well these folks found the cheapest possible way to reprint this game. No where near the quality you'd expect in $30+ for sure. The tiles and pieces all have to be pushed out of punched cardboard.

I love the game and think it is worth anyone's library of smart, fun games. Imagine if those idiots on Wall Street has played this a few times more, we might not be in this recession mess now.",4.0
"Acquire is not a board game for those who love games of luck.  Acquire, while there are elements of luck, is a strategy game that can become quite lengthy.  Each player takes turns placing a tile on the board which represents peices of a hotel chain.  Then a player has the option of buying stock in the various hotel chains that have been created on the board.  Monetary bonuses are distributed during the game when one hotel chain is ""eaten"" by another, as well as at the end of the game for those holding the most stock in the remaining hotel chains.  The concepts can be hard to grasp for younger players and the time it takes to complete one game could also be trying for someone who does not have a long attention span.  For those that are older, this game can be a mental challenge that can be quite enjoyable.",4.0
"Played the newer (2007?) edition for the first time. I loved the concept of the game, keeps you engaged, and there's opportunities rife for conquest and success.

However, the quality of the game was sub par. Nearly all of the pieces were a cheap cardboard, and as others have noted, nothing holds the pieces on the board in place. I kept thinking why had the game publisher thought adopting a similar design to scrabble, a raised, indented board that could be turned, plastic piece holders, a black bag to hold the pieces so players could retrieve new tiles, better construction on the 'cost cards'. I would gladly pay more money.",4.0
"I am an old role playing fanatic form the late 70's and 80's.  Dungeons and Dragons from TSR was one of the first role playing games I enjoyed.  Although, GDW's Traveller and the more recent versions are my favorites.  My young son is getting to the age that these games are of interest, and the personal interaction can't be beat by video games - at least if you are an engaged father.  Anyhow, Wrath of Ashardalon turned out to be a gem of a role playing game in a box for quick action play, and little complexity.  We took it on vaction and played in the evenings through the first few adventures (realize the first adventures are to learn the game play).  We had a really good time, even my wife played.  The components are of very good quality.  I did laminate and bind all the manuals and adventure book, so it will hold up with the neighborhood kids playing too.  There are additional adventures you can download and print.  Since this purchase, we are also proud owners of many new D&D 4th edition books.",4.0
"Ideally, it's a 5 stars D&D board game as the pervious one Dungeons & Dragons: Castle Ravenloft Board Game for most first time D&D board game players.

The way to play is just like Dungeons & Dragons: Castle Ravenloft Board Game, but it added some more new features such as GP for purchase items, NPC status, and chamber cards for quests.

I like it, but I do have some disappointments as an old player for D&D board game.

1. Monster level is still up to level 6, and character level is only up to level 2, so it's a still short game as before.  There is no exciting part on the leveling point of view.  If they can make monster level up to 8 or more, and provide charcater cards for both current and pervious version heros, and all heros levels are up to level 3.  It will have more fun and make a this advanture to combine with pervious one even better.

2. Monsters... Top two monsters are the same as before like a big dragon plus a key monster.  Little monsters quantity is only up to 3 as maximum.  So, the formula is totally the same as pervious one.  It didn't proivde new exciting challenge to me.  I was hope this advanture having some different scenarios such as my hero to be surranded by more a big group of orc, goblin, or what else evil monsters on my way searching the secrect of wrath of ashardalon, but the maximum is 3......

After we received it and play 5 hours...  I have to say... It's a good game, and it should have 5 stars as Castle Ravenloft; however, it doesn't include enough features as a 2nd D&D board game for players who played Castle Ravenloft and look for more.  It's a game with almost the same formula like pervious one via adding few new features, but not that exciting.  It doesn't provide a good way to combine both D&D board games together making more fun for old players, so I would like to give it 4 stars instead of 5.",4.0
"I'm assuming many people are buying this for the miniatures like I did. On that front it is quite a good deal. You get enough nice cardboard tiles to make some simple dungeons with. The miniatures were mostly in good shape, the moulds used are detailed and the monster variety is good. Some of the bases on the the bigger models seemed a little bent. If you are planning on painting these, you were probably already planning on putting new bases on anyway.

As for the actual game itself, I don't know. I tried playing the single player scenario and the book and it seemed incredibly simple and boring to me. The 4th Ed. D&D rules have been stripped down so much that this is D&D in name and flavour only really. The huge blocks of cards that come with the game, aren't really that attractive and it would take some heavy modifying to get them to where they were usable in an actual game of D&D.

For 50 bucks I got a nice stack of dungeon tiles and big bag of around 40 miniatures. Overall I'm pleased and I've decided to purchase Ravenloft now too. The game itself is boring and simplistic but might be enjoyable to play with kids who aren't yet old enough to handle the full D&D rules.",4.0

"Just got it yesterday and ran a solo adventure for myself. Basically HeroQuest on steroids. Enjoyed it, can't wait to run a full game with some rule variants.",4.0
"...but may be intimidated by the seemingly endless calculations, and/or may not be able to get a reliable group of players together. I never played D&D for those very reasons, but after doing some research on this game, I found out that you can play solo. There are 13 adventues included, and the replay value is high since the adventures are unfolded differently each time by how the dungeon tiles are shuffled, along with the creature/treasure/encounter cards. The rule book is thankfully thin, and is mostly clear with it's delivery. There are a ton of pieces, but as long as you have some sandwich bags, you should be ok.

So far I've completed the first adventure, and I like how they didn't throw all of the rules at you (locked doors, for example).

I also like the idea of taking the components from the other 3 games and putting them together for one giant adventure.

I subtracted a star just because the tokens and pieces should have been organized in bags, and some of the rules seem confusing (but not enough to distract the player from having fun).

Highly recommended.  I can't wait to try the other 3 games in the series...",4.0

"the two notable negatives to this latest round of DnD-lite releases are:

1 - discouragingly varied element of 'randomness' - negative experiences that the players could not possibly have anticipated, accommodated, or dealt with. sometimes you just get stuck in a room full of lava with enemies that repeatedly paralyze you and your one chance to heal yourself fails.

2 - there's no real 'role playing' involved here - it's RPG--style combat, and your characters have some stats and equippable items, but you're just playing with 'pawns' in the end - no in-game incentives to actually include a story or 'play' a character.

both of these shortcomings can easily be addresses with some judicious house-ruling or one of the players stepping up to 'play' the role of the DM (a position ostensibly unnecessary in this game) - but it's worth noting that out-of-the-box, these two elements do seem lacking.

Now - all that aside - this is a super fun and 'lite' way to get into an RPG tactics battle game, sort of an excellent introduction to larger scale miniature war games or more story-based RPG adventure scenarios, and it comes with a surprisingly useful collection of figures (the big boss characters are pretty rad) - as long as you know what you're sitting down to, it can really be a lot of fun to play.",4.0

"Bought it to play with my boys (8 and 5) as an introduction to D&D. They are a bit too young to understand the strategies (takes a bit of help from Dad), and it runs a bit long for their attention span, but they picked up the rules and game play quickly. Have had the game for just under a year, and we have played about six times with a lot of enthusiasm and continued desire to play again. Materials are of great quality (they take the abuse of my kids very well), especially the figurines.

Great introduction to D&D for young players; I love letting them role play out their hits on the monsters. I can't wait to play with them more as they get a bit older.

Negatives: I can see getting bored playing it with adults more than a handful of times, unless you added more tiles, monsters, and scenarios from the other games in the series.",4.0

"In a nutshell, it is 4th edition DnD with tabletop miniatures and maps included.  it has the ""core rules"" incorporated for a board game edition of DnD and allows for mixing and matching between this game and the other two titles of this genre.  I have a few friends over  once in a while to play, and it's nice because we can geek out without having to go through all the headaches of keeping up with full blown DnD ""stuff"" (character sheets, and special rules, and new books, and edition changes, etc).

Not quite as much fun as I used to have playing first edition rules when I was a kid, but it fits the bill for what I need at this age.

This is by far my favorite of the 3 titles...  I think a game called dungeons and dragons should have you entering a dungeon and fighting a dragon.  This one DELIVERS and then some.",4.0
"For those just getting started in the DnD world or those who haven't played DnD in years if not decades this is a good way to get learn/re-acclimate yourself to the games. Played an adventure with a friend on the first day. While the amount of pieces, tokens, tiles, was a little overwhelming at first, got accustomed to the game pretty quickly and had quite a bit of fun.

My only con about it is, that Ashaldaron(the figure) seemed well it had great detail on it, but the assembling in factory seemed bad or poor. There is a slight gap between the two sections and what appears to be a slight overflow of glue that was used. I guess I kind of expected a one piece mold or if not a bit more care taken when assembling. I do plan on painting these figures at some point and I'm not sure whether this is normal or not. As well as whether it will be possible to really paint this particular figure without it looking off due to the gap/glue problem. Perhaps I got a bad piece, I'll probably end up talking to customer service about this issue and see about getting a replacement that was assembled properly.",4.0
"We own this game as well as Castle Ravenloft.  Once we adjusted to the scant rulebook in CR (it was very alarming to make up house rules when we were new to the genre), we found the game to be fun and engaging, and it made sense to try out the second version.  WoA shows some obvious improvements over CR.  We found that the health and monsters are balanced better, though it's hard to put my finger on exactly what changed to make it so.  However, in CR, we basically always had to add a house rule for possible health drops after defeating an enemy (we would roll the D20 to determine whether health would or would not drop and then again for how much).  In WoA, we don't have to do that, and we still win often enough to make the game fun and not just punishment.

Now that we have played real D&D, this game feels a little bit weaker.  I see now the depth that I'm missing here, and it's true that actual role playing is hard.  However, I don't think it's fair to blame this game for being watered down D&D.  In fact, I think it's basically marketed to be that way.  By and large, we don't have time for a full D&D campaign with weekly meetings that last for hours at a time.  When those sessions happen, they are more fun than playing WoA or CR, but they don't happen very often.  In the mean time, this provides the opportunity to use all of that magnificent dungeon-crawling lingo and to experience the agony of peaking around a dark corner and finding a cave bear waiting for you.

Overall, I would say that, in many ways, this is a strategy game couched in the slick skin of an RPG.  My husband and I like to work hard to optimize our plans and order our strategies to have the best run-through.  When we play the game with a full party of friends, much chaos and laughter ensue (because, let's face it, five turns per round produce a LOT of monsters and encounter cards).  Yes, we have had to implement house rules occasionally, but the game is still solid even in its original form.  This is a great family game if your family is the right kind of nerdy.  We've played D&D on the computer (Neverwinter Nights), which was a lot of fun.  But, board games are better at bringing people together.  We can play this in a few hours with another couple and enjoy an evening entirely without screens.  I find that to be a benefit.

Oh, and if you need more incentive to buy this game, you can always view it as an investment in another new hobby.  We have taken up painting minis after buying these games, and we have found that the painted figures bring so much more depth to the experience.",4.0
"This game is great! You don't have to have a dm or any experience to play. Quick and easy when you want to play D&D, without getting a bunch of people together or spend tons of money on a million game pieces! Totally worth it. Hell, even one person can play if they choose. Really fun!",4.0
"There isn't much balance in class choices, I was expecting something closer to the descent series when I read the description. Although leveling is possible, you can only do so once and only if lucky. It's fun but I expected more variety in game play style. The materials are good for a variety of things including your own dungeons and dragons campaigns, with dungeon mapping and models.",4.0
"I was attracted to this game and its counterparts (Castle Ravenloft and Legend of Drizzt) mainly because there is a one-player option. There are plenty of times where I'd like to play but no one is available to play. Single or multi player, it seems to be a solid game.

My only complaints are that the punch out tiles seem to be a BIT less of quality when compared to other big box games like Descent Second Edition. I noticed when I was punching out the tiles, there was a lot of debris on the table. Maybe a poor cut in the sheet, but annoying in any event. They also are prone to tearing if you aren't careful when taking them out. But once they are punched out, they seem to be pretty solid. The playing cards are also a bit thinner than other games. Not too big of a deal since most players buy sleeves for all their cards, so that I can live with. Lastly, the adventure book and rule book are pretty flimsy.

The minis are of great quality and there are a lot of them. Wizards of the Coast never disappoints in this department IMHO.

All in all, if the punch outs are carefully taken out and the cards and books are stored properly, there should be no issue.

For a sale price of $38, I couldn't pass this up, but I would be VERY hesitant to pay full blown retail price.

Definitely worth picking up for solo adventures or a good solid game night.",4.0

It was a good game to play with my wife and 1 of my kids.  The game lasted about 2 hours and we won but only after I made some home rule changes because turns started to get very complicated trying to keep track of which traps were doing what and what effects happened when and if those effects were to end at some point.  Once we just made some rule changes to suit us it was much more enjoyable though.  That being said It was two adults and my autistic 5 year old (me and my wife handled the monster and trap turns for him and he just handled his character) so with a group of 13+ year olds it would have been much more manageable I think.,4.0
"With this set, I now own all three D&D adventure system products,  (WOA, Castle Ravenloft, Legend of Drizzt) as well as two Dungeon Command sets. I first bought Legend of Drizzt (easiest of the three) and found it to be a superb dungeon romp. Castle Ravenloft is brutal, a meatgrinder. WOA takes the middle ground, for the most part. There are times where something leads to multiple monsters spawning at one time. If you are playing two-player or solo, this will wear you down. One scenario calls for you to take out 12 monsters. Sounds simple, right? It would be simple, except that Ashardalon's card is in that deck, too. EVERY time we play this scenario, Ashardalon's card shows up late in the game, usually when the healing surges are already used up. Still, this game is quite a bit easier than Castle Ravenloft, tougher than Legend of Drizzt.

AS with all of these Adventure series boardgames, the miniatures are the cheapest RPG miniatures you will find. The dungeon floor tiles are nice and can also be used to generate random dungeons for tabletop AD&D. Also, the Dungeon Command game sets can be integrated into these adventure series games. Simply take the cards provided, shuffle them into your game monster deck. BAM! New monsters to torment you. (With painted miniatures) I take Two different Dungeon Command card sets, shuffle one of them into these games to add an extra flavor to the game. For example, shuffle Blood of Gruumsh into WOA to fight a lot of Orcs and their homies. The game will have a decidedly Orc-centric flavor. Shuffle Tyranny of Goblins into Legend of Drizzt, for a strong goblin aroma.

Buy any or all of these Adventure System games, they are simple, fast-playing, co-op (mostly) and above all, FUN!",4.0

"I haven't played any type of Dungeons and Dragons games since I was a boy. With work and family duties it would be hard to find the time to play in a real D&D group, so I decide to do the next best thing and pick up this cooperative D&D board game, so I can play myself or with my family.  First off this is not close to the book version of D&D that I used to play years ago, it's a simplify board game version, your character can only level up to two, and go on short adventures.

The board game has many cards, tokens, figures and tiles.  So if you have small children you may want them somewhere else when playing because little hands like
getting into stuff. You get an easy to follow user hand book and an adventure book.

Gameplay can take over an hour plus, it all depends on how many players you have and what adventure you are playing.  This is pretty much a pure dungeon crawler so if you looking for something else like a storyline or true roleplaying this isn't the game for you. Many part of this dungeon crawler is random, like placing down the tiles and picking monster to fight, so difficulty depends on luck of the draw than anything else. Combat is very easy, just role a 20 sided dice and add any hit modifier to your role to hit, if the total is higher than the monster AC then you hit. You should be able to learn the rule after the first adventure. If you never played D&D games, this is a great place to start.

I would recommend around 3-4 players.",4.0

"The short, short, version: Wrath of Ashardalon is exactly what it says on the box--a D&D boardgame. If that seems too obvious to be worth stating, read on.

Like probably millions of other aging geeks, I have fond memories of loooong nights at the game table with friends in high school and college, roleplaying until our eyes bled. But now I have a real job and a family and I'd be lucky to get a group together monthly for half an evening. So I was pretty excited when I saw Wrath of Ashardalon, because I was hoping that it would deliver the sugar high of a good dungeon crawl without the prep work or running time of the RPGs I used to play.

Now, in its defense, the game does pretty well. The bits are very nice, the rules are mostly clear, and the DM-less play works okay. It's not perfect. Occasionally you may run into situations you have to house-rule. I'm okay with that, but YMMV.

This game is sort of the epitome of Ameritrash (and I say this fondly, as someone contemplating buying a 3rd version of Risk): loads of theme, loads of violence, and loads--LOADS--of randomness. I realize that's part and parcel here, but it really sucks to work your way into a great (or at least survivable) tactical position and then watch your carefully hoarded powers and hit points disappear in a flurry of bad rolls (come to think of it, that sucks in Risk, too).

One thing I did not expect is that the game can drag on for hours. Except for a few special powers, no-one can kill more than one monster per turn, but you often get one monster per turn. Several of the encounter cards grow the dungeon for you whether you want them to or not, which keeps adding monsters. Then there are sentry monsters, which can open up new areas and thereby bring more monsters into the game. More than once we've had to retreat to a narrow hallway, bottleneck the ghastlies, and just pray we could mow 'em down before we got Walls of Magma. But if you're careful, and a bit lucky, you can just barely stay alive by clever use of powers, especially if you have the cleric and the paladin in play to keep healing folks. Again, part and parcel--""stay alive until you just barely win (or just barely lose)"" ought to be the definition of suspenseful, dungeon-crawly satisfaction. But in actual practice it feels more like, ""stay alive until the dice finally kill you (or fail to)"".

At which point you may think, ""why am I playing this instead of an actual RPG? I could use all the same bits, do all the same stuff, take just as much time, and have more options and more fun?""

So, in the end, that's what I did. This game drove me back to roleplaying games, first by tricking me into feeling like I was playing one for a while, and then by grossly running over its stated duration of play on more than one occasion. WoA is just what it says on the tin, a boardgame rather than a roleplaying game, and it is certainly cleverly done and has high production values. I like it. But I don't love it.",4.0
"Overall Product
PROs

- The Box
- - It is nice to have an actual container for the dungeon tiles for a change.
- - The box is made in such a way that it can be used as terrain as well.

CONs
- The Box
- - The box is big but only comes with 10 sheets of tiles and a cardboard insert that takes up half the box.
- - Of course, this could be a PRO since it is bigger than the tiles and other tiles can be stored in the box as well.

The Tiles
PROs
- There is a nice selection of different sizes.
- Most tiles are reprints of older set that are not available anymore.
- The tiles are made of thick, durable material and not just thin sheets of paper.

CONs
- No real CONs here.

The Art
PROs
- The art is nicely illustrated, as expected from WoTC when it comes to tiles.
- Several varying pieces including rough terrain, doors, stairs, and prison bars.
- All large pieces and most smaller pieces have just empty, stone floor squares on the back.

CONs
- All large pieces and most smaller pieces have just empty, stone floor squares on the back.
- - Yes, I listed this as a PRO, but it seems like the easy way out of providing more detailed pieces.
- A handful of tiles are just blank on the back, even more empty, stone floor squares are better than nothing.
- - 2 of 14 24s are just black on one side
- - 3 of 12 22s are just black on one side

"This new compilation of tiles offers many items, which should find regular use in your gaming sessions.  Most generic tiles in this set offer few specific details, which is nice since they don't take away from your descriptions.

I like the idea of the packaging these tiles in the included reusable box.  Prior tile sets offer no storage for the included tiles once they are popped out of the package.  This box is sized to just slightly larger than the raw unpunched tile sheets.  There should be room to add in tiles from other sets with out issue.  The designers of the box included a generic tile pattern on the entire outside of the box, which can be used as a raised platform area.

I've purchased several of these and looked forward to including them into my game sessions.",4.0
"Versatile and somewhat convenient, you will likely have to spend some time beforehand to set-up your dungeon scene or you may have some interruption to game play.  Still, I prefer them to dry erase at this point because I am terrible at drawing/sketching anything forget about to scale.  These tiles also work quite well with 25mm miniatures so I feel they are a great value since you can usually get them under $20 a box.",4.0
Plenty of customization within the limited amount of tiles you get. I would buy it again. Any chance at desert or snow terrain?,4.0
"Great tile set! I use them a lot in my games. Many pieces with endless dungeon making possibilities. You do wanna make sure to have a non slick surface under the tiles or them will move around. I flip one of my rubber game mats over and it works. Some times ill but a clear plastic board on top to hold everything in place. That's mainly if its a large dungeon and I want to have it all ready to go before my group comes over.
Definitely worth the money to had a little color and visuals to your rpg game.",4.0

good set,4.0
"Honestly, the game itself is not for me (it's a tactical game, and I prefer dungeon crawlers) but it is fun to play and it allows me to expand my DnD board games and my Descent: Journeys into the dark bard games.

Bonus... the minis are pre-painted, so one less step to be able to use them and the map tiles fit with descent and DnD.

OK game... better when used as a DnD or Descent expansion pack",4.0
"With this I have like 3 products in one, is a like a deck with cards and miniatures included, I got two boxes to play with my bro and it has been awesome!, pity that WoTC is not supporting this game anymore, totally recommend this game, for board game fans and card game fans alike. I play DnD as well, and this serve too well for implementing miniatures on that, both, players and monsters!",4.0
The figures alone are worth the price. Faction Packs are something long been missing from D&D. The actual war game aspect of it seems straight forward enough but I have no other player to fight against so I am hindered from a review of it. But the figures are excellently painted and in good poses as well as fashioned for role play or roll play.,4.0
I like the minis and the game is good too. I have to say more for it to post LOL,4.0
My friends and I play DC often.  This set just added another flavor of kick butt to out DC experience.,4.0

"This is easily one of the most usable tile sets i have purchased, its got a lot of heavy duty tiles and great artwork.

"I have recently gotten my sons involved in D&D.  As a newly minted Dungeon Master with a full time job, it's tough to be able to construct new maps/locations for our quests.  This allows me to toss together many different scenes in a little amount of time.  Each tile is mad of sturdy cardboard with semi-gloss printing, much like a cardboard puzzle.  They are two-sided, so one side might be a road, the other a grassy knoll.  I could see having a few more of these for larger campaigns.",4.0
"I would highly recommend this item to any first time users.
There is a lot of diversity when using this set allowing you to use your imagination to create dungeons.",4.0
"I've been able to implement these very easily into gameplay. I use them alongside the chessex megamat and the grids are even the same size, so you can outline dungeons and when players get to the rooms you can place the tile so they see that room only when they're in it.",4.0
This resource was a  great help in running D&D 4.0 games.  I recommend it for GMs to use in they game.,4.0
"This wilderness set is perfect if you're looking to order new tile sets and not sure which on to get.

1. It comes in a box that also has images on it- so I use it to hold all my tiles plus it can be used as tiles (a 3D cliff effect)

2. You can combine it with Sinister Woods set and other ones to make a huge outdoor area.

3. Comes with rivers, ponds, paths, cabin, trees, trenches, ""Stone Hedge"" tile, etc.

The only downfalls I see with this are that it doesn't come with enough paths and river pieces to make them turn and bend. Also, I think that there is too many fire pieces (I would have preferred different forest-y elements).

It's still a must-have. You won't be disappointed.",4.0
"Lots to like here, Good variety, outstanding artwork, good heavy cardstock, You won't create massive dungeons, but the ones you lay out will be very nice. I recommend using this along with one or two of the smaller tile sets, maybe Caves of Carnage and Urban Underdark.",4.0
"it was everything i expected and a little bit more, double sided, and goes well with dungeons and dragons starter kit.",4.0
"The D&D master tiles sets are a much better value than the smaller sets. Although they come with several nice large tiles and lots of smaller tiles, several of these are reprints from earlier sets. A creative DM could make use of one set if it was a small dungeon or just creating rooms for encounters, but for a modest sized dungeon two or more sets should be used. The box the tiles come in makes good use as a raised platform, as well as the lid, for both have a 1"" square grid that resembles dungeon floor.",4.0
"I bought this because it's hard to come by good outdoor tiles. There are a lot of options here, which can make some very flexible outdoor maps. Some of the tiles are a little confusing however. One tile is obviously some sort of cliff face, but no matter which way you turn, it doesn't look like one side is higher than the other in the artwork. Also, all the tree tiles have a giant ball of fire on the back. While fireballs can be useful, it seems odd to include so many. I guess it would be good for a forest fire.

Overall, very nice set of tiles.",4.0
"We set our campagin in the Woods so these worked well. We use them for other settings too, just have to use some imagination.",4.0

"If you want something other than a large battlemat, this set of tiles is a good starting spot for a DM.  Problem is 80% of the pre-printed modules you have will not use the majority of the tiles in here, and you will need 2 for most dungeons of descent size.
Still if you are looking for a way to laydown a map instead of drawing it, you can't go too wrong here.",4.0
"Hello,I want to say this set of dungeon tiles are pretty great. For less then 15 i think this worth the money. The tiles are good and durable and very useful.. I am a Dungeon Master, i DM about game sessions a week with 3 different groups and these tiles are way better then the maps.. My PC's love them and i intend on using them often",4.0
This box has a lot of varied tiles that are of heavy construction - good quality. These will definitely be fun to play with.,4.0
"I agree with the other comments about the good quality and broad range of tiles provided. The tile imprinted box is especially nice as an easy way to include elevated terrain. I don't have a bunch of sets so I don't see the inclusion of tiles from out-of-print sets as a problem.

I'd definitely suggest this set to anyone not already well stocked with tile sets.",4.0
"Okay, I like this set, but like others I wanted more tiles.  That said, the best thing about this particular set is the box.  Have you ever had a room with a 5 foot ledge, followed by another ledge that's 5 feet higher than that?  Turn the bottom of the box over and set it down.  Now set the top of the box up, right side up.  Now set this in the middle of your Chessex battle mat, add the summoning circles, the water, stairs up the center and a throne at the top.  Now put your minis in and attack the party with an extra helping of box text.  Like others, this is largely a reprint of tiles I owned some of.  Unlike others, I don't care.  The tiles wipe off with dry and wet erase, go back in the box for easy transportation and are mildly water proof so they can go on top when I'm transporting them from car to location if I'm moving.  There are several iconic items, but the rest I draw.  They add some spice and for the discount, they make an excellent addition.",4.0
"Lords of Waterdeep was awesome, and Scoundrels of Skullport makes it even bigger, better, and crazier, like the original game on steroids. You get two expansions in one: Undermountain and Skullport. Both feature 3 new Lord cards, 3 new basic building locations (each on a separate small game board), a ton of new buyable buildings, plus a huge amount of new quest and intrigue cards. Skullport includes a Corruption mechanic that penalizes your end-game points by the number of Corruption tokens (blue skulls) you have vs. how many remain on the included Corruption Track (also on a small game board). You gain Corruption by using the awesome new buildings or completing some of the crazy new quests. Corruption is easy to gain but hard to get rid of (ask any politician, lol), but the game includes a number of ways to get rid of it a bit at a time (such as through using certain buildings, completing certain quests, or playing certain intrigue cards). Corruption management is vital. Don't worry about it early, but be sure to start cutting back by mid-game and reversing the number whenever possible.

This expansion also includes a 6th player faction, The Gray Hands, and an extra agent meeple for each color with optional rules to play a long game where everyone starts with an extra agent (you must use the long game rules when playing with 6 people). There are also caravan tokens which stand in for large numbers of adventurer cubes in case the supply runs short. In a 3-player game, this only happened once, but I can see it being necessary with 4-6 players because you will gain a lot more adventurer cubes a lot faster using either or both expansions.

Tried playing a 3p long game with both expansions, and it tripled the game time to almost four hours, but it (mostly) flew by. Part of the length was because we were learning the new rules and freaking out over the expansion's super-powered new stuff, partly chatting, and one of the players suffers from ""analysis paralysis"" big time, with the other two having milder cases. Pretty sure the game would have only doubled in length if we were less chatty and more familiar with the expansions.

Some of the new stuff seems like it might be underpowered or overpowered (and we don't like half the new Lords, including Xanathar who makes your Corruption penalty less, or Halaster Blackcloak and Sangalor who only score by buying their expansion's buildings and completing its quests, which get diluted when using both expansions). Compare those lords to the one who lets you score 6 pts. from any 1 quest type of your choice, or 5 for each 10+ pt. quest you complete). There are several ways to play 2-3 or even more intrigue cards per turn, and that really slows the game down and feels unfair and overpowered to the rest of the players. That said, both my opponents in the 3 player game I mentioned had the ability to play multiple intrigue cards per turn and I still beat them by hardly playing any intrigue cards. I focused on Corruption management, going from a high of 7 to only 1 at the end, which was only worth -4 pts. to me (instead of -28 pts), and solving as many double digit pt. Piety quests as I could (including a 40 pt. one) to get my Lord bonus of 6 pts. for any 1 quest type of my choice.

If you combine both Undermountain and Skullport in the same game, you have to remove 12 buildings, 30 quests, and 25 intrigue cards from the base game to accommodate all the expansion stuff. That'd be fine--once--but the rules want you to do it every time you play by randomizing which base set bits are removed. I'm not sure I can imagine only playing with one set after trying both, so maybe the best solution in this case is just to yank all the crappiest stuff out of the base set once and never use them again. Also, when the game is prepped for using both sets next time, neither the new storage tray or base set hold the combined buildings and cards properly, resulting in unsightly sprawl with loose cards floating around and a bunch of buildings having to be split between both boxes--which sucks.

Nitpicks aside, I do love this expansion, and you get a TON of stuff to freshen up the game that will keep you going for months. It's a great value and a lot of fun. It's so big and crazy, I'm not sure what the designers can do for the next expansion, but I'm looking forward to finding out!

UPDATE #1: Decided after another game using both expansions at the same time that it's just too swingy, too super-crazy, and unpredictable. And the Xanathar lord is broken and guaranteed to make you lose the game, so I've thrown that card out until it gets an official fix. Tried a game using only Undermountain, and that played much more like the regular game, only reasonably souped-up. Game time was increased to about 2 hours, nothing crazy like the 4 hours using both expansions. And I completed four 40 point quests! Will try using only the Skullport expansion next and update my review if necessary, but for right now, I'm advocating you restrain yourself from trying the mega-game and just do Undermountain first, then Skullport, then maybe try to combine them once just to see what that's like. But I think the expansions were not really meant or balanced to be used together.

UPDATE #2: After playing just the Skullport expansion, I have to say I'm not that fond of it or its Corruption mechanic. Undermountain is way more fun. Not that Skullport doesn't have good stuff, just that a lot of it is overshadowed by Corruption. I've decided to just streamline the base game and the expansions and weed out all the inferior or overpowered stuff (including anything that gives or removes Corruption), mixing just the cards and buildings that are the most fun. Some of these cards and buildings never get bought or played, so what's the point of bothering with them at all? Still others are possibly broken and OP, like the Yawning Portal (4 gold cost building that gives the user 2 cubes of their choice and the owner one and basically hands them the game if they get it early enough), or the Undermountain building (name escapes me) that lets you play three Intrigue cards. And all the new cards that let you steal people's buildings are unfair and create more hard feelings than fun. That still leaves a ton of good stuff to choose from. I'm knocking my rating down to four stars after having played with this set for about a month. It's not balanced well enough, and I hate that expansion games can take so much longer to play. The game isn't deep enough to support more than 60-90 minutes of play time.",4.0
"A great add-on for Lords of Waterdeep. Unlike a lot of add-ons, doesn't change the core mechanics in an unpleasant way. Recommend thinning out the buildings before starting, there are too many now and you can get stuck with a row of ones that no one wants to build as a result.",4.0
Great addition to the base game. Really adds a lot to how you can play the game.,4.0
"Using either expansion on their own is a nice addition to LoW but still leaves it feeling kind of light or not different enough from the base game. When combined they make Lords of Waterdeep a game that I constantly want to play, using both expansions adds a ton of table talk and expands the social feeling of the game while at the same time increasing the options and complexity of the game, in my eyes it is hard for a game to accomplish both of those at the same time and Scoundrels of Skullport is a fantastic expansion to the base game.

Read the full review here: [...]",4.0
"Lords of Waterdeep: Scoundrels of Skullport is an expansion for the original Lords of Waterdeep and requires the base set to play. The game was designed by Chris Dupuis, Peter Lee and Rodney Thompson and it expands the core experience to support up to 6 players.

Scoundrels of Skullport is actually two separate expansions in a set, as represented by two new locations added to the game. One is The Undermountain that includes new spots for your Agents to use and a good number of Quest cards and Intrigue cards that really up the ante. Undermountain is a realm that offers great riches for warriors who are brave enough to risk all. Then there's the titular Skullport, which offers new ways to gain power quite quickly but at the cost of corruption.

Skullport is the module that has the most obvious impact to the game given the introduction of the blue skull-shaped tokens called Corruption counters. Skullport-related effects tend to give you a lot of benefits (i.e. a spot that gives 2 adventures of any type) but at the cost of a Corruption token added to your tavern. Corruption counters count as penalty points at the end of the game and the more Corruption people give into, the more penalty points all players with such counters will have to deal with at the end of the game. Skullport-related locations. Quest Cards and Intrique Cards are designed to tempt you with great rewards in exchange for adding Corruption. And once the board is without Corruption counters, future Corruption penalties mean an instant 10 point deduction from that player's score.

Undermountain really shines in terms of the many quests that it adds into the mix of things with rather challenging requirements but also significant rewards. The quests include those that require a good number of adventurers but the card can also allow for players to use any types of adventurers to complete the quest. Of course there are additional requirements that trigger depending on the sorts of adventurers you send into the mix. And there are some card and building effects that allow you to seed the board with various rewards like adventurers or money in order to entire players to go to that spot.

What I really appreciate about Undermountain is the space it adds that allows a player to draw a quest from Cliffwatch Inn, then play an Intrigue Card. And we all know that Waterdeep Harbor used to have the virtual monopoly when it comes to playing Intrigue Cards. It's a tempting offer that allows one to further advance his goals, but without the benefit of the second action that players get from Waterdeep Harbor.

When you put the two sets together, it makes for a far more challenging Lords of Waterdeep game, especially when you max out the game at 6 players. Gameplay does get a little long at this point and it does require a bit of a commitment to see things through. But it's still not crazy long enough to consume your entire game night with just a single game.

I also liked how they tried to vary the sorts of Lord cards in the game. The original mix was mostly an effort to create every single possible combination of Quest Types per Lord apart from the ""builder"" as she's called in gaming circles. This time one can get points for completing quests of a particular expansion or even get a smaller penalty from corruption tokens in your tavern. Of course how things play out is a completely different story especially with cards that even allow you to reveal your Lord card early in exchange for protection from future Intrigue effects.

Lords of Waterdeep: Scoundrels of Skullport adds an interesting new set of rules to the core game that should keep things pretty interesting. Not everyone will want to play with both expansion modules at the same time, I expect, but the flexibility of the option certainly helps one tailor things.",4.0

"This is only an expansion, so it wasn't surprising that I didn't like this as much as the original game. The corruption addition is fine, but not as much of a game-changer as I was hoping for.",4.0
"One word of caution: If you use either expansion, you have to mix together the items from the expansion with those of the base game, and then thoroughly remove them at the end. Also, the symbols for differentiating expansion items are not terribly visible, so you WILL miss some the first time through.",4.0

"This expansion actually includes two expansions: Undermountain and Skullport.

I've only played Undermountain so far, but it's fantastic.  With three new spaces, new buildings, lords, and quests, a new dimension opens up in the game allowing for bigger and bolder adventures.  Look for those 40-pt quests, they can snag you the win.",4.0
Love the fact this expansion allows an extra person to play. Adds a level of complexity though.  Have not decided if I like that yet. Will definitely play again,4.0
This is a really fun expansion to the great Lords of the Water Deep game. I gave it 4 stars because it can get a bit boring after about 7-8 games.  But it does add to the play in different and fun ways.  I find the cards that came with it more entertaining then anything on the board.  the concept of skulls (and negative points) and derivatives of this is quite interesting particularly at first.  You can incorporate this in.  I will say though that if you are a savvy group of players you can learn to master this rather fast.,4.0

However, each sheet is adhered to a thin piece of cardstock with double sided tape making it time consuming to take off.

"This card game is definitely not boring, rather it challenges the mind, with trying to keep track of Who's Who!
We played with 4 players, and after going through the rules of the game (which are definitely complex for younger players), our game lasted over a couple of hours! We had an enjoyable time!",4.0
"I primarily bought this game to generate Hazards for the the One Ring roleplaying game. I'll start with the positives: The card stock is large, thick and gorgeous to look at. The game itself seems like it would be immensely fun for anyone who's even remotely extroverted.

The way this game can generate Hazards for the aspiring Loremaster is primarily by drawing cards and then matching up colored shapes on the card to a chart. They are fun, thematic and give hints while leaving it up to LM what happens. Now I don't think I am colorblind, nor have I ever had trouble with any other games, but I absolutely struggle to tell the difference between these colored shapes on the cards or on the chart. The creators seem to have chosen purple, purple with Elven triangle, and slightly lighter purple with Elven square. I suspect I, and you, will be able to get around it by getting used to it, I just wish C7 had gone with more traditional ROYGBIV.

My crappy eyes aside, I recommend this game for playing with friends or a supplement to your tabletop. I plan on letting players draw a card, that way they feel as though they had some tangible part of what happened to the party.",4.0

"Bought this to play with my 11-yr old Dr. Who fan. Style of play is similar to Pokemon but much easier to learn. Although it says it is for 2 or more players, in my opinion game play is much better with more than 2 players. We got stuck at times with only two of us playing, although  it was still enjoyable. Certainly all of the Dr. Who associations add to the fun for fans of the series.",4.0

Also, the bean bag animals you buy separate to shove in her mouth while ready should come with a carrying puch and be better made...moving on to review those next.

"I finally purchased this after an especially generous ""secret Santa"" gave me an Amazon gift card and was on edge to receive it. After losing my irreplaceable Buckyballs, I was really trying to find a good alternative to occupy my time at work and this did come through to some extent, even if there are some preference issues. To start with the positive, it is a pretty big toy by comparison to my beloved Buckyballs (it's about the size of a baseball) and the pieces are hearty pieces of plastic with multiple magnets inside. They all fit and snap together easily and it is pretty easy to work with it. It is also interesting to figure out new combinations and disassemble, then put back into the ball configuration. As for the negative, the combination of the shape of the pieces and the locations of the magnets means: first, that the pieces have a clear point of connection and, second, deviating from this results in a connection that is less secure and falls apart easily or, if elevated, spins out of place. What all of this means, though, is that the range of structures is limited if said construct is going to be stable.

Lastly, regarding the book: there is a big philosophical emphasis on applying the methodology of constructing structures with the ""Ball of Whacks"" to everyday life situations. I cannot decide if this is negative or positive. For some, it may offer a different way of looking at situations, but I did not get much out of it that I did not already grasp. After reading a few pages, the book found its way to some lonely, relatively untouched section of counter space to sit until it is thrown away, I move, or recovered by some future archaeologist. All in all, it [can be] fun, but there is an underlying feeling that it might be a little too expensive and the book is just filler.",4.0

The amazing thing about it is that kids can find fascination in it to.  My 3 year old son loves to whack it apart and put it back together again.  Older kids 6-10 love it too but seem to prefer the x-ball and y-ball from the same company.  I have yet to get the star ball but it looks cool too.",4.0
"Good product.
You can construct a lot of shapes with this product.
Good for educational purposes!!
The only complain is the magnets are slightly weak.",4.0
"I received it as a gift.  Perfectly sized, fits the hand nicely.  It's great fun to manipulate the pieces into different shapes.  Options are a bit limited, though, because magnets only grip if they see their opposite polarity in the other piece.  As another reviewer noted, the ""shuck"" sound the pieces make as they pull into position is very satisfying.

Two sets would be a lot more fun if you can afford them.

The book has some interesting information about the design of the ball, but other than that it adds little to the value of the toy.  Its ""Creativity Workshop"" can be ignored and you'll never miss it, and likewise for the short library of possible shapes.  I wonder if I could buy the puzzle at a discount if I left out the book.

Page 42 of the book is filled with an 18 x 28 table of 2-digit numbers (01 thru 15) that is unexplained.  A mystery code included by the author and developer of the toy?  A picture?  I've tried a few approaches with it, but haven't had any luck.",4.0
We ordered several Whack balls for a teambuilding event and used the accompanying book to do some creative exercises! We still have them at our desks and challenge eachother.,4.0
"I bought the Ball of Whacks for my daughter and she just loves it.  It seems to be pretty durable and she really enjoys being creative by making new shapes.  In addition, it was 30% cheaper on Amazon than in stores so that made it an even better buy.",4.0
"My partner purchased the ball of whacks last year for our family and we enjoyed playing with it.  I currently am directing an undergraduate residential program that explores creativity and engineering, and I thought our ball of whacks would be the perfect ""toy"" at a recruitment table this fall.  Prospective students very much enjoyed the toy until a toddler knocked it on the floor and all the pieces went flying.  I am continuing to use my incomplete ball of whacks for recruitment this year, and I purchased a replacement ball of whacks for my partner, since we lost pieces of the one I borrowed.

I find the ball of whacks both relaxing and engaging.  The ball is well constructed, and the  magnets are strong.",4.0
"Given to a relative, under the Recommended Age, but in no risk of hurting himself with it. He likes it a lot. I think the educational aspects are overstated, but that's what marketing is for. It is a toy, and a good one at that.",4.0
"Started to collect office toys lately and remembered this product from a co-worker's desk from a few years back.  I couldn't remember the name of it until recently when I saw it in a toy shop and decided to pick it up.

The Ball of Whacks is a good size.  It fits right in the palm of an average sized hand.  I do think that the magnets holding the ball together could be slightly stronger as the ball has, on many occasions, spontaneously exploded into many pieces by giving it too hard of a squeeze.

This ball was supposed to increase my creative juices... has it?  Nope.  But that wasn't what I was looking for, so that selling point was moot anyway.  What I do find is that it's fun, and simple, and offers up a nice distraction for guests at my desk.  Sitting at my desk, just pulling one piece and letting it get ""absorbed"" back into the ball with the accompanying ""shuck-shuck"" sound is oddly soothing...",4.0
This was a gift for an adult tinkerer and I think it was a big hit.  It is for a curious intelligent person who loves to manipulate pieces and make this into an almost 3-D puzzle. Ideal for anyone who loves legos.,4.0
"At first, i didn't know what to make of my new impulse buy. It was just something i got to have a toy on my desk for distraction, and perhaps a conversation piece. People always ask me what it is, then they pick it up and they love playing around with it.

The weird part is that after ignoring it for a while and then coming back to it weeks later, i begin to dream up all kinds of weird new inventions, ideas for shows, coffee flavors...Lots of these things are bogus or impractical (in this dimension perhaps XD), but occasionally i sit and ponder while just playing with the magnetic pieces and it helps me think clearly.
The item itself doesn't hold any magical properties or really hold up well as a throw and catch toy (Ive tried throwing it up and down while lying on my couch, with messy results...) but its definitely interesting enough to hold my attention every once and a while. Makes a nice gift for an inquisitive middle-schooler or budding entrepreneur.",4.0
"So I purchased this toy as a desk filler at work, I find myself grabbing it all the time trying to build things as so do my coworkers.  This is a fun toy, the price is bit high for a bunch of magnets.",4.0
"Ball of Whacks, A Creativity Workshop in a Ball by Roger von Oech

I love toys and this one has me hooked.  Thirty-six plastic pyramids are fitted with magnets so they stick together with a satisfying ""clack"" to form a variety of geometric shapes.  The possibilities for creating stars, polygons, patterns, and random forms are limited only by imagination and accident.  I mention imagination because you can try to recreate the designs in the accompanying 96-page information booklet.  But accident, I found, was a much more satisfying process.  The pieces seem to ""jump"" into place forming surprise designs that, like a stream of consciousness, lead to further discoveries.  And this is one of the major intentions of this kinetic toy.

Roger von Oech is the author of A Whack on the Side of the Head, a book which describes the creative process and offers exercises to flex the inventive muscles.  He designed the Ball of Whacks to take advantage of the connections between the hand, the brain, and the creative process.  As our hands manipulate the whack pieces, our brain slips into a state of flow - critical for creativity.  So simply maneuvering the pieces becomes the most obvious way to make this toy an essential part of your creative work.
In addition, the information booklet gives more than a dozen suggestions for inducing the creative process for individuals, partners, and small groups.  Use it as you meditate.  Think of it as a metaphor for a problem.  Start a brainstorming session.  Or just take a mental stretch break!

"When I was a kid my family always had a game or puzzle on the coffee table to twiddle with when watching TV. Even though in this TiVo world we watch commercials less, the Ball of Whacks still gets picked up and played with while the TV is on.

This is a timeless toy that can be split and combined in a zillion ways. Not quite the rubik's cube of the 00's, but fun for kids and adults.",4.0
This game is great if your players have different levels of word skills.  There are bonuses both for the longest word and for the most words in each round (lots of little words) so there is a chance for the non-wordy people to compete!,4.0
"this game is very easy to pick up and play right out of the box.  A total of eight hands are dealt which makes the game short and sweet.  We play  without a dictionary which is more fun.  The players vote on whether we  think a word is valid and majority rules.  The game really bogs down with  players constantly looking up words.  The first person to be able to play  their whole hand, with one card as a discard, goes out and the rest of the  players have one turn to put down as many words as possible.  Points are  scored based on letter value and some cards have more than one letter such  as ""qu"" or ""cl"".  You lose points for letters that  can't be played.  You cant play your cards on another players word.  Highest score after 8 hands is the winner.  Spelling and game usually don't  go well together but this is a fun game for any age. I personally like Five  crowns better.",4.0

"No one in my little circle had ever heard of this game but everyone loves playing it.  Just as the previous reviewers say, it's easy to learn and doesn't require so much concentration that conversation is compromised as a result.  We discovered, as others have said, that it is important to pick a reference source that all agree upon.  Pretty much the same goes for similar games such as Scrabble.  So, you don't need a Quiddler dictionary or a Scrabble dictionary, but, you probably need something to help the group make some decisions.  We use a standard Webster and accept a simple majority vote where a tie vote allows the word attempt.  Great game.",4.0
Fun game,4.0
"Fun easy game to play.  We did find that the rounds went really fast, so my family altered the rules to make it more like a Phase-10 game with words.  So, overall a good game to have on hand--can be really easy or made more difficult.",4.0
for granddaughter and she likes it!,4.0
This is a deceptively simple word game that may enjoyed across many skill levels and ages. My kids who are teen and pre-teen play it and I've used it during sessions or groups with individuals diagnosed with Autism. It's a lot of fun and easy to learn. It is also very portable which is good for family trips or use in multiple locations.,4.0
"First we had ""5 Crowns"", which is Quiddlers sister game. 5 Crowns was loved by everyone we played with so we thought Quiddler would be just as good. It was ok, but its one of those things thats more personal preference. If you've played 5 crowns, its almost identical, the difference is you use words/letters rather than numbers. We played it all of 5 times but it didn't take, been sitting on the shelf ever since. Wouldn't say not to buy it, you might love it.",4.0

Awards: 2013 Club Fantasci Childrens Game of the Year, 2013 Parent Tested Parent Approved, 2013 Family Choice Award, ASTRA Best Toys for Kids Finalist and Sharp As A Tack Outstanding Education Value Honorable Mention

Quiddler Junior won the 2013 Club Fantasci Childrens Game of the Year for a reason. Its fun to play while being educational and working on spelling as a child is always an important skill to have. Set Enterprises Inc. was kind enough to introduce me to several of their games during the 2013 ASTRA Toy Fair in Nashville, TN. I walked away with a copy of Quiddler Junior and they sent me more games later but it was this game that really caught my attention. I used to home school my daughter so I was very keen on checking this out and seeing its potential in mixing education and fun for the kids. That is a wonderful combination as anyone who has home-schooled can tell you!

The objective of Quiddler Junior is to earn the most points by spelling words from the cards in your hand. Its that simple!

Each player starts with two cards. They draw one card from the draw pile or discard pile and then discard to end their turn. This continues until one player can use all of their cards to form a word and still discard a card to go out. Once a player goes out, each other player has one more turn to try to make a word and go out as well. After the round ends, the players words are scored with their point chips and a new round begins. Each round from here out will change by one card. In other words, the next round, each player starts with three cards, then four, then five etc.until the final round of seven cards to start with.

When scoring a word, each card is worth the value of points show on its face. If a player cant score a word, they get a turkey (zero points.) There are no negative effects in this game unless a player fails a challenge. A player can challenge a word if they feel it isn't really a word. If they are wrong and it is in the dictionary chosen, then they subtract the total score of the word from their score and vice versa. If the player being challenged is wrong, then they lose the points.

There is also a five point bonus for the player with the longest word at the end of the game.

After the last round, each player counts up all their point chips and the highest score wins!

There is also an alternate solitaire way to play this game included.

Now I know this is a simple game, but it is supposed to be. It is for children. It is fast paced and it keeps the kids attention. The artwork is cute and is geared towards the young children. They will not only learn to spell from this game but also the names of objects and animals. They will learn to identify these things by picture while also learning to spell and it all being reinforced by all the resources combined. Its really a good learning tool and game.

This game is perfect for families with young children. You get to mix fun with learning and the kids love it! It doesnt get any better than that. Its also a great tool for home-schoolers or church groups etc. It fits well into a lot of applications for games.

Set Enterprises is known for good solid games that are educational, fun and easy to learn. They make great travel games and Quiddler Junior is no exception.

Club Fantasci Scoring (Based on scale of 10):

Artwork:  7

Rules Book:  8

Re-playability:  8

Component Quality: 7

Club Fantasci Overall Score:  7.5

I am giving Quiddler Junior 7.5 out 10 stars because it is a game that parents can easily play with children, still enjoy and teach their kids important skills at the same time. It is a very good childrens and family game.

This game is Club Fantasci Certified!

I was glad to find this game on Amazon since we played it with our kids and enjoyed it.  It's a neat game that makes you think and come up with unusual words.,4.0
"Have somebody in the family with spelling challenges?  This is not only fun, it helps focus attention on letter order as well as the mental gymnastics required to make other words as the game progresses.",4.0
Quiddler is a very attractive game and if you like Scrabble this is a different way to play it. A challenge for the words lover. Good for smart children as well.,4.0
A fun twist on word games. This game is good for all ages. Even those not that into games have found this one fun. A good family game.,4.0
I like any game that makes kids think and this one does just that.  You have to find words in your hand in order to go out and stick everyone with points.  The kids loved it and it's something adults can play with them without tearing their hair out.,4.0
Great way to help younger kids with spelling while having fun as a family.  It was a game we enjoyed playing together.  It would be good for those who like cross word puzzles - lots of word possibilities.,4.0
"It's a fun game, makes you put your thinking cap on.  Lots of laughs when playing with more than 2 or 3 people.  We played it with 7 and had a great time.....",4.0
"This is a really fun game. It's easy to pick up, and easy to teach. The cards feel pretty solid in your hand, too. We've had to put a time limit on turns though, otherwise people can end up pondering their options for way too long.",4.0
"It's fun and fast but a bit too simple perhaps for quicker minds, especially the first few rounds when you had fewer cards.",4.0
"Fun and a bit more cerebral than most games, Quiddler is a game that requires concentration and thinking. There are many combinations of words can be created with your cards.  Of course, this can slow the game play a bit, as people try to optimize their hands to get rid of that last card, similar to how you try to create combinations in Rummy.  I would equate the shuffling of cards in your hand to trying to get the best setup moving tiles in Rummikub.

Best feature: Great brainiac game
Worst feature: It requires such concentration that people don't talk much while playing.  We first tried this game after playing Cards Against Humanity, which is all about interaction and laughing, so you can imagine the contrast between playing that and the numbing quiet of Quiddler.

So, -1 star from a perfect rating for not quite as much fun and interaction with everyone, but still a good game.  Play this one before you break out CAH.",4.0
Bought this as a prize for an event.  I personally have not played it but the recipient was please to win it and had played before.,4.0
"Fun game to play with others who have fun with spelling word games. I wish the cards were
a little more durable.",4.0
My family and I really enjoy this game.  Played it with our Grandchildren.... it's a super way to educate and have fun.,4.0
"... this one might have won me over.  I definitely recommend choosing a dictionary to be the ""bible"" for the game before starting, to avoid the inevitable fight over allowed words.  I love the design of the cards.",4.0
"It met my expectations. I played the game with friends and loved it, so am happy to have found it on Amazon.  Service was great.",4.0
The game challenges your thinking and that is good for us as we age. .Also it's good working with 'others'.,4.0
It is a different game and we are learning to play it and it is great for different numbers of players.  Good game for our Grandkids. It came in good condition. Thanks,4.0
"It is difficult to find a game only two people can play.  This is fun, portable and easy to learn.",4.0
We have really enjoyed this new game. Even the teenagers want to play. Great fun for family night or game night with friends.,4.0
"Takes some getting used to but it's fun:)  Only issue.. these cards wear out SUPER fast. Other than that, is all good :)",4.0
"Love playing this game with my grandkids and family.  It's fun to see what words we can come up with.  Playing with multiple generations opens up a conversation about words that you don't see or hear as much anymore.  SImple, fast game, helps keep your mind sharp.  Good for vocabulary",4.0
"This is a fun game that is really inexpensive! The rules are similar to rummy, but with words instead of numbers. Try it on your next family game night! It stretches your vocabulary like scrabble does!",4.0
It is a fun game which everyone seems to enjoy. It doesn't require any learning card rules because it is just word formation.,4.0
This game was something I had never played before and was recommended to me. It was so much fun! I would recommend it to anyone who loves word games.,4.0
"This game was pretty fun, I really enjoy word games. The kids ages 8-16 did not seem to enjoy it as much. It was only fun the first few times they played.",4.0
Much easier than Scrabble for the younger kids. And rules can be slightly modified to make it more challenging or make the game go faster.,4.0
Good family game for us. It took a few hands to understand all the rules. The artwork on the cards is beautiful.,4.0
"I've now had this game for years and it continues to be one of the favorites within the household and among the gaming groups I play with.  Particularly enjoyable for those who also enjoy word games in general, and in particular a good game to introduce to Scrabble fans who may not have experience with many/any other word games.  If there is a flaw it's that outcomes tend to be a bit reliant on one's initial draw - it's common to not make it around for even a whole round before someone is able to ""lay down.""  That could be a plus, though, if you prefer games that have a fast pace.  And in any case is still a test of skill with creating words given limited resources.",4.0
It's a fun little game for just 2 people to play.  My husband and i enjoy it in the evenings as a break from TV.  Quick game and it stimulates your brain!  What's left of it at the end of the day!,4.0
Family introduced us to this game on our last visit.  What fun we had.  Great as a 'learning tool' too to see things from a different angle i.e. not just making one long word.,4.0
Quiddler is an exceptional card game for children and adults.  It makes them think about the correct spelling of words.  Young third-grade school children will benefit from playing the game with their parents.  My grandchildren (ages 8-20) loved playing it during the Christmas week.  Someone suggested it to me as a gift for them to share.,4.0
"First of all, I LOVE playing this game. It's fun, challenging, and I can hold onto my cards, ""trading-up"" points by re-making words already made instead of being the first to go out. After all, being the first to get rid of all your cards doesn't make ANY difference in your score. So, by all means, hang onto them, change a 5 point word into a 10 point word with the bonus for most letters used.

Now, that's ME, my FAMILY, however, made me give the game to Granny so I couldn't force them to play anymore. I blame the internet.  It takes a little fun out of the game when everyone is on dictionary.com via their iPod, Kindle Fire or Android phone trying for the ""most words used"" bonus by seeing if ""mu"" - or some other random letters - are a word.  AND it takes forever to play that way. Sounds ridiculous? It is, especially considering how well read my family is.

In short, this is a super fun game, if you can get your family to unplug for while. My mistake was agreeing that Dictionary.com could be their crutch. Learn from my mistake!",4.0
This game has been tons of fun for our family.  We have kids ages 7 and 9 and they have enjoyed played this with us and with Grandma too.  I highly recommend it for your family too!,4.0
"I think this game is one that every family should have because it creates family time together which seems to be lacking today & keeps the mind active & helps all to spell,especially children or grand children.",4.0
"A card game for those who enjoy playing with words.  It is easy enough for children, and should promote the ability to see different letter arrangements and spelling. I like it as a travel game - more portable than Scrabble.  It will never develop the following Scrabble has but it's a good addition to the family entertainment collection.",4.0
"Great game for families with various age children, reading age and up - adults and children compete on the same level as longest word, the most words both have extra pts.  Good spelling tool!",4.0
I learned about this game in a English pub in Portland OR and the players were having a blast. But instead of being bored after 10 minutes this game gets more exciting and challenges your brain at the same time. We have played it once but really enjoyed it! Great game for adults and a good game for kids learning words.,4.0
Quiddler is a fun word game.  It forces the players to learn a lot of short words that they may not be familiar with through daily usage.  Portable so we take it on trips.,4.0
We ordered this game after my sister in law introduced it to us.  It's kind of like Scrabble with cards.  I bought another for a Christmas gift.,4.0
"This game will be great for the grandkids.  While they are having fun, it will be educational too.family game",4.0
"If you like word games you will like this game.  It is quick to learn and fun to play.  Be sure to keep a dictionary close for challenges, just like in scrabble.",4.0
"Quiddler is a fun game, played with cards.  It is easy to take with you on vacation because it doesn't take much space, and can be played with 2-6 people.  We've played it a few times with friends, and it's a pleasant, thinking game.",4.0
"Fun game!!! I had played this before with some friends but then bought several to give to other friends who enjoy word games (""wordies""). We enjoyed the game although one friend thought there should be points for going out first. Easy to learn and easily transportable. Great game to take on vacation. The solitaire version is fun as well.",4.0
"We played a few rounds of this after I got it as a gift. It's definitely a fun game, but it seems to go by awfully fast. I don't think we had a single round where 3/4 of the players didn't go out on the first hand. And that was a rarity, 90% of the time everyone went out on the first hand. I think it's a fun game that will be part of game night rotations, but I can't see it being _the_ game of the night.

As a side note, the distribution of letters also lends itself well to 'word poker'.",4.0
"Actually bought this for my husband. It's a good game for just two players. I can see how it would be a great game for kids who are learning spelling to have letters they make into words. A versitile game. The cards seem sturdy, but I still wouldn't let my 2 year old play with them!",4.0
"Bought this for my family for Christmas and loved playing it.  Can play with 1 to many players.  Educational, requires thought, and very similar to classic card game gin.  A great buy.",4.0
Great game to learn and fun to play.  Order was easy and arrived quickly.  (It was a gift for a family member). Great service.,4.0
This is a great game to learn how to spell and increase your vocabulary - both adults and kids.,4.0
"Such fast service on delivery! I almost got the product before I ordered it!  Well packaged, too. It's a fun game and the company delivered well.",4.0
"Fun game for kids and adults, can be very competitive or everyone can help other players, good for new readers with help.",4.0
"My only complaint is there's so many cards, it's hard to shuffle. Have only played ""solitaire"" version of this so far, which is fun.  Have yet to win.  If you like Scrabble, you would probably like this card game.  It's gin rummy, only with letters.",4.0
"can be a very fun game to play with two players or a group, although rounds sometimes go too quickly.",4.0
"I bought this game for my husband, but we all enjoy this as a family.",4.0
It's like gin rummy and Scrabble had a bundle of joy and I get to play.,4.0
This is a fun game.  When we played on Thanksgiving with about 5 of us and had a great time.  I plan on playing again at Christmas with the family.,4.0
"This is a fun game.  The rules are similar to Gin -- get each card in your hand into a straight before your opponent does and you win.  But instead of suits and numbers each card has a letter or pair of letters, and the goal is to make words.  The first hand is 3 cards, the second hand is 4 cards, etc...on up to 13 cards.

I like this game because unlike Scrabble, the person with the amazing vocabulary doesn't always win, because several short words are just as effective in using up your cards as one long word.  (In fact, you get a 10 point bonus for either longest word OR most words).  So my 8 year olds aren't outgunned by their word-loving elders.

As a nice plus, the art work on the cards themselves is well done.

The only minus is that the deck is double sized (110 cards) and so shuffling is a bear.  Would also have been nice if they included a container that held the whole deck (instead it comes with a tray that has slots for 2 half decks.)",4.0
I was very pleased with the quiddler card games that I ordered. Delivery was fast and the packaging was secure. Thank you.,4.0
"This is a fun family game that is somewhat challenging.  It helps to know a lot of 2-letter words.  We used a Scrabble cheat sheet that made it much easier for young and old, novice or pro.",4.0
"This is a fun ""puzzler"" card game for adults as well as kids who are pretty good spellers (maybe 8-yr.-olds and up).  My 10 and 12-yr.-old grandkids love it, as do all our grown kids and my husband and I.  The kids often out-scored the adults, by the way.",4.0
"We ordered Quiddler after playing the game with friends.  I love playing the game, and play it with the granddaughters when they come to visit or when we camp together.  It is educational in that it helps them with spelling and word composition.  We plan to order another for a gift.",4.0
I've played this game several times with my adult child and we both enjoyed it.  I can see where it would be lots of fun with several players and young children as well would benefit from trying to form words on their level.  Great family game!,4.0
This is a very fun game! i got addicted to it the first time i played. I made people play it with me so i coulf fill my craze. I got other people really into it as well. It's loads I enjoy playing this game over and over and over again!!,4.0
"Quiddler is a game that I first learned about while on a boating adventure in the San Juan Islands when moored next to a group playing the game on the dock. Quiddler is a fun game involving cards and spelling.  Even though I never really enjoyed Scrabble, Quiddler is a fun way to do spelling in a game.  It is a game that can involved older kids and adults and that they will enjoy.  It's refreshingly different from other games.",4.0
"This card game is plays fairly quickly.  It is easy to learn and even young readers can play.  We are a family of Scrabble afficionados so this game is right up our alley.  Unlike Scrabble, you can get a lot of points with just a hand full of tiny words.  Your children will love being able to beat you at a word game without help.  The only drawback for me was the price.  I feel the game should be listed more in the $[...] range like other card games.",4.0
Quiddler is a great game that we have played with up to 8 people and with children from 5 and up.  Everyone seems to enjoy the word building skills required and you will be happy to see your kids argue over spelling and run to pull out a dictionary!,4.0
"Quiddler encourages players to test their word skills.  Most games these days test only our numeric skills.  It's fast, easy to learn and appropriate for young and old.  I recommend it.",4.0
"Good game for Scrabble lovers if you are: too tired for Scrabble; playing with children; trying to carry on a conversation while playing; traveling and constrained by packing limits. This game is a cross between gin rummy and Scrabble. A good solitaire version is included in the game rules. Rules are not complicated.  Everyone who plays this game with us wants one of their own, and Quiddler is hard to find in stores.",4.0
"We love this game and everyone we've introduced to it has gone out and bought it or had us order one or more for them. The only complaint we have is that the cards get very sticky withn lots of use and we are now ordering our 3rd game. Just wish they were made more like ""bicycle cards"" to make shuffling easier. We now have about a dozen people addicted to Quiddler and are ordering 6 new games this time.",4.0
"I've been searching high and low for games/toys for my mother who suffers from bouts of dementia and has some hand-eye coordination issues.  This is a ""game"" that she doesn't feel like a 3 year old while playing...and it keeps her mind nimble.  It is fun!",4.0
"My kids love this game and so do I.  The best thing about this game is that using little words is all right so all ages and vocabulary can play together.  IN fact my 8 years old whips my 11 year old all the time.
I have also played this with adults and enjoyed it immensely.
We did add one rule when playing with my young kids...If you want someone to help you after someone goes out, you can ask and if that person helps you, he gets 5 points.  I also limit my vocabulary to words my kids do or should know when playing with them.",4.0
"I've been playing the online version of Quiddler for a while and was very excited to receive the cards as a gift.  The cards are quite beautiful to look at (the Celtic manual script lettering is a very nice touch in contrast to conventional playing cards) as well as being fun (nice challenge to have a ""q"" by itself).  They are printed on a decently sturdy paper but I don't recommend shuffling them by bending them.
I enjoy the solitaire and the multiplayer game (plays a bit like Gin Rummy), but wish there are more variations.  Since this is a deck of cards with letters on them, it seems to me that more than one game could be played with them and was disapointed that only one multi-player and one solitaire game was included with the cards.
But all in all, this is a great game for word game lovers.  It's quick paced and rewards finding both many words and long words.",4.0
"My sister gave a set of these cards to my niece this Yule and we sat around playing it under the tree.  We ended up laughing so hard we were crying!  It was crazy.

Gameplay:
This cards-only version has pretty streamlined play.  Choose a card, select one of the four questions on the card and use the tokens marked 1 & 2 to either vote for your own answer or to guess what the rest of your fellow players will vote for as their answer.  We found the gameplay rather awkward when we voted on our own answers, so we stuck with the ""majority rules"" version.  Ask the question aloud and enjoy the debate as your friends try to agree if they'd rather... for example find out that their house lies on an earthquake fault OR an Indian burial ground.

Appeal:
While me and my nieces enjoyed the silly, outrageous and, yes, often gross questions, not everyone will find it amusing.  Should repeated questions about body odor or dangerous stunts offend you, you'll hate this.  Most of the cards contain at least one question of a seriously unappealing nature, but it's fun if you're not uptight.

Overall:
If simple-minded silliness is what you're looking for and you don't want the bulk or bother of the full-blown board game, this pack of cards could be right for you.  A good icebreaker and not a bad little distraction if you should find yourself bored with a couple of silly and open-minded friends.  Just don't be surprised if, during a lull in your discussions about the relative merits of swimming in a three piece suit versus running in a suit of armor, you find that the people around you (who aren't ""playing"") are discussing the same thing.  This game and the odd questions it asks are hard to ignore!",4.0
Cute for kids,4.0
My husband and I like playing games so this is fun for when we're driving I can ask him these questions.. it's a fun way to connect and laugh. I would recommend it.,4.0
This is a fun game for a mom meet up night with a few bottles of wine involved. It's great for getting to know people you don't know well or think you know well. Super fun!,4.0
"Fun game, great stocking stuffer!",4.0
I think this game is so much fun and makes you think.  My family didn't like it as well.  I will find someone who does because it can be thought-provoking.,4.0
Not as many cards in the game as I expected (even for a pocket version) but my 3 teenagers like the game. Great for car journeys.,4.0
I got same game but for 4$ somewhere else this price is way to high for a card game. My 4yr old don't mind the game. He says its OK.,4.0
Good stocking stuffer.,4.0
really fun and awesome topics and love how they rate the embarrising to mind complex to random not very manny cards included though,4.0
"Cute card game, great for traveling with teens or other adults.  We travel by car a lot and this game is small enough to keep in the glove box and have on hand when the boredom sets in.",4.0
"a fun social game for kids. Seems best geared towards later elementary and middle school, but high schoolers would probably also get a kick out of it. I'm a therapist, and use the game as a conversation starter. Works every time.",4.0
"This game is fun at first, so when new friends show up that have never played it...it is fun.
Not something you're going to spend hours playing.
Decent game for a good price.",4.0
"This is a really fun conversation starter, especially on car rides. When we started playing it, we put the little tokens back in the box and never looked at them again. We found it a lot more fun to just ask and laugh at the responses and justifying why you would pick one over the other. Our games usually wandered off the cards whenever someone thought of something, but if you were stuck you could use the cards.

I would recommend a purely cards-only version, no tokens or 'rules' just give us the scenarios.",4.0
This is a fun game to play with a group of friends in any setting. A great buy and great deal.,4.0
"The whole family really enjoys sitting around together and learning more about each others' weird quirks.  Great for parties, too.",4.0
"Gave to an 8 year old.  Four adults played it with him.  We all had fun.  Did not play card game, we took turn asking questions.",4.0
"I thought my kids would be into this more..they always had come up with ""would you rather"" stuff in the car everywhere we go...so seeing ""prompt"" cards excited me.  I don't think all of the subject titles interests them and that could be the issue.  Still a great game though and keeps them busy from fussing with each other.",4.0
"He careful, there are some really gross cards to be read in there.",4.0
"Some of the questions are not for kids.  The way the 'game' is structured, it's designed for interaction and to drag out the game a bit.  But you can always change the rules and make up your own version, or even just simply ask the questions to stoke a conversation.  Fun all around.",4.0
Cute game for kids! Keeps them busy on long car rides.,4.0
Good product!,4.0
fun game for all ages,4.0
THis is a fun little game that gets kids (every age) thinking!,4.0
Bought this as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. The kids seem to like it. Good for long car rides!,4.0
exactly as expected.  Compact enough to take out with us.,4.0
"This is good for laughs, on a car ride etc. Takes up little space in the car and isn't an electronic device. Win-win.",4.0

My kids love this!,4.0
fun family game,4.0
"The game is fun to play with my grandson.  The cards themselves were in perfect condition and arrived quickly, however, I doubt the pack was factory-sealed as advertised.  The box had a slight tear at the top.  All in all, a good purchase.",4.0
Enjoying the questions my kids are asking about money and budget. Moonjar helps to illustrate some concepts that might be abstract otherwise.,4.0
Great tool to help a child understand how to work with his money.  I especially like the sharing section which teaches charity and compassion.,4.0
"I think the boys will like it but I should have looked at the size, it's a bit smaller than I would have expected.  It's plastic but a heavy plastic.",4.0
"A little smaller than I expected, plastic boxes, easy to open and handle for a child.",4.0
Would repurchase.,4.0
"The kids love this bank. The three portions (spend, save, and share) have been great about teaching the value of money. The coins make a satisfying ""thunk"" for the kids when it hits the metal of the bank. They love it. :) There's a large rubber band that holds the three sections together. It hasn't lost its stretch even after extended use.",4.0
These are colorful and my kids will love learning about saving with these jars.,4.0
It's good for coins but not for dollars,4.0
"My son is 7, and we started paying him a small salary for various jobs/chores he does around the house ranging from helping wash the car to folding laundry. It amounts to about $7 a week.  We wanted to find a good way for him to learn the difference in spending, giving, and saving, and the Moonjar seemed like a good solution.

The jar itself is metal with plastic lids, all held together with a rubber band.  It's not the greatest construction out there, but it serves its purpose.  We especially liked the small registry that comes with it, so he can keep track of what's going in and out of his jar.  It gives him the ability to practice his math as well has developing good record keeping skills as well as building helpful saving/charitable habits for later in life.

We keep it up on top of our hutch because I do not believe it would last long in the hands of our 1st grader, and we just bring it down on ""pay"" day or when he wants to get some spending money.  I can envision it getting broken, or having the lids/separated sections getting lost.

Overall, I think this is a great idea, but I do wish it was better constructed.",4.0
Larger than I expected which is not s bad thing. My only wish is for the lids to be tighter. My kiddo has an easy time getting the lids off which makes it less mysterious than a traditional bank and also is a little messy for a preschooler.,4.0
The three parts don't stay together without this massive rubber band which was lost as soon as we opened the package. But otherwise I dig it and so do my kids. My 4 year old already knows what the three jars are for and why we have three. Really easy way to teach generosity and money management.,4.0
Love the concept. Construction is sturdy. It is a gift for grandson. It appears to be up to the task.,4.0
Our daughter is enjoying using this box to keep track of her allowance.  It seems pretty durable.,4.0
"We bought this for my daughter to teach her about money. We love the design and colors and she has really gotten into the ""spend, save, share"" aspect of it. I only gave it four stars, instead of five, because I wish it were slightly bigger. The design caters to change much better than it does to bills. That being said, bills still fit in the top and, having compared this to many others, we are still glad we purchased this one.",4.0
i like  the concept but i thought they came in some thing that held  the m together. that something is a big yellow  rubber band.,4.0
"When i bought them, i did not realize that each of the box is separate and comes apart.  And if the rubber that's holding them together breaks, you are out of luck.",4.0
Great tool for the kids to learn about money and spending concepts.,4.0
"Great way to teach children the importance of money.  Use this in conjunction with a Responsibility Chart to earn allowance that ultimately goes into the Moonjar!

Pros:
- Teaches kids the importance of money and how to properly save!
- Compact enough where it doesn't take too much space.
- Colors helps my daughter differentiate the Save, Spend, Share money box.
- Attached write-up gives examples of % split and how to discuss the importance with your child
- Yellow Rubber band durable enough to keep them all together.",4.0
Helpful way to teach kiddos about money.  I wish there was a way to keep then connected without the cardboard.,4.0
Great as a learning tool for saving money.,4.0
"Wish they connected by something other than the rubber band, but the concept is GREAT and my kids are enjoying them!",4.0
bought a few as gifts for grandchildren ... hopefully it will help them learn the 3 S  system  The gifts were well received and feedback has been good.  there are 3 individual containers held together by a sturdy band  ... informational booklet is included as well.,4.0
Very happy with the purchase.  My 4 year old grandson has taken right to it.  Although I hope it isn't leading him prematurely toward  a consumer lifestyle.  At least he is learning to save for the purchase.,4.0
Like the concept to teach little ones about choices and savings.  Think it would be even better if the pieces were more integrated-not put together w/rubber band.  Little hands could handle better.  Appearance is nice-looks good on a shelf.,4.0
"After I ordered this, I saw that a Pig Savvy Bank was available...with a 4th category...'invest'. I wish I would have this as part of the Moneybox I ordered...and you can see the money in the bank.  This Moneybox will be great, just wanted the 'invest' part of it.",4.0
"Love the concept of this piggy bank. Great for teaching how to save, spend and share money.
Only drawback is the band that keeps the 3 separate compartments together is not super tight. It needs to be lose to allow room for them to come out, but I feel like it doesn't keep them together very well. I wish I would've bought one that was 1 piece with different compartments & tops.",4.0
"This bank really has helped in keeping my daughter's money organized since she was 6. The system aids in talking about how and when we spend money. It has provided her with opportunities to make choices about purchasing and donating, taking some of the pressure off us to pay for everything she wanted. She is very pleased to have a place for her own money with unlimited access. She takes pride in saving and donating her money. It was a little spendy for the bank itself as its not constructed that well, but at least it's mostly metal and is holding up so far. I couldn't fine a better option, so over all we are pleased with the purchase.",4.0
The moonjar makes it very easy for my 9 year old to see where his money is going and how it is adding up.,4.0
"I purchased this product to help my kids with understanding the importance of money.  As simple as this is, it works well and the kids look forward to depositing money in the respective compartments.",4.0
The product arrived exactly as is described.  Material is sturdy and should last a while if taken care of.  Great way for a child to learn how to save money for different purposes which sadly isn't taught today.,4.0
The money boxes are well made and go together well.  The little account book is a nice touch for the kids to keep track of their money.,4.0
"Great product that teaches kids well. Made of high quality material. I would prefer the pieces to be connected, rather than just separate pieces with a rubber band wrapped around them, but they work. Just hope the rubber band holds up well. My son loved getting it for his birthday.",4.0
"I have been looking for the perfect bank for my 6 year old son who is very interested in learning about money. I think this bank is perfect! the 3 compartments are just the right size, and i love how they stay together. however, you must keep a constant eye on the rubber band that secures them. it easy to misplace. my only suggestion for this bank is to include an extra band or make the compartments permanently locked together. other than that, we love it. it has definitely helped teach and promote responsible money habits.",4.0
