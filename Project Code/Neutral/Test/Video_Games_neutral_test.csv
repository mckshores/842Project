Review,Rating
Doesn't say.  But is not compatible with newer model Macs.  So have to do a big headaches worth of stuff to be able to even run it.  Then it freezes and sticks all the time.  Not happy at all,2.0
"found the game a bit too complicated, not what I expected after having played 1602, 1503, and 1701",2.0
"Well, I read some ratings before i purchased this game. I watched video on youtube, and  figured I could figure out how to play. Well, I could  not. And as the other reviews state...there are no instructions inclueded.",2.0
"I finally broke down and bought this game.  I have played all of the other titles in the Anno series so I was reasonably confident I would like this installment.

I did, but...

First off: no CD-KEY printed on the manual cover (a .pdf file to boot).  I spent the next 3 days exchanging emails with Ubisoft to get one.  This entailed screen caps of receipts, manual covers and proof of a real CD (they were very helpful).  Ok, Now I can play... NOT!  Every time it loaded, it Crashed To Desktop (CTD).

Ok, so now I have spent another day looking up info on the web about that.  I had to lower my computer resolution to 800x600 AND change some of the graphics settings to low AND had to turn off stuff in the uPlay settings.

Ok, finally got a profile setup (and you only get 1).  Now, I get to play... NOT!  Every time I accept a side mission it CTD's and I have to kill the proses just to exit the game.

I can put up with a lot of stuff if the game runs, but I cannot deal with having to save before every quest, mouse over on the info tabs, etc just in case my game crashes.  Hell, I cannot even play single missions without it crashing.  I was hoping the expansion would help stabilize it, but I have decided to send them both back.

I was willing to put up with uPlay, even if the DRM sucks.  What do you mean I can't change my hardware?  Ok, I have a laptop and thought that would be ok.  Till I found out that 3 is the limit.  I do plan to get several new computers over the next decade.

I really wanted to play a more modern feeling Anno.  From what I have played, its a fantastic game, but...

At least I still have 1404 Gold.",2.0
too much work to set up and play requires internet to play and too many items to set to play.,2.0
"The game hangs after the Dirt 3 logo comes up so I couldn't tell you how the game is.  I couldn't find any solutions on Codemaster's forum that actually worked for me either.

Codemasters also got hacked so I can't register to ask questions on their forum.  At least the game was free when I bought a particular video card.

Edit:

I finally got the game to run after I deleted some sound driver called Rapture 3d that the game automatically installs.  I ran a race and the game worked well with my Fanatec wheel.  I left the game and came back later and none of my controller settings were saved so as I started a race I suddenly had to use the keyboard.  I fixed the controller settings again and then I had no force feedback in the wheel.

When the game works it's great.  I've got the graphics completely maxed out and they look nice.  The surround sound is nice as well.

System specs:

AMD Phenom II X6 1100T
2X Radeon 6870 1GB in Crossfire mode
16GB DDR3 1300 Ram
HT Omega Striker sound card",2.0
This game requires that you open an online account to play the game. A constant online source is required. Gave the game away.,2.0
"I still haven't figured this one out. Did everything as instructed but the game never installed. Strange. Since I don't like to rate on something I couldn't get to work, I'll just say that I didn't like it because I couldn't get it to work :P For those that did manage to get it installed, I'm sure it's a great game. I had the first Dirt and it was a scream! Too bad this one bombed. Maybe a bad disc...",2.0
"This game is full of extra DLC'S to buy.
I really enjoyed dirt 2 and just wanted to keep playing .
This game is expensive. I already payed for it. Stop telling me that I have to freaking buy more stuff.",2.0
"The game itself is great, but Games for Windows Live is such a frustrating piece of garbage.  I wish it would just die and stop bringing down my PC gaming experience.",2.0
"I first owned this game on XBox then PS3 and was extremely impressed with the fun factor. The realism isn't all there however. The issues I have are Group B is horribly slow and weak. Playing the game with a sim wheel is impossible because of the preschool degrees of steering. So I thought I'd buy the PC version

 As for the PC version, I can't even get it to play. My pc is more than capable of running this it just has an error every-time.

For someone with any interest in rally I suggest Richard Burns Rally. Its so good it has me actually doing real rallys in real life.",2.0
"I bought this because I read in a review that it was the best car game of 2011. The graphics are good, the car handling is good althought with a small delay from my steering wheel. I had to eliminate the force feedback and tweak it quite a bit to have it to a point where the delay would have a minimal interference with gameplay.

The competitions in the game are lame and it is not a game that invites you to play. The career mode is lame in that they make you do all sorts of challenges like spinning your car and making it skid, and then different styles of racing (rally, tarmak, race with others on dirt) with lame cars. If you like one particular style of racing, you are really forced to do all styles so it gets old.

I must say, the driving engine is good, but the game is just boring and doesnt entice me to keep playing. Every since I bought it, Ive played it 7 times (believe me, I gave this game a fair chance and that is most I was willing to play this game)",2.0
"Bought for future investing/collecting. Paper included isn't personally signed by the guy,its just a copy. and this actually dropped in price 40% in the last 9 months since I purchased.",2.0
Feel ripped off the bookmark was damaged right out of the box I'm sure not all are like this but sadly that was what I ended up with the books are great nice quality ....wish I could somehow exchange the damaged one,2.0
"I pre-ordered to get this last year as a Christmas present for myself from my parents. Upon receiving it, it was handled with great care. I had left it closed until earlier today because I just had to hold the guides in hands. I took the plastic off and opened the chest. I was without a doubt worthy of 5 stars, that is until I look more closely. At first, I had only taken out the Wind Waker HD and spent 15 minutes preparing the spine for reading. When I was finished, I took out the next guide, Skyward Sword, and immediately saw a scratch on the upper backside of the spine. Upon further observations, I noticed that there were small dents near the bottom of the spine and even what appears to be some hot glue coming from the bottom of the binding. I was expecting something I would be fond of for years to come not something that would ruin my day the first day I were to open it.

Pros:
- best price
- great themed case
- love the style of the covers
- loved the bookmark and letter of authenticity

cons:
- poor craftsmanship ruined my day

Conclusion:
  It's an amazing product if and only if you don't mind what appears to be poor handling before distribution.",2.0
"To begin with, the set is a good one if you havnt gotten each individual book already.
The main reasons for getting this are,
Very nice gold colored metal bookmark.
While cheap, book holding chest.
Ocarina of time 3d hardback book
Secondly. The autograph is printed, not hand signed.
Thirdly, if you can find out where it's coming from I would. If it comes from prima directly it's packaged very well.
Im not sure where mine came from but it was in a much larger than needed box with extra paper holding it in place... And the bottom of the chest was damaged because of it.
Finally, the set seems cheap. One of the books in my set had some of the pages bent and the inside cover was dog eared.
I would be weary of getting this set without seeing in person what your getting. You may be pleased or unhappy.
Being a huge fan and collector of Zelda, this set was soso. If the chest hadn't been damaged and my book not messed up it would have given it 4 stars. Damaged by both manufacturing and shipping.",2.0
"I'm an avid Zelda collector and love almost all of the games. I also enjoy collecting some nice books that are mostly all hardcover and made well for long lasting use.

This set is just not good quality all around. Let's start off with the bad:

-All of the books have a huge scent of glue upon opening it, as well as ""goops"" of glue all around the binding clumping pages together.
-Gild is already wearing off on some of the books upon opening the set
-Badly bound - this is the biggest deal breaker here. It's not sewn and it's a 'perfect binding' which is the least reliable of the sort. Pages will fall out with light use as has been the case with many, many books with this type of binding.
-General scuffs around the books and bookmark - not up to 'collector' standard, a lot of tiny scuffs here and there on all items inside.

The Good:

-The box (chest) feels very good, much better than other cardboard box sets. It feels nice and rigid for what it is. No problems there.
-The game guides themselves provide great amount of content
-The bookmark, besides the few little scuffs, is fantastic. Really nice.

All in all, the binding is the biggest deal breaker for me. It is basically just a paperback glued to a hardcover and provides no real advantage over paperbacks. Pages falling out with ease is not my definition of a collector's set and definitely would not pay the asking price for it.",2.0
"I didn't enjoy this game nearly as much as I hoped to. It's repetitive, and the Nintendo DS screen is often much too small to effectively seek out the differences in the the two images. I can't recommend this game for the Nintendo DS format, not in good conscience. It's a headache-maker.",2.0
For a chess program that has been around so long I expected much more. the program is hard to use - an on-line manual or tutorial would be most helpful. In my opinion Brain Games Chess is far more enjoyable.,2.0
This product should only be purchased by a serious chess enthusiast. It's a bit difficult to navigate the software and it didn't come with any instruction manual. I wouldn't recommend it for a casual player.,2.0
"I went back to my old Chessmaster program.  Fritz is not the easiest to use, and not as flexible as Chessmaster, but it has a stronger chess engine.",2.0
"Fritz Chess program, has everything you can think of,for a complex chess game. But it's not a fun chess game to play. It's not user friendly when you're wanting, to play for fun.

I have used Spark Chess game on line. It's fun, easy to see your chess board pieces, not a complex chess game,it display your game pieces movement on the board,and has different levels for players.

If you're wanting to be a Grand Champion, Fritz is your program.",2.0
"Does not pick up sound unless you eat the mic. If you're hungry, it's still just a three star mic.",2.0
Bought to use with Exbox 360 - Rock Band.  Only works sometimes.  Have to unplug and restart console multiple times and eventually it will work...until you are done and want to play next time.,2.0
Works okay but not much better than my mic in my cheap earbuds. Bought it for youtube videos but my voice still sounds crappy.,2.0
"I don't know if it was mine but offers almost no volume, don't know if it was just mine.",2.0
Worked fine when it arrived on Friday.  Not great on sensitivity but worked. We'll call Tuesday the day the music died.  Just stopped working in the middle of a song.,2.0
Awful controller. Tamborine slaps in Rock Band 4 just don't register. Went with the official mic and things are much better now.,2.0
"This product will not work with my copy of  Guitar Hero greatest hits and rock band Beatles. however it will work with some Guitar Hero Track Packs. instead of this product, I would suggest and official Logitech microphone, not one sold by this Logitech seller.",2.0
Causes distortion compared to the Xbox mic,2.0
NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SINGSTAR on PS4.,2.0
Did not work for my game. Had to buy different ones.,2.0
It's not that great,2.0
"The voice is delayed, and it doesn't have the volume control on the microphone. I have to use the computer to adjust the volume, not very convenient.",2.0
"Why the false advertising? I thought I was buying a Logitec mic for my Rock Band 3 game (Xbox 360) but what I got was a first generation Guitar Hero mic. Not at all like what was advertised in the picture. But then again, they work, so I can't complain too loudly.",2.0
"This product was advertised as new, I expected it to come in a box since this was a gift, it came wrapped with stuffing in an envelope.  I hope the product works.",2.0
I can not get this microphone to work for nothing. So annoying. I have seen that lots of others have this problem as well. Tried several patches nothing seems to work. I wouldn't buy it again.,2.0
No stress collar for the wire coming out of the mike.  Audio pickup is questionable at times.  Wish I had spent more.,2.0
"Probably a fine microphone - but it DOES NOT WORK WITH Wii LEGO ROCK BAND.  It may work with other Rock Band products though.

If you need a Microphone for Lego Rock Band, it has to be a Logitech microphone.",2.0
"This is obviously not the stock part...that's ok, you get what you pay for.

It works, but the battery life is quite short.",2.0
"Do not buy system will tell you 6hrs remaing 100% batery life after 40-60 minutes will shutdown. Put to charge 10 minutes later light goes off use psp-2000 and dies.
will spend more if I returned.",2.0
"well the battery took a lil while to get use to the psp i DO NOT i repeat (((DO NOT))) reccomend it for hackers for me it would constantly die or turn off for no specific cause also it would refuse my charge sometime don't know if its cause the hack or its just like that............. ONE MORE THING if you like using your psp at full potential this battery isn't for u itll die like in an hour thirty minuites ONCE AGAIN don't know if its because my psp was hacked or what......

ARRIVED PRETTY QUICK AND ITS OK AS A PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE.................",2.0
The Screen was not new. It was full of scratches and dents. I cleaned it up and installed it because I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it and getting another one. It did work but once again it is not new and in bad condition.,2.0

however this did work after installation
USE THE IFIXIT INSTRUCTIONS",2.0
"I enjoyed the first Hawx game. However they left out some key things in Hawx 2

1) No coop mode - I really enjoyed that
2) Can't choose your own plane right off the bat. You have to use whatever they tell you.

Those two things will make me not play this game anymore!",2.0
I got the software in a sealed unopened case. I tried to install the program and the error code was 'Key code was been used before'.  I am in contact with Ubisoft.com for support. I hope to have it fix soon. So I can use it and rate it.,2.0
"I loved the first Hawx PC game when it came out. Playing Hawx 2 got boring after several missions, is just a shame.",2.0
didn't work correctly,2.0
"It works fine for PS/PS2 controllers, though rumble isn't supported. In analog mode, the D-pad is mapped to buttons 13-16 instead of a hat switch as you might expect. This can mean extra configuration for some games, but it does allow it to register simultaneous presses of opposite directions (eg. left+right), which has always been one of the odd things about PlayStation controllers. In digital mode, the left stick reads as centered but the Z and Z Rotation axes (right stick) are either all the way up or down, which can cause some trouble.

The N64 side doesn't work at all for me. I tried it with both an OEM Nintendo controller and an InterAct MakoPad 64 (both tested and work perfectly with a real N64). With both of them, all buttons and axes (even the ones N64 controllers don't have, like the right stick) constantly press and unpress on their own.

Note that there is a switch on the left side of the unit that switches between N64 and PlayStation modes. Away from you is PlayStation (left/red LED), towards you is N64 (right/green LED). I say this because there are no instructions and the switch is completely unlabeled.",2.0
"I got this as a way to use my N64 controller with my Mac and PC based emulators.  first off. the reason it gets 2 stars is that the controller did work for my PS2 pack. however since the main reason I got it was for use with N64 emulators I felt very disappointed. I ordered another one, the only other one on the market is seems that has 2 N64 plug ports, and that worked flawlessly.

as a duel function device, this isn't worth the unsealed cardboard box it came in.

as a PS2 2 usb adapter, it is ok.",2.0
"I ordered this product with hopes to get in on some good N64 emulation, instead I received a headache. It was plug and play, as advertized which was accurate. The PS2 port worked just fine but the N64 port, as others have mentioned, malfunctions. The buttons press on their own, it's just awful. I tried every little fix mentioned by others and I'm pretty damn tech savvy so for me to not get this thing to work, good luck trying it with yours. Seriously, do not buy this product, even if it does work I doubt ti will for long. It's cheap plastic, the ports are anything but firm, there's rattling plastic inside and if the appearance doesn't scream ""cheap"" to you right off the bat, I don't know what would. The only reason this thing is getting 2 stars and not 1 is because the PS2 port works which may serve me some use eventually.

Out of frustration I ordered the May Flash N64 Controller Adapter with over-night shipping. I plugged it in, no drivers needed, plugged BOTH controllers in and they worked no problem, literally took 30 seconds from plugging it in until I was playing. On a 64bit version of Windows 7 Home Premium!!",2.0
"Like many other reviewers, I bought this to use my N64 controller with an emulator. This adapter worked perfectly with the first N64 controller I tried, besides having to recalibrate the analog stick to compensate for the wear it received over the years. However, my second N64 controller didn't work, it went haywire like many of the other reviews describe. It's very strange because I bought both of the controllers at the same time, the only difference is that the second controller had less play in the analog stick.

Also, there was no installation CD included with mine, but fortunately I didn't need it. The front side the packaging states ""DRIVER INCLUDED"" but the rear of the packaging states that the drivers are ""pre-installed.""

Even though it does work fine with one of my controllers, I definitely would not recommend this adapter to anyone.",2.0
"I cannot seem to get this controller to work, and I also don't believe that there is support for Mac computers. However, it shipped quickly!",2.0
showed up on time and was well packed but.. when i plugged it in it didn't work with my games,2.0
It looks interesting at the beginning but I was bored after less than 25 hours of play. Not enough variety in the missions.,2.0
"I installed this on a Dell Dimension 2400 with 2GB of RAM and a Ge Force 6200 Video card.  OK it's not the card they call for. All I could see is neat looking rain and water.  It barely responded to any controls.  I gave up.  I will try on another PC.

I only suggest you'd better have exactly what they call for or better in a video card.",2.0
"While this game is fun to play it has severe limitations.  If you are looking to captain a ship from Point A to Point B on a global cruise this game will not do it for you.  There are only about 15 or 20 harbors around the globe for you to sail and they are not connected.  So if you want to go from New York to London forget it because in the game there is nothing between the two.  Additionally, the graphics on this game are about ten years behind the high end games sold today.  Also, while the cover artwork of this game deceptively resembles MS Flight Simulator's cover artwork, MS has NOTHING to do with this product. Do not expect a start to finish trip in this game like you have in any of the MS Flight Simulator versions.  You are basically limited to sailing an ocean liner, tanker, or cruise and cargo ships up and down some harbor like New York.  The missions prove to be the bright spot in this game.  They are fun and interactive.  But once you work your way through the missions there is nothing more the game will offer.  Unlike MS Flight Simulator where player created trips are limitless, once the missions are complete in Ship Simulator the game has nothing to offer.  The mouse and keyboard controls on the game are adequate but again there are quirks in the controls you won't find on high end games.  I would expect to find this game in the bargain bin at the local Wal-Mart for $4.99.",2.0

"My father is a seaman. I have seen many ships, sailed with him around the world numerous times. So ships are in my blood. When i saw this game I bought it without batting an eyelid. Well I wish I didn't because I now regret my decision.

The game is unique in its concept. We never really had a maritime ship simulation that wasn't centrally focused on war and sinking other ships :). This one happens to be just peace-time shipping simulation with different kinds of detailed ships ranging from cargo, to passenger, to rescues, to towing, to even trying to alter history by succesfully sailing Titanic to New york on its first maiden voyage etc. The game creator has gone to great details to simulate as much as possible the Intricacies of piloting as well as managing huge ships operations. Any aspiring sea captian or sea salt will identify with some if not most aspects of piloting a ship as simulated in this game. But to me thats where all the goodies end.

The cons associated with game are just too game-breaking to me and i have essentially stopped playing the game. Until these issues gets addressed i am not spending anymore money on this games series.

First and foremost this game badly needs a voluntary ""Time Compression"" feature. Not all of us have 2-3 hours to devote each time we decide to play this game to have some fun. Sometimes it take an hour or so just to get out of harbour and tag some hours more on this to complete the mission. With a game in which you are looking at ocean waves for hours this gets boring really fast. This is just plain very annoying and game destroying factor to me. I know some people have all the time in the world to savour and enjoy games but a lot don't too. Since its not a action oriented game the passage of time is felt even more. If they can incorporate a Time Compression feature it will make the game lot more open to different segments of gamers.

Second is the still dated graphics engine. I see lots of people commenting on how good the graphics look. I have a pretty good rig and i can play games like Mass Effect and Silent Hunter 4 in almost thearatical quality but even with everything maxed out this game just looks medicore graphics wise. The ships and ocean etc. looks very simplistically rendered from today's standard. The graphical quality of this game released in 2008 is kind of dissappointing though.

Last some of the missions in the game are just plain novice or fillers in my opinion. This game is geared towards people who like to pilot huge ships yet we have a lot of missions devoted to speed boats for stunts, hover boats etc. I bought the game to simulate a ship expirience not go around flipping in speed boats.

Anyways..i wouldn't really recommend anyone spend $40 bucks on this game. Wait until it gets to $19 or so bargain bin. And i hope the developers put some real effort into make a more viable ship simluator for its next incarnation or you are not getting any more money from me.",2.0
"This sim or game leaves at lot to be desired. Small selection of ships and small selection of places to visit. This is not a true sim like ms fsx. No internet support for downloads of other ships or scenery, as a might of fact i reather cruise the open seas in ms fsx. the waves action in this game is the only thing it has over fxs..other then that you can not navigate the real sea enviorment, just selected harbors..shame on vstep for this game that they call a ship simulator. you have to pay more bucks for additional add-on of ships and harbors..shame on you vstep",2.0
"the graphics aren't very good and the ship to shore radio is so distorted and accented that it is impossible to understand what is being said.  The game can be fun, but if you are looking for an ocean going version of microsoft flight simulator this isn't it.  It's not a lousy game, nor is it a great game, it's just okay.",2.0
"Whats this used for? Grip, look, or to waste money on? I don't like this product at all. Not much of a protective case. Don't recommend.",2.0

"This silicone skin was not that great. The silicone felt too cheap and had a weird greasy feel to it. I don't even like using the controller with this skin on. Feels gross.

"I was hesitant to buy this memory card because of the inconsistent reviews of ""my carrying case"" memory cards, but this thing is working perfectly. Saves and Loads games with no problem.

I would definitely recommend this company and their memory cards based on the price and mine working perfectly with every game I've played so far.

It works...mostly. Every time I start up my PS2, it fails to recognize that there is a memcard in the slot. Reboot, and the game will see it. Then it works, I can save, reload, no problem.

This item was shipped and arrived in good shape as promised. Thank you to the seller.  My gripe is that when I put it into the Playstation console (slim model) it tells me the card is not formatted.  It also takes 10 or more inserts to get it to be read.  I had one of these years ago and it worked just fine.  But this one is headed for the trash can.  This is just a faulty product.,2.0
"While I have never had trouble with PS1 memory cards in my PS1, I only bought the 128 Sony product for my new PS2.  Apparently, however, every time I play a game, it says there is no memory card inserted until I reinsert it with the game on and at the point where it asks to continue or not without a card. When I say 'no' after reinserting it, it recognizes it.  This is a frustrating process, having to repeatedly remove and reinsert and not acceptable for either the price or the brand name.  I'm a fan of Sony products but not this one.",2.0
"I recieved the item a few days late and when I went to try it, it would not work. I was very disappointed. The only thing that appeared was an image of the pad on the TV screen but the contacts in the pad would not work to start the game. We never got to play so I am returning the game.",2.0
"My husband bought me this for Christmas, and we were both disappointed.  The graphics are awful, some give me a headache.  The songs are awful--they all sound alike.

"Before buying DDR, I read everyone's reviews, and thought that after all of the bad reviews I might still like it.  This product really fools you, this is why:

~It says 50 Songs, right? Well, it's not really 50 different songs.  About 20-25 of these songs are a trick-they combine 2 songs and make it into one track.

~The graphics are horrible...a screen looks like pieces of moving clip art stationed around the middle of the screen where the arrows are.

I wouldn't reccommend buying this...at all.",2.0
When i bought this dance pad i thought it would be great. All it has are little arrows on a screen that barely say that you got ant right. The music is like the music on a gameboy like a mario game.

"I was made to think this was just like the DDR for Xbox or PS2.

IT IS NOT.

"Started out as fun (although pretty primitive and basic).  Can't really say much more about this product yet, though, because after a couple of plays it stopped working correctly and we returned it for a replacement.  Still awaiting the replacement; hoping to receive it soon because the kids are all out of patience!  One other comment, re. set-up - we have an older TV and the only way I could get it to work was to plug it into the front jacks of my DVD player (which was hooked up to my TV) and then toggle through the various input options until it showed up on the screen - not exactly the simple plug and play I'd hoped for.  Also, this product seems to work best on a hard floor, not as well on carpet; bummer for us because our TV room has carpet.",2.0
We were a little disappointed with the DDR system.  The pad moves around alot and gets all wrinkled up.  The positive is that you get a really good work-out.  We were also very upset that we didn't receive the one we ordered and the seller didn't care.  Might be our last online purchase for while.,2.0

"This device is a very inexpensive unit and the quality shows it. I had a problem with it and because it was so cheap I couldn't see returning it to get one that worked so I took it apart and re-soldered all the bad joints.

However, a couple of months ago I tried using the middle inserts and realized they didn't work. I honestly have no idea if they recently stopped working or if they never worked. Regardless, it shouldn't break within a few years, even regardless of the cheap price. Overall, as others have mentioned, it's a pretty flimsy device.",2.0

"I bought these cords because I got a second controller.  I tested them to make sure that they worked (and they did).

I have another extension cable for my fist controller and have never had this problem in over a year of use with it.

The picture is also misleading about these cables.  I thought that I was buying 2 separate cords that i could link together if needed.  But they actually can't be linked directly to the controller if you don't use both.  i think that instead of marketing them as 2 separate cords it should instead say 2 parts of a cord.

I recommend if you do buy these DO NOT take the cords apart. You can disconnect them from the console and the controller but NOT from EACH OTHER!",2.0
i don't think this game is great its okay for a regular game but it doesnt meet the expectations you would think mega man deserved. The graphics aren't amazing but okay as far as the 3d goes but the textures are terible. The game play isn't that bad its just not worth the money. This game is almost as good as the regular megaman series but its not as good as the mega man x series. this game is good for ages 7 - 12 but if your a teenager or adult get one of the mega man x games.,2.0

"To say that the PS1 version of Capcom's X-Men VS Street Fighter is butchered is saying it lightly.  What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight.  This feature made for great fighting fun, but because of the PS1's RAM inabilities, that feature had to be omitted.  It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses, and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature, the graphics are painfully watered down, the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates, and there is loads of slowdown.  If you can get past all that, this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan, but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time.",2.0
"I actually played the Saturn version with the 4MB RAM cart, and I have to say that the PS1 version SUCKS! Why? Because tag-team was taken out because the PS1 could not handle it. It did not have enough RAM (Random Access Memory) to switch fighters since it takes about at least 40 MB of RAM, and the PS1 only has 32 MB.  If Capcom did put in tag-team, then it would take forever to load up a character once you tag-team with it, you can tag-team with the same character, but it does not feel the same.
 I suggest get a Saturn, (it is only $10 bucks or less) get a 4MB RAM cart which you can find at EB.com, or any Video game store, and get the Import version of X-men vs. Street Fighter, trust me you won't be disappointed.",2.0
"When a system is incapable of doing justice to a game, one would think a company would be smart enough to not release the game on that system. But for reasons that are probably based entirely around making money, Capcom has released a completely butchered version of its arcade fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, on the PlayStation. The only thing added to the game is super cancels, which allow you to string multiple super combos together. Super cancels were lifted out of Street Fighter EX without much forethought, so some characters' cancels work better than others. In fact, the entire game seems to have been designed without much forethought. Even if this were a perfect translation of the arcade game, the simple fact remains that X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a terrible, unbalanced, pound-on-buttons-at-random-and-win-anyway fighting game. One of the few things the arcade version (and the Saturn version, which was an arcade-perfect translation) had going for it was the graphics. They weren't spectacular, but the characters were large, colorful, and used a lot of frames of animation. The PlayStation, a fairly weak machine when it comes to 2D, simply can't handle that much data. So Capcom chopped out tons of frames (Juggernaut does a whole lot of standing still, and his attacks are about two frames). The graphics look very washed out, and there is a completely unacceptable amount of slowdown. Ken's Shinryuken super combo had most of the frames chopped out, and it still slows the game down to a crawl. The slowdown and missing frames are so bad and so noticeable that they have a detrimental effect on the already bad gameplay. The arcade version's big selling point was that you picked two characters and could tag-team between the two at any time during the fight. Your teammate would also come out and help in a two-level team attack, as well as in Alpha counter-style attacks. Since duplicating this on the PlayStation would require keeping four entire sets of animations in memory, the tag feature has been completely removed. You still pick a second character (cruelly taunting players expecting the full functionality of the arcade version), but he only makes his presence felt during the team attacks and counters. To make up for the shortened play time, the one-round battles of the arcade have been extended to the standard two-out-of-three format. Characters also slowly regain life, much like your backup character would in the arcade. This game just shouldn't exist. At some point in the development cycle, someone should have stepped in, seen that the PlayStation simply couldn't do justice to the original game, and pulled the plug. It took an additional 4MB of RAM to get the Saturn, which already has more RAM than the PlayStation, to run a perfect version of the game. I like the Street Fighter series as much as the next guy, but this is taking it way too far.",2.0
"I'm going to fly in the face of convention wisdom and assert that Tomb Raider is not a good game. I like the concept, the puzzle solving and exploration. I like that it's a great diversion from the standard shoot-em up. The problem is with the tedious game play. The game is tough, just from the mental standpoint and it takes some effort to figure out what you're supposed to be doing in each level. But that's part of the fun, figuring things out. Unfortunately, it's moving through the levels and getting from point A to point B that is problematic. There are way too many places where you have to make a pinpoint precision jump or other move with absolutely NO margin for error. In some cases this means you fall somewhere and have to climb back to your starting point, or in some cases you die, meaning you have to start the whole level over again. And after trying one of these jumps over and over and over, you finally get frustrated and give up. There were instances where I tried a jump over and over, and then suddenly made the jump and had no idea what I had done differently from the previous numerous attempts. For any game to be that touchy is just a disgrace. It's too bad, I think I could have liked this game but the tedious pinpoint controller movements ulitmately ruined the game for me. I know it's one of PSX ""greatest hits"" and very popular, but if don't like tedious games, you'll want to avoid this one.",2.0
"This game was fun for only the first day I owned it. It is far too easy to beat (did so that first day) and it does not keep you coming back for more. I have not played this game in a long long time, and don't see myself playing it again in the future.",2.0
"You know you're in trouble when other terrible video games are compared to you. Though only a little worse than Charlie's Angels (GameCube) and not as bad as Hidden Invasion (PlayStation2), Fighting Force is the difinitive bad adventure-fighting game that fits on the same crap list as Burning Fight. Even Brawl Bros and Peace Keepers are better than this, and that's saying a lot.
You get your pick from four forgettable crime fighters: pixie-pig-tailed Alana, gruff Hawk, leather-pants-wearing ""Look at me, I'm Nabiki Tendo"" Mace, and prison inmate Smasher. They're out to get a psychopath who believes the world should have ended at the beginning of 2000 A.D. and is now determined to make that happen. Maybe he should have waited through the other 23 times it turned New Years day across the world.
Many Sega Saturn owners didn't realize then how lucky they were that this game was cancelled on their system. Nintendo 64 owners were not so lucky, and I wasn't so lucky after getting the PlayStation version.
The controls are sloppy, the hit detection is horrible, especially the dash attacks, and the character animation is almost jerky enough to look like an old claymation cartoon.
If there is one redeeming factor, it is the music. Though not great, the musical scores in this game are a nice touch. The only reason you should buy this disc is to pop it into a CD-playing radio or computer and skip track one since that's just a data track ... meaning all you will hear, if anything, is an annoying buzz. Start on Track 2, sit back, and enjoy the only good thing about this game.",2.0

"When I first got this game, I found it to be boring not too soon after getting it. When I play it today, I still think it's boring! WWF War Zone is the first real WWF wrestling game to be released on the Playstation. I don't really consider the In Your House game to be wrestling wise, but more Mortal Kombat like.

War Zone is based off the WWF roster from late 1997 to early 1998, featuring only the most popular stars in the game . Among the wrestlers in this game, you can choose to play as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, The Undertaker, The Rock, Triple H, Mankind, Goldust, Owen Hart, Ahmed Johnson, Farrooq, British Bulldog, Ken Shamrock, and The Headbangers.

The opening of the game is cool, as you're given a Raw like intro that used to open Monday Night Raw back in the mid to late 90s. From there on, you're taken to the menu screen that's in the form of an elevator. In the menu you can look at the wrestlers' biographies that let you listen to their theme and see their attires they wear in the game. There's also a Training mode on the menu that lets you pick a wrestler and learn how to perform their moves before you go into the game.

Once you enter the game, you can either play Exhibition matches to get adjusted to everything or go straight to Challenge Mode. Among the match types available are Singles, Tag Team, Tornado Tag Team, Hardcore, or Steel Cage. The Steel Cage match is probably the most frustrating match to play. When you climb the cage, I didn't know what button to push to climb down. I pushed down but I just ended up climbing back down to the ring. I lost most of the Cage matches.

Challenge Mode involves you choosing a superstar to play as and guide them to the World Championship. Unfortunately this was a boring and irritating mode to play. Once you play one match, you've played them all. You have to fight the same opponents at least 4 or 5 times before you advance to newer ones. As you progress through, you'll be met by a woman in a limo in the parking lot who will either show interest you for winning a match or insult you for losing a match. Oh yeah, that's another thing. If you lose 1 or 2 matches, you're automatically sent back to the beginning and have to start over from match 1 to go up. It ultimately screws you over and you're forced to play a lot of the same boring matches again.

Overall: I found War Zone boring then and I find it boring now. In my opinion In Your House is more fun to play than this. Even the sequel game to War Zone, Attitude, is more fun to play than War Zone. So if you don't want to be bored, skip War Zone and buy In Your House or Attitude instead",2.0
"Strategy games by their very definition usually mean that you're in for an in-depth experience that will challenge your brain cells. Not so with Brigandine. It doesn't have enough options to attract hardcore strategists, and it's too dull to draw neophytes to the genre. You select one of five kingdoms, differing only in geographical location and in initial Rune Knights (human characters with classes such as Witch, Druid, Berserker, etc.). The world map is divided into battlegrounds connected by roads, and you're given a certain amount of game time to take 'em all by force (except for those two kingdoms on the west coast that are all buddy-buddy). Each Rune Knight controls a squadron of monsters (which can be created and, occasionally, swiped from defeated enemies) which can increase in size as their experience level goes up. To conquer new territory, you can send 1 to 3 Rune Knights (one is suicide, two isn't much better) to a neighboring location in enemy hands and do battle. The fighting is done on large maps divided into hexigons and it's about as simple as can be. There aren't many spells to cast and the cardinal rule here is that whoever has the biggest, baddest monsters wins. When one unit attacks another, the game cuts to a battle scene where you see the attack and, sometimes, the counterattack in duller-than-a-bowling-ball 3-D. Mercifully, you can turn this option off to expedite the fighting. The ""story"" (such as it is) is told through dialogue boxes superimposed over the world map. At the end of the day, this game just doesn't try hard enough to draw the player in. It's a time-killer, nothing more. Fans of ""grid"" style strategy/RPGs like Final Fantasy Tactics (which happens to be my favorite video game EVER in spite of its occasional if-you-don't-have-the-right-skill-equipped-for-this-fight-you-are-utterly-screwed unfairness) may be drawn to it since this genre is not the most populist, but it's a limp-wristed production. Without the superfluous 3-D scenes, it could have easily been done on the Super NES rather than the PlayStation. Not a terrible game, but not worth the time required to finish it.",2.0
"I bought this game thinking it would be great beyond preportions, but it actually is quite the opposite and is very old. Before writing this review ,I'm going to tell you that I didn't want to believe some of the reviews that hindered this game's reputation. So I still bought the game thinking that it was going to be great(costly mistake.)
  For one, you don't fight in this game. It's like any rpg game, but it is simulated. Just think about going through a huge game that the battle's are simulated for you. The graphics are the lowest imaginable. You push your characters into battle like chess, and you have a random chance of doing well. The only thing you control are Tarot cards, which have various affects on the enemy and yourself. The strategy is very simple and not really worth calling strategy. If you want to buy an Ogre game, buy Ogre Tactics. It is a very excellent game, and is worth the huge time span. This game isn't worth the time, you'll never care to finish the first ""levels"" once youv'e started playing it. Yes, all it is ""levels."" You have to play levels in sequence and you don't have control where you go. I hope that you listen to this review, and not to any silly person that may think it is good.

"The main reason that people hate this game is because it came right after Twisted Metal 2 and people were expecting A LOT of improvement, but the expectations were in vain. :(

The game isn't all THAT bad, I mean... Mr. Grimm still cool, there is a new Viper car, you can use ""rain missiles"" as weapons, some of the characters and stories are VERY funny, the graphics were improved, the Rob Zombie intro song was AWESOME, and the London, Spaceship and Blimp stages were GREAT.
NOW! The reason that this game suck's is because EVERYTHING in the game looks like fake plastic, the special effects are NOT shocking at all, you can't make ANY massive explosion or massive destruction, many characters look lame, if your car turns upside down you have to wait for 5 seconds for your car to stand up, and many stages are VERY small.

"Having played the Twisted Metal series for a few years now, I can honestly say that Twisted Metal III, while having an initial gleam at first play, it wears itself out fairly quickly. The gleam I'm speaking of is the slick graphics and the incredibly different game play. It tries to be something new, which it is, but it improves in all the wrong ways.

Allow me to explain :

Weapons Inventory. Instead of a max capacity of the total number of weapons in your inventory, you are limited to how many of each weapon you can have. For example, I can pick up 10 homing missiles but no more. The rest of my inventory has to be stocked with other useless weapons like Speed Missiles (more on that in a bit). In previous TM installments, you could keep building your homing missile capacity, and carry only those, as long as you didn't exceed the max capacity. Annoying.

New Weapons. Okay, so initially I thought the (((Rain Missile))) was the best thing since sliced bread. But really, the rain missile doesn't do very much apart from visual appeal. The missile shoots into the air and you detonate it, and a ring of fire falls down like five mini-napalms. It doesn't do the damage the napalm does, but only allows the cars to drive through so they start on fire...at least until they turbo (stop-drop-and-roll in TM maneuvers) out of it 2 seconds later. Minimal damage done.

The introduction of the (((Speed missile))) was the worst mistake of the weapon category. It's a fast missile that has the strength of three machine gun bullets. If you can fire them fast, you can do some damage, but they're so useless during combat that it really doesn't even matter.

(((Remotes))) are plenty but do much less damage than in TM2. (((Freeze missiles))) (the left-right-up maneuver) do not hit enemies like they used to. It is much harder to freeze an enemy. This can be frustrating.

Enemies. New characters are added, some are great, some not so great. Your enemies now have the A.I. that allows them to steal items from in front of you. If they need health, they will race you for it and take the health. This is especially frustrating when you are fighting Minion and you have one shot left to kill him and he quickly finds full health. *Cue controller hitting floor*

The levels are not very large. Not much scenery and not much to discover. There's a few hidden places you can find to explore, but for the most part it's very limited.

All in all, TM3 falls flat. The previous installments are much better both in game-play value, and in overall playability.

If you can find this cheap, get it. Otherwise pass it up.",2.0
"TM3 i must say was quite dissapointing.  The main reason for this is beacuse the characters...There were three good characters in the whole game, the rest were poo piles.  Also, the levels were too small, and there wasn't a lot to blow up.  In TM 2, one of my fav things was taking down the eiffel tower w/ a remote.  That was sweet, especially if an enemy was residing in the tower at the time.  You just can not do that in TM 3.  The graphics also, were worse than 2.  I just do not understand how you can make a 2nd sequel to a great series and have worse graphics than before.  But of course, 989 studios, the ones responsible for the absolutley horrific graphics of the psx nba shoot out series, were behind this game.  The only good thing i can say about this game is that it is a tad better than the first and that it can become a little addicting, as each game of the series can.  All in all, the best for psx in TM2, don't waste your money on #3.",2.0
"Rogue squadon is somewhat fun to play but the majority of the missions are hard to beat. the 3D enviroment is cool looking and on some levels there are places you can see that are straight out of the movie such as Jabba the hutt's palace on Tattoine.
The main problem i have with this game is on the Hoth and Deathstar mission.(use password DEADDACK to get to them)on the Hoth mission you wrap a cord around Imperial walkers to trip them which is tricky to do. As for the Deathstar mission, the scenery is wrong. In the movie Luke fires at the exhaust port at the end of the trench, in the game the target is on the ground. But that's not what bothers me most though, After you hit your target it just says ""Mission Complete"" They should've had a cinematic sequence where the Deathstar blows up.

"I must agree with many of the other reviewers in that this is by far THE worst game in the Tomb Raider series. I beat this game a long time ago, but I have been bored lately so I dug it up and started to play again. My opinion has not changed since I labored through it the first time. I would never have even finished it the first time except that I thought it MIGHT get better (or even slightly fun) as the game went on. Nope.
Now, don't get me wrong. I am a huge fan of the whole Tomb Raider extravaganza; it's an excellent and clever collection. But I was disappointed so much in this one that it almost killed my interest to continue on with the later games in the series.
First of all, the levels are unstimulating and repetitive. I hated the levels in India and the South Pacific Islands so much that I purposely killed myself off a few times just to get the frustration out. As a general rule, I think just one nature-based level should be allowed for Lara; they both were so damn similar and I got tired of killing lizards and monkeys.
Then, for someone who loves a good puzzle, the puzzles in this were just ridiculous. I had to buy the strategy guide just to find my way around the confusing dead-ends (and 'dead' I mean literally). And by the way, the strategy guide was misleading and seemed like it didn't even go with the right level at times.
Also, some of the stunts and moves that Lara has to make to reach intricate points in the game are so precise that you have to save your game before even ATTEMPTING them...or say hello to some huge backtracking or unsightly death. But oh wait...you can't save your game anytime you want. You must have the beloved save crystals! Too bad I'm always reluctant to use them in fear that I might need them for something more important than jumping to a tree limb.
I gave this game two stars for two reasons. The first being that Lara has some new moves---crawling, monkey-swinging sprinting, etc---and those were quite nifty at times (unless I was about ready to gnaw my own hands off from everything else). The second reason would have to be that I liked some of her unusual foes---the creepy Shivas, in particular.
But that was about it, my friends. And those few joys did not hold up well against everything else. I recommend TR2 above any and all other TR games. Even without some of the fancy schmancy moves and scenery, it never fails to impress or enthrall. I mean, how can you top the Barkhang Monastery? Give me a good monk any day.",2.0

"Every once in a while I experience a piece of entertainment that is *so* overrated it's hard to believe I'm even living on the same planet as those that actually believe this is supposed to be the best. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is that very piece of overrated entertainment. Talk about a video game that not only doesn't live up to the hype (not even close) but it doesn't do a darn thing to impress me even *if* I were to ignore all the exaggerated hype. This is a serious letdown of a video game. But again, please understand I'm not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game. I care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else. Apparently most Zelda fans believe puzzle-based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the Zelda series.

One thing that positively stinks is that the land of Hyrule, despite being presented as beautiful (and realistic- don't tell me Nintendo wasn't riding the 3D high in 1998 and going for realism here) it's basically a gigantic piece of nothingness. Simply a means of getting from one area to another. A large, colorless empty field that Link either runs or rides his horse across. Nothing magical, medieval or interesting about *any* of this. It feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house. Going into this game after a Link to the Past, you'll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies, pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles. Remember all those trees, rocks, grass and water sections from Link to the Past? Remember how rich and vibrant they looked? Ha, nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld. Oh sure the monsters come out at night (in predictable spots) but that's it. As far as I can see, only one monster actually comes out (named Stalchild). Terribly lacking. The trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking too.

The dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that it's almost unfathomable to believe Nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient. Again, where ARE all the enemies? Why am I roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good? Are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like I'm really inside a castle now? Give me a break guys. The rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever. Instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner, these castles are alarmingly empty, lifeless and unacceptable. But... that's apparently okay, because Ocarina of Time is the first 3D Zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels, right? Not in my world baby. The games following Ocarina of Time perfected the Zelda formula way more effectively. Wind Waker and Skyward Sword leaves this dated mess in the dust.

While normally I don't care about graphics in a video game, you gotta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the Zelda series more engrossing. This is just... gross. Only the realistic-looking (flawed) overworld is a sight to behold (which of course now looks significantly better in Twilight Princess). Clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons isn't much to admire. I don't really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings, trees or other objects that are all part of the Nintendo 64's datedness. Sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or, at the very least, forgiving. What I DO mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction, or having a game entirely too long so we're forced to persevere these issues time and time again. In other words I'd be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy/uninspiring graphics in other areas. Sadly, it doesn't. This isn't even much of an issue compared to the other complaints I have (which I'll mention below- keep reading). These graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of Mega Men Legends and the walls of the Quake series. The graphics in Link to the Past are unique and cannot be compared to any other game.

Let's discuss the dungeons, shall we? Despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings, most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it's almost a chore going through one generic room after another. Ocarina of Time shows the makings of early 3D development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up Link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until Link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead. When you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position Link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you're doing and where you're going, it's enough to make you think you're playing with string puppets. Again, early 3D design flaws and datedness.

The storytelling is really basic and predictable. It's never elaborate like in Wind Waker or Skyward Sword. It's mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called Goron's for the first half, and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half. This is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented. It doesn't even feel or look like you're going 7 years into the future as Link's appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he doesn't appear to be much different from his younger self. Oh sure he's slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but it's very subtle. The music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however. All the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments, but melodic and memorable. Several dungeon themes are well-made and believably chilling and haunting. The right ingredients were definitely put into the music-making aspect of the game. The Hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and won't get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend there.

The dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused crate-pushing to open up portals or switches, or hopelessly generic ""I'm stuck in a maze and I can't get out"" frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early 3D game design. But... these aren't any ordinary mazes. These are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn, hence the flawed early 3D game design. A cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be, or in other words, needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the 2D Zelda's so memorable. Sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means, and quite often you have to collect 5 silver rupees to activate a switch/open a door. Collecting these silver rupees is WAY too similar to Super Mario 64 with the red coins. The Lost Woods is a tunnel-infested maze with no personality whatsoever. The Lost Woods -if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer- will most definitely be the source of endless frustration.

The enemies, or rather, what little enemies you will stumble upon on your ""adventure"" through the temples, is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game. These dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable. You will often go 3 or 4 rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy. Why even have a sword? In the 2D games the idea was simple- just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and, guess what? *Now* the dungeons are exciting. A genius idea really. Here? In Ocarina of Time? It's all about atmosphere. It's all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once Nintendo's most recent creation back in 1998. But... Nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day. What was once a brand new puppy in 1998 is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design. Video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable. That's exactly what has happened with Ocarina of Time- it hasn't stood the test of time.

Do you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a Zelda game? Seriously? Their animations are so stiff due to the Nintendo 64's limitations as a console that it's unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards Link. But even then, *most* dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable. Big Skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous- it's more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while you're running around. The spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting. Somehow *all* the enemies manage to never once be memorable. Ever! Ocarina of Time has dated horrendously, seriously. Wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make, Red Bubble is basically the same thing as Big Skulltula but on fire, and Gibdos are boring. The ReDead's let out a hilarious scream that freezes Link in place which is inconvenient when you're trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when you're stuck in a room with two of them. Mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them, run behind them, and slice them with your sword. To be fair, some enemies are cool such as Deku Baba where it's best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill- creatively well done there. The Deku Scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat. And the Lizalfos and Dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemies.

The game overall has a shortage of rupees. They're really not that important which is odd. This is the first Zelda game I've ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought. Not something to take real seriously. If you don't feel like collecting them, then don't- no harm done. The bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon. You have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform. It takes FOREVER (and no, this boss is *nowhere* as fun as the water dungeon in Link to the Past in case you're wondering). The hookshot is used MORE than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often. The hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations, but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas. After you collect 10 gold skulltula tokens, you get a beneficial reward. You can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy (usually found on walls). I admit I love the witches you face in the Spirit Temple. While the temple itself is really short and boring, it's probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight. You have to use your shield to reflect shots at the *other* witch, and it's really fun and creative. The hookshot's basically a required item to properly deal with hard-shelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and it's annoying that it's used WAY more frequently than the sword throughout the game. Due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot, using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while (especially if you keep missing your target) and it slows down the pace of the game by a lot.

If you haven't noticed yet, the water dungeon in Ocarina of Time is just abominable. I bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way. Also, the worst influence ever occurs here- the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons (mostly for warping from one place to another). Nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina WAY too many darn times. It's overdone. Just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake. Don't make it so you have to play the ocarina up to 50 times, if not more. I never really counted how many times I used it. It was a lot. It severely drags the gameplay, atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina. Watching Link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing I've ever seen. No wonder people think Nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days. This game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influence.

Ganon's castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful. It's supposed to be filled with dangerous traps, tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place. But... the one in Ocarina of Time falls way short of being presentable by normal Legend of Zelda standards. Instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through 6 trials to dispel the main barrier. The problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting 5 silver rupees. This is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening. Another bonus point for Link to the Past. Oh and the Ganon fight? His strategy is stolen from Agahnim's battle from Link to the Past but takes SEVERAL more minutes to bring down. Remember how you fought Agahnim? Yup, same exact strategy but in a 3D world. Sigh. The second part of the Ganon fight (after a looooong and tedious time-based departure from the top of a castle) is to shoot arrows at Ganon and hit his glowing behind several times. It's really easy, all of it. However fighting him in one of the early dungeons (Forest Temple) is actually one of the most memorable in the entire Zelda series. This is because Ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a VERY unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept. Reminds me of a Harry Potter movie.

A few other complaints. Fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy. It's better than most fishing games I've played in other games I admit. Expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however. Most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them. That's a rare compliment I can give. Some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun. I don't really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm. If you fall behind even a *little* bit you'll lose. Performing this same ghost-chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you're dodging fireballs. The other task earlier on in the game in the Ice Cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle-based. Having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15-20 times. This particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting.

Basically, when compared to the 2D games, Ocarina of Time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the Zelda series into 3D but only giving us a small portion of what's available in Link to the Past. As a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions. It's because the Nintendo 64 is a limited console that's really only able to handle so much. Ocarina of Time comes up way short. Even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going. Avoiding being detected by guards isn't fun after the first time. Oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a Metal Gear Solid stealth-style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people. The stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon. Equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters, these red sword-swinging enemies appear on screen. The SAME EXACT ENEMY 4 times in a row with *no* differences between any of them. At first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times, and they fall over and die.

Reading text and having boring discussions with Zelda, trees and other semi-interesting characters doesn't get the job done either. Ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual (that one conversation with Zelda and Link with Ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in Hyrule Castle comes to mind here). I will admit that some of the flame-covered cutscenes involving Ganon riding his horse is very intimidating. The cutscene outside the bridge of Hyrule Castle comes to mind here. Otherwise, Ganon's presented uninterestingly. You're *supposed* to get a feeling of hopelessness that Ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but... due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems, Ganon being a ruthless villain doesn't ever materialize (at least, he's not as scary as he *should* be).

Recognize Ocarina of Time for making the 3D Zelda series exist. That's fair. It allowed Wind Waker to eventually be created which in turn made the 3D Zelda formula better starting from that game until now. By 2003 Nintendo was working with the technologically superior Gamecube console which allowed the Zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories (gameplay, graphics, replay value and excitement). I say avoid Ocarina of Time but hey, nobody will listen or agree with me anyway so carry on and have a wonderful day!",2.0

"Banjo-Kazooie is a strange platformer, but ultimately misses the mark in all key areas of being entertaining.  It tries to be funny without actually being exciting to play so the game feels like a big misleading tease.  All the attention on humor and yet, the game itself is hardly ever fun.  This means children would probaly be able to overlook the games flaws and focus on the humor, which I'm sure was Nintendo's intentions- to market the game for kids and assume they wouldn't be able to detect the lousy game design.  I guess the Nintendo 64 struggling to make a profit at the time meant Nintendo had to do absolutely anything and everything to try and get *any* type of crowd interested in their products despite the poor quality we're forced to persevere, so that explains Banjo-Kazooie's existence.

Anyway, Banjo-Kazooie is basically nothing but an item-collecting quest with graphics that are admittedly prettier and just better than 90% of the stuff the N64 was pumping out at the time.  The waters, grassy lands, mountains... everything is a beautiful sight to behold with crystal clear authentically pleasing environments.  Probably on par with Donkey Kong 64 in terms of graphics but definitely NOT in terms of gameplay or the sheer size of the overworld which is incredibly tiny in Banjo-Kazooie.  But seriously, why am I basically doing nothing but walking around collecting items the entire time?  If you think ""That's what ALL platformers do!"" guess again: many of them focus on exciting enemy variety, diverse surroundings and a gradual increase in challenge which this game sorely lacks.  The only challenge is to avoid falling from high narrow platforms while collecting musical notes- these are dirty tricks and artificial challenges.  I found sharks you have to swim away from, crabs you can stomp on top of, and weird gigantic green enemies that come out of walls while you're trying to make your way across high paths without falling.  These enemies only appear like 10% of the time- the rest of your surroundings aren't very threatening.

Let's see all the things you have to collect.  Honeycomb pieces, jiggy pieces (mandatory to open entrances to new locations and you need to obtain a certain number of them per world), 100 musical notes which is a total ripoff of Super Mario 64 with the 100 coins needed to get a star, mumbo tokens used to cast spells, and jinjo tokens used to win vehicle parts.  You can turn into animals and insects which is somewhat satisfying for the sake of seeing the occasional brief moments of diversity, but otherwise nothing to get really excited about.  Often you have to climb trees or mountains to reach the items on top and it gets boring after a while, believe me.  The snowy and dessert areas are incredibly generic too, as are the underwater cave sections and grasslands.

Oh and the game is a victim of underwater tragedies- you're constantly adjusting the camera for a more appropriate angle but finding that it's much harder than it needs to be.  I will never understand why Nintendo refuses to fix water portions in 3D platform gaming.  It's mind-boggling.  They didn't even fix them in Super Mario Galaxy 2, a game released a good 10 years after Banjo-Kazooie.  The characters are all forgettable, including the ponytail-sporting female bear and Banjo himself.  Kazooie the bird is probably the only tolerable one of the bunch.

Whereas the Mario series can be enjoyed by kids and adults respectively, Banjo-Kazooie is certainly intended solely for children and no other age group.  It's too shallow of a game overall to satisfy adult gamers.  Banjo-Kazooie is like walking into the nicest looking restaurant in town and everything is great except for one thing- you get a small quantity of food so you ask yourself ""Is it worth my time to return here again?""",2.0
"All right, the graphics are nice and the terrain damage is something new, but that doesn't make up for the gameplay, which could be summed up in one word:SLOW.
Skirmishes take a real long time to get going; I mean, at least a half an hour before you can get a sizeable force. And then what do you find yourself doing? Protecting your base with them, and attacking with missle launches. I'm dead serious, the only way to attack is with missle launches. To attack with your men (Especially tanks) takes like ten minutes to even get to the enemy base!
That being said, the multiplayer is a total waste of time. If the person your playing saves you the trouble of teching and attacks you early on with engineers, consider yourself lucky. Don't get caught up in a 3 hour game that is just about to be resolved, when you or your opponent loses his/her connection. And don't consider engineering a cheap way to attack, it's the only way anyone attacks...
THe campaign is allright I guess, if you can stand the poor gameplay to get from cutscene to cutscene (Which aren't as good as Red Alerts were).

"I still remember when I play DuneII, then the original C&C, I fall in love with Westwood Studio's Real Time Strategy ever since. However, Westwood's recent products are all less-than-stellar, including this  long-await C&C:Tiberian Sun.
Actually, I was expected more from this  game, as Starcraft and Total Annihilation had rised the bar so high for  this type of game. That means, if Westwood wants to be back on the top,  Tiberian Sun has to be better than that 2 (and a lot more).
It  wasn't...First of all, I feel like this is just the enchance version of the  original C&C, the graphics are behind its opponents, like TA series,  and Ages of Empire II. The maps are still 2D, with isometric view....and  sounds are even worst, maybe the worst in the serie so far... And there  isn't many strategies in the game either, the old ""build more tanks,  attack at once with all your tanks."" still working fine, the AI is not  so good also, as I can often see that most units doesn't notice the sounds  of the nasty bomb & laser in some near distance...(It would be OK if  there is no sound of battle, since it might be out of the line of  sight).

It is not up to par with Red Alert and not even  on the same planet as Starcraft or Age of Empires II.  Save your cash and  get Starcraft or AOE II if you want a real time strategy game.

"The title is a pretty good description of what this game is. But in order to properly understand what I mean, I will have to explain the different aspects of this game.

Graphics: The graphics were beautiful. You can actually see liquid movement, such as a creature's girth giggling as it sways back and forth! The level design itself is fascinating and fun to explore. In the first level for instance, you come upon a large apartment complex in the middle of a city, and can enter to explore all the rooms inside. There are a lot of different places to go and things to see, all in six HUGE levels.

Controls: You can change these to fit your preference, so this is not much of a problem.

Sound: No soundtrack, just sound effects; a really bizarre omission that detracts from the game.

Game play: This is where Turok 2 fails. One thing a first person shooter needs to be good is enemies, and lots of them. Other novel games like doom, quake, descent, and the first turok all lived up to this crucial aspect of a good FPS. The enemies in T2 are few and far between. Most of your time spent is locating necessary items and places for your mission objectives. Now this is where Iguana gets some credit, actually, because the mission objectives are a step up from turok #1. Rather then the proverbial FPS tasks of locating key cards or other such rights of passage paraphernalia for the mere purpose of opening a door or progressing to the next level, Iguana was more creative than that with T2. Blowing up ammunition supply bunkers, releasing prisoners, destroying targets of interest, are all more satisfying things to do in a game than just doing what it takes to get to the next level. However, creative mission objectives are only worthwhile if individual levels do not take FOREVER to beat. Sometimes the intervals between fighting enemies and just wandering around trying to find your mission objectives are so long you do not even feel like you are playing a FPS anymore. The enemies you do encounter can be amusing though, made all the more so by the sweet gore animation. But good gore can only hold a game up for so long with scant fighting and unimaginative characters and creatures. Raptors are the only genuine DINOSAURS you encounter in a game entitled DINOSAUR HUNTER. You encounter a lot of giant biped lizards that shoot purple crap from their arms, lame. Worse still, in each level there are only between 1 and 3 different kinds of enemies. A level will feature its own unique type of enemy, along with a couple others repeated from past levels. The weapons are decent, but manage to screw up the game even more. You get a weapon that shoots ""charged darts"" that paralyze enemies. Doesn't sound like a big deal right? It should not be, but your enemies remain paralyzed for about a minute with each shot. So in the later levels, my occasional encounters went like this: I find a dinoid, paralyze him with my charged dart rifle, take my time selecting a lethal weapon, hit him with the minimum number of shots required to kill him, and watch him drop dead. With 30 darts as the allowed carrying capacity, this method could be used throughout an entire level.

Overall, a failure that did not live up to the first Turok. Long and boring with almost no fighting, this is one watered down form of FPS. If I said that the first doom game was better than this, I would be lying through my teeth. It can be fun for a while actually, as the maps provide some amusing locations to explore and eye-catching things to see. Some of the gore is even worth checking out, it's so well done. But if you actually stick it out to the end level (I did not) you may end up really hating yourself for wasting so much of your God-given time.",2.0
"I guess this game is ok if you take it by itself. But if you've ever played the snes version of mario kart you are going to be very, very disapointed. The tracks are slow and boring for the most part, theres very little difference between the characters, and the powerups are weak.

The graphics are ok, but the suffer from very repeditive texturing, which can get pretty boring after a while. The only other good thing about this game is the 4 player capability, which makes its ok for parties etc.

Still, you'll thank your self if you can get your hands on a copy of the gba or snes version instead.",2.0
Don't get this game because if you do and have it for a long time it gets really boring. But when you first get it its exciting but if you have it about like a year or so it really gets boring. But you should still get this game.,2.0
"Wow...after three years of having ""The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"" game on my computer with a Nintendo 64 emulator, I finally got around to beating it.  Even with the occasional help of walk-throughs in some places, this was the longest, most challenging, complex game I've ever played.  It also was the most detailed, dramatic, and absorbing adventure, and looked great with the clear 1024 X 768 fullscreen resolution of a computer monitor.
But nonetheless, the original ""Legend of Zelda,"" ""The Adventure of Link,"" and ""A Link to the Past"" from NES and Super NES were still better.
All of the great drama, the awesome battle scenes, and realistic feel of ""Ocarina of Time"" could not make up for its excessive length, its overly-complicated mazes, and the sad ending as the big prize afterward.  The fun factor was reduced, and at times, the game seemed to resemble work more than play.  This was especially true during the second part of the adventure, as it dragged on and on.  Often times I would quit playing for six months or more -- just to take a break.  And finally when this gargantuan undertaking of a project was completed, Ganon was still alive, neither Link nor Zelda possessed the full Triforce, and they didn't get to fall in love as adults.  What a complete waste of frustration and energy.  This ""Ocarina of Time"" game should be renamed ""The Waste of Time.""
And the unfortunate thing is that it could've been the greatest game ever.  If it had shorter, simpler mazes containing *more* fast-action fight scenes, if it had fewer required items to obtain in the overworld, and if the game featured an ending that was happy, fulfilling, and rewarding, my negative opinion of ""Ocarina of Time"" would be completely reversed.
But it is too late.  My trust in the guys at Nintendo to release good ""Legend of Zelda"" games has been ruined.  How can I be certain that I'm not setting myself up for another giant disappointment by embarking on another ""Zelda"" adventure?
In conclusion, my recommendation for everyone is to stick with the original three ""Zelda"" games.  Beat them again every once in a while, and have fun doing it!  Stay away from ""Ocarina of Time.""  You will be saddened and let down.",2.0
"Ya'll maybe wondering why such a low rating. How on earth can I only give 2 stars to this wonderfully crafted game. Well to begin with, I loved Zelda a Link to the past, for the SNES. In fact in my opinion it was the greatest game ever made. I remember how I couldn't wait to get the SNES just for this game and I loved every minute I played of it. The graphics were great and the plot was captivating. Then the N64 came out and I was less than thrilled about this system. First game I saw was Mario ""64"". A three dimensional mario running in first person perspective. I played this game and I just couldn't get into it. There was something lacking about its gameplay. It just wasn't fun. This game was followed by a whole host of other 3d games. And then came Link Ocarina of time. My brother immediately got this game and began playing it. I watched this game and then I tried playing it too. There was something about this game that i didn't like. It just didn't appeal to me. It felt and looked dark and even ominous. I missed the small cartoonish link of the older game as I watched this fully figured polygon rendered person staring at me. This game almost gave me chills to play. Why make a zelda game so real? Why take away all the innocent fun and bright colors? The first time this realistic Link got injured in battle, I really did get chills. This game was just too real to be fun. Now I know i'm no where's near the experienced gamer as most of the others who rated this game. I expect many of ya'll to disagree with my viewpoints. But seriously, why even go outside if you can play a video game that so eerily simulates life? Once classic games entered the 3d arena thats when I felt they drew the line. I mean come on, Mario 64, Sonic R, Castlevania 64, and now Link 64. Whats next Zelda VR?? Im sure some of the zombie-like gamers would love to see a virtual reality Zelda. Is is me, or is this not just a tad absurd? Many gamers are almost disgusted that the genius Miyamota is going towards a more traditional cartoonized anime look in the next zelda game (zelda 128) I personally agree with this move and I hope its successful. Maybe this will reinvigorate my love for the zelda genre. But seriously, the same type of people that like realism in games are the ones that play these games 50 hours a session and then brag about how they beat them 4 or 5 times. I mean wow, after all that time invested what have you accomplished?? You beat a friggin video game, big friggin deal! Go out and get a life! my god.. Seriously wake up people! What kind of zombie generation are these games breeding? How much realism is too much realism?? Or do you not believe there is such a thing. Oh and the game Men of honor that so many people worship is the epitamy of it all. A game that realistically attempts to recapture the horror of D-Day. A brutal battle in which several thousand men died for our freedom. Now is on a god damn video game! Entertainment for a bunch of bored college guys on a friday night. I wanna throw up. Well sorry that I had to use Link Ocarina as my guinea pig for ranting against this 3d video game generation, but I figured its the one that you mindless fools have spent the most time on. Please go outside and do something. Invest your hours of time in something other than beating a video game for the 5th time. Learn how to play an instrument, learn karate, do something! I mean seriously, telling a girl that you can beat zelda in 30 hours instead of 50 is not hardly going to impress her!",2.0
"Miyamoto slacked off on this one.
1. This is certainly not the best game ever. Not even the best game on Nintendo 64. Super Mario 64, and Perfect Dark both stomp this game into submission.
2. This is not a role-playing game. Role-playing games have a lot of text and character involvement. This game has a script that is about two pages long, maybe less. What you say or do in this game really has no effect on the games out come.
3. This is not the best Zelda game. The Legend Of Zelda, Links Awakening, and A Link To The Past are all much better games, especially for their time.
4. This game is not 256 Mega Bytes. It is actually 256 Mega Bits, which is equal to 32 Mega Bytes. So sorry the game isn't nearly the size of a 650/700 Mega Byte CD-ROM.
5. The game has no replay value, I played through it once, then about a year later, I attempted playing through it again, I couldn't bare it, the game is just too boring. I played through Final Fantasy VII and VIII twice each, and those took alot longer than this to finish, they were both great both times through.

"Ok, I have never tried out any of the other Tomb Raider games, but after playing this game, I'm tempted to start purchasing them, based on their good reviews. This game has great graphics. Lara never gets stuck in walls or have any graphical deformations. The enemy creatures look very cool, but don't get me wrong, those pesky monkeys get very annoying. Well, actually, I've only seen very few creatures, because I can't get past the second part of the 1st level. Which brings me to my next point-(This could take a while, so try not to fall asleep from my rambling) THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL IS EXTREMELY HIGH. They give you no clues what so ever about the puzzles, they just expect you to put your thinking caps on and figure it out. There are switches on walls in the middle of nowhere, and all you here is a door opening, and you have about 15 seconds before it closes. Or, switches that rig boulders so you have to sprint , stop, turn and climb into a secret alcove ten feet above your head Oh, and say you want to take a little swim? CHECK THE WATER FIRST! Because sometimes, the water will be infested with little fishies...PIRANAHS. The split-second you climb into the water, you will be attacked by a mini-school of them. Feel free to sit there motionless while your health goes down all the way in 0.09 seconds. Confusing- You get more health drained when you get bit by fish then when you get attacked by a tiger or cobra. Hmm, intresting. Oh , also, if you get to the second part of INDIA, the TEMPLE RUINS (the farthest I've gotten) as you explore, watch out for cobras hidden in the grass, almot totally camoflauged. Which brings me to my next point. (sigh) I find myself using up flares in almost every tunnel or tiny space I am in. Every space is so dark. You could either use flares, or turn the brightness on your moniter way up. Those little flames go fast. They should provide you with a flashlight. Well, I would recommend this game to anyone who can sit through this game without crying\screaming\bashing in computer with a sledgehammer.",2.0

"I recently tried playing this game, and by this point, my N64 is lucky it didn't get chucked out the window. The first few passes through the first few stages were fine, and pretty fun, but the rest of the game ends up being one long, annoying, tedious, impossible, and frustrating chore.

To start off, the control just isn't good enough to pull off HALF the things you need to do in this game. There are instances where you must execute specific jumps to get you from point A to point B, but half the time, the controller is non-responsive. Especially when it comes to levels that put you high up, this usually means falling...over and OVER again!

To add to this annoyance is the fact that there are no check points. If a level requires you to go to the top of a mountain, and you spend half an hour just getting up there and then you fall, you have to climb the whole thing ALL OVER AGAIN! So if you're like me, and find your self wondering off cliffs every other try because of the awful camera work, you will be playing the same stages over and over with no payoff but one big headache!

Now let's talk about the camera. Throughout most of the game, I found my self fighting IT more than I fought Bowser. It's simply impossible to judge distances based on where the camera is facing at any given time. Pressing the C buttons will move it around, but you have to keep perfectly still in order to avoid suddenly gong sideways or backwards. If you are in a stage where there is a time limit or a complicated jump, this can be particularly fatal.

Adding to this frustration is the fact that it is incredibly easy to over or under jump! This wouldn't be as much of a problem if it weren't for all the levels which require you to get to ""the top"" of things. Again, if you fall once, that's it, you start all over again. If the game designers weren't going to give you any continue points in these levels, why-o-why did they make it SO FRIGGIN' EASY FOR YOU TO FALL!!!???

There are plenty of levels and stages in this game, and lots to do in all of them. But by the time I cleared one stage, I really questioned whether or not I wanted to even GO to the next. Finally, after reaching a mere 52 stars, my answer is no.

So that's my two cents on this game, I can't beat it, I don't want to beat it. I'd rather go to a Morrissey concert with Kathy Griffin as the opening act than try to play it again. It would me MUCH less annoying than this game!",2.0
"I'm pretty sick and tired of people calling Super Mario 64 a classic.  It's not.  Just because it's significant and influential in helping pave the way for future Mario titles doesn't mean Super Mario 64 is deserving of its classic status, or that it's any fun to actually play.  Super Mario Galaxy came along and pretty much improved every single aspect of Super Mario 64 so you basically no longer have to play this game other than to get a dated taste of mid 90's gaming history.  The only other possible reason someone would play Super Mario 64 is because they desperately seek open world exploration, and this is basically the only Mario platformer that can at least attempt to satisfy gamers with that particular appetite.  Not that I personally believe the game succeeds at the exploring aspect either.

The biggest problem is that so much of the land you explore consists of emptiness.  Oh sure you'll see trees, ramps, castles, buildings, enemies such as goombas, chain chomps, badly and laughably animated thwomps lifting up and slamming down, pokeys, rolling boulders, and other things that have become a trademark of the Mario series, but the amount of items to find and collect is *extremely* limited to coins (both yellow and red ones) and the occasional power-up that enables Mario to either fly (which admittedly is pretty fun) or obtain the incredibly boring metal cap that makes Mario invincible.  An alternative to the starman perhaps, with lousy side effects (Mario can't jump as high or far while wearing the metal cap).

When you're not experiencing the endless disappointment that is running across empty and boring lands and basically doing nothing but wasting time, you're jumping across a series of unspectacular and very ordinary-presented platforms over and *over* again.  This stuff seriously resembles a beginners course for developing platforms.  It's extremely basic game design.  The platforms are generic square-shaped tiles for you to jump across that quite often are all the same exact size.  It gets monotonous almost immediately.  Only unreasonable Nintendo fans would eat this stuff up, seriously.  Anybody else would obviously be able to detect flawed, repetitive gameplay.  The 2D Mario games move at such a swift pace that you don't even have time to stop and notice the platforms (unless you're an extremely slow gamer).  This is mainly because you don't have to stop and situate Mario a certain way for the purpose of making the perfect jump which is what severely ruins Super Mario 64's gameplay.  And don't EVEN say my skills are horrible when it's obvious through countless youtube videos that several gamers have the same exact issue.

While I'm by no means someone who cares about the best graphics available, you gotta admit the ones here have dated horrendously with embarrassing blocky shapes pretty much occupying most areas of the game.  The buildings, water and trees in particular are just awful for the eyes.  Nothing appealing whatsoever about any of the graphics- even the bright inviting colors don't lure me in but rather rub me the wrong way and force some of us older gamers to recall the unpleasant days of Mario Paint.

You have to collect 120 stars in order to complete the game 100% but guess what?  Many of the stars are flat out boring to collect due to being pathetically easy and basically being handed to you within minutes.  What kind of challenge is that?  The one where you have to swim around and open treasure chests in a certain order is baby-ish, and the one where you swim around collecting 8 predictably located red coins inside a basic building near the beginning of the game is offensive.  Or how about simply stomping a post into a ground to release a gate and thus, release the star?  Don't even *think* about mentioning the ones where you walk up to Toad and he simply hands you the star.  Granted, the game seems to always alternate easy star-collecting challenges with longer and more drawn out ones as a way to balance things out but that's the problem- the stars are either too easy or too long.  There is one star mission so awful it makes your inevitable death seem like something to anticipate- the one where you have to jump across a series of moving poles.  You have to jump at *just* the right moment while making sure you're positioned in the right spot.  This takes forever and is dreadfully annoying.

Also, what's up with all the little baby games?  Grab a baby penguin and slide down a snowy hill?  Chase the bunny so he doesn't hop away?  These are not suitable for anyone who recalls the challenging portions of previous 2D gaming such as Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World (and yes, these bunny grabbing missions are flaws in Super Mario Galaxy too, in case you think I'm intentionally favoring Super Mario Galaxy for no reason).  At least the cannon-shooting parts are cool.  It's fun figuring out where to launch Mario so he can land safely on upper grounds.

I can't help but feel the red star collecting is overrated.  When you collect red stars in Yoshi's Island, you feel like you're given a really elaborate and perfectly executed assignment since you also have to collect flowers and stars to 100% complete a stage.  It's a lot to do not to mention really darn exciting and satisfying once you've acquired all these items, and constantly keeps your attention span in check while searching for them.  Super Mario 64 basically takes that one red coin-collecting element of Yoshi's Island and makes it a main priority here.  You often have to collect 8 red coins per stage (opposed to 20 in Yoshi's Island) to obtain one of the 120 stars.  Ugh.

But nothing NOTHING is worse than the fact you have to re-enter stages over and over again just to grab all the stars that are located throughout.  To me this is unquestionably lazy game design.  How can it be anything else?  Who in their right mind would actually *want* to keep going back to the same exact stage ad nauseam?  Super Mario World was guilty of this too granted but not NEARLY to this exaggerated extent.  A terrible idea that gives a false impression a game has replay value but it's exactly the opposite- once you go through the same stage a bunch of times and finally accomplish everything there is to offer, you won't want to repeat these same objectives ever again.  So... you probably won't want to play Super Mario 64 ever again.  Even worse- when you often have to search for 100 coins to obtain a star.  This can take up to 20 minutes and bore you the entire time.  Being forced to collect 100 coins is a lazy way of assuring gamers don't leave any stone unturned because you basically have to thoroughly search every nook and cranny of a stage to even *find* 100 of them.

I also dislike how many of the classic enemies aren't included here such as the hammer brothers, buzzy beetles, bloopers, and cheep cheeps.  Even the koopa troopa is nowhere to be seen (well, other than that one race in the beginning).  You can ride a koopa shell like a skateboard but that doesn't count as an enemy appearance.  He's not a true enemy here.  Why is that?  Why not include all the familiar and well-loved enemies that have become a trademark to the Mario series?  They ruin the pirahna plants by the way.  Why is he sleeping?  Granted he comes alive when you get near, but it's a really weird concept.  At least Nintendo got the boos and haunted house right- a surprising and exciting maze-like high point of the game.  It's a lot of fun sorting through each room of the haunted house stages.  *That's* how you design a memorable stage.  Obviously if you weren't busy running around through several vast and average-designed empty fields of grass, there could have EASILY been room for the inclusion of more enemies.  Hey I'm all for open world exploration, but you have to actually fill in those areas with exciting, creative items that are both fun and rewarding to collect for the player, and enemies that present threatening encounters and a rush of excitement.  Simply throwing Mario into a big 3D world because it's his first grand 3D adventure truthfully isn't going to get the job done I'm afraid.  More needs to be done.

Constantly having to rearrange the camera so you can see where you're actually going is a nuisance.  Nobody likes dealing with a camera while jumping around trying to play a video game, but granted, several games back in the mid to late 90's were guilty of the same camera problems since developers were still getting their feet wet so to speak, and figuring out the best way to help players accurately and conveniently see what's ahead.  Still, you'll lose more than a few lives due to bad camera angles in Super Mario 64.  I guarantee it.  One thing I *do* like about this game is how fast Mario runs.  It's a fast-moving game, which helps going from point A to point B more convenient. Also some of the wall jumps and triple jumps are fun to execute.  Reminds me of Super Metroid in that respect.  Yoshi is teased in this game (I won't spoil how) but he's not actually playable which doesn't make sense.  Why make an appearance if he's not going to be playable?

The music is either extremely good (the brilliant peaceful moodiness of the water theme and the intimidating and exciting heavy metal-like Bowser fights) or downright horrendous (everything else, which consists of annoying nursery rhyme children's themes inappropriate and painfully skull-smashing for the rest of us).  I can't STAND the theme songs that play in Whomp's Fortress and Rainbow Ride- two unforgivable themes that make me want to smash my brains in whenever I play Super Mario Galaxy 2 where they return in all their overbearingly annoying glory.  Rainbow Ride in particular reminds me of a county hayride where kids ride around on tractors (not to mention the stage itself is extremely tedious and overlong).  The snowy mountain stage with the Italian accordion music is sickening and out of place.  Just mute the volume on your TV to make life easier for yourself.  The boss fights are incredibly simplistic- grab Bowser's tail, spin him around and toss him, or pick up/stomp other bosses.  Basic, boring stuff.

A few stages that are actually fun include Lethal Lava Land where the platforms convincingly feel like an upgrade into the 3D world from the original Super Mario Bros. castle levels (not to mention better/more interesting use of platform jumping compared to the rest of the levels in SM64), Shifting Sand Land since it's packed with obstacles and enemies (and reasonably challenging overall), and Tall Tall Mountain's tricky climb to the top (involving a vine climbing portion).  In fact, to be fair, Tall Tall Mountain is one of the best levels ever in a 3D Mario game.  It's *that* good.  Bowser's castle levels are pretty solid as well, mostly due to the fast-paced nature of them.

Several things feel tacky- the 1-ups and coins are small, dark, ugly looking, and clumsily made due to less than spectacular graphics and game design, and overall Super Mario 64 is just a really lackluster and highly overrated game.  If not for influence, this game would have been forgotten and the superior Super Mario Galaxy series would have prevailed even more dominantly than they already do.  Oh and don't even mention the cake-eating storyline.  It's atrocious.  The fact they brought it back for the Galaxy series makes me want to vomit.",2.0

My popularity was high, all of the ordenances I could have had were activated, all buildings had water and power, I had full funding to schools, firestations, police, ect., police and fire coverage were excelant, taxes were only at 3 for everything (Ind., Com., and Res.), and everything else you could think of, I had it. It was the perfect city and my whole population (who still liked by the way) left the city. If you have a good reason for it , I'd say it was a glitch in the game. Don't get me wrong, it is a fun game when there is a reason to the sudden drops, but I don't think you can have a real good city that lasts for more than four or five hours and there is no good city, they'll all die out eventually.

"I have been playing RPGs since I can remember. I Love them. From DnD to MUDS to Everquest and Asheron's Call not to mention the myriad of single player RPGs I've played, I have always enjoyed them. Then came UO (Ultima  Online). I began playing UO the first month it was released. The world was  new, and it felt huge compared with other computer games I had played. I  remember countless hours hunting in dungeons with friends. I played for  over a year, but unfortunately technology passed UO by, and the culture  deteriorated to random mass killings and basically pure anarchy.
ONE: I  love the diversity of professions/skills and other aspects of the variety  of skills available. In UO you can become a chef, or a blacksmith or a  scribe, or any of several other professions. This is really unique to UO as  the other MMRPGs out there don't do professions nearly as well if at all.  This aspect of the game adds a sense of ""realism"" of the world.
TWO: The anarchy in UO is too much to handle. Basically in UO there are  no laws. If you wish to walk up to someone in the wilderness, kill them and  take whatever they have on them, go for it. The only repercussion is that  you will become known as a murderer and will have a slower time of  resurrecting and what-not. Origin never understood that if player killers  are allowed to walk the land, then they should have a legal system, court  system, and prisons. That same player that killed you will be ""out on  the streets"" again in a day or two. This is the largest flaw in UO  that I can see. Innocent citizens are not protected from random killings  except in town. In town, guards will kill anyone who attacks you, but there  are loopholes that the PKrs (player-killers) know about and exploit to  avoid the guards.
THREE: the graphics in UO are severely behind the  times so much so that they bring down the over-all play experience.  Essentially in UO there are no 3-D elements whatsoever, and your view of  the world is an isometric (almost top-down) view of your character and  immediate surroundings. The trees and undergrowth all look alike, and the  monster graphics are quite limited with minimal animations. In essence, the  graphics are abysmal compared to today's standards.
FOUR: The economic  system in UO is in disarray. When I first started playing UO, a small house  cost me 4000 gold. Now, nearly 3 years later it is over 1 million gold. If  we had that kind of inflation IRL (in real life) governments would collapse  and anarchy would take over. Even if you can afford to buy a house, there  is no land left where you can actually place it, so the idea of housing.,  although a great idea and unique to UO vs Everquest and Asheron's Call, is  unusable in its current form in UO.
FIVE: Character development. UO is  completely a skill-based system. This means to improve something you must  do it over and over and over and over (you get the idea). This would be OK  except that origin has all sorts of skill caps so that at some point you  cap out and are afraid of even seeing someone make bake a cake as it may  raise your baking skill which would automatically lower your hard-earned,  cap'ed-out, magic skill. Essentially once you reach the caps you have  nothing to strive for. The other MMRPG games allow you to almost  indefinitely strive for new heights giving you one more goal to continue to  game for.
 SIX: Cheating. It is well known that there are  ""cheat"" programs available for UO. Inevitably the same characters  randomly killing other characters in the wilderness are using these to gain  an unfair advantage. Also, because of these and other ""macro""  programs available. It is possible to ""cap"" a brand new character  in a matter of days. ""Cap"" means to get a character trained in  skills all the way to their maximums. The fact that it can be done in a few  days is distressing to other players wishing to enjoy a more level playing  field and to actually earn the skills vs. using macro programs to get the  skills maxed.
SUMMARY: If you already have a large group of friends  playing that you can use to help protect you,  if you like the idea of  professions, and you have some extra cash burning a hole in your pocket,  perhaps give UO a shot. However, due to the anarchy, the terrible graphics,  and the overall player culture, I do not recommend this game to anyone  looking for an enjoyable on-line RPG experience. My suggestion is to try  Asheron's Call and perhaps even Everquest, NOT UO",2.0

"Konami took a bold step into 3-D with this Castlevania installment for the 64.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to expectations, which part of it is because it wasn't the same people (believe it or not) that did Symphony of the Night (PSX).  Read on to see why it's a below average game:

I was never a fan of the 64 controller and this is the one game where it hurt most.  The controls and gameplay were difficult at best, and normally I have a decent tolerance level for controls; Here's where I absolutely loathed it.  Getting your character to go where you want is quite a challenge for this game.  Also, the storyline, aside from the two characters' different (yet similar) paths, is really hollow at its core and doesn't add anything new to the Castlevania legacy.
OVERALL
Not recommended.  I advise renting the game only.  ONLY BUY IT IF YOU ARE A DIE-HARD N64 FAN.  Otherwise, I strongly recommend skipping it.  I'm a big Castlevania fan and I feel that this game does not do the series justice.  I noticed some people in their reviews that they liked this game over Bloodlines (Genesis); Why?!  Bloodlines had far better gameplay and replay value than this!  Perhaps it's because 90% of gamers today prefer graphics over gameplay, when it's GAMEPLAY that creates the game.",2.0
Interesting game at first with lots of enemies to fight but the later levels revolve mostly around making difficult jumps.  Would not reccomend.,2.0
"Overall, it's a pretty good game. 1 star taken off because it does not feature the original soundtrack, and because of this many levels are silent or have different music. another star taken off because of load times, the graphics, lag (come on, no amount of enemies should make a game like this lag), and the censoring of some levels. Also, no 2-player Co-op, only online which is stupid. If you simply MUST have it on PSX then you'll enjoy it, if not then just buy the PC version.",2.0
"This is a futuristic dirt bike game, where rather than riding dirt bikes, you ride a jet-powered motorcycle. The game starts out being fun racing along exotic 3D courses like a jungle island, an earthquake rattled Los Angeles that has fallen into the sea, a cold mountain passageway and so on. When the player advances past the first few races the game stops being fun and starts getting unnecessarily and frustratingly difficult, because rather than having track borders (like walls) where the racer cannot go past a certain point, the courses further in the game take away those walls so you literally fall off the track. It is also unclear where the finish line is, sometimes you must do a lap around a circular track, and other times you must do a U turn then go back through the track. Then reappear on the track, far behind the other racers. The game is full of jumps, ridiculously high jumps, and while you are in the air you can do flips and tricks. Not any advanced tricks like from Tony Hawk. There are several racers, however the racers are so uneven that you can pick a certain racer and win constantly.",2.0
The game is ok but the the feeling in the ring is too small and when you move a superstars place it should play the groups music. The rings are too boring should be a NITRO ring. Cage matches should be in ring chosen.,2.0
"Love south park, and it was cheap.

Its also laughably bad.

"Back in the day I somehow managed to complete this game, using a Game Shark to make it through....

...I've found this title at a flea market and decided play it again. Now I realize why I got rid of this game in the first place.

What's good: The creepy tone, dialogue, and many of the FMV scenes are really interesting (some comic) and are what makes this game so well remembered.

What's so bad:
(1) THE CAMERA: This is your #1 worst enemy. In many places, it won't face forward so that you can make a safe run. In fact, many times it turns so that you will fall to your death. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY LIVES I LOST DUE TO THIS! This game isn't friendly like Sypro. The camera is awful.
(2) HORRID DIFFICULTY: Even in the first levels, you'll be taking a lot of damage per attack. Later on, you constantly get swamped with several enemies attacking all at once. I just can't see how to survive very long without using Game Shark codes to replenish health over and over again.
(3) TOO MUCH EXACT JUMPING: There are far too many jumps that require you, over a short run, require you to hit the directional twice (to run) & hit the jump button in time at the right time. I made it all the way to the Ghost Ship level, where there's platforms above cannons that open & close. I was lucky to eventually make it across, jumped on the spinning platform, missed the next jump only to fall into an area that eventually leads back RIGHT BEFORE THOSE CANNON PLATFORMS AGAIN! I've detailed this because this is where I finally gave up & almost cracked the disc!

UPDATE: I was able to finish this game by activating the Cheat mode within the game. Only then was I able to get past the final levels.",2.0
This Game Isn't Very Exciting. I Don't Like This Game. It's Boring .What You Do In This Game Is Try To Go Through Boring Levels That Don't Look Very Detailed. I Warn You. You Won't Like This Game. I Warn You. Don't Pick This Up. This Game Is Really Old  And Just Such A Bad Game .,2.0
"This game was very poorly made...it's really boring, because all you do is walk around and throw stuff at things. All the enemies are exactly the same, there's never any health, and 100 health points aren't enough, because the health goes down too fast. The sight of range is ridiculous because half the screen is nothing but fog, and it all just draws in as you walk ahead, making it hard to see enemies. I do like seeing the familiar South Park characters in 3D, the game is very funny, and the weapons are hilarious! But still, I wouldn't buy it. Rent at most.",2.0
"They should test products before being sent out, packaging was good though. Such a good game I was disappointed when I heard the rattling.",2.0
i got this game a couple of weeks ago and I do not see how anyone could like it.  The computer always gets behind you so you have to turn around  with horrible car physics which takes a while with people like Darkside and  Minion.  The cpntrols are bad and all the fighting seems to be in the same  place.  You can have some fun woth this game though.....,2.0
"Who in their right mind thought using up on the D-pad for accelerate was a good idea? Little things like this absolutely take all the fun out of the game. The vehicles move around like they're on a tightrope trying not to lose control and cornering and braking are deplorable and is a complete mess. Graphics hardly mean anything to me, but man does this game look harsh, probably the worst for the PS1, even for its time. This game hasn't aged well at all. It has almost put me off on trying the sequels, but I hear they get better. I tried, I really did, but it's way too short and the controller quirks along with the vehicle mechanics make this game almost a chore to play today.",2.0

"I was pretty excited to try this game, because I remembered it from my childhood. However, it is really really hard, especially if you don't like to use the D-Pad. I can't get past the first mission. The dialogue is really cheesy and lame too. I wanna keep giving it another shot, but it just doesn't do it for me.

The whole concept of the ninja fighting is actually really cool though. I enjoy the stealth aspect of the game a lot. It is honestly very realistic. However, it's the actual combat that ruins it for me. Combat is unavoidable at parts, although you have ways of escaping. I think the developers purposely made the combat suck so that you would stealth assassinate npc's. The combat is so bad that I just turn it off and put metal gear solid in instead; that way, I get a decently difficult stealth action game on the playstation with ninjas in it anyways, just less frustration.

Package came quickly and was in fantastic condition though. I'd say it was worth 4 bucks.",2.0

"Ive Been A Mortal Kombat fan for years. But i was very dissapointed When Mortal kombat 4 Came out. The thing that attracted me to the 1st mortal kombat in the fist place was they used actual people in the game that made it distinktive from many other games, And i belive when people were suggesting to have it in the 3d formatt its that they wanted actual charecters (people) like in part 1,2&3 But in 3 dementianal backgrounds and 3d actual people charecters.  Plus i think they bombarded the charecter Rayden he Looks Sorry.  Hopefully they will return to useing actual charecters",2.0
"The Good: Decent story, tons of gore, great graphics and audio, new features are neat

The Bad: Abysmal combat, terrible control, extremely slow pace, laughable voice acting

I tried so hard to love RE1 and look beyond its major flaws. Flaws such as the abysmal combat system. You can't aim at anything! The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY, and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window. The other flaw is the level design. Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost. The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.

Another thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow! When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish, menu are slow, text is not skippable. Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting. They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad. The only good part about RE is the story, enemies, and the amount of gore there is. While DC offers vibration, uncensorship, and a few game play tweaks it's not worth it. RE4 was my first RE and going back to this is just awful. If you haven't played RE1 you're not missing much at all.",2.0

"I was really excited when this game first came out. The advertisements were really cool and I was excited about MK finally going 3D. But, the first con I noticed when I started to play was that it had the same boring music as the last games. The Mortal Kombat movies boasted excellent, exciting music, and I was really hoping that MK4 would incorporate some of that into the game. The music made the movies so much better (and let's face it, probably the only thing that made the second movie worth seeing was the music during the fights).
Killer Instinct has awesome music, which is what makes that game so fun to play. MK4, if it would have had better, faster music, would have been a lot better, IMHO.
What I liked about this game was that old favorites returned. MK3 didn't even have Scorpion (my fave)! So, I'm grateful for his return. The graphics and special moves were cool, as were the weapons...but I feel as though they could have done so much more with the use of weapons. Basically, all you can do is hack and slash with no real technique or anything...
MK4 seems utterly far behind other 3D fighting games (like Tekken). It's unevolved and gets easily boring unless maybe you're a diehard fan. The plot was okay, but the character endings were done sooo poorly. I always thought MK was cool because of its intensity, but the endings in this game were...goofy. The resolution of the conflict between Scorpion and Sub-Zero was done so poorly...I just kept shaking my head.
And even Liu Kang's ending was horrible. The character voices were pathetic. In fact, I was going to give this game 3 stars, but now that I think about it, I'm only going to give it 2. I don't know if the game developers intended to make the game goofy and clown-like, but if they did, then they succeeded. If they were planning on making the game as cool and intriguing as the last ones, then they failed miserably, in my opinion at least.
One more con: Everyone has the same combos! Why?? Run, punch, punch, high kick, roundhouse (or something like that) is everyone's greatest combo it seems. MK3 Ultimate was cool because of all the different combos. But in this game, the only thing that makes one character different from another is the appearance and special moves. The fighting technique is the SAME for EACH character (except Goro, of course).
If you're an MK fan, then it's probably worth buying...but if not, just rent it...
I'm hearing rumors of an MK5 being in the works. If it's true, then I hope that it's more serious and true to the series than this game was. I don't think I'll buy it, though. I don't think I want much of anything to do with MK anymore.",2.0
First off this game takes off some of the best bosses and many of the good areas. The original and gamecube versions are much much better. Get them instead of this one or if your a collecter get this one but don't bother playing it inless you don't like the other longer versions. And that dead guy you find at the biggining won't have that tape you would find on the other games which is a big downfall well not really but still. it can still be quite scary but not as and since its the playstation version the graphics arn't as good as the gamecube(im sad to say this seeing as I prefer the playstation to the gamecube).

"Naughty Dog and Sony released Crash Bandicoot, which rivaled the likes of Mario and Sonic. In the end, many gamers liked Crash's non-stop action, but others simply just skipped it. Even though it was very promising, Crash's gameplay did not really offer anything new, which featured elements you can find in a 16-bit platformer.

You play as Crash, whose girlfriend is kidnapped by Dr. Neo Cortex. You basically just run through the levels from start to finish and fight bosses after each world. Even though the action is intense throughout, the gameplay becomes really tedious. Crash Bandicoot did nothing new for adventure games and it isn't really 3D since you're restricted to one path. All you do is make your way through levels, dodging obstacles, avoiding enemies, and collect items and nothing more. The difficulty level is not exactly high either, and the challenge is severely lacking.

Crash's graphics are quite impressive for a PlayStation game, including well-textured environments and colorful characters. Effects like running water and mist and fog are great eye-candy. The visuals are the game's only saving grace. Controlling the bandicoot can be a hassle since it doesn't use analog. You're forced to deal with sensitivity of the crosspad and at times will result in unwanted deaths.

Aside from good graphics, you're left with nothing but an average platformer equivalent to that of a 16-bit Sonic game in a polygonal world. While it may be 3D, Crash plays out too much like an old side-scrolling game of the past. I don't know why would anyone want to play this game because Crash Bandicoot pales in comparison to other breakthrough adventure games at the time, like Sega's NiGHTS and Nintendo's Mario 64.",2.0
"I really, really wanted to like this game, I loved the cover, and I loved the characters, and the personality of the protagonist, but the controls are not very good at all. When you push the analog stick back, the character just turns around and moves all over the place, and jumping on platforms is painful to say the least. I would have liked this game if the controls were not so finicky, but it did extremely poorly in that department. If the controls were bearable, I would have actually enjoyed the game.",2.0
"Croc: Legend of the Gobbos for the PlayStation should be a very fun game but some key things make it anything but.

Plot: The evil Baron Dante invades the peace loving Gobbo Island the crocodile name Croc tries to save the day by stopping the evil Baron Dante. 8/10

The plot is a high point in this game as a lot of games have bad stories

Sound: This game has a high quality soundtrack and great sound effects. 9/10

Gameplay: to control croc is the bad point, the game bad controls make this game bad enough to skip. 3/10

Overall: This game is OK, but could have been A LOT better. with its cute and cuddly characters to the beautiful islands This game could have been one of the best and well know PlayStation games, BUT, it is only half that.

"it's fun to play in little bits, but if I play it for too long it's just maddening. there's almost no story, for one. the controls are imprecise at best, and the battle system manages to be bare-bones and overly difficult at the same time. the 'health' is the gems you collect throughout the levels, but no matter how many you collect, you'll lose them all if you get hit just once. if you get hit on zero 'health', you die. you only get three lives, after which you lose any progress you've made in that level, and start from the beginning. all in all, if you have a lot of patience, you might enjoy this, but if not, I wouldn't reccomend it.",2.0
"This is not a game for the impacient.  Normally, If I dig into a game I know will take a long time solve, it has to motivate me with an interesting story line, music and or graphics (an RPG like FFVII or VIII for instance)  However, If you are interested in a complex and super challenging strategy game, this may be for you.

"There's a lot of hype surrounding the Resident Evil series of games. They're on most systems, there are books, and even a movie. The story is a good one, but I found the game to not be so great. Graphics are alright, the sound is bad though. And game play is horrible. Trying to move around is difficult and can be confusing, especially when you're under attack and things are chaotic. The characters move unlike most games. You don't go in the direction of the D-pad, rather you turn with right and left direction and move with a button. It was poorly designed. But since the Playstation 2 is out, and better games as well as more Resident Evil, there's no reason to pick up this game anymore. The 2-disc set here is one adventure with a male character and another with a female. The game is involved, just not as much fun as it shoud be",2.0

"I think it's too late to give a review on this game, but here goes. This is the most perverted game ever made. When you think about it, it's pretty disgusting.

Anyway, the gameplay is fun...for 15 minutes. Then it's bothersome, annoying, and dull. Your team mates have the worst A.I. ever, and they don't get power-ups. The game is horribly easy and WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY too short. Like, 30 minutes short. Also, the voice acting sucks.

"Although there are video games out there that can wow you, and then there are the duds. Not all racing games seem to be the best behind the wheel. In the case of a video game coming based from an arcade version, it really seems to be alright, but looks are always decieving. In the case of Nintendo 64, there are very few racing games that really can make it behind the wheel. This isn't really one of them.
The 1996 Crus'n U.S.A. game for Nintendo 64, seems to be a real miss behind the real wheel. The graphics are very strong, but you are limited down to a certain number of cars to choose from, which is seven, not like the more than dozen that there are in the arcade game. Although the courses seem to be within detail, there are so many flaws, including th frame rate and the style of the game, especially within the tunnels of place like Washington D.C. Nevertheless, the game seem to be a little down and out, but at the time it came out for Nintendo 64, it was one of only two video racing games for the Nintendo 64.
It is kind of dissapointing that they couldn't try to make some better video games with racing at the time, but there are so many better choices to the Nintendo 64. If you're really into the racing feel of the Nintendo 64, I suggest you either get Mario Kart 64, Rush 2, or the sequel to Crus'n U.S.A. : Crus'n World.",2.0

"I became nostalgic one night, after thinking of my middle school memories of this game. I read all the reviews about the game which were pretty low. I bought it anyway. Personally, I love the game. But if you have never played this game, I would suggest you buy a better N64 title. There is nothing innovative or original about the game. You race fictitious cars heavily inspired or duplicated from real cars like the Corvette sting ray and Ferrari 355? You race on tracks with just one path. No shortcuts or side streets. The track curvature and topography varies based on the location theme. San Francisco, US 101, Hollywood, Arizona desert, midwest, cities etc. Scenery also changes based on the track location.
Light traffic obstructs your path while racing for a challenge. Two player battles are very fun if you want a quick, competitive, but easy going race.

cheesy MIDI background music
Ridiculous crash and handling physics
2-3 minute races
Sub par graphics
Car imitations

"Well, what do we have here folks?  A bad movie tie in game?  Well, what else is new?  A Bugs life for the Playstation is a almost universally hated game.  I really didint know what to expect when I first fired it up to try it out.  Did I like it?  Not a whole lot.

You start the game where you must get to your anthill.  You start walking around, getting used to playing, listining to Flick talking, following Dot, and killing evil bugs.  In a few minutes however, you start to realize something.  Flick will not be quiet.  He keeps going on and on and on and on and on and on and on with his annoying comments.  You finish the level and go on to the next level and keep up this pattern untill the end of the game.

  Up untill then, if you haven't tried to get all the little goodies, you will have had a fun time.  But when you play again to try and get all the secrets, the trouble really begins.  For instance, to unlock a movie clip, you must collect all the letters of your name, collect 50 grain kernals, and kill all the bad bugs.  Sounds simple right?  Dont be an idiot.  getting all the grain pices is fairley hard but manigable.  Getting your name is really tough.  In one area you will see the letter F for F-L-I-C-K  To get it, you have to get a tall stalk.  To get the tall stalk, you must collect green tokens scattered throughout the level to power up the stalk power.  After collecting all the tokens, some of which are guarded by really tough bad bugs and others that are placed where you have to use another bug power to get it, you can finially reach the letter...once you get a seed.  Which is located a mile away from the letter.  You have to get the seed and take it to the letter, all the while getting attacked by bad bugs and listining to Flicks annoying commentary.  Once you get the stalk, put it in place and break it open, climb the stalk and get the letter.  Wasent that fun kids!  And you have to do that for EVERY SINGLE LETTER!!!! And don't forget that you have to kill all the bad bugs.  To do that you have to get the tokens for berry power, which are located throughout the level.  However some of them are located out of reach, and you can only reach them by getting a tall plant to help you out.  To do that, you must collect green tokens and get seeds to help you out and yada yada yada yada blah blah blah.

  Get the idea of how frustrating this game can be?  And along with all that, Flick does not shut up, he keeps saying something every 10 seconds.  Along with all these problems, you have to deal with bad graphics, a annoying camera and some really HARD token collecting levels later on in the game (Such as the tree level)

A bugs life does have a few nice points.  Some of the levels are neat, such as the boss battles.  The final battle with Hopper at the end of the game is very cool.  The music is by far the best part of the game, almost all of the tunes are very memorable and addictive.  But beyond that, the things that try to enable replay value almost destroy the game.  Rent before you buy.  Did I mention that Flick never shuts up?

The good:
Some neat levels
cool boss battles
excelent music
the final level

The bad:
none

and the Ugly:
Horrible graphics, abysmal gameplay, Token collecting is impossibly hard, annoying levels, Frustrating ennimies and FLICK DOES NOT SHUT UP!!!",2.0
"This game had the potential to be great, but the controls were very difficult to maneuver with, as your thumbs will become very sore after trying to move your character with the D-pad for however long you play the game. If you can find yourself a specialized D-Pad for fighting games, or one that can override the Dualshock analog limitations, than you just may be good to go, but you can easily take a lot of damage, and you can't save anywhere like you would be able to if you played any of the Doom games, or Quake. If you want something that will scare the jeepers out of you, then go ahead and play this, but if you want a comfortable game with horror elements, I think you are better off playing Doom 3, Silent Hill, the original Quake or Resident Evil 1-3. These are my two cents.",2.0
"I bought this game back in December. I played it for about 2 solid hours. I come to realize that this is it. All the same levels are like this. So boring and so not like the movies, and the movement and the weapons in this game are terrible. Not to mention the animation of the Aliens, they look like they are break dancing or having an upright seizure, moving back and forth like a tiger pacing in a cage. The alien creatures are so predictable in this game, and not the least bit scary. The parasites things that crawl on the ceiling, walls, and floor is perfectly done, but I am going to have to say that even the DOOM games bring better action and better background and goals and weapon options compared to this Alien game. The PC game, ALIEN VS PREDATOR is by far way better than this, and is true to the plot and movie action.

Its too bad I spend 12 dollars on this game, I am going to re-sell it right away and let some other sucker buy it.",2.0
"I remember playing this game back around 1996. I was nearly 12 years old when I first played this game and I thought, at the time, this was a really cool game. I really like the Alien movies (mainly the first and second one) and I was fairly excited to play any game based on my favorite movie.

Now, as a grown up (or maybe still a child at heart, lol), I came across this game again. Remembering all my childhood experiences with this game, I was fairly excited to relive it. Right after playing it for about 5 minutes, I started laughing at myself. I honestly don't know what I saw in this game. The game is so horribly crafted that it's really a surprise that they released this game at all. The graphics are ok (given the time it was released), and the weapons are kinda cool. However, that's all that's good about this game.

If you are buying this game to relive some childhood memories, I recommend not buying it because you're going to ruin some good memories. Just keep it as memories, don't relive it because you might see it differently.",2.0
"KEEP AWAY UNLESS YOU ARE A FAN OF THE ALIEN SERIES!!!

This game is old, and it shows.  There is no Dual Shock capabilities, and pretty much everything is sprite animation except the walls and doors.  It really looks like it could be a cell phone game.  The story is: there is no story.  You are pointlessly taken on an adventure through the areas of the first three movies in the series (the TRILOGY at the time, obviously) and pit against tons of enemies including human foes as well as the Alien creatures and their varients.  This game isn't very creative, or well designed, but it is classic.  In the end, and as a fan of the Alien series, I must say DO NOT play this game.  It will only alter your perception of the series.",2.0
"I bought my PS1 in 1999, and this was the 2nd game I bought. This game is only fun if you cheat. Mainly because it is too boring to spend countless times replaying the same level over and over again to finally advance to the next one and have the exact same objective. Find batteries or some item, then find the mission end door. This wasn't poorly made, by any means. It is a good early FPS, maybe I played it just too late. A definite buy if your an Alien fan though.",2.0
Game was not mint. Had wear on it. Game not as described,2.0
"well, first of all, i think the plot (...), i don't like gexs atitude, and maybe i am young but i still think itd be better without the ""adult content"" in it...but it is kinda neat and funny like chasing snowboarding snowmen and stuff...i really cant tell u what to think of it...youd have to rent it and see for yourself... me, i don't like it",2.0
"This is an early military simulation type game, and pretty much obsolete, basically a mediocre pastiche of other stuff being done at the time. The graphics are supposed to be photo realistic but they aren't, the ideal in these types of games is that it should look like a helmet cam worn by a soldier in real life. Everything looks very matter of fact... This isn't a beautiful game to behold. The psn version that I have glitches and freezes up often, I don't know if that was a problem in the original or not but it probably was. The Gabe Logan 3D model is the worst that I've seen in a ps1 game, he has a Sasquatch body with a Lego character face, and stands and walks like Sasha Mitchell. That has nothing to do with the limitations of the system but instead it's a limitation of the artistic ability of the people working on the game. Controls are pretty close to as bad as it gets, very hard to steer your character, mostly worthless auto-lock targeting. There is some creativity to the level design, some okay variety, but there was better stuff being made back then. I stopped playing a level or two after the helicopter boss, because the enemies start wearing super flak jackets that take more than one clip, it turns into a head hunting game where you have to go into manual targeting mode and are left a sitting duck unable to move from the sucky controls.",2.0
"WAY too many positive reviews for such a crappy game.  That's what I think.  Syphon Filter is atrocious.  I received this game as a Christmas present (gee, what a crappy gift) back in the late 90's.  I thought to myself ""well, all the N64 players have Goldeneye, I can compete with them when I receive Syphon Filter for my Playstation!""  How wrong I was.

It's not that the actual game is bad.  I mean, walking around shooting people is fun, and it's also fun to avoid being seen and make it to the end of the level without having to fire your weapon once (and having to remain VERY quiet while doing so).  The problem is that the difficulty is incredibly high and the storyline is about as interesting as watching the paint your baby brother smeared all over your television set dry.

Without a certain special code it's REALLY hard to get *anywhere*.  The storyline is similar to one you'd see in the TV show Jag.  It's just not interesting to me.  Walking around shooting people is fun, but that's all the game has going for it.  Now imagine if that special code didn't exist where you can kill people in just one or two shots.  The difficulty would be out of this world.

I also hate the game for the bad memories connected to it.  The Christmas I got the game, I had a few bad personal things happen.  But looking back, Syphon Filter really isn't any good. It's not surprising to me that the game is going for only a couple pennies right now used, and only a couple dollars to buy brand new.  It's not even worth THAT much!",2.0
i have not finished the game stuck on level where you have to fallow the guy to the secret meating don't know what to do aftery you kill the guy in the meating room and get to the room that's all red and get to the door how do you get the security door open hope fully you can help,2.0
"It's a shame that the Sega Saturn didn't succeed in North America the way that it did in Japan because they received the Arcade perfect version of this game for the Saturn and to this date there still is not an Arcade perfect version of this game for any home console. You could probably find someone selling a Japanese Sega Saturn on eBay or something, but that's a lot of trouble and who wants to buy an entire foreign system just to play just one great game (and maybe X-Men vs. Street Fighter too!)?

As far as the PlayStation version goes, you are forced to select only one fighter and an assisting teammate due to the PlayStations lack of RAM and VRAM (the Japanese Sega Saturn version requires a packed-in 4 MB RAM Cartridge which allows the game to play exactly like the Arcade version with minimal load times). However there is a trick if you are playing a 2 player game! If both players select the same characters, then you are able to play the game the way it was meant to be played: 2 vs. 2 tag-team! This game plays almost exactly like the previous years X-Men vs. Street Fighter on PlayStation with some new features and different characters. If you liked the way the PlayStation port of Marvel Super Heroes played then you will like this even better since it is more of the same with more character variety and more colorful graphics. Aside from the cutbacks in gameplay style and missing frames of animation (another downside to the PlayStations lack of RAM!), this game is enjoyable enough if you aren't obsessed with the Arcade verion too much. I would still go for the Japanese Sega Saturn version since it is Arcade perfect or wait (and hope) for Capcom to release a Marvel Anthology or another Capcom Arcade Classics compilation with X-Men: Children of The Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, this game, Marvel vs. Capcom and Marvel vs. Capcom 2. C'mon Capcom!!!!!!",2.0

You get to whack things with yer light-saber which  sounds much like the movie and the other sound effects/background ambience  are excellent in my opinion.  Music even better.  Gameplay OK.  Graphics  are not the best for now but very good for 1999.  You want a good Episode I  game, try Racer.",2.0
"This game is ok. When I first played it I thought it was excellent, but after I borrowed it from a friend I realized how lame some parts of the game were. Playing as the queen is just bad, VERY bad.  Panaka is ok,  Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are pretty cool because they have sabers. But the  queen? Maybe someone else like Padme or even Jar Jar. The fact that the  Jedi could deflect lasers blasts was great. This feature could have been  awesome if Lucasarts hadn't of made it so difficult to deflect laser  blasts. Another problem are the stupid droids. The battle droids sometime  don't attack you when you are 3 feet away from them. Realism is another  factor. In the movie, we didn't see R2-D2 until the queen left theed. In  the game we see him opening doors for us on the Trade Federation Ship. Even  though this game has some really messed up parts in it. There are still  some good parts in it. Sound is excellent. THe duel with DM is good too.  All in all, The Phantom Menace is a pretty good game if your a star wars  maniac, but if your are a simple star wars fan like me it's really nothing  special. Jedi Knight is better anyway.",2.0
"This game had a lot of potential, no matter how lame the movie may have been.  The graphics were good (especially the lighting efects), but the polygonal characters... frankly, they stank. I know Lucas Arts can produce  MUCH better titles than this, after having played Jedi Knight and Pod Racer  I know it's possible. But this one was rushed to the point of releasing on  beta level! The sounds were great, just as most of the other Lucas Arts  games are. They are usually pulled straight out of the movie. The most  annoying aspect of the game was the camera angle. What were they thinking!  You could barely see in front of you. It would have been better for a  completely overhead view, than that annoying angle, in which you couldn't  see twenty feet. Anyway... I'm not even going to waste my time writing  about a game I was sorely disapointed with.",2.0

Which is, sadly, only for gamecube and dreamcast.  This Game  doesn't have the same quality of story line as the previous sonic adventures did.  while the team thing was great, it was not great that Knuckles ability to climb walls was taken away.  All we can do is hope seag realizes its mistakes.  i hope the next sonic game is more like the first sonic adventure.",2.0
"Boy, this game was a real disappointment. I truly expected better for this game, since it was based on a truly cool, badass movie. The main reason why it wasn't so good is because of its difficulty... this game was incredibly difficult! Even with the Player's Guide it was very difficult to beat! The last time I played it was probably 2 to 3 years ago though, and back then I wasn't as skilled as I am now at video game playing... maybe I'll give it a second chance. Still, its chances of not being sold or something are not really good.
After all the reviews that I read, I thought that when I tried my buddy's game ""Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles"" on my step-brother's Dreamcast that it would [stink]completely... but in fact it was the exact opposite. All the reviews I read kept saying how ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" was way better than""Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles""... boy were those reviews experiencing strong cases of irony. ""Jedi Power Battles"" was a lot more fun than ""The Phantom Menace"", and it was at a good level of difficulty. Too bad I didn't beat it though, my step-brother doesn't have a Memory Card for his Dreamcast. If you're a HUGE fan of ""Star Wars"", then don't get this game... you'll end up destroying the game after you see how many pointless missions you have to go through and how many impossibly difficult leaders you have to face: 1) Jabba the Hut's champion fighter, 2) a huge and hairy beast, 3) a thief who stole a part from Anakin's podracer, 4) a Coruscant mercenary, 5) and ofcourse the incredibly powerful Darth Maul. Sure, it may SOUND easy, but wait till you hear this... you don't always play as Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi; in quite a few levels you are forced to play as Captain Panaka and even...gulp... Queen Amidala! Really, I'm not kidding.",2.0

"I just have to say one thing first: There clearly are not enough buttons on the N64 controller to make a decent variety of moves. Instead, in this game, there are about nine moves, most of them useless because they do so little damage. This alone makes this game so incredibly boring after two hours that I have to wonder what the creators were thinking when they made this game. Even multiplayer mode loses its appeal pretty quickly, because of the limited amount of moves. There are also a few too many items, and it really makes it less fair that you can use a big baseball bat or a lightsaber or a beamgun to help you win. Also, considering that the gameplay wasn't good enough, the fighting environment takes a new approach at trying to add lots of detail and affecting play, but most of the battle grounds are far too plain for what it is trying to attempt. But I will say that the game has incredible graphics, each character and scene developed beautifully. I also like that in practice mode, you can change the speed of the characters movement so it seems like slow motion. You can make the characters go at normal speed, or one-fourth of it, making for a great amount of Matrix-like suspense. The two challenge rounds are also a challenge, maybe too great a challenge, especially with characters like Yoshi, who don't get a jumping boost, but an egg to throw. The bottom line is, this game is simply a rental, because that is about the amount of time it will take you to get sick of this game. If there were more buttons on the N64 controller, and the game had more play modes, this game could have been pulled off very nicely, but for now, it's just a short rental.",2.0

"Duke Nukem is a pretty cool series.  I use to own some of the Nukem Games...I happen to buy this game along time ago at a game store called GameMax..They had it for 4 bucks...It was pretty sweet.  The graphics were terrible but Hey it was on the Play station.  The game play was kinda slow but still good.  I don't know if this is and edited copy of the game...I can tell you is that in this version I got for PS1 you do see women take there braws off when you pay em' cash..But they have stars...Literaly covering there nips..And it also has a type of color...The one that matches there bra..
The games violence is over the top.  But still it's a winner...I happen to like the N64 versio more then this even though there isn't Brief nudity like The ps1 version But in the N64 version there is more violence...The bodies explode when you shoot them again after there dead.  You can't do that in the PS1 version but that doesn't really matter.
Duke Nukem Total Meltdown is recomended for a mature audience since this game does have over the top pig exploding violence plus you go to an Adults Only Book store and there are half naked strippers with stars on them.
I had fun with this game.  It kinda pissed me off cause you didn't get to do all the stuff you can do in the PC version But I still liked it.  Over all it's a mediocer version.
I do not recomend this version at at all!  Get the PC version!  Or the N64...I donno I just liked that version.

Very annoying for a claim of ""professionally installed"". Secondly, there is a very, very big gouge mark from an exacto (or other similar tool) where they removed the front plate to replace it.

I already own one that I've had since I was in grade school, but I figured having another one would be cool, too, especially since mine was missing its battery door. I chose this one because it seemed like the best, but when I got it this morning, I was slightly disappointed. The gameboy sat in the package with no bubble wrap to protect it, but it wasn't damaged from shipping luckily -- I guess that part isn't such a big deal. I do feel, however, that there could have been a bit of warning as to the console's working conditions.

Going to put the batteries in, I saw there was corrosion on the positive end for the top battery slot, so I took about ten minutes cleaning that off. Not too big a deal, either, I guess. But, once I put a game in to test the gameboy out, I found that the A and B buttons hardly work. To get them to respond, you have to mash them down and hold them down. Makes gameplay pretty slow. I figured I could fix this myself, but once I went to unscrew the screws from the back, I saw that three of them are coated in corrosion, and the top right screw is so rusted, I can't even see where it is. At the moment, I don't have the tools to fix this.

It's not completely unusable, but when you're playing Pokemon and you're in the middle of a battle and the A button doesn't work the first ten times you tap it, it can get a little irritating. Oh well, at least my old gameboy has a battery cover now.",2.0

"I recieved this racing wheel a few years ago as a birthday present. I had an easy time hooking it up to the computer, and installing the software.

Instead of a desk clam, the wheel has a base that slides between your legs and the chair (this product is not for parapalegics)and this puts the wheel at a very unrealistic position, even when the tilt feature is used.
Fast forward about a year. When I try to play Need For Speed Porsche Unleashed, the pedals stop working. I try other games and they will not work. I discovered the cord has to be in just the right postion to make a connection. Very inconvienient having to keep the cord in a delicate position while racing online...
Next, just recently while playing NASCAR Heat, I was making a relitivly slight turn and *SNAP* something broke, and the wheel went loose and wouldn't work.

Once it froze I had to start all over again.  So I emailed Digital leisure and all they could tell me is  I could buy a DVD attachment.  I think they should have gave me a better answer than that. I also got dragons lair but that worked fine.,2.0
"I normally don't like trashing games, but with a game this bad that people are saying is one of the best RPGs of all time, I'm sorry but I can't stand by and watch things like that being said.  I don't see how people can even put this game on the same level as the Chrono's or the Final Fantasies or XENOGEARS!!!  So since most people who play this game seem to have a brain tumor, I'll ease into the worst aspects of the game and start with the graphics and music.  Now the only reason these can't be considered god-aweful is because this game is a re-release of an older one, so the 16-bit graphics and music that sounds like Windows having a nervous breakdown are excuseable.  Now the battle system is a different story.  It is the most unoriginal battle system ever.  Attack, defend, item, magic.  Wow, how riveting.  The only plus is that each character has his own unique spells and you can earn extra physical attack hits by leveling.  But even with the unique spells, the game once again takes an unoriginal turn by going to the exciting level-spell system(gain a level get a spell).  Also, there are virtually no side quests in the entire game.  So all the best armor and weapons are easily obtained.  Now most of these things are usually excusable, as long as the story can make up for the loss.  So logically, Lunar must have a good story.  Let me put it this way, after the first few hours I could predict the rest of the game.  The story was so boring and easily predited that the only reason i finished the game was in the hope that i could be wrong and maybe the plot would make a twist or turn...or even a bend of some sort.  But my efforts were of no avail.  Even the characters were boring.  The best written characters are those that you end up caring for and worrying about.  In Lunar, all I could think about was how unimportant these characters were.  Actually the plot would be exactly the same if every character except for the two leads and the main enemy were not even in the game.  How can you love a character that is only in the game to take up a place in the battle order.  In every RPG I have ever played I have always been able to find an upside or at least something about the game that was done well.  The only thing I enjoyed about Lunar was the pong-like mini game you get to play(no this wasn't part of the actual game but it was on one the cd's).  So I guess what I'm trying to say is...THIS GAME SUCKS!!!",2.0
"I recieved this game for one of my birthday's many years ago. At first I was excited...but when I played it...oh boy. The Graphics were horrible, too rough and generic. To make matters worse, they looked like cheap cartoon drawings.

The missions were dull. Your first mission is to fly though magical rings. The Story is even worse, you have to save random civilians using various powers. The levels keep jumping, so your never in the same place.

The multiplayer was kinda fun, but it gets dull fast. Basicly, it shifts to fps and you shoot other people for points. other than that, this is probably the worst game I have ever played. Don't buy this game...rent it at most..or borrow it.",2.0

The story is intruiging, yet the game's ending fails to please the player, since, you'll discover shortly after completing it, it could be completed in a matter of minutes.

I don't believe anyone has ever finished this game without some help.  There is too much slow clicking around and backtracking to keep the attention of even the dullest person.

"I really wanted to like Hexen 64. It's like a fantasy version of doom, and the storyline and atmosphere are damn good. You can play as a weak but magically powerful mage, a strong but magically weak fighter, or a balanced cleric. But this game has waaayyy too many problems. I didnt' even experience the jumping bug in the editorial review either. The first couple levels, i was hooked. It reminded me of warcraft II: trying to save your homeland from impending doom by ringing the bell and such was awesome. And the fact that the enemies teleport in only adds to the gameplay, as you never know whether you've cleared an area or not. The items are cool, and the mazelike and puzzle aspects woulld've been where it really shined, had they been done right.

unfortunately, not the case. Firstly, the horrible graphics reminded me of jurassic park on snes, as the entirely identical backgrounds provided with not-so-great maps caused me to get lost over and over again, thus killing the mood. Also, in the 4th level or so and on, you hit a switch, and it could open something up on a random spot in ANOTHER LEVEL. This caused me to give up, as i have no interest in searching a level over and over for some obscure doorway or whatever. Also, when i cheated to find the later levels wikthout said searching, i found the end-game bosses to be clones of the you!!! this is just lame imo, they couldn't even be bothered to make up cool end-game bosses?

The game is impossible to figure out unless you are willing to decicate your whole life to it.  Period.
So if you like a game with neat graphics that you will roam around in for hours on end, clueless as to what is going on, then Riven might be for you.
For those with less time I would recommend a game like Grim Fandango, instead of Riven.",2.0
"Okay, yes, this game is beautiful.  Yes, the story is compelling.  Yes, the details are mind-boggling.
But...this game is -needlessly- frustrating.  There is often a considerable lag time between when you  figure out how to solve a problem and when you can actually do something  about it.
Oh, and if you are trying to play this game without headphones,  forget it.  You'll be beating your head against a wall within a few hours.  The game ""suggests"" that you use headphones.  Nay, say I.  You  -must- have them.
Back to needless frustration.  As I experienced in  Myst, there were a number of painfully long hours in which I -knew- how to  solve a puzzle but the extremely small detail and absolute perfection in  every single movement needed to actually -do- the puzzle was beyond my  dexterity.  Many of the puzzles (like the topographical map/animal  sounds/sliding balls etc) were so multi-layered that you actually could  forget which piece went to what puzzle and why you were doing it in the  first place.  They were hard not because of the difficulty in figuring them  out, but in actually doing the mechanics to realize the solution.  I've  played Infocom, I know what -real- difficulty is.  Myst and Riven are a  not-quite-as-fun kind of difficult.
I lost track of the number of times  that I said, out loud, just like when I played Myst (the underground  shuttle in Myst, for example)  ""You've got to be kidding me"".  I  would instantly realize what had to be done and watch in horror, as the  long, boring, and frustrating road of actually doing it stretched out  before me.
But...some of the puzzles were actually relevant to the story,  so you felt a purpose in solving them.  At times, you didn't mind the fact  that you spent hours on something so gosh-darned silly, because hey, at  least the pictures were pretty.
Good story, good pictures, good  animation, some good puzzles, but bring a lot of paper and a pen for notes,  a really good set of headphones, and about 4 aspirin.",2.0
"Others have commented on the richness of the sound score, the sumptuousness of the graphics, and the immersion the puzzles provide for you.  All true.  But I find people's devotion to Riven and its predecessor  a bit overblown.
There are design faults here that should be pointed  out.  The 'slide-show' effect when moving probably does allow sufficient  computer memory for photo-realism while standing still, but it compromises  the realism that the producers were otherwise attempting.  Besides that,  it's simply annoying.  Some have said that it adds a certain elegance to  movement throughout the game, but I don't like seeing my surroundings  'melt' away as I move through them. Nor do I like sterile, empty  environments.  Oh sure, it all adds to the 'creepy' vibe the producers were  hoping for, but a universe which is largely uninhabited is mighty boring  after a few hours.  I wanted wayyyyy more interaction with people than I  got here.
I also wanted to understand why I was doing what I was doing.  Oh I could solve the puzzles, given gobs of time and guesswork, but at the  end I found the plot rather too spare for the amount of work invested.  If  I'm going to spend weeks solving puzzles, I better understand more at the  end of the story than at the beginning.  I'm not altogether sure that  happens here.  The universe here, for all of its graphical excellence,  left me hungry for more.  Clearly, this is an entertainment crafted by  fine artists rather than fine writers.  If you're happy with that  orientation, you'll be overjoyed with the final product.  But if, like me,  you want a game to surround you with an active, vibrant plot revealed by  characters of substance, Riven isn't much of an adventure.",2.0

The main problems I have with this game are the graphics(except the cinematics),the gameplay and some other elements.

All you do is read,read,read...and read some more. The combat system is way beyond confusing. It's all about they hit you,then you hit them,then they hit you with a strong attack and almost or completly kill you. The only good thing I can say about this game,is the cineamatics are beautiful.

"While it may be true that Final Fantasy VII definitely started a whole new phase of RPGs and video gaming in general, I think this is one of those instances where we need to kind of wake up and smell the fresh coffee. Let's face it; FFVII is old news. Many people still praise the glory of the more recent titles as they should, but the conversation always tends to fall back on FFVII, a game that receives far too much undeserved praise.

Let's take a little look into the game, shall we?

Okay, first off, the graphics--What is so appealing? I personally prefer the updated graphical stylings of the first six games rather than a bunch of blocky, lego-esque people (actually lego people look a lot more realistic than that) with no facial expressions whatsoever. FFVII's predecessor, FFVI, was rich with far more detail in its 2D, pixelated environments than this eyesore. Yes, I realize, FOR ITS TIME, it may have looked great; but that was before bigger and better things came along and blew it into the dust.

Storyline--I don't know about anyone else, but the plotholed, still-in-revision feel to this game left me feeling rather empty by the end. I think the main reason I bothered to finish this game at all was simply because I'd hoped there might be some clarification on a few events that seem to fit jaggedly in with the rest of the puzzle, but of course instead of getting that, I get roughly five minutes or so of an ending that resolves nothing. Yes, we've got good ol' Advent Children out now, but that's only after masses of raging fanboys and fangirls overwhelmed Square with the notion that FFVII was the cream of the crop, so they decided they'd throw something together with some catchy graphics to tide them all over, when really, the movie does nothing to help resolve anything. Oh, and let's not forget, in a series called ""Final FANTASY"", we're dealing with a world very much like our own, where an evil corporation is sucking the life out of the planet. Wow, I really wanna play a game where its story holds very little difference from reality. Yea, props to Square for bringing Final Future Fairytale Failure to stores everywhere.

Characters--Okay, wait a sec; I'm supposed to give a darn about an introverted, rude, self-centered basket case, an overgrown muscle maniac who seriously needs to zip the lip once in a while, an annoying ninja who also needs to zip the lip and maybe grow up, a stupid talking robot cat, and a ""flower girl"" who ""just happens"" to be of an ancient race and ""just happens"" upon the main character (can hardly call him a hero) in the most opportune time? Hey, how about I go outside right now; maybe I'll run into Bill Gates as he ""just happens"" to be passing through, and ""just happens"" to have a million dollars he doesn't need and ""just happens"" to give it to me? Come on, people. And not to mention the other characters, like Red XIII, Tifa, and Vincent do little to maintain order around the story. While those three are the only even remotely respectable characters among the cast, one of them is entirely optional, another doesn't have nearly enough lines to make up for all the dim-witted things spewed from the aforementioned group, and the third is borderline as annoying as the others, save for her small lack of ditsy lines.

Gameplay--Okay, I'll admit, this game can be fun sometimes. The music is alright, nothing to marvel over, but it does have its moments. Without being able to use the analog stick, it does become somewhat tedious, and you start to feel more like you're maneuvering a robot through tight spaces after a while. Combat does move at an acceptably swift pace, but the summon animations get somewhat redundant after a while.

Sound--As stated before, the music isn't anything special, but there do come a few themes here and there that seem to stick out in your mind. The mechanical hiss of every sound effect and every song, however, really does start to get irritating after a while to the point where I eventually just muted my TV for a while.

Overall--I think I can honestly say, the only reason I consider FFVII good in any way is that it has its own entirely unique look and feel to it. I don't consider it a FF game, but rather its own separate story. I think if the hype went down just a little, it wouldn't appear as such a spotlight stealer, but as it stands, it does have its own strange sort of charm to it that you don't get from many other games. However, had I been exposed to the glory that was VIII and IX beforehand, this title would've been lost in the mist for me. Upon completion of just about every other FF title, I was presented with a feeling of sincere accomplishment and completion. Not to mention, they all lingered with me for days on end afterward. But this one? Nope. I seem to clearly recall just sort of giving a slight shrug and shutting off my system, never to play the game again after completing it. Yes it felt epic at the time, yes it felt good to finish, but that's only because I was craving it to be over. Am I the only one completely oblivious to the hype? Let's be real, here; if this game came out today, as it is, it would be nothing. If VIII had come out in its place, VIII would be all the rage on every RPG fan's wishlists, not this. Same goes for IX. Or X. Overall, very bland and uninspiring game. I will never understand the hype, nor how it is that this game has somehow managed to gain more popularity than the likes of VI, IV, IX, X, VIII, or XII, which far outshine it in every possible regard.

Save this one for the fanatics; be a true fan and play the games that truly make Final Fantasy GREAT (I, II, III, IV, VI, VIII, IX, X, XII). Have a great day.",2.0

"An ""OK"" game. It was groundbreaking when it came out, but it's a game that outlived its welcome. The biggest reason why this game is still considered the greatest is because of how innovative it was. There is no denying that. However, the gameplay is difficult. You WILL get lost. You WILL get confused. It's inevitable. There's no aids to helping you if you're lost. I've actually had to start the game over twice because what was supposed to be happening never did. It's an alright game if you're bored. But there are WAY better RPG's on the PS1. Legend of Dragoon, for example.",2.0

"First off, i was thinking of giving this 1 star...but that would be too cruel. Now then why does this game suck so bad? I can sum it up very easily for all of you that love this game so much and will dissagree with me to the point of trying to find where I live and killing me. Now then onto why the game sucks

FF7 has many small flaws that stop it from recieving  what you all think it deserves. This game does almost everything wrong in one way or another. It's the way it does it though that makes this game so bad.

This game gets so much priase through it's story but this is probably the most flawed part of the entire game. For a while i did enjoy the game but then as soon as everyones favorite bad boy Sephiroth enters the entire game goes downhill and evetually into the depths of hell where it belongs. Now then Sephirtoh is the ""bad guy"" but no you're still after Shinra ( an ""evil corpiration.....) *who also wants to kill sephiroth..ever heard of putting aside differences to destroy the common enemy guys?* Now thena  bad guy like sephirtoh is cool to see in games, but it's all about presence. Sephirtoh himself isn't very thertening or cool because of  the fact that he gets very little screen time or the fact that whatever he says makes no sense whatsoever....and it never does! The story wasn't even complete whent eh game was released. They never bothered to fix all the tons of loopholes that they left in the game.

Where this story goes downhill the most is with all the plot twists. In an effort to make people think they are buying an intelligent game, they throw in as many plot twsits and possible and never answer about 2 thirds of them.  It makes me feel sad that people claim this to be the greatest game of time (HA! LOZ: Ocarina of Time is probably the greatest game of all time...if you want a amzing game get that...seriosuly...these characters ahd no effect on me whateverso ever...i didn't care at all  *sploier alert!!!!!...though if you don't knwo this already you must of been living under a rock for the past 7 years* that aries died, all it meant was one less sterotype in my party and one less flabbergas head to worry about. Why do you think people try to analyze this story so much? Because none of them understand it! If it's such a great game why is it so hard to understand?

Why spend so much time attacking the story? Becuase it has lots to do with it's gameplay. All of the sudden you focred to use a character you havn't been lvling at all. And there is so much pointless talking that never has any answers to them whatsoever!

Also at many times you are forced to go to a town that felt like it could of been a  sidequest, but no we have to deal with a long boring story of someones past *and we hardly learn a thing about them even after the 2 hours you had to spend in that town* It just really drags the game down.

Now then about graphics...they sucked for that time and they still do. The characters look like legos and the cgs look like  they used dolls of the game characters. Now then the still backgrounds. This is where you have to run all the way to the other end, and you have no idea where you are going. Ocarina of time had some still backgrounds but that game succed in making them look beautiful. This game simply looks horrible , plays horrible, and makes absoulty no sense.

Now then the materia system. It allows you do all the old favs. but then they throw in spells you never need to usea nd i mean never. De spell....death...when am i going to use these? Also people claim the system works well. Well, explain to me then. In most rpgs each character has unqie moves to them. And besides the characters limit breaks and normal attacks *which don't have much of a difference* there is no reason to unlock the hidden characters. And no reason to put certain spells on certain people. None of the characters have an diveristy. This game is flawed through out. Then there are pointless flash back that takes hours and since it's a flash back you don't gain any exp to the main game. The entire story of that could of been summed in 10 mins. not 2 wasted hours of gameplay.

Also you cannot skip summons, these are cool at first but soon become very boring and you wish you could skip them. Then all the god awful mini games. The only fun one was the motorcycle one. Even Chocabo racing sucked.

Now the music is great but..the sound is simply some of the lowest quality ever.

This game had a chance to succed and be a great classic, but it fails in pretty much every catergory. If Square hadn't rushed this game like they do with most of thier games, i might of enjoyed this more.  Now you can bash me all you want but when it comes down to it. This is starting to sound very right now isn't it? * i would go into more detail about the game but i am tired of talking about it for now* If i were to review this on the first couple hours of the game i would give it 5 stars but then after that the game simple fails to keep up the epic feel it had in the beggining.",2.0

"WWF Attitude, although a good game don't get me twisted, was not worth it on the Playstation because of the incredible loading time. ... Seriously, if you picked Owen Hart, Gangrel, Road Dogg or even Kane or the Undertaker, you had to wait atleast 2 sometimes exceeds of 3-4 minutes just to get a match started. And if you picked a hardcore or cage match, sometimes, you had to wait even longer.
The trade off was truly not worth it for me because of that reason. Granted yes what you got on the Playstation version rather than the N64 version was better. PSone had more sounds, more create a wrestler options in the voice and music and some clothes. Because of PSone's memory capability, the game could have more and that was a definite plus over the 64.
I will admit that once you got the match started on the PSone version, the game itself was faster than N64's version but still, anyone could appreciate not having to wait 5 Minutes to play a simple game. The controls can be a little challenging at first but once you get it, you're golden and you don't have to worry about a thing.
For the game itself I will give a 4 star because it is still a fun game to play with your friends but because of the awful loading and wait time I give WWF Attitude a zero. ...",2.0
"The Resident Evil series has been on a steady decline since the first game came out in the mid-90's.  It seems that they make these games harder and harder than they should be and Code Veronica is no exception.  It's not the simplistic puzzles that make the game difficult, rather, it's the lack of ammo and healing items that make what what should be easy battles far more difficult than they should be.
Why do some zombies take more bullets than others?  Why do zombies respawn in some areas?  What's up with all the backtracking in this game?  You're still forced to use the stupid typewriter ribbons to SAVE?  These are some of the questions you'll ask yourself when you play the Code Veronica.  Has the series evolved?  If you get past the improved graphics, the answer is NO.  The control is just as sloppy as it was in RE1, albeit with a quick turnaround feature and a new two-handed gun mode (you burn through bullets faster this way).  A great deal of prior planning and trial and error is required, which may have been good back when the series was young, but it has simply gotten to be tedious today.
Even the soundtrack is pretty forgettable!  The game has a rather cartoonish look to it...could have looked more realistic but then again, the Dreamcast isn't exactly a graphics powerhouse.  My suggestion...don't buy it.  Granted, I've owned this game for quite some time and those who are new to DC may have heard great things about CV, but trust me, this is a BORING game!  Get Shenmue instead as that game simply plays better and has a better story!",2.0
"Shadow Man on its own is an awesome adventure game with nonlinear exploration and a dark and twisted plot that becomes more and more interesting as you progress.

HOWEVER-and that's a very BIG however, DO NOT buy this game for the playstation. The graphics are horrible! The textures and pixels block together in a muddy picture that will make you squint after about 3 minutes of gameplay. On top of that, the framerate is bearable at some moments, but more often you'll find yourself straining to see what's happening as you move in what looks like a slideshow.

The controls work well, and it's still a good game, but the bottom line is if you get the playstation version of Shadow Man you will most likely be very dissapointed because of the nightmarish graphics.

If you're willing to risk your money on it though, Shadow Man is a deeply involving adventure that is vaguely based on the original comic books. Acclaim significantly changed the whole look and feel of the franchise, making it much darker and creepier. Even on the playstation, the ambient ghoul-filled areas you explore can become uniquely hellish and terrifying. There are so few action-adventure games out there like this one.

You travel through the pre-apocalyptic world of the living and the demon-infested wasteland of the dead from a camera that follows behind the character. You can rotate the camera at 90 degree intervals which can feel complicated at first, but it is necessary for surviving certain dangerous traps. (getting the right angles).

There is also a lot of item-collection, but it doesn't feel tedious and the rewards are worth it. Over time you gain new abilities as you overcome several challenges and dangerous quests in the other-worldly temples of Deadside, the world of the dead.

The combat may take some getting used to, and on the playstation I'm not sure it can ever feel smooth or fun. It's all shooter-based fighting, with either an assortment of guns or magical weapons that shoot fire and energy to damage your foes. Shadow Man can hold two guns at once, and I found the ambidextrous usage of weapons to be effective and simple enough to get used to. Imagine the dual-wielding you get in Halo 2, except you change your weapons in an inventory menu but you draw them in real time. There is no strafing with the default controls, but when you lock onto your enemies with the target system you can circle-strafe to avoid projectiles.

Shadow Man is an incredible and uniquely thrilling adventure that you definetely don't want to miss out on. But as I said before, if you want the actual experience, get the Dreamcast or Nintendo 64 version. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR THE PLAYSTATION!",2.0
"Now before I start talking about how bad this game is, I would first like to state out the few positive things about this game. .The graphics in this game are truly stunning, and it certainly creates a truly scary atmosphere, but, unfortunately, that's about it on the positive side. This game is an absolute mess. The controls are horrible, and the puzzles make this game a tad too difficult without a stategy guide. Now for what I really wrote this review about, the game's story. It's like a jolly awful b-movie. The voice acting is atrocious, and the story is about as believable as Pat Buchanen becoming president (brrrr!). Believe me, it is extremely corny! The people who made this game could have done alot than this! Rent the game if you wish, but please don't buy it! When it's all said and done it's a complete waste of time, and a rip-off!",2.0
"As a huge fan of Midway games, especially NBA Hangtime and NFL Blitz, I had rather high expectations of NBA Showtime when I found out that it would  be released for the N64.  Showtime failed to meet most of these for an  assortment of reasons.  For starters, though, I'd like to quickly say that  the whole idea of fouls in this game has nothing to do with the rating I've  given it.  I'm rather neutral towards it.  Moving on, the least appealing  thing about this game, by far, is the shoddy graphics.  If you want to see  a realistic looking sports game I'd suggest the All Star Baseball series.  The graphics made me cringe when I  started playing, and I had trouble  getting past this.  This game seems like it could run on a SNES.  It really  fails to take advantage of the hardware that the N64 has.  There are some  good things about this game.  The create-a-character idea from the whole  NBA Jam/Hangtime series has been revamped, and I found this part of the  game very fun and easy to use.  Also, if you can get past the graphics,  you're in for a decent amount of fun.  To summarize, I gave this two stars  because I'm fairly sure that the developers were trying to make this  realistic (as opposed to, say, Hangtime), and if this was indeed their goal  then they pretty much failed.  The enjoyment of the series is still there  for the most part though, so i had to give it at least two.  It's worth the  rental fee, but I wouldn't buy it.",2.0

"I love south park and was expecting more from the game when I heard about it.  In story mode you can be any of the four 8-year-olds.  All the unlockable characters can only be used in battle mode and that was one of the biggest dissapointments to me.  Another was the characters always say the same thing, I think they should say something new each level or episode.

And the last was that they only killed kenny in one episode on the game (the one with the robot turkey).  They should've killed him more!!!!  I bet that dissapointed alota kenny fans.

I really wish they would've added more kenny deaths but oh well.  I heard on a web-site that the creaters of SP are thinking about making a new video game but still don't know what company and game-system to have it on.  It better be better than the others they made, thats for sure.",2.0
"I simply find the game ordinary and boring. I really love the TV-show and was very much looking forward to the game.

Admitted: There  are a few funny features in the game, the cow-shooting gun, Mr. Hanky the  christmas Poo but even these things gets quite boring after a very short  while.
My advise is: Enjoy the TV-show and use your playstation for  something else.",2.0

In Dino Crisis 2 it is none stop action, you kill about 12 Dinos every minute, and their are two times more dinos in Dino crisis 2 then in Dino Crisis, And their are about three times more Weapons too(And the wepons are so cool, like when you have one machine gun in each hand at the same time you are able to shoot two different Dinos at the same time).

"What the Resi series of games does, it does well - OTT Hollywood-style scares and genetically-mutated things that go Bump In The Night. RE 3 is no different, providing more of the same for fans who love it. It also boasts one or two gameplay improvements, but somehow can't quite get back to the glory days of the first 2 games in the series.
The plot follows the heroine from the first game, Jill, 24 hours before and after the devastating outbreak of the T-Virus in RE 2. A novel concept, and one which Capcom surely intended to exploit fully. The inclusion of the Nemesis character, a Frankenstein-like monster who relentlessly pursues you from start to finish, is also a nice twist, adding much-neede dtension to the game whenever he makes an appearance. The menus and controls are also tweaked, most notably the inclusion of the 'Turn' and 'Dodge' features, which, if learned properly, add hugely to the gameplay.
Graphically RE 3 is as good as RE 2. It's as detailed, and lush as before. The intro is strangely disappointing, being lo-res and choppily animated - the PlayStation 1's power is being overused. The sound is good, though, and the gameplay is the best possible version of an imperfect control system.
The problems with RE 3 lie mainly in the game's production. It's nigh-on impossible to keep track of yourself for the first thirty minutes or so, and the map for this portion of the game is difficult to spot. The baddies are souped-up versions from the previous games and are actually too difficult to kill initially. You waste precious ammo and health packs before you realise that you can take multiple paths. Also, Nemesis, though an excellent inclusion, is again too intense for the early stages of the game, and more often than not you'll find yourself cursing Capcom while waiting for your game to reload after he's dispatched you. Again.
As the game continues, you realise that the baddies have an unfair advantage over you, and you will end up running past the majority of them. The satisfaction of knowing a Zombie is cornered just isn't there anymore. You also miss out on some beautiful backdrops and vitally important clues becuase you're too busy avoiding some ridiculously over-populated area.
A vast, sprawling game that does yield some rewards for die-hard fans, RE 3 is not a good way to introduce yourself to the series because of its unforgiving difficulty. The storyline may also confuse newcomers. If you're a fan who doesn't mind being confused and frustrated, then check it out. If not, wait for something better, like Code: Veronica, or anything in the Silent Hill series.",2.0
"The Dreamcast VMU that I bought was a used one. When I got it in the mail, I went to try it on my Dreamcast with some new batteries, but the VMU that I bought didn't even work. It would disconnect the controller whenever I plug it in, the buttons don't work right, and the thing would restart itself on its own. I would recommend buying a brand new Dreamcast VMU for a little more so you waste money on something that doesn't work.",2.0
"Although I most confess that I did enjoy this game at first (At first, meaning from beginning to end), I was happy with big areas to explore, and really enjoyed the Nemesis (although it was no more different that that bald stalking guy of the inverted RE2) hunting you down, I most say this game is a fraud in what concerns story line structure, which on its own right, is the main mover of any story-based game.
  I'm going to simulate here the general structure RE3 (and RE2 and RE, although this is acceptable in the original game) follows: ""So, how did these creatures end up here? let's search the whole place while we try to get out of here. Look out! (Lots of guns, blood and guts follow) Wow Jill, that was close! Hey, he was supposed to be our friend! He turns out to be a traitor! Hey look, a secret lab within the main place, (House, Police Station, City or any other place of your fancy) let's check it out! Oh no, this is the truth behind the monsters! We most stop Umbrella. Darn! This place is about to explode, let us get out of here! Look out, a big mean monster! (More guns, blood and guts follow) Yeah! We did it! Our heroes escape a few seconds before the whole place blows up. Fin"" Wow, we have a new Resident Evil game here!
  My point here is: This game features the same story line structure of the past two games, only this time we get to play before and after RE2. That dirty trick was Capcom's strategy to make the game's storyline a little bit different and engrossing.
  I can't comment on Code Veronica, for I haven't played it yet, but I think I will do so when it gets out for the PS2, but for what I can see, the RE series is going down the drainage. I will consider Resident Evil 4 depending on many aspects. I might be playing this game (along with RE2) again when I get me a PS2, but surely, I won't touch it again in the near future.
  There is more to horror gaming than just guns, blood, guts and linear story line.",2.0
"Back in 1996, Capcom introduced  both Japanese and Americans gamers a brand-new world of videogaming. Despite the rather awkward name of ""Resident Evil"", which is just plain out laughable, the title has become a household name. This movie-like, horror series can be written down as a new genre of gaming, horror. Yeah, very few games caused gamers to devastatingly sob (Aeries' funeral in Final Fantasy VII), some games built mystery or suspense (Gray Fox's desperate attack and impressive dialogue in Metal Gear Solid), but Resident Evil led the player to leap in fright or frantically jitter. Capcom inserted blood-thirsty zombies as the adversary, and the player's fear as the biggest opposition. In a sense, it is a movie.  Useless to say, Resident Evil was among the titanic series that landed on the Sony PlayStation. The original game presented an amazing surface. However it suffered from terrible voice acting and a somewhat dull story. Capcom extremely went hard at work for their sequel. Powerful hype erupted when Resident Evil 2 was announced. Anxious gamers couldn't wait to get their grubby paws on a copy. Resident Evil 2 altered the gaming industry. Other home console companies decided to cash in while the genre was sizzling hot. Konami cashed in with Silent Hill. Survival/Adventure games went mainstream.  After RE2 respectfully lived, a third installment was introduced, this time hype was scarce. It came out too quickly and sources claimed the interface was going to be identical as the other two. Fearing the worst, the third installment seemed to be a horrible move for Capcom.  And is.  From the experience of the two Resident Evil games, the player may expect the ""scare moments."" While playing on a big screen t.v., with surround sound, the volume almost reverberating the room, and a sudden pack of grunting zombies crashing out a window, I felt no fear. Amateurs to the Resident Evil series may have a chill ride their spine, but original fans will expect each scare attempt. Though few changes have been added, RE3 fails to take a leap over the original Resident Evil 2. In other words just imagine playing Resident Evil 2 but with more rooms and more puzzle solving.  RE2 is the strongest and most remembered in the series. When catching a glimpse of RE3, excitement was absent. RE3 seems it brought the entire series in shame. The story must take a new direction! Like taking a role of an umbrella agent, or the T-Virus spreading somewhere else than Racoon City. Nemesis, a ferocious, mean, bazooka- equipped devil who hunts the player, proves to be a pathetic antagonist and challenge.  The minigames granted after beating the game bring little life at the game's abrupt end. The slogan, ""if the Suspense doesn't kill you, then something else will,"" lives truly in the second game.",2.0

However, most games are terrible and a game system is only as good as the games it plays.",2.0
"Finally, Sega releases a video game system that rises above mediocrity!  Sega is famous for all kinds of failed (and embarrassing) video game consoles they brought to the world, but this time they actually ""kind of"" got it right with the Dreamcast.

Unfortunately, Sega made a gigantic mistake that almost immediately brought down any chance of the Dreamcast becoming a success.  They chose to release the Dreamcast in late 1999.  Gaming fans vividly remember what happened to the Sega Saturn just a couple years before, and people weren't going to be fooled again.  This was now or never for Sega.  If the Dreamcast failed, Sega would be gone from the hardware market forever.

The release date for the Dreamcast was getting closer and closer.  It was in September of 1999.  People were still very happy with their Playstation One because 1999 was one of Sony's highlights for spectacular and revolutionary gaming.  That wasn't the only thing going on.  Sony fans were also anticipating the release of the Playstation 2, which was guaranteed to become the dominant console thanks to the relentless power and popularity the Playstation One was responsible for.  It was during this time Sony was far and away the most powerful company in the video game business.  Sega saw trouble ahead but continued to move forward with the expected Dreamcast release date.

Nintendo was also very much alive and in the big picture with the Gamecube.  Nintendo was content on making sure their fans would NOT be disappointed with the Gamecube the way they were with the N64.  Nintendo fans are loyal.  *Nothing* can knock out Nintendo.  Nintendo recognized their mistake with the N64 and knew they could make it right again.  They knew they could give the Playstation 2 a run for its money (and looking back, Nintendo did just that).

And so, the release date for the Dreamcast arrived.  With Nintendo and Sony on top of their game, what would happen?  What would happen to Sega?  The Dreamcast would hit the market and... nothing.  No sound.  No noise.  So little was said about the Dreamcast on the release date that it was like Sega had died right then and there.  An eerie silence for a company that gave the world Sonic the Hedgehog.

The Dreamcast failed because there were already more than enough successful gaming consoles on the market in 1999, and people didn't want the Dreamcast to interfere with the superior, soon-to-be-released Sony and Nintendo gaming systems.  Sega also failed because of their long, frustrating history of ripping people off with unsatisfactory video game systems (such as the Sega CD and Sega Saturn).  Sega would fool people into thinking they had something extraordinary in the works... only to end up not supporting it.  They had trouble supporting the video game consoles they created and would often leave people with failed attempts and false hopes.  Sega would always fall asleep on the job.  This would happen time and time again, with Sega hoping the brain-dead masses would buy their average, incomplete gaming consoles.  It's like the people who worked for Sega would always say ""let's start something and not finish it"".

When Sega failed YET AGAIN with the Saturn, people finally couldn't TAKE anymore.  Anyone who was still a Sega fan by that point pretty much lost all hope.  Sega was now the enemy and they had to go.  A gaming console needs a giant selection of games, and unfortunately Sega only understood that ONE TIME in their lackluster history (with the Genesis).  Every other console they released only had a few classics to choose from among a bunch of average games.

In the case of the Dreamcast, Sega tried to support it but it was too late.  Sony had defeated them.  Sony had defeated BOTH the Saturn and the Dreamcast with the overpowering success of the Playstation One.  Hard to believe but it's true: the Playstation One knocked out BOTH the Saturn and the Dreamcast  off the market, making both of those consoles nothing more than a disappointing memory for Sega fans.

In 1999, Sega knew they wouldn't be able to compete with the Playstation 2, so they finally did the right thing in early 2001 by announcing that they would never again make another video game console.  Sega was DONE.  They admitted defeat.  That, my friends, made milions and millions of people very happy.  No more junk on the market.  That announcement was the best thing that could have happened, and if you happened to glance outside that day you would have noticed the sun smiling down on everyone.

That meant no more arrogant Sega promotion.  I used to hate the way Sega would always promote their games by putting down Nintendo and Sony.  Now I can laugh at it.  Sega really thought they could trick people into buying their crappy games by constantly making fun of Nintendo and Sony.  Didn't work.  Nintendo and Sony fans are too smart and considerate for that immature nonsense.  I bet everyone responsible for the Playstation's creation were laughing in piles of money over the ""fly, play thing, fly"" commercial that Sega created in an attempt to make Sony look second-rate.  Ha!  That ugly, gray-colored box destroyed both the Saturn and the Dreamcast, and I hope Sega fans never forget it.

It's almost 2007 and people are STILL talking about the Gamecube and Playstation 2.  Why?  Because they are successful video game consoles.  People will look back and REMEMBER them as successful consoles.  No one remembers that the Dreamcast tried to compete with them at one point.  People forgot the Dreamcast even EXISTED when the year 2002 came around.  Sega's video game consoles immediately became dated and forgettable once companies stopped making games for them.  If Sega had put less energy into putting down the competition and more energy into offering their customers *complete* and enjoyable gaming consoles, maybe they'd still be around today.  As it stands, they deserved to watch Nintendo and Sony destroy them.  Nintendo and Sony didn't have to stoop to dirty tactics to win over fans and the world is now a better place.

With the release of Nintendo's new revolutionary Wii system coming to America this November, along with the Playstation 3, we don't have to laugh at Sega's silly attempt to compete only to end up being the laughing stock of the world.  Goodbye Sega.",2.0

"You know, sitting behind a computer screen, I'm glad no one can see the look of disappointment that appeared on my very face the minute I began playing Tekken 3. I am incredibly disappointed that after reading so many positive reviews claiming Tekken 3 to not only be a significant improvement over the previous two Tekken games, but also tagged ""the ultimate tournament fighter"" that the actual game would turn out to be *so* underwhelming.

Tekken 3 really surprised me. But don't take that as a compliment. I went into Tekken 3 with hardly any experience with fighting games whatsoever. I took a break for 10 years with tournament fighters after all those lousy 2D Mortal Kombat games brought me to tears. Back then I figured ""okay, either I don't like fighting games or maybe I just don't like the Mortal Kombat series"". This was when Mortal Kombat 2 and 3 were popular on the Super NES and Genesis.

A lot can change with a human being in 10 years. We grow older, we decide we want to learn about life and wonder where we came from, and we develop an apprecation for the things we have and the people who are in our lives. To put it simply, we're thankful to be alive and feel good. But in some situations, things can remain EXACTLY the same. All those extreme feelings of hatred returned to me immediately after only 5 minutes with Tekken 3. It was the exact same feeling of hopelessness I encountered with the Mortal Kombat series.

I really have no idea what went wrong. No, not with the game, I mean, what went wrong with ME. Seeing as how I love watching people fight and kick butt on TV shows and movies, I figured it was only natural that the fighting style in the world of video games would appeal to me. Appeal to me a LOT. That was my assumption. But apparently it STILL hasn't happened. Tekken 3 was supposed to help me wash away all the bad memories of playing old Mortal Kombat games and give me a fresh start and hopefully help me develop an appreciation for the ever-popular genre of games known as ""tournament fighters"". Nope. It's really disappointing to me to find out that Tekken 3 is just as bad as the rest of the fighters I've played, and basically the same thing but with improved graphics, for that matter. All fighting games feel the same to me. It doesn't even matter if they are 2D or 3D fighters.

Tekken 3, despite all the positive reviews, does NOT appeal to me whatsoever. The fighting is really clunky, and it seems each fighter delivers very basic and boring moves to each other. It's not interesting or inspiring at ALL to me. It's boring to watch, and even more boring to play. Why is it so much fun when they fight this way in movies but *not* interesting when it's time to do the same thing in a video game? I have no idea. If you want to pull off the really impressive looking moves in Tekken 3, you have to press a bunch of buttons on the controller in a really complicated way in order to complete a move that COULD have been made *much* easier with a very simple and quick sequence of buttons. Strong emphasis on the word ""simple"". Many moves actually require you to press the Circle button, and then jump over to the Square button. How is someone supposed to easily master this? Going from Circle to Square is NOT easy.

You see, for each of the ten characters in the game, they have major power moves that are very important to master because these are the moves that are supposed to cause the most damage to an opponent. However, many of these moves are incredibly difficult and sophisticated to pull off, and this is a *really* bad thing because the company responsible for this game apparently doesn't understand the importance of making a fighting game easy to master for everyone, of all ages. That way, young and old people alike can appreciate the Tekken style.

It really bothers me how ALL of the developers who release fighting games assume the player is automatically completely aware how to play the game. They assume this *every single time* they release a fighting game. Developers assume everyone who plays these kind of games will be able to understand them instantly. We're supposed to be gifted players when it comes to understanding how to successfully pull off any number of lengthy and devestating combos to our opponents. We're supposed to have enough time to press really awkward button combinations on the Playstation controller during a fast-paced and intense fighting match. Not just combos either- regular moves too. We're supposed to have enough patience to continue trying the same fight over and over as we die a million times and the frustration factor increases significantly, and we realize just how IMPOSSIBLE these kind of games are.

Well, I have news for every developer out there: many of us have a really difficult time with games like this. Not everyone who plays fighting games should automatically be expected to be a skilled player. Not all of us hang out at local arcades wasting tons of quarters as we try and perfect our skills. Some of us are, you know, average ""normal"" gamers who just like to have fun. The developers of tournament fighters NEVER could understand this, and years later, they still can't understand what it's like to have fun. We shouldn't have to be a genius to play a fighting game. Not all of us can press the EXACT moves at the EXACT moment and win fights. Maybe one day a tournament fighter will be invented for a gaming console that will be specifically designed to be playable for people who struggle with them. Maybe one day...

Other things I don't like about Tekken 3. Despite having excellent graphics, the music is a bunch of horrible, repetitive techno sounds that hardly make me feel compelled to continue playing the game. Oh, and by the way, even though the graphics are really a notch above the rest, there's absolutely no reason to jump with joy when looking at them. Since the fighting is just as basic and uninspiring as that of, oh I don't know, Killer Instinct (another terrible game) you quickly stop caring about how the game looks. In fact, I'd say the fighting engine is EXACTLY like that old Super Nintendo game Killer Instinct. Extremely uninteresting. When someone throws a punch, it's so boring to watch that you just don't care about it. That's what Tekken 3 is all about. Having a fighting engine that's so boring you don't even care if you win or lose.

I'm disappointed. That's the only thing I can say at the moment. Maybe one day an easy tournament fighter will hit the market where the main purpose of the game is to have the computer opponents move along at a reasonable pace for all the normal people out there who constantly struggle with fighting games. A game that will give people the much needed time and patience to put a move on their opponent. A game where you aren't expected to hurry up just to deliver a simple move. Somehow, despite hundreds of tournament fighters that will eventually hit stores, I doubt this will ever happen. I will never buy another tournament fighter again. Ever.",2.0

"Sonic Adventure is a game that tries to do way too much. There are six characters and only one (sonic) is decent. Most of the game is boring and the rest is usually to broken to be any fun.

The Sonic level's, which should have been the entire game, are plagued with a broken camera (it was on crack, sometimes it would focus inside a wall) and bugs. The boss battles are way to easy, and when you started to pick up speed I felt like the game was playing itself (I tried to fail on the whale level and it was impossible). Plus the sonic story is super short. I didn't really like the other game stories.

In the Tails levels you just replay the same levels as sonic but you can fly. The camera and bugs are even worse here.
The E-102 Gamma levels are a super generic shoot-em up game.
In Knuckles level's you search for gems in a map and is very tiresome.
In Amy's level you pretty much just walk around and hit enemies with a hammer, it gets old very fast.
I save the worst for last Big the cat. His levels are just a fishing mini-game. There's nothing special at all, just a boring fishing game, way to go sonic team.

Most of Sonic adventure you play boring sub characters, and when you do get to play as sonic, it's too short and plagued with too bug to be any fun. This is by far the most overpraised Dreamcast game out there.",2.0
"The game had a few cool features. I liked the fact that you didn't have to remember how to get to different locations, you simply had to visit it once and it was added to a list of destinations for you to pick from.  The other  cool feature was that it was a game...other than that, it felt like  ""Get item, kill monsters, go to next level, get items, return with  items, kill monsters""  The plot (as far as I got, as much as I tried  to force myself to continue onward eventually even my self-loathing has a  peak) was weak, the NPC's dialogue was horrid...I'm old school in that I  actually care about plot in an RPG call me bizzare...if you want a good  RPG, go get Might and Magic, or wait for Diablo 2.

"If you've played Diablo through to the end so many times you begin to see the spiked monstrosity in your dreams, and STILL can't get enough - but really wish it could make use of your new 3D accelerator, this is the game for you! On the other hand, it's far more likely you'll play Darkstone  for a few evenings, uninstall the game and begin having a blast playing  Frisbee with the disc.
-Buy this game because you enjoy playing games  with no particular point, because the only skill you wish to employ is  marathon mouse-clicking, because you just can't get enough pointless quests  for useless objects, or because you are completely indifferent to storyline  'Just point the way to the next monster! '
-DON'T buy this game if you're  looking for a challenging fantasy game with an immersive storyline, or if  you're looking for something new and interesting that will earn itself a  place of honor on your hard drive.
Don't get me wrong, I loved Diablo,  though it shared many of these shortcomings, it had a distinctly 'real'  atmosphere. You felt a certain amount of immersion despite lack of an  involved storyline. Perhaps had Darkstone been released years ago with  Diablo it would have been a different story. Darkstone strikes me as being  'dated', and perhaps incomplete. Did the developer ship it out before it  was complete? Who knows.

"I really love platform games. I guess it is because I love to explore and make my way through those cool-looking worlds. And I have to tell you, Sonic Adventure's worlds look great. This was the very first 128 bit game I had played and boy, was I excited. The game really disappointed and annoyed me however.
After playing through the game a bit, you will start to realize that after the fun action stages, you will begin a squence of boring and annoying cut-scenes (that you can't skip) that will drive you mad. Most of them involve sonic and Robotnik threatening each other, or just characters talking. Also, the characters will pause between almost every sentence. It takes forever for them to finish what they are saying, and you won't really care most of the time. Boring. If you make it through the cut-scenes, then you wander through the adventure stages, looking for the next action stage. Mainly by going to a red hint sphere that will say something like ""Have you searched the entire adventure stage yet?""
When you find another action stage, things will get a bit better, but only for a while. Some of the cool things you can do are snowboard, speed through a futuristic highway. Cool. But, then it is back to boredom and the annoying voices (especially tails.) If you are a real platfor fan, skip this one and get Rayman 2. It may not be super-fast, but it sure isn't boring. And it has better worlds and graphics.",2.0
"I loved Dungeon Keeper, so I bought this product thinking it would be the same addictive game as the original.  Here are some pros and cons of the game.  As you can see, there are more pros than cons, but the one big con, the incompatibility with XP brings it's rating down for me.

Pros:

1.  3D graphics, pretty descent for a 98 game

2.  More characters

3.  Same great game style as original

4.  Easy to pick up

5.  Great sound and voice acting

6.  Sandbox mode! Yea!

7.  Elite creatures and more details for each of your minion

Cons:

1.  It won't run on Windows XP for more than half an hour!!! (I have looked on the internet for a cure, and I installed the Windows compatibility administrator to fix it, but I still can't get it to run for  long.)

2.  You have to patch up the game to enjoy the little time you have

4.  Although 3D is good for it's time, polygon characters are a bit distracting

5.  I'm not sure if it is just my computer, but the entire screen is covered with little black squares, not too many to see what's going on, but still a problem

Overall, I would have given this game a 5 out of 5, but I cannot play long enough to tell you how great it was.  The sandbox mode was awesome and really allows you to relax and build your dungeon with ease.  So if you still have an old machine with Windows 98 or 2000, get it!  Definitely worth your time... If you don't mind the blood, gore, violence, and the shrieks of your torture victims!",2.0

"Other reviews relate this game to a really scary horror movie. I agree. This game scared the living weasel out of me more than any movie could.
But when I go out to buy a game, I'm not really looking for something that's gonna scare me. I want a game that's fun. And SS2 just didn't cut it.
Awkward play control (especially when fighting), lousy attempt at techno music, bad graphics. It's not enough RPG to be an RPG, and at the same time, not enough of an FPS to be an FPS.
Bottom Line: You wanna be scared witless? Read a good book or watch a horror movie. Wanna have a lot of fun? Buy Unreal.",2.0
"I love Civilization.  I bought the original a week after it was out.  I spent entire vacations playing it only.  I upgraded to Civ 2 and played it  even more.  I am absolutely adicted to this game.
Then I bought Test of  Time.
And I was severely disappointed.
The graphics make the game next  to impossible to play.  Plains look like deserts, forests are  indisinguishable, units are blurry, and so on.  The familiar flashing unit  it replaced by four yellow lines around the base of a unit, so it takes  several moments simply to distinguish which unit you are using.  The city  interface is more difficult to use, plain and simple.  The layout and  interface are confusing. The whole game is simply a dark indisinguishable  mess, a far cry from the brightly colored, easily distinguished graphics of  civilization and civ 2.
This game really does have so much promise  conceptually.  Its a shame its next to impossible toplay.  For those of you  who really want the next generation of Civ games, get Activision's  Civilization- Call to Power, a game that blows this piece of @#$%^ out of  the water any day.",2.0
"I've been a long-time fan of the Civ games, but this ""update"" of Civ II left me seriously disappointed.  The graphics leave alot to be desired - they are no better than in the older Civ II product, and in several instances, are worse.
Since Sid Meier left them to join Firaxis, they have done nothing to improve the product at all.  I am happy to see that Sid Meier is doing Civ III (and of course, Alpha Centauri, the follow-up to CivIII, which is also a GREAT game).

"After the extraordinarily good X-wing and TIE Fighter games, Lucasarts decided to continue the series with X-wing vs. TIE Fighter, and expand on the area fans had complained about most in the first two titles -- the lack  of multiplayer.  Unfortunately, this was done at the expense of everything  else.  While if you have a decent internet connection the mutliplayer  features are pretty cool and fun, this game has no plotline, no backstory,  nothing to tie it together...It's just a random series of missions and  melees.  Not only that, but although it's an improvement over the graphics  of the original floppy versions of its predecessors, XvsTIE's graphics  still look kind of grainy and aren't very good.  Added to that was the  horribly embarrasing opening cutscene, and you have a pretty horrible  game.
So LucasArts decided to remedy the problems, and released the  expansion, Balance of Power.  It wasn't worth the effort.  Yes, it enhanced  the graphics a little, yes the cutscenes looked good (even if they weren't  especially cool or innovative), but it just didn't add enough.  While it  claimed to have a plot, and it did, it just didn't feel right.
There  are two campaigns, but they're not linear.  Either you're flying in an  Imperial Task Force sent to wipe out the Rebels, or your flying with the  Rebels to wipe out that task force, so the story can really go either way.  And the levels don't flow from one to the next, it feels like just a bunch  of random encounters, some embarrasingly easy and some disturbingly  difficult. And the campaigns are so short that after you finish both within  a week, there's no sense of accomplishment.  It's just a wasted 20 bucks.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Buy X-Wing Alliance, with it's  superior story, multiplayer, graphics and cutscenes, and save yourself some  time and money.",2.0

"Rebellion is a game that looks good until you play it.  Building powerful fleets and expanding your empire is a lot of fun, but it is made difficult and annoying by the mantinence, the constant distracting micromanagment,  and the fact that the tactcile battles are really miserable.  One of the  most extremely bothersome aspects of the game is the messaging system.  You  are constantly being harrased by notifications of litteraly everything that  happens.  You get a message that you are forced to deal with for everything  you build and everything you do. There is no way to differentiate between  the important occurances and the most obvious and mundane.  You will get a  message telling you that you just fought a battle as soon as you exit the  battle!  That is just one example of the multitude of blemishes in what  could have been a great game.  I would love to see it synthisized with  Homeworld.  I recomend you go buy Starcraft-this game was released too  early and need a lot more work.  Starcraft is a RTS game that's close to  perfection.",2.0

"On the face of things, ""X-Wing Alliance"" has the makings of an extraordinary entry into the Star Wars franchise.  The characters are engaging, with enough backstory given in the accompanying written material  to start a small movie.  Conveniently, there *is* actually a small movie  which opens the game off with a real narrative bang.  It makes one wish  that Lucas himself had taken a page from the game producers when he was  making _The Phantom Menace_.
Unfortunately, after this high point, the  game soon degenerates into endless missions which advance the  plot--painfully slowly.  Oh, there are cool points along the way.  The cut  scenes are interesting, and the sound environment throughout the missions  is superb.  But the in-play graphics engine is fairly ordinary by  LucasArts' own standards.  The missions themselves are endless variations  on the same themes.  And the game's conclusion is less than satisfactory.
But there's another side to the game--multiplayer action--and for this  the game deserves some praise.  As a vehicle for capturing the gaming  possibilities of the Net, ""X-wing"" is worth the purchase price.  There's a large, loyal player base for the whole ""X-wing"" series,  so you'll never be alone on the Net.
Still, there are better options to  get what you want out of a Star Wars game.  ""Rogue Squadron"" is  an infinitely better single-player space game.  And the upcoming  ""Force Commander"" promises to be something of a new standard in  multiplayer action.  By comparison, ""X-wing Alliance"" merely  feels like a solid update to an aging series.",2.0
"With a form-factor nearly identical to the original PlayStation  controllers (but minus the analog sticks of the ""Dual Shock""  controller), this controller's obvious benefit is to owners of  ""Connectix Virtual Game Station"", the PlayStaiton-on-Macintosh  emulator.  It's also handy for arcade-y titles and MacMAME, the emulator of  classic arcade video games.
The one place Gravis makes a change is very  much for the worse -- the four separate directional buttons are replaced by  a single pivoting directional-pad.  As too often happens with designs like  this, the D-pad pushes two switches at once, and ALWAYS comes through as a  diagonal (eg, right + up, when you thought you were just pushing right).  The frequent inability to enter a true right, left, up, or down is annoying  in some games, particularly in navigating the menus of an RPG, and deadly  in others (PSX ""Asteroids"" is unplayable when rotating your ship  sometimes inadvertantly puts you into hyperspace, since that's what  ""up"" does).
Also of note is the fact that this controller works  only with games written to use Apple's ""InputSprockets"".  That's  true of most late 90's / early 2000's games, but not of some earlier titles  (""Descent"", which used to be bundled with Mac Performas, comes to  mind), and it's not clear if Sprockets will be supported in the upcoming  Mac OS X.
That said, driver installation is easy and has been hassle-free  on my two iMacs and my iBook.  USB plug-and-play almost always works  without a snap, though I've found it's better to plug it in once the Finder  is up instead of during the boot cycle.
If you play lots of Mac games  (and by the way... HOW?!), this is better than relying on mouse/keyboard  alone, but the D-pad problems are a major aggrivation.",2.0

"I originally bought this gamepad because it's basically a clone of a playstation controller, and I had an old Gravis 4 button gamepad from 1995 that suited me well and I hope its quality would carry over to this product.  Simply put the directional control on the gamepad pro is not very consistant and gamer friendly.  This might be a great game pad if you must make lots of diagonal moves like if your playing Q*Bert, but if your game depends on many crisply executed non-diagonal moves, like the NES game the Legend of Zelda, forget about this pad!  The pad has a hair trigger when it comes to diagonals.

This is the second crappy pc joystick a purchased.  Come on PC Peripheral makers, start making better joysticks!!

"After getting tired of using the keyboard for playing games, I picked up this gamepad thinking that it may help. I was wrong. After a hour or so of playing and getting more and more frustrated, I finally tossed the controller to the back of my desk.
 The Gravis Gamepad is roughly the same size and shape of the Sony Playstation controller, a design that sits well in your hands. It has four face buttons and another four shoulder buttons, plus the usual start and select buttons. The directional pad though is very different. The d-pad seems to misread where you are actually moving it, instead of moving straight up, it will read it as a diagonal direction.
Pros:
 Similar in size and layout to the Sony Playstation controller.
 USB interface
Cons:
 The directional pad is possibly the worst that I have ever used.
 Feels a bit flimsy
 This gamepad is not too bad if you can overlook the directional pad's flaws. But you might be better off spending your money elsewhere.",2.0

The ""helper"" is annoying and slows down game play. If you want a game that will really agitate you then this game is for you. If not, I would reccommend Roller Coaster Tycoon or The Sims.

So seriously, buy Roller Coaster Tycoon.  it has cool graphics, awesome gameplay, a point (hey, what a concept!), and is SOOOOOOO much more fun.  SimTheme park will make you want to kick your computer because of all the things you can't do that seem so entirely simple (like rotating rides!)!

"I guess you could say that this game was pretty much a dissappointment. I probably would have liked it more if I hadn't already bought Rollercoaster Tycoon (even though I'm not really a fan of that game, it's a LOT better than Sim Theme Park). I felt ripped off when I found out that there were only four theme parks to choose from, which made this a very short lasting game. Another major problem is - you can even build your own rides! Talk about cheap.
Overall I give Sim Theme Park 2 stars, I gave the extra star because I probably would have liked it more if I got it before I got Rollercoaster Tycoon. Actually, this game is pretty good for all ages, it's just leaning a little more towards the younger kids, about I guess 6-12. If you want a game for older gamers, try Rollercoaster Tycoon. (I suggest that you just ditch the thought of buying a game about building amusement parks and get a game like The Sims or somehting).",2.0
"I got this game when it first came out. I am a BIG fan of Roller Coaster Type games, but this game doesn't even come close to a ""cool"" roller coaster game. It was very confusing on how to build a park, but there was a tutorial. The tutorial man that shows you through the park is very annoying. After i turned him, I figured I would try to expirement with the game. The prices for rides are hard to determine, because the money is not like ours. Rides are usually priced 10,000. I thought that was way to high, thinking that it meant 10,000 dollars. I lowered prices, and got a notice saying my prices were too low and should raise prices.  Prices was a big factor in the game which made it confusing. The 3D graphics are great, but the view you get makes it kinda hard to see what you are doing. I did not like the game because it was too hard to play, not fun. Get this game only if you want to expirement, but don't expect this game to become your favorite. Get Roller Coaster Tycon Instead...MUCH Better",2.0
"Sure, its fun its exciting, for about 5 minutes.  You get bored of it fast, not to mention the fact that it crashes 4 out of 5 computers (not fact).  If you want a good simFUN (my word) game get Roller-Coaster Tycoon.  This game is fun for a while but it gets old quick and i say its a very  dissapointing Sim game.",2.0
"If you are looking for a roller coaster game, get Roller Coaster Tycoon, not this. I own both, and RCT is the only one I continue to play. First of all, you have to have a super computer to run this game. It crashed 2  computers before I found one it would work on. Even now, there are little  lines all across the words in the game. Very annoying. The only thing a  little great about this game is that you can ride the coasters you made,  but it's really not as cool as it sounds. This game does not live up to the  standards of previous Sim games at all!  Now get out there and buy RCT!",2.0
"I LOVED Theme Park and Theme Hospital, RCT is the best Sim game around so I had high hopes that Theme Park World (as its called in the UK) would go one step further.
Basically this is a kiddies game. Its NOTHING like  Theme Park and your very limited to what you can do. There are fun rides  and the best part is walking round the park and going on your rides but you  don't have the same amount of control as in RCT.
Its nice to look at  (although I didn't like the 3D style) and you need a good spec machine  otherwise expect jerkovision (or if you build too many rides). Theres only  4 parks/scenarios!  unlike RCT where there are loads plus an add on pack).  My nephew liked taking pictures of the park and emailing them but it has  taken a whole new view point into Sim games. This isn't a true Sim game  -  I think we need a bit of going back to basics here and seeing what makes a  Sim game. Just look at Theme Hospital and RCT. It also loses marks for  having the only online help assistant who is more annoying then the  MS-Office Paperclip one! (Luckily you can turn him off!)
I stopped  playing it after a week. So will true Sim Fans. Bring on another RCT add on  pack!",2.0
"I was really excited when this first came out and could not wait to get it.  ONce it arrived, I was pretty disappointed and frankly, was surprised that it came from the same people as SimCity!
The game is slow and  choppy.  You can only start in one of two ""parks"" before going  on.  I tried, really tried to like it but have not touched it since.
Try  to find someone who has it or a demo to see and play before you pay the  price.",2.0

"In the exact sense of the word, the game cheated me. The suspense built up by the time you finish the third level culminates in one of the most shocking and innovative pieces of plot I have seen to date. What's the  problem? The remainder of the plot is a piteous attempt to bring the  innovation and tie it onto the ""and all was well"" ending.
The  graphics are amazing, although there is way too much green, and you spent  less time in original-looking levels than in the ""normal"" ones.  Nevertheless, from the beginning, they look quite surreal and amazingly  life-like. More than that - they are aesthetic. The main character is  pretty much non-existent, snce he has no lines, and his only role in the  game is to capture monsters. The battle engine offers far too few choices,  since upgrading your character's equipment is nonsense (he rarely enters  actual combat), and you can't equip your monsters. Therefore, the game's  central and only concept is to go through level after level, capturing and  merging monsters. There's nothing more to the game. Oh, yes, there are  several original parts (you earn money by selling the captured monsters),  but they are too few.",2.0

"I had this card for a year or two (I lost track) then suddenly, it deleted itself.  One year's worth of saves, gone like that.

I tried again, more cautious now.  Then, before my eyes, the memory card wiped itself again.  I paid [alot of money] for this thing, and it isn't even a good paperweight anymore.  I expected better.

"Even when this game first came out, it was fairly mediocre.  Let's move on, shall we?  There are many, many games that topple Half Life and Counter Strike released since 1998.
Contrary to what the Amazon editorial had to say about this game, Half Life is not the bloodiest (Soldier of Fortune), is not the smartest (No One Lives Forever), and is not the scariest (System Shock 2 or Clive Barker's Undying).

"First I have to say I had just finished Deus Ex before playing this game.  The graphics are a bit dated by today's standards.  I must say I did like the interaction with the scientists and the security guards, the the voice for the scientists are perfect.  Also the military guys were fun to fight.  I enjoyed fighting them more then I did the monsters.  The game's strongest point was the characters; it was a fun game in that respect.
  As far as gameplay goes, I was not too impressed.  Most of the ""puzzles"" were nothing more then jumping or moving from one place to another in a certain sequence, killing monsters while you were doing so.  Plus the puzzles did not seem to have any reason for being there; they just were, so most of them added nothing to the story.
  I am sure if I had played this game when it came out, I might have liked it more then.  If you are looking for a good game, get Deus Ex for story gameplay and graphics.  Or get Unreal for eye candy.  Either one blows half life away.",2.0

"Looks like a great game, doesn't it? Hundreds of puzzles! Don't let it fool you. All the puzzles involve composing images (some three-dimensional). Most are about as fun as a sliding puzzle. I can't believe this is the best they could come up with. There really are only about 12 puzzle TYPES. The hundreds of puzzles means basically that they have hundreds of images you can play slider puzzle on. It was fun for a few hours, but many of the puzzles are tedious after a while, and when I realized I'd played all the puzzle types, I didn't want to continue.
The puzzles aren't even particularly intellectual, either. Most of them involve matching, like a jigsaw puzzle. How long can that keep someone interested? There's no planning (ala lemmings), there's no figuring out how things work, there's no creativity for you. The images you form are sometimes pretty, but they pale in comparison to the lush interactive environments we are used to from the likes of Riven.",2.0
"The 10 puzzles here get really old really quick.  Most of them are rehashes on the jigsaw puzzle theme or the sliding square puzzle theme.  And that's the best of them- on the bad side there are some really  irritating click fests like ""lens bender"".
As the levels  advance the puzzles simply add more pieces rather than becoming more  interesting or difficult.  Solitare and minesweeper are much better  Microsoft products.  Get a copy of Uncle Henry's playhouse instead (the  puzzles from 11th hour & the 7th guest).  Those puzzles reflect a real  creative effort.",2.0

"I was expecting a lot more from Return to Krondor when I bought it.  While the graphics and sound effects are excellent, I was disappointed with the short running time of the game.  When I opened the CD case and saw that it  was a 2 CD game, I thought, ""Wow! This is going to take me forever to  beat! Great!""  Unfortunately, it did not.  All the space, it seems, is  taken up by the graphics, and the plot got left out.  There are only 4  characters you get to play with, and maybe 2 or 3 towns you get to explore.  I remember 2 side quests, but there may have been another one I'm  forgetting about.
While the concept of the mage and/or the healer making  their own potions is interesting, the player ends up wasting a lot of time  fooling with the equipment, trying to find ingredients for the potions, and  waiting . . . and waiting . . . and waiting for them to brew.
Betrayal at  Krondor, its predecessor, while pretty weak graphically (but consider when  it was made) had and EXCELLENT plot, with many side quests, multiple  characters to play with, many game characters to interact with, and a lot  of locations to visit.
If you're simply looking to sit in front of the  PC for hours on end looking at the pretty colors on the screen, this is the  game to get.  If you'd like a game that is engrossing that you'll be  fighting family members to get on the computer to play, I recommend getting  its granddad, Betrayal at Krondor.",2.0

"First, this is an okay game. Is it fun? For awhile. Is it interesting? Sort of, if you're into world history. Does it captivate you and make you wish to play when you're nowhere near your computer? No.
Let me start with the pros. First, the graphics are good, if you consider how old the title is. The sound is also good, considering its age, though the unit response sounds are very boring. The gameplay is also not bad.
Now the cons. First, storyline, in that there is very little. You get a history lesson before and after every level. Keep in mind, I'm a huge history buff, but these were VERY boring. Example: ""Egypt did this and this and this. They were prosperous."" Yay. Good for Egypt. They could have done a much better job. Maybe introducing some characters, somebody who played a pivotal role in history. Rameses II is menioned, but that's all. The briefings are like reading a history textbook. *Yawn*
The gameplay, though not the worst I've seen, is often tedious. You don't really have a solid enemy, a la Warcraft II. It's more like: ""Today, the Caananites are your friends, and the Babylonians hate you. Oh, but now the Caananites hate you, and the Babylonians don't care anymore."" Once again, yawn. They could explain WHY Egypt and Caanan were suddenly enemies.

"I thoroughly enjoyed the first two Gabriel Knight adventures, which in my opinion rank as the two best computer games of all time.  The third game, however, does not measure up to the quality of the first two, and is  probably the most disappointing game of the year as a result.
The reasons  for my disappointment with this game are many.  First, the storyline is so  complex and dense that's it's very difficult to follow.  Furthermore, the  game is bound to offend those with orthodox Christian beliefs. I don't wish  to give the story away, but Jesus Christ is a character in the game and  those who are more conservative or orthodox in their faith will not  appreciate the way he is presented.
Second, the characters in this game  are much more superficial and uninteresting than in the previous two games.  Essentially, the cast consists of a bunch of stereotypical European  characters (pompous British tourists, snobby Frenchpeople, etc.).  Even  Grace and Gabriel, the two main characters, become caricatures of  themselves in this game (with Tim Curry giving an absolutely horrendous  vocal performance).  I've always felt that the best aspect of the Gabriel  Knight series was the excellent characterization, but that quality is  definitely lacking here.  By the end of the game, I didn't care how the  relationship between Gabriel and Grace turned out because I ceased to care  about either one of them.  Gabriel was just too jokey and Grace was too  annoying and grating.
Third, the graphics of the game are blocky and  uninteresting.  Yes, they're three dimensional, but they lack the beauty,  color and style of the earlier two games.
Lastly, and most importantly,  the game is BORING.  You're stuck in a small, uninteresting town in France  and that's pretty much where you stay the entire game.  The game can be  very difficult, so the pace is very slow and frustrating.
What  especially adds to the boredom factor is a new feature called SIDNEY, which  is the name for Grace's computer.  In order to complete the game, the  player must spend an inordinate amount of time  sitting at a desk and  solving a bunch of puzzles within SIDNEY (as opposed to actually moving  around and interacting with characters, which is infinitely more  enjoyable).  The presence of SIDNEY was a huge mistake that made this game  much less enjoyable than the earlier two.
I hope the fourth installment  of the series is better than this one.  However, this game is so weak that  it may hurt the chances for a sequel.  That would be a tragic shame, since  I do love adventure games, and I would hate to see this franchise die.",2.0
"I loved the first two Gabriel Knight games (""Sins of the Father"" and ""The Beast Within""). They were creepy, well-researched, and had great atmosphere.
Well, ""Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned"" had great potential -- Rennes-le-Chateau and vampires! Neat! But poor gameplay really squandered that potential.
To give you an example of what I mean, one of the puzzles involves getting a vehicle so Gabriel can get from one place to another. A perfectly good motor scooter (I think; it's been a while) is available. But noooooo ... Gabriel refuses to ride something so wussy. He has to have a big motorcycle. So that's the puzzle -- getting the selfish jerk a motorcycle to ride.
Let me get this straight. He's a detective trying to solve a case, but he's going to waste time finding a cooler ride?
That was the point where I threw the game out the window, so I can't comment on how it ends, unfortunately. The voice acting was pretty lame; I don't know who told Tim Curry he could do a New Orleans accent, but he can't.
Now that [the price has dropped], it's worth trying if you're really into Gabriel Knight. Otherwise, there are much better adventure games out there that are also dirt cheap. Try one of them.",2.0
"This game...  Let's not even call it a game, call it a piece of crap!  No,  a piece of crap is too good for this game.  This game seems fun at first,  but gets so irritating!  In a real-time RTS, you can select more than 12  units and don't have to worry about food!  That's the point of a true RTS,  if you want to worry about food, try a simulation.  This excuse for a RTS  has annoying sounds and sound fx!  Every time you select a barracks, it has  that annoying song coming up and that ugly robot girl for Terran.  Although  I don't judge looks that much, that robot girl will even scare a one-eyed  cyclops!  And when you train a firebat, they say something really lame  like, ""Heat it up!""  Not only do the sound fx suck, but the  graphics do too.  The nuke looks like a really, badly designed satellite  and it's smaller than a siege tank!  Nukes are usually designed large, so  they can travel farther, but the nuke in Starcraft is designed to travel  three inches if you're lucky.  The angle of the game is so off also!  It's  too close up.  But about the gameplay...  The gameplay is...  To be  honest, it is really...  Sorry, I can't express myself over this game here,  as kids may be reading.  The storyline is messed up and doesn't make sense  if you really think about it, as evolution can not be true and I know a  three year old kid that can write a better storyline than Blizzard did for  this game.  If you want a real time RTS, try C&C or DR2.",2.0
"Ok, at the risk of being labeled a spoil-sport, I'll say I didn't like Homeworld.  The concept is creative, the design elegant, the graphics impressive, the soundtrack awesome.  The AI is dim-witted; the interface  ridiculous, and the gameplay annoying.
First, I like the idea of a 3d  tactical space game.  Too many of them (notably Star Fleet Command) are  entirely too two dimensional.  Of course, making a space sim 3-d means you  need to be able to look at the ""map"" from different perspectives.  Sadly, you can spend as much time managing the camera as you spend  fighting your forces.  Not a good combination.
Second, the AI is  incredibly dumb.  I didn't have as much problem with avoidable collisions  as one reviewer, but my fighter pilots had this nasty habit of launching  out of the mothership and then parking while the battle raged around them.  I shouldn't have to go tell newly minted units to fight back.  Especially  since I couldn't see them to tell them to get their rears in gear most of  the time.  (That doggone perspective camera-management problem again.)  This is a real drawback when you have a lot of units on the map, which  makes too many demands for micromanagement.
Last, the gameplay is  annoying because I spent as much time trying to figure out how to play as I  spent playing, only to be annoyed with the dumb AI and camera management  tasks once I had the interface down.  Not a good sign
Bottom line:  The  game has potential, but the learning curve is too steep and the minor  problems too distracting to make it fun.  If you want a game that looks  good when you play and has a great soundtrack; and if you don't mind a  steep learning curve or large micromanagement demands, this is it.  If  you're on a limited game-buying budget, don't have a lot of time on your  hands, and would settle for something less technically impressive but more  fun to play, then Homeworld isn't for you.

I might as well  just give up"" I think that kind of defeats the whole purpose of HAVING  FUN. But, the alternative is to ignore the objectives and deal with failing  the goal. Of courese, if you do that, you'll be playing the same 3 levels  over and over again! But overall, it a cool game.",2.0
"If a game doesn't hook me within the first half-hour then I'm just not going to see it through to the end. Homeworld just seemed like Age of Empires: In Space to me and the slow, confusing gameplay really got on my nerves. I know that this game has an Army of fans who will denounce my comments, but I simply could not get into it.

Usually, I like space games and I was hoping that this would have a Star Trek-ish feel to it. I also quite the Wing Commander games and since it only cost me 99p then I thought I might as well give it a go. Call me shallow, but it didn't give me instant satisfaction and uninstalled it after only 45 minutes.",2.0
"Everyone is a right. Homeworld is a game that introduces us to a whole new kind of game.  This is not a regular third-person 3D game. It's not like Myth/MythII where there is a limited rotatation around characters and the action. In Homeworld, you can *fully* rotate around ships and other objects in a real 3D world. Over the top, under the bottom, and spin around ships. It actually takes some getting use to, once you do, it's amazing. Another plus is the amazing graphics of not only the ships and objects, but also the explosions, thrust of the ships engines, ships ""jumping"" into and out of hyperspace, and the other eye candy.
After a couple hours playing this game, you will find yourself in the Homeworld universe; you will feel like you are really there. However, Homeworld is not all eye candy, it has a really good story that will keep you stuck to the game and the plot line.
But why did I give this game only 2 stars? It is probably the buggiest game I have ever played, and many of the most anonying bugs were never fixed. I had a number of times where I would hit a bug where I could not complete the level and had to step to the previous level! I would save the buggy game and reload it, still messed up. Would step back to a previous save on the same level, and it would still be messed up. If you hit these bugs in multiplayer, you were screwed (I remember the ""build bug"" would halt production of large ships). I never did have an enjoyable multiplayer game, since someone in the match would always hit one of the nasty bugs. After that, they would be easy to knock out of the game.

"I bought this game a few days ago and was exited to try it out. It looked pretty impressive from the box. When I found out how it was played with the keyboard I almost gave up right away. There are too many ways to do things  .Every time I move I have to look in the book. Another thing is like other  games I have , like roller coaster tycoon the graphics are way too dark, I  hate that. How can I jump when I can barely see where I am standing or  where I supposed to jump to? This kind of thing can be extremely annoying.  The graphics are very good, but too dark, Im sure it has plenty of puzzles  and things like that people are looking for. I just find the interface  awkward and complicated without having to be. Try it and see for yourself,",2.0
"When this game was first released, I thought it was OK but nothing special.  I have played it to the end level but never managed to beat the 'boss' and therefore did not get to see the ending.  Additionally, I have no intention of replaying this rather moderate adventure game.
PROS:
The voice acting is reasonable,
The graphics are alright considering its time of release,
Indy makes sarcastic comments as in the films,
There are a large range of weapons, though these are nearly all guns.
The game uses bullet time, which makes dodging fire at a range easy!
The controls work properly, though they may be unresponsive at times.
The system requirements are fairly low, so people with out of date hardware should have no problem running this.
There are a wide range of in-game levels and environments, from a canyon to a Russian cruise.
CONS:
The combat is so boring and is linear.  Fistfights are pathetic and Indy's trademark whip is nothing more than code scraps.
Just like Tomb Raider, it takes three to five pistol rounds at close range to subdue a guard!
The guns seem all the same!
The game puzzles are too hard and it will take weeks to beat the game.  I even needed a walkthru at times!
There is a small range of enemies and the AI is such that a guard can see you from behind a wall.
FINAL VERDICT:
This is not true to the wonderful Indy films and is like a clone of Tomb Raider.  Infact the only level I enjoyed (i.e. did not get frustrated with) was the level in which I had to escape from a Russian cell aboard a ship and then defeat a duo of tough, almost invincible soldiers.  Buy this if you like solving puzzles, because it consists of 90% puzzle solving and 5% combat.  (Oh, the other five percent is spent sitting waiting for it to load).  I would strongly recommend Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb INSTEAD of this.",2.0
"We recommend not buying this game, unless you don't mind a buggy version that is not supported by Hasbro and can't be fixed.  Hasbro has decided not to support the game and the patches at the website are no longer available.  Save your money and wait for the next one, hopefully bug free.",2.0
"I wanted to like this game but it just didn't impress me.  It is impossible to figure out where the enemy is and how you should attack them.  Maybe they should have included a tutorial or something.  The graphics were adequate but I just couldn't fly the plane well enough to make the game enjoyable.  Put it this way-if it was this hard to fly one of these, I would have died on my first day in the war.",2.0
"The expansion was outsourced to Sierra Online and the quality from Diablo I was not maintained.
The expansion does not really add anything: monsters seem out of touch, music, ending are nothing compared to the original. Skip this and go straight from Diablo to Diablo II which is another pure marvel.",2.0
"On paper Hellfire seems like a great idea. Take a really good game, add a couple additional levels, quests, items and monsters, put in a couple of new classes, and bam: instant winner.

Sadly that doesn't pan out in practice. Part of it is that the Hellfire design feels largely uninspired and lacks the cohesiveness, balance and ingenuity that went into original Diablo. In fact there are only two really good features in Hellfire. The first is the ""Jog"" toggle that allows your character to run in Tristram. Too bad it doesn't function in the dungeons. The second is the ""Search"" spell that helps you locate items on the ground. Unfortunately it's a spell, so you have to spend mana on it. Blizzard rolled up both these features in Diablo II in much improved form. As it stands they end up not benefiting Diablo very much.

The rest of the additions are just mediocre or worse. The new character class is fun, but kinda unbalanced, and doesn't really add a lot of depth. Lots of stuff feels tacked on and has an inconsistent art style that doesn't match Diablo's polish. There aren't really a lot of new quests. One (of the two) new area is downright annoying. Some of the best features can only be enabled by editing a special file outside the game.

The worst part of Hellfire is that playing it means making a tradeoff. It is not a seamless expansion to Diablo - it's almost like a separate game. Your Diablo characters aren't portable between Hellfire and the original game, so you have to roll new ones. And while Diablo went on to gain five more patches after Hellfire's release - Sierra only patched their game once... so Hellfire players have to contend with bugs long-fixed in Diablo. In addition to those bugs, Hellfire brings a set of its own, which never got resolved. Hellfire players can't (without hacking the game) play multiplayer. This expansion is not playable on Battle.net. The music in new areas is lacking, and because it isn't read from the CD, the game glitches whenever an item is picked up. The drop system is bugged out the wazoo, to where finding some of the new unique items is actually impossible.

I would really recommend this one only to die-hard Diablo fans. Those without it are not missing out on anything. Sierra tried to pull it off but they just couldn't match that Blizzard standard set by the original game, and the new features aren't worth fighting the bugs and irritants brought on by this expansion.",2.0
"I believe I paid ten dollars for this controller so I could use it on my emulator. The thing is terrible. The D-Pad is clunky, and impossible to move diagonally on. The four buttons aren't any better either. Honestly, the only thing they didn't screw up is the start and select buttons. This is a horrible purchase. You'd be better off just going to a Game-X-Change and finding an old, real controller. I paid half of what I paid for this, and it's twice as good.",2.0
"This controller is an okay replacement for the original SNES controllers, but not as good. The reason why this controller is not as good as the original SNES controllers is because the buttons are not as sensitive to button presses unlike the original which have very sensitive buttons; the buttons after using them for several months or a little bit more start to sink down more inside the controller because the springs are not as strong as the ones in the original controllers are. In addition, they are made cheaper than the original controllers and are not as durable, so they will not last as long. My recommendation is to not buy these controllers and get refurbished original Super Nintendo controllers on (...) or the exact replica version because they use the same exact materials to make those controllers as Nintendo does for their controllers. The only difference is the exact replica's do not have the Nintendo logo on it. I got two refurbished original Super Nintendo controllers from that website and they work excellently and they will last for many years. And another thing about the New Port controllers, the first time you use them, the D-Pad buttons are rather stiff and eventually lossen up after using them for a while and become easier to use. A last warning about the controller, the down function on the D-Pad does not work very good, unlike on the original Super Nintendo cotrollers, the down function on the D-Pad works excellently.",2.0

"Meh, this game is more of an Open-Sandbox to build cities without a real clear objective. Multiplayer can be like ""Starcraft"" but more focused towards City objectives vs. actual fighting (though you can do that).

In campaign mode, the story-line is very condescending and degrading to the player. The Corporatist perspective is to treat you like trash, i.e. calling you names like ""idiot! moron!, etc."" vs. actually teaching you what you need to know in order to proceed to the next level. There was no real clear indicator regarding how to build or obtain a mission objective unless you have some previous city building experience.

Anyway I do kind of miss the old school 15th century style

Anyway I would really only recommend this for Anno allums that have to have an Anno fix.",3.0
"Awesome game, but all the DRM issues really have made some issues with the game. You have to have it attached to a uplay account in order to even play the game... so, similar to Diablo 3 you're forced to have internet access in order to launch the game, even if you want to play single player.

At one point I've also had an issue come up that said the game was ""incompatible with my current OS""... if you run into the same problem, launch the game as Administrator and it will work fine. Also... THE GAME CODE WILL NOT ACTIVATE ON STEAM. I got this on amazon to try it out and if I didn't like it I wanted to sell it, but having it required to attach to your uplay account basically didn't allow me to do that. So I'm stuck with a game with insane costs for any DLC...

If you like sim city style games, I'd pick this one up... but wait for a steam sale and get it through there so that the dlc's are also at a reasonable cost as well.",3.0

"This really is a step up from Dirt 2. Better graphics, cars seem a little more responsive. Overall it was worth almost the money, but of course, I wait till the games are ""old hat"" and buy them cheaper.

The really bad thing is having to buy tracks and cars. Nope, I'm never going to do that and I think it is a crappy deal, but that's life. If I had known about the lack of tracks and cars, I would have passed. There's no real reason to finish the game, as it's just more of the same without paying a bunch of money to get all the ""extras"", that should have been in the game to begin with.",3.0
I Had been looking forward to this game for a long time. I own all the previous versions and all still are good games. I was somewhat disappointed in this version. I expected allot better game play and graphics. The game play is somewhat boring compared to previous versions as well as the graphics. DIRT 2's graphics are much better as far as detail in the particles such as dust and rocks during game play.,3.0
"I greatly enjoyed Dirt 2 and picked up Dirt 3 for more dirt racing action (truck racing is my favorite).  I actually found this rather duller than Dirt 2, less ""game-like,"" the locations a bit monotonous, and way too much emphasis on gymkhana, when what I really want is land rush, rally, rally cross.

Requiring gymkhana to advance past the first level is annoying, to say the least, and may be a deal breaker for some people.

However, it is possible to modify the database file to completely unlock the game. In fact, you can modify the database to unlock all the cars, all the races. Just google ""dirt 3 unlock mod.""  The file is a replacement for ""database.bin"" - so all you have to do is search for that file, save the original file as backup and replace it with the unlocked database. (And, after you play through to the next level, you can put the original file back.)  It's a fairly easy fix even for the so-so computer literate.

The upshot though is, Codemasters could have included an option to bypass gymkhana for those just wanting rally and not screech-braking in a parking lot.

This game did work without a problem on Win 7 64-bit with a Thrustmaster Ferrari GT Experience wheel.",3.0
"This is a pretty fun game, but you have to buy most of the cars and tracks from the online store. The game claims to provide so much more content, however, the ""scam"" is, that you don't get that content with the game. You need to buy it. If you win races you will get a message saying ""YAY! You can now purchase your new car from the online store!!!""

OMG REALLY??? I CAN SPEND MORE MONEY ON A GAME I ALREADY PAID FOR??? NO WAI!!!!

But overall, if you don't mind playing with the same default cars all the time, it's a pretty fun game. I really only play online mode, which allows you to race against other people. The computer on this game is WAY to easy so single player isn't any fun. You could drive backwords and still beat the computer.",3.0
"Although this game is an amazing real to life representation of rally racing their choice in not hosting the log in servers was a bad idea. i loved this game and played it everyday until Microsoft live f'ed up and my account was deleted. sad to say i cant play this game anymore, due to the fact that Microsoft's support may as well only apply to people living on the moon because it is that bad. codemaster should have choose somebody else to host their servers, that is why my overall rating is at 3 stars. The game is great, support is non existent. so now i will have to buy a completely new game thanks to Microsoft.",3.0
This is a really fun game to play but I hate the new Microsoft Live formats being added to the newer games. You can't save game progress or a profile unless you are online & have a Microsoft Live account. When I purchase a game I should have the ability (and rights!!!) to save game progress & profiles without having to be online & tracked by Microsoft. There's also all kinds of track & car add-ons that you are encouraged to buy for additional money. Overall a rip off in my opinion. No more Microsoft Live games for me!!!,3.0
"I got this version instead of the PS3 version, which turned out to be a mistake. Console versions of games look 95 percent as good as their PC versions, but you do not have to deal with driver issues and the numerous things that can go wrong with windows. First off the installation takes about 30 minutes, which is ridiculous. I have never had a game take this long to load, Shift 2 took about 20 minutes which seemed too long also. Next many of the latest games for PC are forcing you to have an internet connection in order to install the game, regardless of whether you want to play only offline single player games. Shift 2 unleashed is also like this, so be forewarned. Internet requirements are not prominently displayed on the boxes. The game pushes you, but does not require you to, sign up for a Games For Windows Live account, which is required to get the game patches and updates. More time wasted signing up for that. Finally after about one hour the game was up and running , but the menu screen text had red blocky borders, and the sun in the game screens was ugly pink red, with red reflections on the car and everywhere. So more time spent googling to find a solution to this. I had to download a hot-fix driver update for my AMD videocard driver, which solved that red text and sun problem. Finally after nearly 2 hours I was able to play the game, which is perhaps the prettiest racing game I have ever played. Magnificent graphics, and fun excellent gameplay. Good forcefeedback effects with a steering wheel, and excellent sense of speed and immersion, makes this a top notch sim racer with just a hint of arcade feeling to it.
I was really, finally enjoying the game , when suddenly about 30 minutes in to a race the game suddenly crashed. No error message or anything, it just hung up and crashed to desktop, under windows 7. I later tried it with Windows XP on the same machine, and it crashed less frequently, usually only when exiting the game, but random crashes really kill the fun of a racing game, since it might not crash during an entire 20 lap race or it might crash on the 2nd lap.
It is a great game when it works, and if you are lucky enough to have a machine that it runs stably on then by all means get this game. But hang on to your receipt just in case.
I am tired of fiddling with my computer trying to find a totally reliable setup for this game, so I think I am going to buy a copy for my PS3, which has never crashed, in over 3 years of game playing. I have been buying the top notch PC versions of videogames and spent thousands of dollars over the years on faster videocards and cpu's , but I have finally grown tired of fiddling with incompatibilities of hardware and software, and now game publishers demanding that you have an internet connection as well as providing a long serial number, utilizing gigabytes of harddrive space, 30 minute or longer installation times ( it takes less time to install Windows 7 ) , and requiring you to sign up for their online service and game store, and still you have to put that stupid little DVD in your computer everytime you want to play a simple game to relax. I am pretty much done with PC gaming, since the consoles are so much less hassle, and they have "" good enough "" graphics that the diminishing returns of costly higher resolution better antialiased higher framerate graphics is not worth it. When the PS4 and Xbox 720 come out, I think the law of diminishing returns will be even more evident.",3.0

There is a noticeable difference in my Netflix streaming though. So, for six bucks this is what I got, and I'm happy with it, but not over the moon.",3.0
"First, this is a low cost cable, and so is built.  The RCA ports are easy to get loose and slip out of the tv connector.  Also is not well shielded , you will have to route the cable away from RF interference or power lines, or you'll notice flickering video.  Overall in a simple connection it should work fine, but in a entertainment system where are some other devices, as home theater, networking equipment, etc, the cable will pick a LOT of Noise.  Also it should be a permanent installation, since it is not sturdy enough to resist multiple pulling in / out of the connectors.  Otherwise it will do the trick, and having your WII in 480P will not make it a HD console, that the wii is not capable of, but picture will be clearer, sharper (I don't know, but in my 40"" LCD image out of the standard cable seems a bit blurry)and with more defined colors",3.0

After I recieved it, the cd included said that the N64 function does not work on all systems. I would advise looking into it before purchase to ensure that it works for your system.",3.0
"The PS2 portion works completely fine. The N64 portion doesn't, as every button spazes out and makes it impossible to bind or use anything.",3.0
"The N64 port, which i bought it for, doesnt work. The playstation port works great with ps1 or two and if you really want to play your N64 games, just use a dualshock. you can use the analogs for the joystick and C-buttons. Because the 64 port doesnt work, i cant give it more than three stars. like i said, you can play N64 games with a dualshock which is weird at first, but once you get used to it, its all good.

PS - this works with Project 64 (comes up as 12 button joy stick), Fceux (nintendo emulator) and Snes 9x, may work with others, not too sure.",3.0
"What I have:

PC with Windows Vista 64 bit edition
2 original N64 controllers
1 Dualshock 2 (actually it's a knock off)

N64 controllers: Both N64 controllers spaz out. The joystick appears to twitch and the yellow buttons appear to flicker when viewing the inputs on the controller control panel program. oddly enough, one controller seems less crazy than the other. The controllers seem to calm down a bit and act more normal when the Dualshock controller is plugged in.

Dualshock 2: It works just fine. The central dead zone is a big, but all buttons and joysticks work",3.0
"At first the adapter didn't work when I plugged in an n64 controller.  I found out it only works with like 50% of controllers, so I traded with some friends and it works beautifully now.  everywhere I go with my laptop I also have a 4-player N64 console with an unlimited amount of games.  if you hook up your laptop to your TV you can get a realistic n64 experience, not to mention ps1 and ps2.  It does take some time configuring, but once it works its great.  Also, they break kinda easily, but they're $7.00 so I'm not complaining.\

Edit: There is a much better adapter that allows users to connect 2 controllers for the same price, and it is MUCH more reliable!",3.0
"We were able to get the product to work, as per the instructions previously posted on this review page; it took some finagling. Unfortunately, for the N64 controller, to the best of my knowledge, the controller only allows for up, down, left, and right on the analog stick with this product, though the original pupose of the analog stick was meant to allow you to go diagonal as well. This can make playing some games difficult.",3.0
"This adapter does work as advertised with only a few minor flaws. PS2 controller port works absolutely fine...the only problem is with the N64 port. Apparently some users have reporter the buttons going crazy whenever the configuration is switched to use the N64 port. This is true...IF you don't plug in a PS2 controller at the same time. Apparently there is a design flaw that causes the signal to mess up without a PS2 controller in the port, so that can be problematic if you don't own one. Not to mention it can be slightly annoying to calibrate. At least with my controller, sometimes pushing the analog stick in a direction doesn't always make it go all the way, so it takes some fiddling. If you do what I described it will work fine, and it's fully compatible with Win 7.

Because of the above flaws, however, I can't rate it more than 3 stars. If you have both controllers and need an adapter for both, then this will suit you fine. However, if you want just an adapter for the N64 only I would recommend getting something specifically for that purpose over this dual adapter.",3.0
"Adapter would not work with my red official controller. After a little bit of convincing, it now works great with my yellow official controller. If you plan on purchasing this, make sure you have at least a couple working controllers hanging around in case one of them doesn't work with this device. Also make sure you have a good grip on troubleshooting. There is an undocumented switch on the device and no manual. There are several drivers on the CD included but no solid indication of which one to use.",3.0
Bought this for my son.  He advises a little disappointed in the ships graphics.  Ships are missing parts.  He does enjoy the game just wish the ships were more accurate in graphics.,3.0
"This game is a slight Rip off.  I must admit the Speed Boat is cool as the Jetskies, Hovercraft and other fast (manuerable) watercraft to speed around on that is a blast...but I really am not so happy with it and this is exactly why, the missions hard to understand, very abstract and disorienting, if not done in the right sequence with multiple boats the mission remains incomplete, and they give you a list of boats with no clue as to what sequence to follow, the Tugs handle like (CRAP) as with the Cruise Liner, freighter and other larger vessels, yes I get that the game is aimed toward realism and respect that they handle that way in real life but lets be real, when I have a half a mile to spare and Im full reverse thrusting the Rotterdam Ferry and using full rudder and bow thrusters and I still slam into a boat, dock at (three) knots and sink and fail the mission that is just not acceptable.  I waisted a whole month trying to figure this game out and my whole morning going across the seas only to crash the Russian Tug into the Agile Solutions Freighter that I tried to tow from getting stranded on a dock from a game glitch...I am so glad that it was free off my Amazon gift card that I recieved for Christmas.  Because if I spent my hard earned money on this game I have to say I would have been quite upset.  Time to wipe this hog off my valuable hard drive and start over. If you want a good simulation game I highly recommend Flight Sim 2004 or FSX which is excellent and does the job. The seaplane is a blast and there are many downloads for the programs including a hovercraft from Hama Mitsuya that atleast has a spray effect where as the one in Ship simulaotr does not:-(( It is also equally as realistic:-))  I think I know what programs I highly value from now on. To wrap it up in a sumary Ship Sim '08 is a good game just not great since half of its ships and missions are unrealistic, Just my opinion.",3.0
"It was a game that my son wanted but there is not any directions or help in how to use the different aspects of it. He isn't able to find out how to do certain parts of it because there aren't any help pages, etc.",3.0
"My son wasn't to impressed with this game. Kind of boring and very hard to understand what the folks are saying. However, the product arrived in a timely manner and was pleased about how the transaction was handled.",3.0
"It worked really well for a while, but then it fell apart and it became useless",3.0
"These help especially because playing countless hours of FPS games, my hands tend to sweat. Unfortunately, I cannot get over the weird rubbery smell. I've tried washing it with soap and water, but the smell just really bothers me. If you don't mind a rubbery smell as all, then I would recommend this. But that smell really sticks to my hands.",3.0
"Great protection and grip for a while, but like a latex glove, it stretches out after a little time.  For the price, a great deal.",3.0
"I bought this to slow some of the wear on the finish on my controller. when installing it, i accidently ripped part of it. :-/",3.0

"Pros: Works well, easy to put on.
Cons: joined seam isn't cut well, so it may require some trimming to feel right. Didn't bother me enough to stop me from buying a second one.",3.0
"It's a product worth your buck, but don't expect too much. The edges are uncomfortably rough where the edges line. The grips not THAT awesome. Also, the skin around the triggers aren't protected, so it looks ripped. It was worth the few bucks though. Good service and satisfaction guaranteed in my review.",3.0
advertised as more durable then they appear in person..but they are tight fitting and completely more protection..then say..Nothing and they do look more style-ish then plain..,3.0
"This cover fits well and improves grip a lot especially for long sessions ans sweaty hands. However...tis whole perimeter has a rib around from the mold. This is downright uncomfortable. I took a light grade of sandpaper to it and after 10 minutes, wore it down. They need to reverse mold this to get rid of the rib.",3.0
"the only thing it didn't like about it, was that it was so thin i don't think it would protect your controllers if you were to drop them. But it sure gave it a nice feel to my controllers and it protects it from scratches and it doesnt get all greezy. i like to eat chips while playing and my controllers would get slippery",3.0
"This is a nice silicone skin for the controller. Its thicker than what I had imagined so putting it on and taking it off won't be a skilled task. Now I do have the ""Grip It"" thumb grips so I did have to trim around the joystick area. It does fit kinda loose on the controller which to some might not be noticeable.",3.0
"I was slightly dissapointed in the packaging this came in - just in a clear bag.  No markings on it at all.  I know I'll get the ""What is this?""  reaction on it when my husband opens it for Christmas.",3.0
nice cheap made cover it doesnt fot very tight but it does the job if you want to extend the life of your controller this is it,3.0
"this memory card works great....but is hard for any ps2 to read easily... some times you have to reinsert it a few times until it recognizes it... makes me scared that it could randomly erase the many many game saves i have transferred to it, so i only safely use it as storage in the memory card mainly.",3.0
"It's fine for saving games, but this one doesn't have a MAGICGATE logo anywhere in this product or memory card itself.

good,3.0
yes,3.0
didn't have enough storage for one game,3.0
"I really like how large of a memory space it has but I had to wiggle it in the slot a little to get it to work. It wasn't recognizing it and was then later saying no memory. I took it out, inserted it again and then it recognized it again an said all the space was available this time. Successfully copied some data to it. I will do what was suggested in another review and loosen the screws and see if that helps at all.",3.0
"Works fairly well but won't save some games.
Rather dissatisfied at that aspect I thought I had found the only card would need",3.0
the seller shipped fast. the item was packaged great...again the seller shipped fast. the item was packaged great. It says it's 128MB but it reads as 64MB and it worked. it reads fast with no delays. if you want a large memory card for your PS2 then this 64mb card is way better than the standard 8mb card by Sony.,3.0
Attention! It's not a memory card by sony as the product description. what i got is a ps2 compatible card by hydra. If you are selling a compatible card. you should make it clear in your description.,3.0
"not compatible with my PS2
i like becuase it is a bigger memory than the usual PS2 memory card
i am not sure if i would recommend this, but this does not mean that im not recommend it
i would gladly recommend it, hope you have a better luck than i",3.0
It's a good product worked well. Didn't have any issues with it yet. I will see what happens later. So far so good,3.0
The price and item met my expectation but it was almost a week late coming in. Other than that it was okay!,3.0
Does not work with all games.  Some games have not read and instead opted for my 8 bit card. ok,3.0
"well it is good. but some games do not recognize it as a ps2 memory card. unfortunately, i bought the memory card for those games...",3.0
I use this for two games and I am sure there is plenty of storage to put on it but glad to have it,3.0
"Don't screw with the card by opening the screws or anything else, the ps2 just can fail indexing the card. There are no hardware issues with it it is just freaking huge. My proof of this is that i can work just fine on the menu with screws opened but  if your game tries to re-index it it can fail. It may seem tedious but just restart the system if it doesn't work at first or unplug and plug it back in. It is so much more card than I could ever dream of using I wish I had just got a 64MB so there wouldn't be index issues.",3.0
It's a pity that this became the standard for saving games for so long. Internal hard drives would have been a wonderful addition to many of the systems that came after the SNES.,3.0
"It's capacity is amazing to any Playstation 2 player but it does have one problem with it. It doesn't always connect. Sure you can take it out and put it back or move it slowly to the sides until it shows up on the screen. Normally this wouldn't bother me because I've dealt with this before, but this seems to happen every time I first plug it in. Overall, it's a pretty good piece.",3.0
We bought 2 Playstation 2 memory cards at 128mb and one was not formatted for any of our playstation 2's to save any games for us. I am willing to send that one back for another on. I have the orginial PS2 and slim PS2.,3.0
This memory card doesn't seem to work on Ratchet: Deadlocked but works on others. The  formatting is not consistent with a Playstation 2 8MB memory card.,3.0
"As others have stated, this memory card is dubious at best. It does work, though formatting it with the system it only displayed having 7999k free. This of course is unacceptable. I formatted it with the FMCB installer app and the first time it failed. The second time it formatted out to be 64 megs. I used Memory Card Annihilator 2.0 to wipe it and it still showed as 64 megs. I decided to install FMCB on it and it failed to install so I decided to format it one more time and finally I was able to use the full 128 megabytes and install FMCB.

I've heard reports that FMCB and other homebrew apps don't work with it, but in my experiences Open Loader and Free MC Boot seem to work fine. It took repeated efforts but in the end I have a working 128 mb memory card with more than enough room for FMCB, OPL, and all of my game saves.

Can I give this card a recommendation for most people? No. I cannot. If you aren't familiar with homebrew apps there is a chance this card might only show up as an 8 meg or 64 meg card. When it works it seems to work fine, but there is no way to know how stable it is going to be over long term.

If you like playing with homebrew and want a good amount of space to work with, then I say this card is worth the money if you can get it to work at full capacity. If you don't want to take the risk I recommend either the official Sony 8 megabyte or one of the other third party cards.

On a final note, the product description says it's an official Sony product, but it isn't. Whoever the manufacturer is, they went through some effort to make the card appear official, but it is very obviously a clone.

Buyer beware.",3.0
"Mine does work properly most of the time, but some older games look specifically for an 8MB, and one time out of ten my PS2s won't read it. It may be that mine is defective, but it does work the majority of the time.",3.0
"i haven't use it yet, but i hope it work good so i can be totally satisfied :) :) :)",3.0
"When this works, it works fine. However, I am using one of the original models of PS2, and it can be pretty finicky at times. essentially, the contacts don't align quite right. It works properly about half the time, the other half I have to fiddle with it a bit. Just wedge a slim piece of cardboard or something underneath it, that generally gives it the necessary leverage for full contact.",3.0
"I tried to fill this thing up but it stopped at 64 even though it said it had 128, the PS2 formatted it and it then said it only really had 64MB but it cost the same as a 64MB card so 3 stars Ha!",3.0
"It'll work fine for all my Final Fantasy PS2 games, but for Kingdom Hearts II forget it. It won't work period. Even tho I have like 128,621KB Free it just won't save. So I think I'll look for a memory card BY sony or at least MADE by Sony...",3.0
"When I bought this memory card, I was thrilled by the amount of memory space it had for the PS2.  I figured I wasn't going to need any other memory card for it, but come to find out, it doesn't work with my Kingdom Hearts 2 game.  It works fine with the others so far, but not with that one.  So if you're going to play any of the Kingdom Hearts games, I'd recommend looking for a different memory card, this one's not a good idea.",3.0

"Don't expect the bells and whistles that you find in the Playstation or Xbox versions of Dance Dance Revolution.  This version offers wonderful ease and cost, since all you need is a TV.  But it does not save high scores, have different versions of play, or much of anything else.  It follows the basic DDR premise of using your feet to touch arrows on the mat that correspond to the arrows scrolling across the screen.  At the end of play you see a score and how many hits and misses you had, but that's about it.  If you have a game system, get the ""real version.""  If not, this might or might not be a satisfying substitute. It might depend on whether or not you've been spoiled by the more advanced versions.  But it sure would be easy to pack and take along when travelling with kids, perhaps for a holiday trip to Grandma's house where there are no video game systems.",3.0
"It's no Sony Playstation game but it does the trick.  If you're a professional and have high expectations about the graphics, don't buy this game.  If you have little ones (age 6-10), or your just starting out, and you have average expectations, you'll have fun.  You can't expect a whole lot for the price you're paying.  My kids like it.  You have to put it away and break it out every now & then to keep it exciting.  I think that's true with just about anything in life, right?",3.0
"We bought this for Christmas for our three kids and they have fun playing with it, but it's hard!  We haven't found one song that is slow enough for beginners!  Even the beginner songs are too fast!  We bought it so the kids could get some extra exercise over the winter and it has served that purpose!

"If you've never played a Dance Dance Revolution game before, then this pad is perfectly OK.  Go ahead and get it.

but.....

If you've played Dance Dance Revolution before, and you're expecting the classic songs that are listed as being available, and semi-decent graphics, you will be HORRIBLY disappointed (as I was) with this game.

The music is in MIDI format;  it's tones.  That's it.  Follow the sun, If you were here, all those classic Dance Dance Revolution songs are nothing but computer bleeps and blips that make a horrible attempt at sounding like the originals.

But if you've never played DDR before, then you'll never know the difference.",3.0
I just recently purchased one of these dance pads. Its not that bad really. I mean what can you expect for 20 bucks...lol...its lil old in graphics..it reminds me of atari days...and the music isn't the greatest but its not the most horrible thing i have ever bought. I wanted to get this try it out and then see if i was really ready to buy the real deal spending about 50-70 bucks. I like it so far...its really fun.,3.0
its good but be VERY carefull with it don't drop it from more than 5 feet or something will snap off don't step on it either. mines broken becase for some reson unknown the usb conector jub snapped very suddenly. BE WARE,3.0
Well I did buy the game and if you are going to work out its a fun thing to did but if you have a x box are a Playstation  it will be good to buy it for that. But the TV is not that bad but if I had a xbox or a playstation I wood have get it for one of them but if you are trying to loss weight and do not have one of the game system the TV is good but there is something I did not like about it  The graphics are bad and no No words in the songs. But like I said it good for working out. and that way I will give it 3 star.,3.0
"I ordered this for my daughter who just recently discovered DDR at the arcade.  We like the idea of two people being able to play at once as well as the fact that your score is reflected on the screen.  The competition adds to the fun. Plus I like the idea of not having to purchase PSP2 or some other console.

What I don't care for is the sound and the graphics.  They have got to be from the 1970's.  The music is done by some old computer sound - not guitar, drums, etc.  It has kind of an eerie sound to it like the OLD OLD science fiction movies.

My daughter uses it as a form of exercise and is looking forward to having friends over for some fun and competion.  So I will keep it until I find something better.",3.0

"I initially received a unit that wasn't working. Since I'm handy with electronics, I decided to open the case up and check out the problem. Everyone who is having connection problems is probably due to poor soldering of the components onto the board. It's an easy fix if you know how to solder. I contacted the seller who sent me two replacements, one of which didn't work. So now I have one working unit and two shoddy ones. Hence the three stars.",3.0
"Buyer beware.
It's a cheap-o piece of junk. Keep in mind that I own a few of these and EVERY one had shoddy soldering. In fact several electrical joints never even received any solder. I had to finish the job myself with my own equipment. Once I did that, they became a great addition to my video game collection. Only worth the price if you don't mind a little project.",3.0
"It works, but it is definitely not a high quality item. It looked absolutely terrible when I first set up my PS2. Had to take it apart and realign all the insides and glue together the broken parts of the case.

I was looking for a product to hook all my gaming systems into so I won't have to move the TV every time. This was not the answer. Every thing is loose so the picture will not stay on the screen. I tried many different ways to have the things work but most of the time it does not.,3.0

"This was exactly what I needed.
I have a Wii and PS3 and I needed to switch between them.
Well this does just that.

The connectors are well labeled, and gave a tight fit.
The switch is BIG and well marked and I really like that (so does my 6 yr old).
Works great.

The 'complaint' is not against the product at all - I'd buy another.
The thing to consider is the placement.  I would have liked if all the connections were on one side - or maybe the OUT to TV was at the bottom.  When this is on the shelf all the wires are visible and not easy to hide behind something.",3.0
"The switch works fine..for now...and I have no problem switching between my PS3, XBox, and Wii.  However, the AV cord that came *with* the switch was complete crap.

I love the systems I currently have because I enjoy the games I do have for them.

I had ordered other brands off of amazon before but there was always an issue with the game selector switch box. So I was relieved that this one actually worked.  Although the packaging was the only down fall for this item, as I have received the item outside of the packaging in the box it arrived in.",3.0
"$1.88? Really? Well what do we really expect for such a low price? I certainly didn't expect much and that's pretty much what I got. In fact, it didn't even work when I gave it a try. But, like at least one other reviewer, I disassembled the unit and found at least 3 pins not soldered at all and one that had failed. If you know how to solder, it's a piece of cake. If you don't, consider this a 1 star review.

I had it apart, fixed and fully functioning in less than 10 minutes. It was actually kind of fun, but if you expect it to work right out of the package, you may be in for a surprise. Otherwise it's exactly what I was looking for in a simple, cheap switch for a newly installed Wii.

Proceed with caution!",3.0
"I bought this item because my kids have a WII console attached to the TV in the rec room. Before the WII, we watched movies in the rec room as well. needless to say, that became an issue as the cables needed to be changed around every time we wanted to watch movies or they wanted to play WII. The switch is not as sturdily built as it appears to be and in the case of the one I received; one of the sides does not work! That's ok since we only needed 2 inputs to be working any way.",3.0
I used this item in order to switch from a signal from one Tivo to anouther into my DVD recorder and then out to my surround sound system. The only problem that I experenced in doing this is a slight delay in the audio signal which gave you a slight echo in the sound. I was able to eliminate that by muteing the TV sound and still get the surround sound however.,3.0
Nice little AV selector for those of us still stuck in the composite era. Does everything as promised. Possible bad/loose connections have on occasion made me get up and jiggle the switch to fix the picture (It gets odd lines across it). Easy fix though. Can't wait to get a new HDMI one with a remote on it.,3.0
"One of them broke immediately, the other one still works, I guess they're just too cheap and there's no telling if it will actually work longer than two days.",3.0
"They work fine but i feel like they have a little lag to the controls when i use it on my controller. And out of the two, one is already ripping. They get the job done but i don't think they will last very long.",3.0
After buying this product one of the extension cables stopped working a few days after use. I ended up with only one extension cable that was reliable. I gave the product 3 stars because they were so cheap that I can't really complain.,3.0
Received a total of 2 extensions work great  Nintendo brand and generic brands. Only complaint is one of them broke at one end. The cable slid right out of the socket and I had to throw it out. other than that great product. I'm hoping this was just a fluke.,3.0
well atleast one of them worked what else could you want for the price. the other one works too just not all the time,3.0
"I have used these for months.

out of no where no matter what happened it always looked like the joystick always was stuck going right. no matter what game or what controller i used, it always was going right. The other one is fine though.

If you find one that is better quality definitely go with that one instead of these.

Cool idea though...",3.0
"These cords aren't very high quality, but you get what you pay for. I just hope they hold up for a while. Bare wire appeared at the base of the plug-in a couple days after installed.",3.0
"The extension cables work great, you can connect a few if you want, play from 20+ ft away if you're into that.  However, don't wrap them up by twisting around a Gamecube controller, this can cause the wires to stress and pull out of the connector.  They work, but take care of them, or they may not last long.  At least they're cheap!",3.0
It allows us to not have to sit three feet from the TV and that is a great thing.  The less than perfect thing is we keep having to reseat the cable connections during game play when using the extra length.  We never have this problem when plugging our controllers directly into the game system.,3.0

"Let's not mince words here: Clayfighter 63 1/3 is a poorly put-together game. The game had a lot of possibilities, but everything lacks polish. Characters are missing frames of animation, backgrounds look decent but unexceptional, and the fighting engine lacks the strategy of Street Fighter, the speed of Killer Instinct, or the playability of Mortal Kombat. In any normal world, this would be a one star game.

Except somewhere along the way, Clayfighter 63 1/3 is so bad that it actually becomes good. Character design is pretty good, and the special moves and taunts are hilarious. The game is playable - not in any way that it can compete with the above-mentioned games, but it still makes you want to come back for another round, if just to see all the things the characters can do. There's also a bit more value once you unlock the secret characters, though it's frustrating that there's no save function that keeps these character unlocked.

Certainly not worth full retail price, but the N64 is dead now so you should be able to snag this game for dirt cheap. Also be on the lookout for the Sculptor's Cut version: this was a Blockbuster-only release, but most were sold off as pre-played games. It contains a hilarious singing intro, 4 new characters, and other enhancements.",3.0
"The Plot:  When the father of Callum Clockwise (aka Rascal) is kidnapped by the evil time lord Chronos, Rascal must follow them through six time zones, armed with only a bubble gun.
What's Good? All the reviews I have read about this game seemed to be negative. I actually liked `Rascal' a lot. Sure, the graphics and gameplay aren't the best and the character is hard to control, but I found it fun to play. There are eighteen different levels in six different worlds - Atlantis, Aztec, Wild West, Middle Ages and Pirate Ship. The Atlantis world has to be my favourite - its colourful and challenging and a superior to most of the other levels in terms of enjoyment and graphics.
What's bad? The character can be hard to control and the camera doesn't always keep up with you as you play. The game possibly won't have a very long lifespan either - I've played it twice now but probably won't again. Also, the battle levels against Chronos are basically the same but with different scenery and a few more missiles as you progress.
Gameplay: 2 - the character is hard to control and the camera doesn't always follow you as you play. Sound: 3 - the character just kinda says `Ouch!' and squeaks a lot, but the music on most of the levels in pretty good. Graphics: 3 - colourful and fun, but nothing spectacular. Enjoyment: 4 - Fun and easy to play, but the plot line isn't particularly interesting.
Recommendations: I think younger kids would like this game. The graphics aren't great, but the game is bright and colourful and fairly easy to play. If you liked this game, I would recommend ""Crash Bandicoot"", which is similar but much better, and ""Croc, Legend of the Gobbos"" which is another fun, easy game for younger kids.
Overall Rating: This game is awarded three stars overall. Three, because the four stars go to games that are either visually superior or just easier or more fun to play, and the five star rating is reserved only for my beloved Final Fantasy VIII game.",3.0

"Most Teekns fans carer started with Tekken 3.  And if you were an aracde aholic, it started with 2.  Had this been the easrly 90's this gamewould have got 5 stars hands down.  But over the years, this game is aged.  Tekken 1, was not an arcade blokc buster, and really came to age on ome systems.  Most fans of later tekkens will notice that this game was left for improvements.  Thee characters, while perfect stunnning and apporpiate for the early 90's, are blocky and of little detail.  although it was light years beyond Virtua Fighter 1.  And the fact that this was one ofthe first 3-dgames without chessy ringouts,and a highly detail, and cue combo system.  Most fans of later tekken will notice the cheese factor of the gameplay.  You could basically, pumble the computer, or an human oppeonent with little ease on the ground.  Which was improved in later Tekkens.  And the 8 characters, which again was appropiate for the times.  The story of this game, goes back to early Tekken.  Heatchi(sp?) was the final Boss. And was pretty hard due tothe fact you could be killed with only 3 moves.  I don't remember if Devil Kaazu(sp?) was a secret boss. But he was selectable,only through a very hard unlock process.  Anyway, I know that the later Tekkens blowthis game way, but his is a classic.  Introdcuing oyung versions, of Tekken legends.  Law, Paul, and Kaazu(sp?).  This is a personal favorite of mines.  But the reason for the low rating is the fact that the gameplay was cheesy.  Which, again was greatly imporoved upon in later tekkens.",3.0
"I could've just played this game on Tekken 5 arcade history, but I wanted to play as the boss characters, and I thought it would be easier. I'm not bad, I know a lot of the moves. But this game is to damn hard. Even on easy, its still hard. Mainly cause characters like ""Paul"" ""Nina"" ""Michelle"" ""Law"" and ""King"" just spam (do it over and over) the same moves. Even if your on the ground, they will still try to attack so when you get up, you get your a** handed to you. Nina spams the flip and jump punch and doesn't stay still, Paul keeps doing the ""sweep, elbow"" combo and kick combo, King flips, dropkicks, lunges at you over and over, and Michelle does this annoying combo that's almost unblockable, and finally, Law. He spams the punch combo and kicks over and over. Yoshimitsu isn't that annoying, but he kicks too a lot. Kazuya and Jack aren't so annoying (Jack does spam though). Heihachi spams grapples and most of the ""Sub Bosses"" are clones of the original 8. Plus, they don't have endings. Lee is a Law clone, Wang is a Michelle clone with Paul's ""Phoenix Smasher"" (like we really needed an even more annoying clone of Michelle), Armor King is just like King but has Kazuya and Heihachi's uppercuts, P. Jack, Kuma, and Ganryu are all clones of Jack, and Anna is like Nina, but more difficult, and finally, Heihachi. He is mainly Kazuya with some added moves. Playing Heihachi is unnecessarily hard. I never thought that this would be the only Tekken game where I have to set a time limit to 40 seconds. The game is ok, but the sequels are better. Oh and a lot of characters sound like Jack.(Ganryu, Heihachi, P. Jack)",3.0
"I remember playing tekken when I was younger, though I'm not actually sure what game I played. It was probably either tekken 2 or 3. But I wanted to try playing tekken again. I liked the stories you get at the end and I like the different characters you can get later on. So I decided to play at the beginning.

As for Tekken the original game:
(keep in mind that I haven't played tekken in a long time, and this is my first time playing tekken 1.)

PROS: This is where it all began so it was nice to see how it started
  You get to see and play the original characters
  You get to see how their stories began
  and have fun learning their techniques(a pro and con)

CONS: The character's endings are very short and if you don't have the manual you may get confused on how this has to do with the characters.
  There are no voices at the end, you just hear the same music
  The graphics aren't that good, but keep in mind it's the original
  Mostly a bunch of button pushing
  You don't get to unlock any extra characters
  and you have to learn a lot of moves on your own (a pro and con)

Overall I would say it isn't a must get, but if you want to see how the story began and are intrested in starting from the beginning then it isn't a waste of money. But I would mention that if it is just their stories you were intrested in then just look online and you can see all their stories in a total of 4 minutes. I don't regret my desicion, but I wouldn't get it again. This said it is likely I would play it again just for kicks.",3.0
"the seller's description sed BLACK LABEL IN LONG CASE. i recieved the damn green labled regular case instead. in other words, my ass got ripped off.

the game itself is a good fighter, i love how wen u start it up you get that classic galaga game. theres a pretty good cast of characters, each with there own uniqe set of moves. the graphics are great, characters are in 3d while the backgrounds are in 2d. you get cool CG cutscenes during arcade mode for each of the 8 characters. probably my favorite part of ANY Tekken game is the music. the music in this game is very well done. one of my very few complaints of this game is that there is no training mode. its hard to learn some of the moves while someone is fighting you at the same time. you can also ajust the difficulty level of the game, though i didn't notice a difference. this is one of the first fighters on the PS1 along with Battle Arena Toshinden. i wouldnt really reccomend it unless your a collector like me and you want the long case version. i would reccomend Tekken 2, which is the best in the series in my opinion.",3.0
"To put it bluntly, Breath of Fire III is intolerably dull. The battle engine has few innovations, the graphics are standard 2D cutesy sprites on  a rather featureless 3D background, and the plot is riddled with  problems.
Sure, in combat you can turn into eleven different kinds of  dragons, but so what!  At no point in the game are you actually required to  do so. In fact, you can go through the game with no need of a sinle  transformation. Experimenting with different dragon genes (necessary to  discover the above-mentioned dragon types) is tedious and wastes your MP.  In fact, transforming into a dragon wastes so much of your magic, that it  sort of invalidates any strategy.
The random battles are copious,  considering the fact that for most of the game you fight with no purpose in  mind. Thankfully, most enemies have a trick or two up their sleeve that you  can learn and perform yourself (most of the ones you can learn are  useless). Combat in this game just isn't fun, probably because it has  nothing to do with the plot.
The plot is surprisingly bare and devoid of  livelihood. Just as an example, before you meet the final boss at the end  of the game, you will have no idea that she is there. Neither will you know  for sure why exactly you are fighting her.
The plot has a lot of  interesting parts that are left unexplained. Some of the human interactions  seem realistic, but all of the realism is drained away by the fifth time  you are beaten up and kidnapped by the same pair of bandits.
The  soundtrack features several off-beat tunes, but otherwise is bleak. You'll  spend most of your game-time listening to no more than five tunes.
There  are also a few small things that are sure to irritate. Specific characters  are necessary to perform certain tasks (only the walking onion character  can break the glass seal on an emergency door), but switching characters in  your party is a long and tedious task. Sometimes it takes several seconds  to quit certain conversations, and sometimes there is lag between character  actions in combat.
I've never played the other installments in the Breath  of Fire series, so I cannot be sure of their quality. However, if they are  on the same level as this tepid piece of software, they desperately lack  appeal.",3.0

"I'm certainly no big expert on video games, so the professionals who appraise ""Tekken 2"" will have to excuse me for not finding it so outsdanding it breaks any major barriers. The multitude of characters seems to alienate them from the gamer unless he gets very much involved into it and manages to familiarize himself with everyone. About the characters, I notice a distinct lack of creativity and ideas begin to be mixed up (see King - a puma in a blue shirt and tie? Excuse me, but is there something wrong with the picture?). Special moves are often repeated between characters, and, having a little fun with it, the ones that look the best always lose. It seems sort of sluggish and trivial overall, far from the fantastic premonitions that I've heard. The game does have a number of great features: first of all, the graphics are outstanding, better than I've seen in (literally) almost all other games, probably the best, and second of all, pretty responsive controls that nevertheless manage to bring you into the game. To make a long story short, ""Tekken 2"" is worth buying, but don't expect a revolution.",3.0

"It has playstation graphics, not the best but still a fun game to play. Each level is a different puzzle lots of thinking.",3.0
"I didn't beat the game so I guess my opinion shouldn't count...but here it is:

This game has GREAT historical value. Prince: Sands of Time, Soul Reaver, God of War and many others are based on some things that Tomb Raider made popular.

Game would be perfect if save points were better placed. It would be best to have a save game option at any point but those were old times...

What I disliked: I beat Mexico levels playing each one two to six hours. I got to St Francis' Folly level.

Things started to look really tiresome: first, I spent too much energy beating pillar sub-level and didn't have spare medpack reaching ground floor. I restarted. I got enough energy by reaching ground but wasn't able to beat pool puzzle on top. Then I figured out that I should have gone to the ground WITHOUT USING SAVE CRYSTALS, open all puzzle doors (top level door is connected to ground switch) and then climb back up...which means another level restart.

Maybe this game is for hardcore fans, but I am not one of them...I got frustrated enough to quit.",3.0
"This game is more frustrating than fun, yet is strangely addictive.  Since the first ""Tomb Raider"" game I played was ""The Last Revelation"" (#4 in the series), I will always compare that game with others in the series.  I bought this game because I wanted to see how it all started.  Though many people think this is still the best ""Tomb Raider"" ever, I just don't see the appeal.  There are many frustrating aspects of the game that fortunately were cleared up by the time ""Last Revelation"" was put out.  A few examples:
--You can't save the game whenever you want to, only if you happen to come across a giant floating blue crystal (which isn't often enough).  I often found myself having to repeat entire sections of the game over and over because I kept dying before I could get to the next crystal.
--The animals in this game are really agressive and hard to kill.  They gang right up on you, often cornering you while they quickly take damage, while you have to shoot at them for at least 10 seconds (or more) until they die.  Also, the animals don't disappear after you kill them, so after a while the level becomes strewn with animal carcasses. (EW!)
--The human bad guys show up every once in a while to shoot at you--but you can't kill them because they're part of the storyline.  So you have to shoot at them until they go away, while they take some damage from you.
--The game doesn't give you enough ammo for the big weapons.  Considering how many rounds you have to use to kill a single animal, they need a lot more.
There are some good points, though--I love the variety of locations, the storyline is good, and the music is awesome (here's a tip: put the CD into your CD-player--the soundtrack is on track #2!).  The puzzles are also a little easier to solve than in ""TLR"".  Overall, I WOULD recommend this game to ""Tomb Raider"" fans since it's interesting to see how the game started, and how far it's come since then.",3.0

"This was another three dollar find in a bin at the resale shop.  When I was a kid I loved watching my friends or my brother's friends play this game and many other PS1 games that would later be heralded as classics.  I really didn't enjoy playing the games myself, because even my pre teen self in the mid 90s knew that the controls were absolute garbage.  Here I am twenty years later trying this classic again, and my opinion hasn't changed.

I can't say much about the game because I can't make it further than the first screen on the first board of the game.  You're thrown down in a little cave at the beginning, and your first task is to blindly shoot at a couple of animals who were just minding their own business.  Then you have to find a way out vertically.

The first jump you have to make in this game is ridiculous.  You have to make it to the adjacent rock.  There is a wall to your right preventing you from making a clean jump which also makes the camera go nuts.  Be prepared to make a lot of blind jumps.  It took me twenty minutes to jump to that rock which I promptly fell off.  Another ten minutes go by and I made that jump and got a little further up until I slid off a rock and all the way back down due to the horrible camera angle.  I actually tried to break the controller in half.  I have never been so mad at a game.

So there you have it, that is my review.  I couldn't make it further than the first screen.  If you want a classic tomb raiding experience that you may actually enjoy, check out Tomb Raider Anniversary.  It's a blast, and I actually finished that game.",3.0

Kinda ruff shape but for the price I shouldn't complain.,3.0
By far this game it's much more fair than the original Tomb Raider.

"I bought this mainly for the super street fighter 2 and super street fighter 2 turbo. Impressed though I was by the visual arcade perfection I was greatly disappointed by how ridiculously easy these games were even on the hardest level. Street fighter collection 2 is much closer to the arcade difficulty. The hardest setting should be hard and the easiest easy but it is easy all the way through. I hope in capcom classics collection volume 2 super turbo is actually difficult this time. Also I would like to see the first super game included in a future PS2 release but again difficult. Hyper street fighter 2 is basically the same as super turbo but very difficult. The funny thing with this game it is the other way round. The arcade version is too easy and the PS2 version very difficult. In spite of my criticism this collection has tremendous nostalgic value and will be great for playing with friends,but be prepared for the tedious load times.",3.0
"The sheer number of games bearing some form of the name ""Street Fighter II"" is staggering. So when Capcom announced that it was putting together a compilation of Street Fighter games, I was stoked. My excitement quickly cooled when I discovered the true nature of Capcom's package. Street Fighter Collection contains Super Street Fighter 2, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, and Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold, a slightly updated version of Street Fighter Alpha 2. The original Street Fighter 2, Champion Edition, and Hyper Fighting are nowhere to be found. The result is a shallow package that should have been so much more. The graphics and gameplay in the Super games are almost identical to what you remember. Every frame of original animation appears intact, and there isn't any noticeable slowdown. However, the graphics do appear a bit fuzzy. The sound is decent, and the music even speeds up and intensifies when a character is near death. The second disc contains Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold. The game is almost entirely identical to Street Fighter Alpha 2, with only a few differences. First, any character that was in Street Fighter 2 Champion Edition can switch between normal and Champion Edition modes. Playing a CE version of a character disables his super meter and changes a few moves here and there. The CE character graphics are still Alpha 2-style. Also, there is now an Akuma mode, which pits your character against Akuma over and over again instead of fighting all the other characters. Also, Cammy is hidden in the game. She appears in her X-Men vs. Street Fighter costume. All this is fine and good, but what about all the other great Street Fighter games? Where's SF2 Turbo: Hyper Fighting? Or the original SF2, complete with Guile's ""handcuffs"" and all the other weird little glitches? Capcom truly missed out on a great opportunity by releasing a ""collection"" that is obscenely incomplete. If you're really itching to play SSF2 or SSF2T, this package is right up your alley.

The game's puzzles never get  too frustrating, but sometimes, the game can really drag because sometimes,  you just simply don't know where to go next. It's easy to miss valuable  information. Besides the slow pace of the game (which isn't that bad,  considering it feels a lot like an X-Files episode), everything else has  impressed me. The presentation of the cinemas in the game are excellently  directed. Many complain that Mulder and Scully don't show up enough, but  that's silly because the story of the game is investigating their  disappearance! X-Files fan will not be disappointed, and adventure fans or  puzzle/mystery fans will also get a pleasant experience out of this. Being  an X-Files fans, I am truly pleased and impressed.",3.0

"The Title line says it all (stolen from a song by Danger Bob, a little-bitty but great band).  If you watch the show, you will enjoy the chance to be on it.  I guess it almost simulates being on the show because  you DON'T play Mulder or Scully.  It also simulates being on the show in  the way of waiting for something to happen, although you aren't waiting for  the lighting crew to set up the proper lighting, etc.  You are looking for  clues, and at times they are annoyingly difficult to find.  The only way to  progress is by finding them.  There are wonderful in-jokes for the fans,  and once you find Mulder and Scully, it is very exciting to have them  onscreen.  The story is okay, pretty much on par with this season of the  X-Files.  The items you use to help in the investigation make the game much  more interesting and fun.  The end became pretty draggy trying to figure  out what to do. The sequence mid-game with X was terrific, as you get to  experience again what a badass he is.

4= HIt or Miss Imo due to the character design styled more like 1 & 2 than 3

Twisted Metal (2012 for PS3)=Didnt play this one but heard it was good

Twisted Metal: A great game, revolutionary for video games of the first 3d era. Still a fun game and the only twisted metal with the inside the car view no saving to memory cards there was a short code for resuming your game later.

Twisted Metal 2: Most fans will consider this to be the best twisted metal of all the final release with single track after this one the game changes its physics dramatically...

Twisted Metal 3: In this installment twisted goes for a much more realistic driving feel for the cars. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but to most fans it just wasn't as fun. This was 989 studios first attempt to make a twisted metal game and fans trying out twisted metal for the first time tend to be the only fans that like 3 the best. However a few of the early twisted metal fans like 3 better but the game play turned off a large percentage of fans so this one is hit or miss try it you might like it best or you might not like it at all.  In the end 989 failure to appeal to a large amount of the fans of the franchise put twisted metals popularity into a downward spiral.

Twisted Metal 4: This game still made by 989 studios and after twisted metal 3 alot of the people who would of liked this game were no longer interested in twisted metal this one goes back gameplay designed to be fast and fun.  I would say compared to 1 and 2 the default characters you can chose from are less interesting and useful however you can create your own cars.  I think it was this that makes or breaks the game if you found a car you enjoyed playing you would probably like twisted metal 4 if not then your likely to turn away from it and say its a bad game.  This game attempted to incorporate features that would make hands down the best twisted metal and to some it was.  This is the last twisted metal game for the playstation 1.

Twisted Metal Black: First Playstation 2 release and back in the hands of the original creators who reformed under the name Incognito entertainment.  Best Graphics easily so far and better than even the game to come after and gameplay thats arguably just or good or better than any of the other games.  With nearly as many features as 4 including the first twisted metal game that was online capable(with a special disc not all copies could do that and official servers are shut down now)  this game is considered the best by playstation 2 fans and many fans of the twisted metal series.

Twisted Metal Head On: This is the spirtual sequel to twisted metal 2 its graphics and gameplay feel like they derived from number 2 however i would not say gameplay is quite as good as number 2 it does have all new stages and solid gameplay with new upgrade system after you kill an opponent you can collect a drop from them to increase your fire power this could be considered better or worse.",3.0

"In 1998 Twisted Metal 3 was released for PS1 the sequel to 1996's Twisted Metal 2 and the original Twisted Metal released in 1995. A new developer 989 Studios took over for SingleTrac who developed the first games in the series. This game uses a entirely new engine built from the ground up since it was a new developer working with the series. I have personally played this game and will say that its garbage and not even worth being mentioned as apart of TM series. The cars control bad plus the graphics look realistic like the first game rather than cartoonish like the second game. Its basically the same as TM2 where you travel around the world to places like Tokyo, London, Area 51, Egypt, Hollywood, just to name a few levels. A few characters from the previous games are in the game like Darkside, Hammerhead, Sweet Tooth, Thumper, Outlaw, Mr, Grim, Specter, Warthog, Minion, as well as new characters. The endings for the characters are really cheesy unlike TM2 which was pretty dark. The game also allows you to hook up a multi-tap to play with four other friends well three but four if you include yourself.",3.0
This game was alright but definately had more flaws. The other TM's are way better than this one. But this one wasn't that bad it was good,3.0
"If you've made it to this point in your life without playing a Twisted Metal game, that's all right, we'll explain it to you. The trilogy is probably best described as a vehicular version of Midway's Mortal Kombat or else a James Cameron's Terminator take on a demolition derby. In it, a horde of over-the-top characters compete against each other in cars and trucks armed with missiles, freeze rays, and other assorted weapons of destruction. This time out, there are a few new cars and weapons, and you have an option to have a computer-controlled ally aide you in the tournament, though he always seems to be the first one blown up in the fight. The biggest change to the series though is that its developer has changed from SingleTrac (who've started a new, but like-minded, auto-combat series under the moniker Rogue Trip for GT Interactive) to 989 Studios, a Sony-owned development studio. This affects the game on nearly every level. Graphically, the game appears much differently from the previous titles in the line, though it's not necessarily improved. There are various shading and lighting effects at work, but the end result is somehow grainy and washed out. The title's soundtrack, which is comprised of songs by Rob Zombie and Pitch Shifter, is very fitting, but the supporting sound effects are very weak. For example, the machine gun sounds like a cap pistol and driving through water inexplicably sounds pretty similar to that.
The game's much-touted new physics engine turns out pretty strange in function. The cars will now dip and roll upon collision, which sounds fantastic in theory, but in practice is fairly questionable since vehicles will often flip over after hitting a small curb or even a snowman. The collision detection is also highly suspect, as instances where you'll find yourself stuck on a ledge or halfway into a wall are frequent. It's very nice to have analog control this time, but the physics engine really works against it. The main downfall of Twisted Metal III though is its lackluster level design. Most of the stages are, if not modeled after, extremely reminiscent of levels from the first two games, and those that aren't are even more uninspired. The Washington level, for instance, is a long rectangular courtyard with a ramped area on one end and teleportation sphere (which sends vehicles to the ramped area) on the other. Snore.
In the two player modes, the default horizontal split-screen runs into the same problem found in SingleTrac's Rogue Trip. Since the levels are no longer as flat as in the previous TM games, having half you horizon cut away makes it hard to see in hilly or ramp-heavy levels. Fortunately, the designers had the foresight to include a wide variety of split-screen perspectives, such as a vertical cut and variations on a four-way split where the other two boxes are filled with radar, speedometer, and weapons info (these are the best since you view the world through a smaller version of the full screen). In the three- and four-player modes, the perspective is similarly cornered. Both appear to cut into the frame rate and increase the visible seams between surfaces, but not majorly. Multiple views aside though, the game is as much fun in multiplayer mode as it is in single player. As there, you'll be struck with the feelings of ""Why am I here?"" and ""Why am I playing this"" after a level or two. There are a few good ideas at work within Twisted Metal III (such as the multiple perspectives), but they're not nearly enough to counter the fact that improvements to the gameplay are pretty slight and the level design is a big step backwards, making the game a real lemon overall. If this is the direction the series is taking, it should probably stop right here. Take a look at Activision's Vigilante 8 or GT Interactive's Rogue Trip instead.",3.0
"It still amazes me how good this game -- now over two and a half years old -- looks.  Sure, the top of the line PC stuff is definitely prettier now, mainly due to higher polygon counts.  But we have yet to achieve a quantum leap in graphics quality equivalent to what ""Unreal"" and ""Quake 2"" accomplished in late '97/early '98 (just compare ""Unreal"" to the previous year's ""Jedi Knight"" to see what I mean).  To this day the game's textures are flat-out gorgeous, particularly the ones on the ""Vortex Rikers,"" ""Terraniux"" and ""Dark Arena"" levels.
That said, the gameplay is pretty weak.  I came to ""Unreal"" after having played ""Half-Life"" -- still the penultimate single-player first-person-shooter (FPS) experience -- and ""Unreal"" didn't even come close.  I could barely be bothered to play halfway through the game.  Only the lure of new graphics ahead kept me playing, but I never finished it.  While ""Half-Life"" keeps you intrigued with lots of in-game scripted moments, a plot containing at least a few twists, and a series of unforgettable sequences that leave you shaking your head saying ""That was so cool,"" ""Unreal"" just throws endless levels at you.  And buttons to push, and levers to throw, and doors to open.  Sure, the enemy AI is pretty good (for its time -- ""Half Life"" put that to shame as well), but the number of different monster-types is pretty low, and there's no context for any of it after the first few levels.  The action isn't intense enough to hold interest by itself.  To borrow an apt phrase, there's no ""there"" there.
Still, the atmosphere is amazing, and more than enough to justify buying ""Unreal"" given its now-low price.  Some of the moments are simply breathtaking -- first emerging from the crashed ship into Nyleve's Falls; walking around the outside of the Coliseum in ""Dark Arena""; and above all the approach to Terraniux, when the setting suns backlight the huge looming spaceship that dominates the landscape.  There is also some fine architecture -- ""Dark Arena"" and ""Sunspire"" spring readily to mind -- but remember there is a difference between designing a cool building and creating a really great game level.  The music is great too, although sadly not in Redbook format, so you can't just play the tunes off the CD.
Bottom line: if you haven't bought ""Unreal,"" and your system has the appropriate specs, pick it up.  It's a piece of gaming history and still pretty darn gorgeous.  But don't expect a seminal gaming experience.  Expect instead a sublime ""it-might-have-been.""",3.0
"Okay, I normally love everything Lucas Arts puts out, but this...

I really, honestly loathed this game! The gameplay was repetitive, hard, and booring. Basically, it is every vehicular battle from the trilogy, put on a game.

While this had great potential, and awesome graphics, I cannot reccomend it.",3.0
"Well, going into it, I heard that this was SO much better than Quake III arena.  I had played that game, and I liked it.  So, I gave Unreal a go.  After playing for a while, I played Quake III again.  Within a few minutes,  I quit Quake, uninstalled Unreal, and went back to playing Quake.  The  difference in the graphics was incredable.  All the sharp edges are fine,  but I perfer the revolutionaly rounded surfaces.  Quake III blew Unreal out  of the water graphically.  What about the game play?  Well, I was kidna  dissapointed.  Quake III is very intense, the kind of game you get caught  up in.  I found myself playing Unreal, just to see what it was like.  It  had no draw whatsoever.  I thought the weapons were fairly difficult to  use, and were kinda cheesy.  For me, it is all Quake III.",3.0
For less than 10 dollars Unreal is fun and worth its cost but for hardcore gun-toting maniacs thrn Unreal Toyrnament is your calling.  However if you just want to play a good shooter with nice graphics and to practice skills  against an OK AI then Unreal is a good buy.,3.0
"Well, that's what CGW editor Jeff Green called ""Unreal"". After playing it, I'm inclined to agree. It incorporates (on a small scale) elements of adventure games, which slows down the first-person action  without actually adding much weight to the alleged story. It does look  nice, though, at least for a 1997 era game.",3.0
"This has to be the most detailed and beautifully rendered game ever made.  The monsters look real, the weapons look sleek, and the animation is very realistic, with no jerkiness.  Unfortunately, this game requires totally  unreal system requirements!  Anything less than a PentiumII/300MHz  processor runs like garbage unless everything is turned down, and, well,  there goes the graphics!  This game was the chief reason for my system  being upgraded!  Also, remember the sleek weapons I described?  Well,  they're sleek, but that's it.  For crying out loud, it takes THREE HITS  with a ROCKET LAUNCHER to kill one of the BASIC enemies (the Skaarj).  There's no bang to them at all!  Plus, another good thing about Unreal is  the multiplayer games where you can play against computer-controlled  opponents (bots).  Sounds good, right?  Wrong.  Unless you put the skill  level down nearly all the way, simply aiming a gun at the bot will cause it  to zig-zag in a way that is impossible to hit, all while shooting at you  with godlike aim!  Other than the steep system requirements, the  difficulty of the bots, and the bangless weapons, the game is very good and  highly customizable for all those hackers and map makers out there.  You'll  get your money's worth, but I hope you're good at strafing while shooting,  otherwise you'll NEVER win!",3.0
Game in pretty bad shape,3.0
"This game used to be one of my favorites, not the best, but one of them trick attack was my favi, i just wish i had some of those skills back. This is a 2 player game and its kind of fun racing your friends down a mountain. I just don tlike how if you land wrong you loose health",3.0
I use to play this AGES ago and use to be pretty good. I started playing it again and I now found that the controls (at least for me) don't seem very forgiving. In order to do tricks you have to place the toggle in the exact correct place (at least pretty spot on). You also have to land in a specific position or else you crash (too many crashes makes it so you can't finish the race). The half-pipe mode is pretty decent though and can range from super easy to insanely hard. Overall a not so bad game for that time.,3.0
"If you don't read anything else:

If you find this game at a yard sale for $1.00 - $5.00 or online, then go ahead and get it, but in my opinion there are much better snow boarding games out for the N64, like ""Big Mountain 2000,"" ""Twisted Edge,"" or even ""Snowboard Kids"" or ""Snowboard Kids 2.""

Now I know that this was the N64's first snowboarding game, so we shouldn't expect the Taj Mahal in video game form here, but having played the previous mentioned snowboarding games and then playing this, there are some things that I dislike about this game. First, landing your snowboard in this game is more based on luck than skill. First, you have to press the ""Z"" button when you land and secondly you can't move your control stick AT ALL when you are landing or your player is going to fall over because the board is on an angle on screen. That right there ruined the game for me because it sucked a lot of the fun right out of the game. Also, if you want to try to play this game, I recommend plugging in an N64 controller that has a joystick that is still very firm. I started playing with my usually controller, where the joystick is a little loose and I was pretty bad. Plugged in another controller with a firm joystick, got INSTANTLY BETTER controlling my character in the game! Second, if you bump a wall you fall over. There are other snowboarding games on the N64 that do that, but here it seemed really prevalent. Third, the music in this game is really annoying sounding. I liked the title track, but after that I was treated to songs that had people with high pitched or dull voices yelling the same things over and over again! I would have preffered just straight up instrumental music here. Fourth, I noticed that ""PRETTY MUCH"" the only way of winning a race against the computer player, was to take a short cut hidden in each course. Sure you could try to out board them, but if you mess up 2 or 3 times (hit a wall or wall over) FORGET WINNING!!! Fifth, when you enter the competition events, YOU ONLY GET SO MANY CONTINUES and let's say you are playing on easy (Where there are 4 tracks) and you want to quit the 3rd race because you know you are going to lose and don't want to waste a continue. So you go to select ""Restart"" from the pause menu. YOU ARE BACK ON THE FIRST COURSE AND HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING OVER AGAIN!!! AGGH!!! Sixth, I did some of the time attack modes, I believe that's the right name for it. I am not positive right now.) Anyway, you have to board through certain goals (They look like a traditional marathon finish line) and I am playing the one level and the goal was on a cliff above me, that I had no chance of getting on from where I was and time ran out and I lost! WHY WOULD THEY PUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE GAME!!! Put the goal lines where people have a good chance of getting to them. Not up on a cliff, that I could of went up on, 8 seconds ago, but now I am stuck!!!

I loved the look of this game! That's why it was so hard for me to let go of the thought of getting fully into this game. I tried very hard to like this game, but I still couldn't bring myself to do that because of the mentioned above flaws. If you can overlook them, and you have the taste for snowboarding games you should be able to enjoy this game. Happy playing and thanks for reading! Merry Christmas and best wishes for 2010 and beyond!!!",3.0

"Hands down the hardest game of the first three.  The graphics were better and Lara had new moves.  But the game took an almost insane turn for hardness.  Not the best pick for your first Tomb Raider experience.
The game is cool that you can complete the stages in any order after completing the first one, India.  Also stealth is involved in some areas like Nevada.  Better to not tangle with all the guards.  The new save feature is pretty lame though.  Instead of keeping the excellent save anywhere mode from the last game, they made you collect save crystals.  And to be bluntly honest there aren't enough in the game.  Makes the game more frustrating than it needs to be.  Thank goodness for cheat codes right?  Still a solid game and worth adding to your Playstation collection though.",3.0

"Tomb Raider 3 was by far the most difficult Tomb Raider I have ever played. I'll admit, I used every cheat in the book in order to beat the game. But can you really blame me?
The game first starts off with an incredibly difficult jungle level, in which you have the option of finding a few secrets and then beginning the level, but regardless, you'll be jumping to a slope and then jumping over a set of spikes, and then (surprise!) jumping over another set of spikes, and finally landing at the bottom with a save crystal and a bunch of different directions to go. Don't go into the sinking sand and watch out for anything that looks dangerous because chances are, it'll be the last dangerous think you look at.
Finally, after a period of a week to a year, you've finally beat the jungle levels... WITHOUT CHEATS! Well I bet you were quite tempted! Now choose your destination. The strategy guides all tell you to go to the Nevada Desert, and then to the South Pacific, and then London. If you watch the entire ""Story So far..."" feature, you'll notice that the game plays the scenes with South Pacific first and Nevada Desert last. So nobody cares what order you do it in, it doesn't matter much. And believe me; you WILL get frustrated either way, so go to the one you want to go to first because it will take you FOREVER to finish that section of levels.
Finally, after God-knows-how-long, you finished the whole globe, and get this; you did it ALL WITHOUT CHEAT CODES! I congratulate you. NOW WE GET TO GO TO ANTARTICA!!!
Yippee.
Antarctica is incredibly difficult, and it ends with a big, mumbo-jumbo mother-of-all-spiders human-headed thing. Oh, and one shot with the rocket launcher just won't kill it! And one thing to keep on mind, one-hit K.O. As in, if it hits you once, it will kill you. Good luck!
But in spite of all of that, I really enjoyed seeing Lara in new costumes and playing in her new house. It was a lot of fun to get the racetrack key and find the shortcut at the racetrack. I must say, I really did enjoy Tomb Raider 3.
If you like challenges, then Tomb Raider 3 is definitely for you. And regardless, the Mansion is definitely worth the 5 dollars that Tomb Raider 3 now cost at Game Crazy. But, if you're anything like me and do not enjoy getting so frustrated over a horribly pixilated British woman in a jungle tomb, then get ready to memorize ""L2, R2, L2(2), R2, L2, R2, L2, R2, L2(4), R2, L2, R2(4), L2"" if you want to beat this game!",3.0

"Remember Command and Conquer, the real-time strategy that lets you build a base, a lot of units and rush the opposing force?  You'd think the developers of the original would come up with some innovative game play for the sequel. While maybe they can, they didn't here. Not only is the game play unchanged, it suffers from a weak story, poor balancing and computer AI and several small problems.

The single player campaign story, what there is of it, is just a jumble of scenarios without much to tie them together. There are characters and things happen to them but but there isn't a story progression to follow. You fight over here, you fight over there, then it's the final battle. In fact I reached the end of the GDI campaign without realizing it. The live video cut-scenes should have helped create a rich back-story but writing this I can't remember any of it.

There are balance issues particularly with NOD units and structures. A NOD 'super laser' structure can destroy almost anything with one shot but the NOD artillery is completely unbalanced. With a long range and a big punch, the artillery is can wipe out any ground force, and is unstoppable even in small numbers as long as a small anti-air backup is nearby.

The computer is an easy opponent. It doesn't rush but sending units at piecemeal, a handful at a time. It doesn't protect it's harvesters either, once you locate them it's easy to cut-off the computer's resources. The computer showed some initiative just once: During a NOD scenario several GDI engineers rushed my base taking several of my structures. I was so surprised it nearly wiped me out but building a good perimeter stopped later rushes. In the scenarios that followed the engineer rush never happened again. I didn't try any higher difficulty levels, maybe the computer plays better there.

Large maps are hard to manage, the game tell you that an offscreen unit is lost but not where the unit is. Some scenarios seem designed to simply frustrate you with a huge map and a timed objective with no direction as to where to accomplish it. In the end the game is all about the mass rush, once you build 50 or medium strength units nothing the computer can't stop you. On the technical side this game ran perfectly on Windows 2000.

GDI has better defenses and a vaster air force, while NOD has better ground troops and machines. Multiplayer is very fun and can get you use to the controls and computer strategies. How ever if you have almost any programs or down-loads going on, it often times frezes up and never lets you quit or finish. Also in the single player games, there are some unbeatiable missions on both sides very soon in the game. On GDI, the unbeatable is not because you can't finish because there's too many oponents, it's that you don't know how and it's confusing. With NOD, the unbeatiable is because you don't have enough guys to get around or through their force.

As for the game itself, nostalgia is a powerful thing. Mario Kart 64 was never my favorite, but I had some good times playing it.

Both are almost the same. If you like games where you have to think and games that are tedious, both are for you. Overall, since Banjo-Kazooie makes you think quite a bit more and has the extra puzzle-finding feature to it, I would suggest you pick up Banjo-Kazooie first and then either get Banjo-Tooie if you truly enjoyed the first game, or get Super Mario 64 if you want to play a slightly different video game. Also, Banjo-Kazooie is A LOT easier than Super Mario 64. So when you go to the store to pick which of the two games to buy, remember that unless you have a lot of free time on you hands, you probably shouldn't buy Super Mario 64.",3.0

"I have to say first, i love the idea of oblivion. And while i do find the game fun(ish) i cant help say some levels are way to complex. Remember the original zeldas lost woods? Yea. Way to much of going in circles somehow. I love the turok bosses. Sisters of despair being my favorite just because they sound bad ass! Never beat it without codes as it was way to hard to find wth i need to go. Cool guns. Love the cerebral bore! But in all not a game ill pick up and dusting off anytime soon. Havent played 3 or rage wars yet but the first is better overall. Save the blood and gore is intense being a nintendo game! If u haven't played and were a master at nes zelda games-this just might be a great one",3.0
"Back in the day, Turok 2 would've stunned any player with its eye-popping graphics and huge levels. One of the coolest aspects of the game is its wide arrange of really cool weapons. Multi-player is fun. Though, I wouldn't recommend this game to any of my friends in present times.

While playing Turok 2, you will spend a lot of your time back-tracking areas, which doesn't lead to any action. When you kill one of the enemy's, it will vanish providing you with no way to find your way back. If you play enough through these annoyances then you can become a expert enough to move through the game with ease. Being a action-shooter type, back-tracking areas can become a major bore for this genre. Don't expect steady feet gameplay like Goldeneye or Perfect Dark.

The graphics are great for 64, the story is okay, the characters are awesome, the weapons are extremely awesome, but the overall beat of the game lacks, which sucks away a lot of ""what it could of been"" gameplay.

Turok 2 isn't a bad game, but isn't one you pull out of your closet a year or two down the road, to play  either.",3.0
"you run around,look for extremely hard to find switches and wander some more then well you know look for switches and well you then its ummmmm wander some more.then somewhere in the midst of all this maddening insanity,a cool monster will jump out and you get to waste his butt with a dynamite lased arrow.then its back to the wandering.",3.0
The biggest grip that I had was the controls.  They just didn't feel right and I got killed more often then not just trying to walk or jump.  Alltogether a decent game though.,3.0
"This game's graphics and animations are very well done, and the story line is above average.  The thing that in my opinion makes it average is how long the levels are (coupled with the ridiculous Death Throes, more on the later).  It reminds me of the days of Jaws and Friday The 13th games for the NES where the levels dragged on and on and on....each level in this game will take you at LEAST three hours to get thru and not only that but youll have to back track thru old levels to get new keys and items etc.  After a while it gets to the point where you get tired of it and quit.  And one more thing this game seems to have been made for a bored teenage kid or adolescent, there are no puzzles or challenges to keep you intrigued, except for the occasional switch to find and that gets boring. The game is basically just kill this dinosaur and watch the blood spew forth, while it goes thru a ridiculous Death Throe.
Considering how long the levels are use the cheats some have mentioned and you should get a lot more enjoyment out of it (at least that way you won't have to be backtracking all the time).  Buy this game used.",3.0
"I played this game for week's years ago against a friend or 2 and it was great fun on multi-player. However when I played it one player I hated it. I thought it was too slow and real dodgy. But that was before I actually sat down and gave it a real go. And once you master the sliding/skid turn booster trick, it becomes a lot better.

To do that; you just hold the R button down when going around bends and corners and tap the analogue stick in the opposite direction 3 times. The smoke goes from white, yellow to red then you let go the R and you have a slight boost. Once I had learned that it plays a lot faster.

Overall, the graphics good and the levels are much bigger then the previous SNES version. But it lacks the same competitiveness and fun of the original version. But don't get me wrong, it is great for playing with friends, but it is a different feel from the original.

In my opinion the best Mario Kart out is the GBA version because it is the SNES version with more tracks! (the original SNES tracks are unlockable in the GBA version!) But none the less, this version stands out on it's own.

This version I didn't find to be as fun as the SNES one for a few reasons. They should have had more racers to choose from. And I miss my favourite driver the little Koopa Trooper, instead he's been taken out to make way for a slower Wario. But once I'd mastered that thing to take corners with, it was easy to place 1st in the 150cc.

Overall, I give the one-player game 3 stars and the multiplayer 4.

Cons: Not enough tracks and courses. Once you've mastered the courses on 150cc, there is no further challenges for you in single player mode.

- Not enough drivers to choose.

- The sound effects can be very annoying after a while (like Toads Whoa-Whoa-Whoa-Whoa sound)

- No way to turn the objects off (like banana peels and the hazards of the coarse... it is really unfair sometimes)",3.0
"Mario Kart 64 Launched with the N64 and it sure did good with the sales but Ultimatley this is disapointing.  Mario Kart Succeds in graphics departure but Fails at the boring over and over gameplay that you indure in the game.  Don't get me wrong this is a great game but it just pretty much fail to fun factor.  Back when I got this game when It first came out I simply loved it but after the next day it kind of got boring for me.  The game is great but fails with the overuse of boring driving and nothing exciting happens.  If it were up to me I would have addes some really cool Driving maze level(yeah it does sound lame but what ever)

In Graphics the game is simply superb.  It really does make the N64 a really good lookin' system.  The level desighning and great setups make it one of the better looking N64 back in the days when it was still popular..  It truly does make some Ps games look like crap.

The sound is pretty average...ehh I rather not go into that..

NOW.......The gameplay..

It just get's boring after awhile and nothing special happens and the single player is pretty short.  But cool......

And that's pretty much it.

The Multiplayer is pretty fun.  I had a blast playing it with my friends.  It really is fun but like I said before...Nothing special.

When it all comes down to this.  The boring yet kind of fun gameplay, Great Graphics but doesn't help gameplay, Really fun MP but still fails to succeed in fun factor(well atleast to me)

I give Mario Kart 64 a 3.4 stars out of 5

"I am speaking for all of those who never can never win in video games. My sister had bought Nintendo 64, and she had got this video game. Soon after, I was thinking maybe I should play one game just for fun. But this game drove me crazy! If I lost, i got crazy lol I kept on wanting to win! But of course, I never won lol.  But my sister won, and she likes to play every now and then. I guess I am not the video game type, and I guess I'll never win lol But sometimes I try every once and a while.

"If u have an N64, and your under 14, buy this game.  Now.  Don't bother reading anything else in this review.  It has ok graphics, cool blood effics, and awsome multiplayer.  But I'm afraid now I'll have to talk to the older audiences...
This game is all multiplayer.  But no single player.  It's clunky graphics, average weapons, and too 007ish single player make it an average game.  Sometimes ... ... ...  COME ON!!!!Other times you'll hit them in the leg, and they won't even limp,they'll just get back up and keep fighting. KamakazieSoldiers...
Worst of all, all the maps in the game have a certaincourse to fallow, and when u try to get outside of them, you'reblocked off by an awkward wall with complex colors...weird...but don'tgetme wrong, sometimes you just wish ... ... of people, and this is the game to do it.
Face it, I even own this wacky game, but don't say I didn't warn u.

"This was a good game.  It was.  If you look at it by itself, not expecting anything, it's a fine game.  However, I'm something of a classic gamer, and I suppose I expected to get the Super NES version, but better.  I found myself horribly disappointed by this 3-D (well, duh) thing.  I suppose it is much like the Super Nes version, just 3-D . . . and I just didn't like it.  If you don't like the world of 3-D gaming, you probably won't like this one.  But, in the interests of being true to the Zelda series, try out a friend's.  You may like it after all.",3.0
"I own an N64 and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I preordered it so I was sure to get it the first day. Well when I brought it home I was ecstatic. I couldn't wait to sit down and play it. For the first week I was playing it a lot then gradually I slowed down and finally stopped playing it altogether. I got to the water temple and that was it for me. I lost interest. As I progressed further into the game I felt like I was forcing myself to play it. The graphics were superb, play control was great, the soundtrack is excellent, and the battle system works great too. You might be asking yourself now what my problem with this game is.
The major part of the game which disappointed me to a great degree was the plot. It's as thin as paper. It didn't keep me interested at all. I found it to be too predictable. Whenever I played it I got a sense of deja vu. How many times has the princess been kidnapped now? I know this is more a prequel to the other games, but c'mon it's getting a little old.
Lets face it guys, this game is pretty easy. Sure there are a couple parts where people are liable to get stuck, but normally the puzzles were easy to figure out.
I'm a big rpg fan myself and one of the main reasons why I got the N64 was for Zelda and any other rpgs that were to be released. I got my 64 on Christmas 97 and I was really excited. Well other than Zelda, there is still yet to be a decent rpg on the N64. Please don't try to tell me that Quest 64 is a good game.
Zelda is pretty good but it was missing the plot aspect. It still surprises me that people refer to this as ""The Best Game Ever"". That is probably the biggest exaggeration I've heard, next to the ""Blair Witch Project"" being ""scary as hell"". I'm going to continue holding on to my N64 with hope that a great rpg will someday be released. Fortunately, I also have a Sony Playstation. They have enough great rpgs to keep me busy for a long time (Final Fantasy VII, Xenogears and Final Fantasy Tactics to name a few).
Bottom line, the game itself is relatively simple and the plot is thin and basically the same as any other Zelda game. It's a good game, not great, and is most certainly NOT that best game ever.",3.0
"DO not get me wrong.  I am one of The BIGGEST Zelda fans in the world. and I bought this one as soon as it came out with the gold cartige and  all.

Its missing the Fancy tunes,  the story just doesn't seem that addictive.
WHen you first get the game  its great and it looks to be one of the best games. but then after you beat  it.... its kinda boring...
Zelda games should never get boring! Zelda NES  I STILL paly that damn game.' Link Not as good as the first but still I  like playing it. Zelda A Link To the pass on SNES is the BEST Zelda game.

"Maybe its me, but Half Life is too crude to be an engaging play.  Been meaning to play it for years, but never got to it.  I played Half Life 2 first, and that is simply the best experience in gameing I've ever had.  It is brilliant.  I can see how 2 is a derivative and continuation of 1.

But after a few hours, I simply could not take the constant jumping/missing/dying.  And the totally totally obscure paths through each scene.  The long passages with no health.  The obscure mazes and constant times of being squished.  After a while, I became so frustrated I simply stopped playing the game.

There were some jump/fall/sqish episodes where replayed the silly jump part over 100 times.  I think that the playability is dated, just like the graphics.  The peculiar movement, where you always run, and have to press shift just to walk and not fall or overshoot where you're trying to get to, is simply not a current way to control movement.

All in all, a charming prequel to the best game ever.  I'm sure this game was truly groundbreaking 7-8 years ago when it first shipped.  But by today's standards, its not for me at least.  I cannot wait for more from Valve, as they are fantastic.  But this one, I'll pass forever",3.0
Loves this game great buy and mint condition,3.0
Better than the second but not as good as the first.  My brother got me this as a birthday present in 2001.  It didn't finally beat 100 percent until 2008 and it took me four days.  After that I beat the second also in four days.  Boy did I take my time or what.  Anyway.  The music was better than the second and the boss fights but why did they have to go by that stupid three hit rule.  Like with the second game N. Gin should've been the final boss.  The ending was stupid and not worth it.  I really still can't stand the fact that Tawna wasn't in it.  She really is cold hearted.  Crash has a picture of her in his home and yet she's nowhere to be seen.  I guess that means even though he risked his life to safe her she wants nothing to do with him.  How this game got ruled by everyone as the best in the series is still something I'm trying to figure out.  But it still is a good game.,3.0

"Remember when GTA: III came out? Then Vice City? Then San Andreas? Now IV? How excited you all were to play it? How you couldn't wait to just tear into the package and get that disc out for the first time?!

Well, that's how it was when this game first came out. Given, the graphics aren't that good, but think here people, it was an early Playstation game. I'm sitting here reading reviews of this game and shaking my head, because a lot of them are coming from people that are disappointed with the game because they played the newer ones first.

Don't give this game a bad rep because you played the newer versions first. Yes, they obviously will have better graphics, better story-lines, better views, more missions and whatnot, but this is the game that STARTED IT ALL. If you've played GTA, GTA: London, and GTA 2, you know what I'm talking about. These games are classics in their own age. At the time they came out, there was nothing that could stop them, much like the newer GTA's today.

This GTA is the one that started it all, and it's just as much fun as any of the later versions of the game if you ask me. Yes, it has the 'overhead' view, controls that take some getting used-to, and not the best graphics you'",3.0
"GTA 1 is a very old game, so anyone should expect realistic grafics nor long and complicated missions, as in the last three GTAs, but it's a game in the same style of the newer GTAs, and fun as well.

"Grand Theft Auto - Circa 1997

GOOD:

- The roots or start of a super popular franchise

- Sort of fun and different in it's own way

BAD:

- Really, really dated graphics, even for its day

- Gameplay is pretty old and controls can be tough for some

WILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:

- A Top-down run and gun game where you steal cars, kill people, and live a life of crime

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:

- Grand Theft Auto: London 1969

- Grand Theft Auto 2

- The legend of Zelda: A link to the past (but a lot more urban and violent)

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- There is a version of this game for Game Boy Advance

- There is a version of this game that comes packed with Grand Theft Auto: London 1969

- All three levels (or cities) in this game later on became their own Grand Theft Auto game, example the first level is liberty city which is the city from GTAIII, The second level is Vice city which is the same city from GTA: Vice City, and last but not least is the third level San Andreas which is the same city/state for GTA: San Andreas",3.0
"I dunno... I loved the concept, but the control kills it.  I don't like having to push a gas button to walk!  Thankfully they fixed this in GTA 3 & 4.  Those games are incredible.  Buy those asap!!

"I've recently beaten Grand Theft Auto 3, which I enormously recommend to anybody who has a PS2 and can tell the difference between reality and fantasy. I thought it would be interesting to take a look at the original GTA (Historical interest, you know), so I bought a used copy.
As everybody already knows, and as I knew, the graphics aren't great. They're 2D and pixellated, and they don't seem at home on a Playstation game. But graphics aren't everything (After all, Tetris was one of the best games ever), so this flaw doesn't greatly detract from the game, in my opinion.
Unfortunately, two other flaws greatly ruined my fun while trying to play. The first is the game's camera. It's really, really annoying, and you can't do anything about it - the camera keeps zooming in on you/your car and then zooming out for no reason, making it difficult sometimes to see what's happening sometimes. Other times, it's just annoying. Also, you can't rotate the camera, which bites.
The second flaw is much more aggravating, and really hurts the game, I think. The controls are almost indecipherable. I figured that maybe it was just that I was still using GTA3-styled controls, and after awhile, I would learn to adjust, but I didn't. I still can't drive a car in this game without constantly bonking into a building, or frantically trying to steer my car back onto a road. There are five different layouts for your controls, all pre-set, so you can't customize it. All five are useless. It really hurts gameplay if you can't even play the game.
The game has great historical interest, and it's still a fun concept. However, if you have a PS2, just forget about this and go for GTA3. At least in that game, if you have a hard time beating it, it's because the game is challenging, not the controls.",3.0

"This game has been a huge let down...The graphics are decent, but by no means superb.

To make matters  worse, the sound effects stink (what a waste of my good speakers!). In  short, this game is nothing but a low brow, uninspired arcade fossile. If  you want an interesting and FUN game, try Red Baron. I still have not found  a game that beats it.",3.0

"This is a totally new spin on Quake II. It is different than the computer version, new levels, new missions, but the same new enemies from Quake II on the computer. There are around 16 levels with 30 missions. What I mean by missions, is that in each level you have stuff to do, such as collect explosives, then place them to blow up a power grid, or realign a satellite dish. If this sounds complex, don't worry just walk up to something and it is done (quite brainless). This game is your stereotypical shooting game, you run in a first person game, with one of seven guns you can pick up and with this game you get a full 360 degrees motion with your gun, so its more than shooting straight. With other shooting games you fight against waves of monsters, in this game there are pretty much 10 - 20 creatures per level, making the levels go by quickly. This is a pretty good game, the only real downfall is that there are only 10 - 20 enemies per level, making the game go by pretty quick and easy. However the second to last level is totally different from the previous levels making it nearly impossible for the player to complete (Several death traps when the previous levels have no death traps).",3.0

"I have played all the tomb raider games over the last couple of years.  Though this game offers the best range of weapons and environments but is clearly the hardest.  There is more puzzle-solving than firefights and NO hand to hand combat!
POSITIVE ASPECTS:  New, improved Lara
New weapons (Isreali Desert Eagle, Rocket Launcher)
New moves (Sprint, double flip, handstand, monkey swing)
Cool environments (Antarctica, Indian Jungle, Area 51)
Intelligent enemy AI (survive the challenge of wolves, giant ravens, a mutated spider, Area 51 guards, etc...)
Brilliant engine and graphics (you can even run this with a 200MHz pentium 2)
Lara looks sexy!
NEGATIVE ASPECTS:  The game is actually too difficult.  You need to buy the strategy guide (nowadays this probably costs more than the game)
There is no hand to hand fighting system (Lara relies totally on her weapons)
It is a bit outdated (if you want to buy a modern game wait for the Angel of Darkness)
FINAL VERDICT:  Though better than the first Tomb Raider games its diificulty rules.  It is for this that it loses two stars.  Generally with the TR series, I find it is a copy of Indiana Jones and lacks ideas of its own.  However, I would reccommend this game to anyone who likes adventure games!",3.0
"This was probably the weakest game of the Tomb Raider 3 series.  Although the enemies are tougher and smarter and the graphics and game engine have been improved greatly, the game lacks the certain taste and quality that made Tomb Raider 1 and 2 so great.  For one thing, you're barely even going through any ancient ruins.  This time you're in cities, military bases, and technical centers with men scattered around with heavy guns.  Only a few levels feature ancient places to wander in with traps.
A word of warning.  This game is not recommended for new players.  Even the most experienced player who's played the last two games have had a hard time beating this game without a guide book or a walkthrough off the internet.  This is one reason why the rating suffers.  Many players have given up in the game because of their frustration over the level of difficulty.  There are many dark and annoying rooms, you always end up in a deadend that leads nowhere, some places require you to lose a huge amount of health in order to move on and some of the levels seem pointless as fillers to make the game bigger.
Apart from those, the game appeared with several bugs and errors that prevented people from completing the game.  If you don't think your computer has what it takes to play this game, then don't get it yet.
Overall, there are five different areas to visit.  The India and London levels are by far the worst in the game.  The Nevada levels have some excitement into them.  The South Pacific Island levels are AWESOME as they return that Tomb Raider tradition by venturing into exotic ancient lands.  The final Antarctica levels make a good climax.
In conclusion, this game is not bad.  It could and deserves much better though.  But I'm sure Eidos have learnt their lessons. It seems like they tried to experiment with new ideas here but failed to come up with anything good. Tomb Raider 4 and 5 have been a big improvement.  I recommend Tomb Raider 3 for anyone who's played and completed Tomb Raider 1 and 2.  Otherwise, don't bother with this game.  It's just too darn hard and it'll give you a bad taste of what the tomb raider series are like.",3.0
"Have you ever sat for hours playing one particular video game and you can never find out what to do? This is one of those games. Although it does hold a great assortment of fun weapons and great graphics, but it's hard.  You don't just go around firing guns at everything. Although I did not like  the first Tomb Raider either, only because many of the enviroments looked  exactly the same though. They both are good games but if your not willing  to put a lot of time into video games and just play for fun like me, your  not going to like this one.",3.0
"I've conquered hundreds of video games, but unless you have serious amounts of free time on your hand the tomb raider series is not for you.  I especially don't like having to get a hint guide to progress through a  game.  The first tomb raider was difficult, but not unreasonably so, the  puzzles made sense.  The second one introduced a troubling trend of hiding  the solution to puzzles in nonsensical places, and forcing a player to  backtrack and turn up the brightness constantly.  In this game it is  virtually impossible to figure out swiftly where you need to go or what you  have to do.  With larger levels come an increasingly frustrating inability  to simply figure out what you're trying to do in that particular level.  I  finally gave up after defeating two areas.  I refused to buy the hint  guide, but after flipping through it I was enraged at how impossible the  programmers made it to find the extra weapons and ammo.  The game is  tough enough already without having to defeat levels with just your pistols  if you don't buy the hint guide.
Why the hell can't they just make the  game fun?  the first one was just about right.  I'll never have the amount  of free time necessary to enjoy this series, which I actually love.  I have  more fun just wandering around and jumping then trying to defeat needlessly  obtuse puzzles.  The only area really up to first tomb raider standards are  is the south american levels with the giant statues.  ARGH.",3.0
"I had a positive but more negative experience with this game. I did beat it a few times at the final level, defeating Bowser. But, the game crept me a couple of times. I could not fully control the buttons on the controller in order to figure out where I (Mario) was. Plus, there were some enemies that were scary and immortal. I could not stay in the water for too long or else I would die. However, the game was the first 3D Mario adventure type with cool graphics and so.

I rank this game the second in the list of most difficult Mario games (maybe 5 as total) ever. The winner is Super Mario Bros. 2 (in my opinion).",3.0
Bought this game to give the kids an alternative to Mario Kart but Mario Kart still rules supreme. It's hard to beat the best game ever made though...,3.0
"Okay this game is the reason they created difficulty settings. Some of the stars are just plain infuriating to get. And it has the exact same plot as every other Mario game. OMFG Bowser stole Peach whatever shall we do?! Get an ugly princess or something! And where the hell are the king and queen anyways?! The hats were also poorly implemented. The Flying cap is hard to use, the metal cap is rare, at best, and the computer can still see you when you use the invisible cap. They should have stuck to the 2D side scroller. And also where is Yoshi?! The fact that in later levels the edge of the map is always a bottomless pit is also frustrating.",3.0
"The game is fun, but simple tasks can be very hard thanks to the sloppy controls. If you die, you start the level all over again. I spent three hours Trying to collect the 8 red coins of cool. cool. Mountain. The sloppy controls kept me sliding of mountains, causing me to start all over. I don't recomend it for younger children unless they don't mind messing around in the first few levels.",3.0
"I own this game and have only played it a couple of times because it really is very boring.  It's only a one person game, and it gets really old after awhile (if you know what I mean).  But if you live alone, and have A LOT of times on you're hands then buy it.  But if you're purchasing it for a young child..... DON'T!  They won't like it at all.  It's very hard, too.  But hey, if you want a very, extremely, hard chalenge... then good for you!  BUY IT!  But my opinion is.... IT'S BAD!  Mario Cart is a much better game.  Bottom Line: Don't waste your money.",3.0
"THIS GAME IS SO EASY THAT IT IS BEYOND BELIEF! and I mean that, too.  Some people think that they're the GREATEST nintendo players of all time just because they beat Super Mario on the N64 console.  Big deal.  This game is incredibly, (AND I MEAN INCREDIBLY) Easy.  It's okay, but nowhere as near as good as Zelda.  However, if you want a game that's excellent for the N64, get this game.  Here's my pros and cons for this highly wonerful and yet laughably easy game:
  PROS:
  Wonderful graphics.
  Addictive gameplay.
  Every now and then there's puzzles that are mildly challenging.
  Un-predictableness with the creatures in this game make it fun.
  CONS:
  Awkward camera angles.
  Too easy that you should beat it in about two or one month.
  Controls are weird and at times confusing.
  Graphics are good, but at times there are major glitches.
  This games levels look alike every now and then.
  The plot sucks.  It does.  Save the princess and jump through paintings and destroy Bowser.  Come on!
  Bowser bosses are not difficult at all.  You can beat all three of them in like less than a day if you try hard enough, (I did it in one day, true story, I SWEAR)

  And there you go.  Hopefully this review helped somebody out.",3.0

"Sim city 3000 is great for people looking for a game that is fun, pulls you in, mildly addictive, and not too complex, the unlimited version only offers more building sets and other things that some people would pay for, but nothing relavent.

From 1 to 1oo, this game would get a 40, why? Becuase it just isn' that good of a game, I'm an expert ing gaming and pcs and have been in the business since windows 95. But this game is made for the average ""dumb american"", that is why it is so simple, and lacks any depth. This game is perfect for teenagers, soccer moms, and stud people, but anybody who likes a good challenging game shouldn't even look in it's direction.

These are the good things about the game....

1. It has playability value but not much, from 1 to 10 maybe a 3, becuase once you master it( spoiler, it takes about a hundred years to get a size million in a city) you just don't give a damn about playing it again.

2. System requirements are low, and it runs on the most ancient pc that is feasible.

3. It's easy to learn to play, and inexpensive, and the graphics are pretty good for those who care unless you get to close( highest zoom).

4. You can voyage out of reality and build a city of imagination.

Now these are the concerns about the game.

1. The game has very little realistic qualities about it, it is not in check with the real word, even the information bar suggest it was mad for kids.

2. There is no names for streets, no district and area setting, and no combining indidvidual parks to make one small, medium or large park( Different small or large parks placed to getting but functioning different ans seperate is not realistic).

3. There are not as many tax forms as they are in the real world, and the maps are either way too small or only show the central part of the city, which is also unrealistc, since all large cities have metros.

4. The max loan size is way too small, and the interest is a bit extreme.

5. The airports don't generate as much income as they should.

6. There are not nearly enough mass transit options in the game, and the availabe ones are very unrealistic. The train option is just horrific, and the subway us expensive and not very fun to build,( they were probably thinking that the game is about cit building, but transportation is a huge part of any city over 300,000) the highways are basicly useless and very expensive and difficult to build, and there are no underground building and other types of roads and highways, and no street lights and signs.

7. It is just about impossible to get a city size of over 4 million even on the larget plot availabe, and even when thinking this is just the central part of a city and the metro is not shown on map is still not feasible, since the large us cities have far more than 5million people in there central part.

8. The game crashes and is racked with bugs.

all in all you see why this game gets a 40, if less, this game is not just that great, hopefully they will fix atleast 60 percent of these major flaws(anything less is unacceptable) in the next simcity, and as for simcity 4, lets not just go there,and there will not be a five, ( I believe maxis is not in operation anymore and has just not announced it), but the city simulation industry is still wide open and the demand is high.",3.0
"Sim city 3000 is a game that allows players to build the city of their dreams with parameters, very similiar to real life, however there are a few flaws that shouldn't of been ignored when making the game.

For one, you can't name city streets, this is a major drawbacks, and takes away from the realism of the game.

There are no one way streets, and streets can't be bigger than 2 lanes, which is another major drawback.

There is only one type of commuter transportation, the subway, and the train is severly limited and not reliable, which is another major drawback, especially if there trying to make a realistic game.

The easiest scenario is too difficult, and the loan interest is way too high, which is also unrealistic for small cities, which are major drawbacks.

So after all of these negative things which bring the game down, I have to say that this wasn't there best work, but it is a good game to kill six hours, unlimited still does not implement these things, but as they say most game designers always leave somethings out when there planning on making a sequel, it's just some designers don't know that there is a line between to much features, and a half done game, and that line is unbelievebly easy to cross, and they didn't see it...",3.0
"While the game itself is quite good.  I enjoy playing my copy of the game, and still find new interest and challenges of running cities.  The replay value should be obvious as there is no ""end goal"" to meet, though there are ""rewards"" along the way.  There are several problems, however, particularly when compared to Sim City 2000.  First, there are no scenarios.  That is a pity because the scenarios often enhanced the value of the game.  Second, you cannot for your own landform in the New City mode before you start the game (again, unlike SC2000).  Both of these problems were later corrected for the later cousin of the game: Sim City 3000 Unlimited. Additionally, the online support is much better for Unlimited.  The building downloads on the official website are minimal, and the building design tool is not supported by the basic game.  Still, I will have to admit that 3000 is still a vast improvement over the previous version.  The buildings are better designed, and they really do look different on different sides.  Also, the graphics are much better over 2000, while they are not vastly improved in Unlimited (which is essentially the same game, with the additions above AND additional buildings).  I would recommend that you do buy Unlimited over this version simply because of the vast number of updates.  And, with the release of Sim City 4, it is highly unlikely that even the Unlimited website will stay up much into the future, and it certainly will not be supported any more.",3.0
"Simcity 3000 is a good simulation.  The graphics are outstanding, the music is ok, it is fun to look down and see vehicles driving on the streets and the people walking around.  Even the sound effects match with the specific area of the city you are looking at.  For example, high-crime residential areas feature sporadic gunfire, rapid footsteps and the clanging of a chain-link fence.  the bustling commercial areas feature heavy traffic noises and sirens, and industrial areas have heavy truck and machinery noises.  You control the layout of the streets and the zoning.  Then the city develops itself, according to land values and access to transportation.
The not-so-good:  When areas become blighted and buildings are abandoned, the buildings become black boarded-up boxes that no longer resemble the original building style-- for example, a twelve story apartment building, when abandoned, becomes a three-story black box with boarded-up windows.  You cannot have suspension bridges cross above highways or city streets.  ALL the streets intersect (no way to build overpasses, except highways crossing streets) There is no way to build elevated rail lines-- the railroad must cross every street at an intersection.  Also, you are mostly restricted to a north-south street grid system
Overall, this is a great game.  I just felt like pointing out some flaws that might annoy some people.",3.0
"Well,I actually liked this game,its pretty fun,you can make all kinds different landmarks,and you make and control your your own city! But,the main problem with it was i couldn't figure out how to save a game-It didn't say anywhere,and it was so furasturating!!!!!!!!!but other than that it was pretty fun,I would recomend any Sim game-especially Sim Tower......Also You might like Zoo tycoon,and the Roller Coaster Tycoon games.....",3.0
"Sim City 3000 is good game, yet it is the hardest game I have ever played. The main problem is getting money. I can never get any profit at the end of each year. Sure, I can use the $100,000 cheat code, but it only works once. Another problem is getting the people to work. Even if you put residential areas (where they live) next to industrial areas (where they work), they still might complain that it is too far to go. Some good things about Sim City 3000 is that you can build famous landscapes. Also, the graphics are great! If you are considering buying this city-building game, I would suggest The Sims or Roller Coaster Tycoon instead.",3.0
"Sim City 3000 is a really neat game (at first). It is by far the best in the Sim series. Graphics and sound are greatly improved over Sim City 2000. And it is very easy to just overload yourself with all of the new options  available for construction around the city. It will take you several days  and practice cities just to get the options down and to figure out what all  the new structures do.
My greatest problem with the game is that after  100 years or so, you spend 95% of your time running around the town  performing maintenance. The game has gotten to the point where it is to  realistic to be any fun any more. Trust me, it is zero fun to spend all  your time looking for dilapidated water pumps and repairing damaged  streets.
My second problem is that citizens in the game are constantly  petitioning the mayor (you) for any and all types of new ordinances. This  stops being interesting after about 50 years of game play. After that you  just wish they would leave you alone. Once again, realism starts sapping  out the fun. But overall, Sim City 3000 is a good way to waste a few hours.  Just don't be surprised when you hit that breaking point where it changes  from a game into work.",3.0
"why? it just seemed to have a ""funner"" aspect to it than 3000, in 2000 it was possible to get a good city going without having to cheat, or be a master at the game. i spent hours and hours playing 2000, and i  couldn't wait for 3000 to come out... but i was a little dissapointed, its  fun, but not that fun, after awhile there is nothing else to do, and it  gets real tedious when all your stuff breaks and you have to go about  fixing it again... if you liked 2000, i would recommend this just because  it is a fun game for the first 20 hours or so, if you didn't like 2000 then  don't expect this to be any different from its predecessor",3.0
"Pretty much just an upgrade over SC2K... definately improved, but no great new innovations here.  Recommended, but not enthusiastically.",3.0
"Overall, SC3K is a wonderful game. It is fun to play, and challenging also.
I got an issue of my computer magazine. On the front ""SIMCITY 3000"" in large bold letters. I opened the mag up, and inside was a  article on how excellent it was going to be. Now I have the game and think,  why didn't Maxis do better? It remains the same game, much like SC2k. No  graphic improvmentsand more frustrating than ever.
The good side is what  a fun game it  is, and always will be. You, mayor of a city, the people  loving you, them hating you, its the SimCity experiance.
The thing is,  that this game is excellent. It is very fun and neato. The bad thing is, is  that it is too much like sc2k. SC to sc2k was a big change, but sc2k to  sc3k is not. :)

"At first glance this game may look easy but its not. You could spend many hours just trying to figure out what everything does and even more making your numerous attempts at unsuccesful cities. The graphics are pretty good  but you need an intense system for the game to run smoothly. Maxis has once  again added their own humorous touch to the game which can add to the fun  factor. You probably won't get sick of this game very fast. If you are  looking for a huge improvement over SC2K you won't find it here. I have made  this game sound bad but it really isn't, this a very fun and challenging  game and would reccomend it only to one who likes this particular genre.",3.0
"I thoght this game was really fun. The only problem I found with it, is that you have to be patient at the start and make money before you can really build your town. On one of the reviews it said, ""Don't get this  game if your under sixteen.""  I'm 13 and I made tons of money on the  game. As long as you start out slow you won't get in debt.",3.0
"If you are under 16, don't even think about getting this game.  The amount of money that you are given at the start of the game is just enough to build the town and then you will lose money for at least the first 20  years.  Then if you make it after that the game is a lot of fun.  If you  get the game, make sure you get a strategy guide.  It will save you a lot  of time and effort.",3.0
"So, I bought this game and was satisfied with the amount of time it took to ship. It also plays well, I have no problem getting it to work. The only reason I can't give this game five stars is because I'm stuck in it and can't figure out where to go next. It's one of those games that if you don't look up every little detail on the internet or have someone experienced playing with you then you're going to get lost quickly. I haven't made it far past the starting screen, I'm just sort of trapped where I am. I love different sorts of Castlevania games and would recommend this to someone who has a bit more time on their hands or someone who really knows what they're doing.",3.0
"A password feature. Graphics that are lacking for the PS1 era.

There is no saving in this game at all. The original PC version, which I own 2 copies of, as well as DOOM 64, DOOM 2, and DOOM 3, all have saving features. Not only that, but the teatures are very gradient, reminiescent of the old 3D Maze screensavers on older Windows machines. The graphics could have been smoothed out a bit more. There are games on the PS1 library that have better graphics, and on the original DOS version of DOOM, there were better graphics.

The controls are responsive and fluid, the music is damn awesome, the game comes in a special padded longbox, the gameplay is fun (but repetitive, due to the password system that sucks), and the level design is excellent. There are more postives than neagtives when regardring DOOM on the PS1, but the negatives are major screwups that irritate me. It's a great game, but i recommend not buying this port.

You even get to choose different faction like WCW, NWO, Four Horsemen, WCW Wolfpac, and LWO.

The game uses actual entrance footage from WCW Thunder broadcast when you start a match to show the wrestler coming to the ring and you even get a vs screen with who you are fighting as. You get alot of game modes like battle royal, steel cage, which weren't in WCW Nitro by the way plus weapons that are outside of the ring.

"Now, being a big fan of the hit TV show, I was a little skeptical at first if the game would bring down the integrity of the show, but in the end it did not. South Park isn't a great game, but if you love the show you will definitely enjoy it. You can chose between the four main characters: Kyle, Cartman, Stan, and Kenny. Usually, I pick Cartman because he is the funniest one out of the group and has the best insults. They implemented the same humor they use in their TV show, so the sound samples keep you the most entertained. The point of the game is to save your town from evil turkeys, aliens, toys, clones, and what not. Each level gets kind of repetitive, so the game can be a little boring. There is not much variety to it, but let me reiterate that the voice samples do and will keep you entertained. I give this game credit for the humor, sound, creativity, and graphics, but it lacks in level design and keeping the gamer entertained through other means rather than sound.

Overall, I rate this game a 3 out of 5 because although its cleaver and funny, the actual game play of the game is not that exciting. If I wanted humor, then I could just turn on the show.",3.0

"This N64 title was exclusive for N64 at one point but that doesn't really matter.  South Park 64 looked really promising at first and it truly was with it's shocking yet really great graphics some what game play.  And I was looking forward to one of the things South Park is best at.  Stupid Funny plot.  It kina had one but ends up failing AND I LOVE SOUTH PARK IT'S ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS OUT THERE.  But for a game it's just..AVERAGE.  Nothing new just run and gun but I liked the whole senario stories like the visitors and the Turkey episodes.  Those were great.  The game starts off really well as you battle your way through vicious Turkeys but once you beat the Turkey boss it just drags on with the same ol run n' gun and then fight the boss with nothing New.  It's just the same ol' same ol.

Graphics are really good and one of the best on the N64.  It really shows what the N64 can do.  One of the best parts are the bosses cause there 3d animation is sooooo good.  But that is just it...Graphics... Now lets get to the problem

Gameplay gets really boring after awhile.  Really...It's just the same ol same ol but the game is great for Die Hard SouthPark Fans.  I thought the game could have bin better but hey It wasn't But They still try to do a good job.  But still...Gameplay is just a lil boring..

Sound is perfect...Trey Parker and Matt Stone do a great job as teh voices of those crazy boys.  Sound is great ok!

Pros

Graphics

Sound

Voices

Cons

Gameplay is just way to boring and a bit tedious

Seems like playing the first Episode over again

The ending is sooo crappy I was really expecting something big and cool but just same lame ending...Then again it's just a game based on a show but seriously.

Over all I give it ....a

"A decent game. It was interesting to see where the SC series got it start from, but in the end you're better off playing SC2-5 depending on what you're main focus on the game is. I can see why people like it, but it's not worth the hunt for it.",3.0

"Or so the prologue goes in the Soul games.  This game came out on the Playstation, before the Soul Calibur series.  You might could say that this is a prequel to the Soul Calibur series.  Anyway, I bought this title after I had already played Soul Calibur II and Soul Calibur III.

By the time I bought this game, I was already accustomed to the great graphics, fluid movement, and responsive controls of the PS2 versions.  That is the reason why I did not enjoy Soul Blade.  I am sure that it must have been top-notch back in the days of the old Playstation, but today, it definitely cannot compare to Soul Calibur III.  The basic idea is the same though.  You have a small cast of characters who are seeking Soul Edge.  Soul Edge is a sword with magical powers.  It consumes the souls of those who use it.  However, in return, they stop aging and they obtain combat powers that exceed that of even the very best warrior.

You might want to buy this game and add it to your collection, if you're a fan of the Soul series of fighting games.  However, I would not recommend buying it if you actually want to play.",3.0

"Ok, let me start off first by saying that I've been a huge fan of the Twisted Metal series since I was a kid.  I recently played this game again for the first time in years.  That being said...I find the original TM game highly overrated.  It's not bad, but it's definitely one of the weaker ones in the series.

This game suffers from some control issues, lack of multi-player tournament, and the fact that there is only 6 levels, as opposed to the normal 8.  Like I said, it's not a bad game, but I think the thing that kills it is the lack of replay value.  You'll play it until you beat it (maybe), but after you beat it, there is literally no reason to play it again, unless you care about the storyline for every character.  The thing is, it's not like TM:Black, where the stories are really interesting.  I personally didn't care about the stories at all, but who knows, you may like them.

There's just not a whole lot to do in this game.  6 levels, and 1 boss.  There isn't even a Death Match mode in this game.  There are a couple levels you can unlock via cheat code, but the tournament is still too short.  I personally can't play this game for more than 30 minutes, I just get bored.

Ok, if it sounds like I'm being too harsh, well I kind of am.  The game is not bad.  For one thing, it has a great selection of cars.  Darkside, Crimson Fury and Yellow Jacket are some of my favorites, who only make very few appearances throughout the series.  Pit Viper should have stuck around as well.  When it comes down to it, I understand the budget was probably not very high.  This game feels more like a well made project than an actual game...which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  The game overall is ok, the good thing is that it only gets better from here, and it gives us a taste of how the series will evolve over time.

Pros

Great selection of cars
The levels that they do have are great, some of the best in the series
The music is amazing
Gave birth to the TM franchise
Introduces us to a concept that only gets better from here

Cons

Controls need more polish
Cars behave strangely at times
AI acts strange or glitches out from time to time (What is with that crazy spin thing they do?  Someone please explain this)
Special weapons could have been better
More levels needed
No Deathmatch
No Co-op Tournament
Just very clunky in general.  Nothing is fluid in this game, it feels like everything is bouncing, hopping, or spinning.

Overall, if you're a TM fan, you might as well buy it to add it to your collection.  It's not a bad game.  If you're new to the series, I recommend trying out TM2, TM:Black, or the PS3 version.  There's a lot more replay value and overall entertainment there.",3.0
"Its a bit harder than I remember it being and controls are rather awkward, takes a bit of getting used to... also, can't use analog setup.",3.0
"The other night one of my friends picked up the new Twisted Metal game for the PS3. After playing for a few minutes, a wave of memories came flooding back into my mind of the original vehicular combat game (well, besides Carmageddon), so I had to dust it off and throw it in the other day. To my surprise, I played for a couple of hours and found myself still enjoying it.

It looks awful. The controls are pretty unresponsive. The computer is unforgiving and the other cars are almost always at an advantage. So you must be wondering, why exactly did I enjoy this game? Maybe it was the nostalgia factor, but I think it was more of the fact that the game is so simplistic that you can jump right into it and play it without having to sacrifice a ton of time to do so. I beat the game in under an hour; there are only 6 levels to play through, each one amping up the difficulty. Players are not really rewarded for progressing through the game over multiple playthroughs. It is this lack of replayability that factors into my rating of the game.

The characters are memorable. There are 12 in total, each one coming with a ridiculous backstory.  Just about every one of these characters is balanced, offering enough of a challenge to make you think through your actions. Will you select Mr. Grimm, with his ultra powerful weapons, or sacrifice speed for a bruiser that can take a lot of damage, such as the monster truck? The bottom line is that there is something here for everyone.

The violence is so over the top that it's comical, rather than graphic. I won't focus on the story, because there isn't much of one. The game centers around an annual competition, in which the last ""man"" standing is granted a wish that he can use to get anything desired. I think it goes without saying that you're not picking this game up for the story line. At the end of the day, the game feels dated. Passwords take the place of save features, and the game has an arcade feel to it. The soundtrack is just good enough where it doesn't get annoying, but it is repetitive and far from memorable, having a heavy metal feel to it. In the end, don't expect to be overwhelmed by the games presentation. However, that does not mean that you shouldn't play this game if you haven't already done so. Any fan of video games or the Twisted Metal series can still appreciate this classic.",3.0
"I have played this through several times because the puzzles are excellent and you kill zombies.  There are many puzzles I still haven't solved and I may end up playing though again just to see whats there.  Also, some of the graphics were nice and I love the fear, even though I played RE's 2&3 first, this one scared me the most (but being the first I played, only RE2 gave me nightmares for months).  I will agree, this game is hard core, and there is plenty to like about it.  I love interactive movie feeling like Final Fantasy VII and Wing Commander: Prophecy.
However, now I will list what I didn't like.  Why I only gave it three stars.  Well, to start off, the cinematics are not only outdated, but horribly done to begin with.  If I made the game, I would have just said: ""Y'know, that was really bad, let's just not have a cinematic.""  Also, the movement is quite shabby and fake looking, and while a zombie hovers into a standing position, you can't shoot him until he is standing up and walking toward you.
If you think that such a picky thing about positioning, picking up items is worse.  You can commonly at a position in which you appear to be facing an item perfectly, but you can't pick it up, because it's really 30 degrees to your left or something like that.  With these positions, you are forced to listen to mind-numbing music.  I thought the sound effects were bad and the voice acting made the sound bad enough, but they had to go and give us the abolute worst soundtrack you will ever find, for any game or B-Movie.  The only trouble with the music is that you require listening to the sound effects to survive, and so you must endure the music as well!
However, the music is beaten in abysmal-ness by its dialogue.  The script is terrible, and to say the voice acting is laughably bad would be a huge understatement.  It doesn't end there.  The pitiful dialogue scenes do nothing but tell one of the most cliche-ridden plots ever devised.  You have police traitors, huge creatures that come out of rooms that you just came out of to kill you, and worst of all, you have about three dozen times through the two stories (which are almost identical) where people walk in just in the nick of time to save the other.  That type of stuff makes me sick.  You are alone for about two hours, when suddenly a trap goes off, right as your partner happens to be right outside.

"Twisted Metal started the whole car battle racing genre for the game consoles, but it was not the first of it's kind.  For that you have to look to the British video game Carmageddon.  It was the first and IMHO still the best one out there!

Both games now look a bit dated, but for sheer fun and mayhem, they can't be beat and Camageddon is the deeper game of the two.",3.0
"Twisted Metal 1-  Not the best game that I've played, but its pretty cool. Great for first time Twisted Metal gamers. After you've defeated it a few times and can beat your friends at it, move up a notch to TM2, which I think is the best of the all. You might not, though.
Bottom line is that if you are just starting to play the Twisted Metals, I would start with Twisted Metal 1.",3.0
"The gameplay gets fairly boring fairly quickly, and the graphics are excellent compared to an Atari 2600, but suck royally compared to PS3 (or PS2 for that matter).

What makes this game a gem is that you can beat up on someone until he simply can't continue and the ref calls the match.  Nothing like throwing the Hulkster against the ropes and hitting him with a rough neck foot to the face 80 times in a row until he can't get up to let of some steam at the end of a long day!

"This is the best game that WCW ever produced for the Playstation... but that's not saying much.  WCW NITRO and WCW THUNDER were horrible.  This game won't win any awards... but, at the very least, it's better than those wastes of space.
There are two things that I really liked about this game.  First of all, there's the gameplay.  It's so much better than the other WCW games!  It's a lot less complex than the button mashing madness of NITRO and THUNDER.  Secondly, I liked the title competition mode.  You can create titles and defend them against the computer and other player-controlled characters.  It's the best part of the game!",3.0

"Tenchu: Stealth assassin - Circa

GOOD:

- Easy and fun stealth gameplay

- nice/tight controls

BAD:

- Really dated graphics

- Stealth gameplay can be overly simple

- Little replay value with not much to unlock

WILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:

- Ancient Japanese samurai and swords theme

- Ninja Stealth gameplay, more fun hack and slash then overly complex (think more Metal Gear then Splinter Cell)

- Two playable characters one male and one female

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:

- Tenchu 2: Birth of the assassin

- Metal Gear Solid

- Siphon Filter

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- Getting a better ninja rank at the end of missions unlocks much better items",3.0
"The first Tenchu to come out (which is the reason why there isn't a number behind Tenchu) and the first Tenchu I have ever played, also the Tenchu that forced me to fall in love with the series. When I first played the game it was love at first sight, no one-night stand here, this one's a keeper. The game takes place in Feudal Japan; the game starts at the time period and impressively stays there through the entire game. You won't find anything you wouldn't find in the time period (Yes, Feudal Japan did have guns). Some people would complain about the over-exaggerated bloodshed and the sometimes-cheesey dialogue. I must disagree with these people these two factors made me enjoy the game even more. ""What the hell!?! Why would that make a game better?"" You maybe asking, well those two features made me feel as though I was watching an old Japanese Kung-Fu movie, minus the kung fu that's how I believe you must think of this game to fully enjoy it. After watching the ending I believe that's the effect the creators wanted to put in this game, after seeing the end sequence yourself you'll know what I mean. Of course the bad camera angles sometimes made this game annoying. In order to block your opponent's attacks you must hold down which a lot of the time backed you into a corner.... The reason I only gave it three stars? I don't think this is a game for everyone, that's why. I believe this game will be a rare collectible in the future, so buy this game now and save yourself future trouble.",3.0
"If you didn't like the original Twisted Metal don't bother Reading this review -- nothing substantial has changed in the sequel. If you liked the original Twisted Metal don't bother reading this review either -- there's plenty of new cars and tracks in the sequel. If you don't fall into the above categories, read on. The Twisted Metal story is simple. Each year, a dozen-or-so misfits and malcontents meet for a battle royale in souped-up cars straight out of Death Race 2000. The last person alive gets any wish granted by Calypso, the man behind the Twisted Metal competition. Your job is to take control of one the these cars in a variety of locations and then blast your opponents to kingdom come. Graphically, the game is identical to the original Twisted Metal. On the plus side, the landscapes are richly detailed and the battlefields are complex. On the minus side, the texture-maps still look horrible up close and clipping and pop-in is still plentiful. The game also controls much the same as the original. This means you will eventually choose your ride based on a combination of 1) how cool it looks and 2) how often its handling doesn't make you want to throw your controller through the TV screen. This time around, there are plenty of tracks and a wider variety of vehicles. It appears that Single Trac listened to the folks on Usenet and included cool new cars like a hearse, a bulldozer and a grotesque man/car thing, Axel, that gives me the willies. Also new to this game are ""special moves"" that anyone can pull off. These include a freeze ray, a shield, and reverse weapons.
The game still shines in the two player mode. Life doesn't get much better than chasing your buddy around in a cop car and nailing him with a tazer. In fact, if you are into two-player games, there's no reason for you not to buy this game. Overall, Twisted Metal 2 is a cool game with plenty of replay value if you like beating a game 12 different ways or are into two-player games. It's just a bit surprising that the game looks so much like the original. I guess they decided ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"".",3.0

This was a Christmas gift from my grandmother and even though I like the game but to me it was a major step down to the first game.  The boss fight were a major disappointment mainly because of that stupid three hit rule.  N. Gin should've been the final boss not Dr. Neo Cortex.  The final boss fight against him is just a stupid race and you only have to hit him three lousy times.  He has a blaster and yet he never uses it.  The ending was a major downer because it falls horrible short.  The soundtrack is at least great but not as a good as the first games.  Tawna being dropped was a mistake because it made that whole adventure in the first game feel like it wasn't worth it.  I can't believe she dumped him shortly after he rescued her for Pinstripe.  He tried to kill Crash in order to keep him from rescuing her.  Now that is cold hearted.  Still is a good game but not as good as the first.,3.0

"A decent ps1 classic but not really true 3d platformer like croc or mario64 of the same era. I never understood why crash is restrained to levels that are basically hallways, very linear, not much depth. Yes you still get '3d' movement but its restrained by limited levels so it almost 2.5 d in a sense. Graphically this was one of the noticably low polygon games that suffered from flickering and sometimes missing polygons on characters and levels. the 32 bit era polygon games have not aged well. Graphics suffer from texture warping, poly flickering and jaggies and it doesn't help that the ps1 had the worst video ram,system ram and resolution of that generation of systems. This has to be a very common game from the ps1 era, I cannot understand why people think its disc based version is worth north of 20. Hello people, wake up, there is a psn digital version for 5.99. Since when does a digital psn re release warrant a skyrocket in disc version prices. The value of a game should be based on rarity and a greatest hits game that has be re released digitally is anything but rare. Do yourself a favor don't pay more than 10-15 for the disc version anymore and your over paying. I see crazy prices on auction sites like 40 and above seriously is it worth it to pay 34.00 over to have a plastic disc.",3.0
"Though officially the 4th installment in the MK series, Mortal Kombat 4 followed one upgrade game, a compilation game, and a Sub-Zero spinoff game, making it around the 7th actual produced game for the series. It was the first game to utilize a 3-D engine, and the first MK game to feature weapons combat.

While the 3-D engine was a refreshing change of pace after the stale, sprite-based animation of the previous entries, in truth MK4 gets dull rather quickly. Without the 3-D engine, it's pretty much the same as previous installments, only with less characters and less finishing moves. The idea to finally drop the silly finishers like Friendships and Babalities was a good one, but once you go through all the finishers and stage fatalities, you've pretty much seen it all. The basic fight engine is solid, but feels a little too simplistic and generic. The pre-programmed combos were toned down, which should be a good thing, but after awhile you miss the 'wow' factor that came with delivering them. The sidestepping button doesn't really do enough to change things, and weapons are so easily lost that its not worth pulling them out except for the coolness factor.

MK4's still decent and worth buying if you find a used cartridge around, but only because the N64 seriously lacked solid fighting games. The Playstation had plenty of 2-d and 3-d fighters that made MK4 pale in comparison. It's still fun to go a few rounds with friends, and its a nice pre-cursor to the more advanced Deadly Alliance and Deception, but the game just doesnt leave you satisfied.",3.0

"The very first 3D Mortal Kombat offers great graphics, new 3D worlds, the return of several fighters, tournaments, 2 on 2 kombat and much more. Scorpion, Goro, Reptile and others return to the game with a few new fighters, however the bad part is that all of the new characters have similar powers as the old characters that were not in the game. Another bad part is that unlike the past few Mortal Kombat games is that this game is very quick to beat and it lacks challenge. To make up for it though, there are the most awesome fatalities of any game, such as Scorpion's very realistic fire, the spinal removal from Sub Zero with a total 3D effect and Liu Kang's throwing his opponent straight toward the camera. Each fighter now has weapons as well to add flavor to the fight.",3.0
"This is definitely a fun platformer and a good first attempt at the genre by Naughty Dog.

Graphics (8/10) - The environments look very lush and colorful. From what I've seen, the game has none of the typical warping PS1 games are known for. It still holds up well today.

Sound (6/10) - Mostly average tunes here. Nothing I'd demand to put on my iPod, but it gets the job done and fits the game well.

Gameplay (8/10) - The game controls well even though you have to use the D-pad, since the analog support didn't exist when the game came out. The game itself is a challenging, fast-paced platformer that moves fairly linearly. It's a lot of fun.

"I will confess I never finished this game, but thankfully I won't need to curtsey of the RE-make for GameCube. I had originally started this series with RE 2, and decided to back track to the first one for the sake of finding out who Chris was, and why Claire was looking for him. However the horrid control, horrid graphics were bearable, but the lousy voice acting was not. I couldn't stand it because here was a great classic B-Movie story (and I love B-movies) with F-Movie acting. Everything about this game became cheesy. I then bought the director's cut hoping for better voice acting... well at least I got my wish a couple weeks ago. I then bought the dual shock edition.... yeah, I'm kind of bitter, but I won't hold a grudge because Capcom and Nintendo provided me with what I wanted recently. But this game could have been better, even for the time it was released; at least the voice acting could have been better. Now that the remake is available with all the good things about the original intact, plus some fiercely improved graphics, sound and dialogue (although I miss the ""Master of Unlocking"" line) there is no need to bother with this game.",3.0

"Product arrived far sooner than I had expected, and arrived in great condition, save for a few scratches here and there on the disc.

Aside from a little scratch or two, the game plays perfectly, and just as well as I remember it in the good old days. Back when game developers focused on the structure of the game and not just the graphics or any fancy sh** like that. This was back when 90% of the games at the time were all good, simple, and had such great repetitive value. Back when the ruling mascots were Crash, Mario and Sonic. Damn, it just brings tears to my eyes I tell ya.

My only real nitpick for this product was the case it came in, the jewel case was flimsy, and the tape holding it close was not really necessary, so it broke when I tried opening it. Aside from that, I am satisfied in the long run. I recommend this seller.

[UPDATE][UPDATE][UPDATE]

A little update on the product. The game plays alright up until a certain level very close to the beginning; 'Rolling Stones' to be specific, then it just flat out freezes and sits there. This really doesn't surprise me, these games are almost 20 years old, and it is rare to find a used one in perfect condition. I'll give this one game a little extra time and try multiple times to see if the level will play.

I won't change my opinion about this seller, I am not frustrated, or anything. I got the game in a great time window, it was cheap, and it works at least. Just a little advice to anyone distributing aged games like these; I'd suggest trying to at least play these used games through and make sure they work 90% at least. Time consuming? Maybe, but in the end, the seller gets money, and the customer gets their money's worth and their satisfaction is guaranteed. Fair trade, everyone wins.

I'll give it another week or two of trying it, if I can't get it to play past that point, then I may be returning it.",3.0

"Back in 1996 the ps1 needed a mascot so naughty dog made crash it was 3d with 2.5d sections but just 20 some days after this game was released Mario 64 came out now Mario 64 was better because it brought a new 3d open world which had never been done in platformers before. While crash just seemed like your typical platfomer turned to 3d now this game at the time this game had better graphics than Mario 64 but gameplay was not as epic of a masterpiece as Mario 64. I,m not sure if this is true but naughty dog said they originally designed this game to be open world but then made it linear to make the game more action packed and fast paced. Now this game has perfect graphics for 1996 and great mascot some really fun challenging levels now you only have one hit point but if you get the witch doctor masks then you will get another hit point. Now the main problem with this game is the save system and the difficulty the game's save system is in certain levels there will be 3 pictures of his girlfriend and you have to find them and then go through a bonus round now if you die in the bonus round you don't get save now that really sucks and some of the levels are way too hard such as slippery slope sunset vista the road to nowhere and the high road now I did beat the game but it took a while because in this game you have to memorize the levels alot and i'm not that good at memorizing stuff and even if you are the game will still be very hard now the boss are ridiculously easy and the story is simple wich isn't a bad thing but it is just barely told out. The main thing that this game lacks is gameplay wow factor now i have played other really hard games but they still have some type of gameplay wow factor. This game also has occasionally sluggish controls. This is naughty dog's 1st decent game the ones after this are pretty damn awesome. The ones before this were horrible such as keef the thief for PC,rings of power for the Sega genesis,and way of the warrior for the 3do. It is hard to believe that the same company who made this game and the ones before it made crash 2,crash 3,ctr,jak and daxter,and uncharted all great games that are some of the best games that i have ever played. so get this if you are either a hardcore crash fan or a hardcore naughty dog fan like me other wise pass it.",3.0

"Back when the Sony Playstation and Nintendo 64 were first released, people were getting all excited over Super Mario 64 in 1996.  It was new, it was innovative.  It had something.  Meanwhile, the Sony Playstation got Crash Bandicoot, and this was described as a game that could take Mario on at his own game.  That, of course, didn't happen, as Mario still holds the torch.  However, Crash Bandicoot wasn't a bad game.  It was, however, a bit more flawed than most other games out there for certain reasons, the main one seeming to be its unforgiving difficulty.  There were, of course, other mitigating factors.

Crash Bandicoot carries the--even then--overdone save the damsel in distress storyline, ala Mario saving Princess Peach over and over.  Much like Mario, however, Crash wasn't about storyline.  It was about gameplay, and here it's just as simplistic as it is in your average 2D side-scroller.  Crash only has two attacks.  His spinning attack and a jump attack.  You'll use this to take down your enemies.  There are advantages to using one attack over the other.  For example, the spinning attack can potentially send enemies flying into other enemies while the jump attack gives Crash some extra air, which is actually needed to access some of the games little secrets.

Throughout each level, Crash also has the ability to obtain Aki-Aki.  A mask that serves to protect Crash.  If you have one you can sustain two hits before you die.  If you have two you can sustain three hits.  If you have three you'll be temporarily invincible.  The game also makes it a point to give you an Aki-Aki if you're dying too many times in a certain level, and believe me, that'll happen a lot.  The good news is that Crash Bandicoot isn't shy about giving you extra lives.  The bad news is that you'll still mow through a lot of them pretty quickly.  A lot of the times things are just unfair.  The camera is permanently fixed behind Crash, so sometimes it's hard to predict jumps, or sometimes even where some enemies are.  Also, the amount of surprises they throw at you can be annoying as well.  Like a bridge where the planks fall out and then you get to what is seemingly a dead end only to find out that you've no time to look because the plank your standing on is also lose.  Thus, you've no choice but to go through a lot of trial and error in levels.

To its credit, though, Crash Bandicoot has a variety of levels.  There's the basic 3D platforming where you basically run through the level in a straight line with the camera behind you, but there are some levels that make you go about the old fashioned way by these levels being 2D side-scrollers.  There are also levels where you'll run from a boulder in Indiana Jones style, levels where you'll ride on a hog.  You'll get your fill from these levels.  Although, many level designs are also very simplistic and straightforward.  There's not a whole lot of exploration to be done, and even when you can veer off course, you'll only be backtracking to get back on the right course.  In short, many levels are just too linear.

Mastering the game is also fairly difficult.  Throughout each level there are crates that you have to smash.  If you smash all the crates, you score a perfect.  Seems simple right?  Well, the catch is you have to smash every crate in the level without dying.  And again, with some unfair camera angles in some levels, and the trial and error, you'll be attempting to score a perfect on a level several times.  Likewise, it seems strange that the levels are so difficult yet the games bosses are so easily taken down--including the final boss Dr. Neo Cortex.  Most boss battles aren't a challenge, but getting to them sure as hell is.

Even the games save system is flawed.  As you go through each and every level you'll find tokens that'll let you catch a glimpse of the girl Crash is out to save in this game.  The problem is this token is hidden in crates throughout the level.  The second problem is that you need three of them.  The THIRD problem is that you have to go through some stupid mini-level in order for your game to actually be saved.  They're played out in a 2D side-scroller like fashion with the exception that even in these levels there are some 3D elements, which again require trial and error to get through sometimes.  At least you don't lose a life... just the chance to save your game.  The FOURTH problem with this is that once you collect all three tokens, whether you were able to make it through the bonus round and save your game or not, you can't get them again.  Thus in each level you're only given the chance to save once, and you may not even get it!  This is inexcusable.  The later installments of the series certainly did a better job with the save feature.  There's also a password system here for those who don't have a memory card, and that's really nice to have.  Again, however, it sucks that you only really get one chance to save.  You can save after scoring a perfect on a level, but again, that's a one time deal.  You can't go to an easy level, score a perfect and save again.

Despite its gameplay issues, Crash Bandicoot looked good at least.  Especially for a game released in 1996.  It runs fairly smoothly, and just looks great for the time of its release.  It wasn't a launch title, but at least it was a game that was easy on the eyes.  The levels also look good and even too this day the game still has a particular visual charm to it.  It can't hold a candle up to today's graphics but in 1996 this was a charmer.  The game also didn't sound so bad either.  Some tunes do get annoying, but a lot of tunes really satisfy the levels, and the sound effects are brilliant.  As far as presentation goes, Crash Bandicoot really knew how to hand it to us.

Unfortunately, it's unforgiving difficulty may actually be enough to turn some fans away after a while.  Was it a good game?  Sure it was.  But the first installment just had a lot of unforgiving issues that thankfully were worked out in the second game.  It's not bad for a first outing, but a game shouldn't be so unforgiving in its difficulty.

Pros:

+It's a good looking game

+It sounds good

+Simple gameplay that anyone can pick up and learn

+A variety of levels

+Tons of secrets and little things to do; you'll be busy just trying to complete the game 100%

Cons:

-The difficulty level of this game is unforgiving

-Bad camera angles

-The games levels are difficult yet the games bosses are disturbingly easy

-A lot of trial and error moments

-Many levels are too linear

-The save system set up is absolutely horrible

It's still a good game, but later games in the series do a far better job.",3.0
This game was fun and all but it was hard as heck. It was so hard that I had to put in a cheat to get all levels so I could skip the levels I couldn't beat.

"Seeing as how this is the first Crash game, it pains me to have to give this game a 3. The only thing that makes this game not quite as good as the others is it's lack of a very big story(and not to mention a horrible ending). Otherwise, this game isn't so bad. I give this game a 3 and a half. The graphics, gameplay, and music are fairly good. This game got me into the whole Crash Bandicoot Trilogy; and the games just get better along the way!",3.0
"I bought this game when I first got my PS1 because I loved playing my cousin's Crash Bandicoot 2 game. While this game is fun, the part I hate about it is you have no control over when you can save the game. You are given the option at odd points in the game, and even if you beat 3 levels after the level you saved at, if you start over, you'll start at the level you saved at, and not the one you most recently beat.
...I recommend getting this game because it IS fun...",3.0
"Crash Bandicoot. It came out of nowhere, like a force of nature it rumbled and made it's mark on the video game industry, and revolutionized the plat-former game subgenre forever. With it's crips beautiful flawless graphics to it's incredible tight gameplay, it was a platformers dream. And Possibly the most fun in-depth game up until then. Now 5 years since it's been, it still remains, (if not for me) one of the most memorable, and feel-good games. The games strurture is a rather simple one, Crash must travle and wade through 3 islands to rescue his girl freind-Twana from the clutches of Dr. Neo Cortex (hpm...sounds a bit like Mario, anyways..) What always stuck out about this first game in this future triology was that it had a strong sense of atmosphere to it...more athuentic than any of it's upcoming sequels. Was it becasue the makers stuck more to coming up with more varied gameplay ...possibly. Not a bad thing at all, which is one of the things that made the sequels better. While Crash Bandicoot can be a very enjoyable experience, it can be seen today as something along the lines of ""out-dated"". The level structures have a lot of depth--which makes for considerable replay value, but compared to it's sequels, their almost childlike. Sure the levels vary , but advancments in game-pay was not this instalments strength. Still the game is fun as hell, and with it's island-jumping structure ,makes it feel your in more of an adventure than the other games do. And while the game make look kiddy and cheerful, this first instalment has a genuine rotten underbelly to it as you venture father into the game, it has a considerable dark quality to it as you get to more advanced levels. If anything the 3rd game ""Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped"" has the most lightest tone. I would label the first games atmopshere as more of a ""grey"" while the second game would be a ""black"" natuarlly ""Cortex Strikes Back"" has the darkest tone. And the 3rd ""white""-being the rousing conclusion, sort of like a movie triolgy.

"Croc is one of those games I only had a small chance encounter with when I was younger. The demo disc that came with my PlayStation back in 1997 had a demo of the game and by all accounts I was pretty taken with. The graphics were bright and colorful, the world it presented (and by extension Croc and the Gobbos) were cute and likable and overall it seemed to be a pretty solid 3D platformer. Developed by Argonaut Software who developed the Super FX technology used in Nintendo's Star Fox on the SNES in the early 1990's, I ordered a copy of the game based on those memories... but fifteen years is a long time to be away from any game and with advancements in gaming this leaves little room for error. Unfortunately, if the title of this review is any indication, Croc pretty much squanders most of the good will its positives bring to the table and only serves as a history lesson as to why the series never saw daylight after the 32-bit generation.

Almost all of Croc's problems center on the controls. Well, it's not completely on the controls, rather it's a combination of the controls AND a camera that does whatever it wants - but if it wasn't for this I firmly believe more people would remember it. The game's controls are not unlike those in Core Design/Edios' Tomb Raider series - which in today's world some people find rather archaic - but I'm still at home with them since I grew up with that game. What makes Croc different (and ultimately more problematic) is the camera is not completely locked behind Croc at every moment. This makes certain moments of the game painful to play and its because these controls are more befitting of a game like Tomb Raider where the game world is more technical being built on a grid of squares. This isn't the case with Croc.

Well, that's kind of a lie because the further you get in the Legend of Gobbos the more technical (and challenging) the levels are with all their little platforms and obstacles where the clunky controls become a real liability. Even worse are the controls when Croc is underwater or doing a mini-game as these sections are simply horrendous. The situation with the controls is a real shame since the game (aside from the utterly pathetic boss battles) would still be astounding today if it wasn't for them. It's (kind) of possible to enjoy Croc despite its problems but I personally had to play the game in small bite-sized portions to really avoid my building frustrations - a red flag for a gamer if there ever was one.

Despite Croc's shortcomings I can't really tell people to flat-out avoid the game. I still have a soft spot for it (and the characters) despite what I experienced while playing through it. Still, if you can I'd recommend trying - or revisting - the game before you buy it. For those that played Croc when it originally came out nostalgia might be enough to save it, but those without an attachment to the IP will quickly see the game as the ailing entity it is.",3.0
"Spyro the Dragon was something of a mascot back in the very late 90s for Sony, along with Crash Bandicoot. Developed by Insomniac after being acquired by Universal Interactive and the good but poorly sold Disruptor, this first game feels very ambitious in its goals, and, while a very good 3D ""platformer"" for its time, is dated by its vastly superior successors, in that the controls and mechanics are loose and not nearly as tight or improved as they were later on. Insomniac Games was the new kid on the block, and while their first game is dated, it was their first shot at a 3D platformer, and in that way, it's a very well-made game. It's just that you have the other two to play...",3.0
"Croc, original released in 1997 had the same appeal that Crash Bandicoot had.  It was a simplistic game that was absolutely gorgeous to look at.  Obviously inspired by Crash Bandicoot and Super Mario 64, Croc was a game that could've been for everyone.  However, lackluster controls and a bad camera make Croc more frustrating than fun.

As with most games aimed at the younger audience, Croc has a simple story.  The Gobbos have been kidnapped by an evil Baron.  It's up to Croc to save the Gobbos and stop the Baron.  And he'll traverse four worlds to do it.

The level layout of Croc is surprisingly good.  Levels are pretty straightforward but you'll be able to veer off path whenever you need to.  In every level your goal is to get to the end and ring the gong.  Along the way Croc will be faced with enemies and natural traps like lava or freezing waters.  In every level you'll also collect gems.  From level to level the total gems you finish with stack up on each other.  For every 100 gems you'll get an extra life, and you'll need those lives.  There are also six Gobbos in every level you venture to.  Five of them are scattered throughout the level randomly.  However, the last Gobbo requires you to find five special gems and open a special door at the end of a level.  Upon finding those gems and opening a special door, the game will usually make you play some kind of bonus game or solve a puzzle to get the last Gobbo.  Some of these parts of the game are incredibly frustrating.  For example, in one bonus game you'll have to make Croc jump on buttons in order to ""whack"" sheep in a sort of Whack the Mole fashion.  However, it speeds up and the controls aren't all that friendly.

That may very well be the biggest problem with Croc.  The game is such a pain to control.  You'll suffer a lot for this.  Up always moves Croc forward but the camera is always moving.  Croc doesn't turn sharp enough so you'll mostly spend time stopping and turning so that you can continue on your way.  This wouldn't be so bad if there weren't enemies on your tail or if you didn't have to stop and turn on a collapsing platform.  Even worse is the camera.  You don't get control over it at all.  The view doesn't shift fast enough which may lead to you running into an enemy simply because you don't know where it is, or having to quickly jump off a collapsing platform.  These issues make Croc--an already challenging game as it is--harder than it has to be.  It's frustrating as well.  The game has potential, and the right gameplay elements, but the controls make it too hard.  However, it is still a good challenge.  Completing the game 100% by finding all the Gobbos and getting the second ending is a task in and of itself.

What Croc lacks in gameplay it certainly makes up for in everything else.  The game looks stunning.  Especially for a Playstation game in 1997.  The FMVs look incredible, the bosses look spectacular.  The environments look incredible as well.  There are hardly any Playstation games that look this smooth or run this well.  The soundtrack is also a beautiful soundtrack.  In terms of production values, Croc is an astonishing game to behold.

In short, Croc is a good game, but a game that would've been so much better if it didn't suffer from such horrible controls and a bad camera.  It's a fun game, but only barely so.  There will be many gamers who won't be able to let those issues slide.",3.0
"This game has everything it needs to be GREAT! It IS great. I've never played Croc 2, scared off by difficulties in the first one. Yes, I agree, the controls are horrible. I can remember spending 7 minutes climbing platforms only to miss a cage, jump down, take 5 minutes back up, and fall down right before the top. <SCREAM> It made me even madder because the characters are the cutest, you collect things like Spyro and Ty, it's the cutest story, and I WANT to play it so, so badly...but the diificult controls make that impossible. For ""Greatest Hit"" couldn't they have fixed that ONE problem?? If they fix the camera/controls and make Croc 3, I will pre-order it.",3.0
"The Spyro the Dragon franchise holds a special place in my heart for some of the best(Year Of The Dragon, final game made by Insomniac for PS1) and worst (Enter The Dragonfly for PS2) games I've ever played in my life. It's appropriate to first review the very first, which to this day is revered by the critics. And, I get what they're trying to say. There's excellent graphics for 1998, and the soundtrack, done by the drummer of The Police Stewart Copeland is great and it stays in your head all day long. (Stone Hill) I'm not sure how they managed to convince him to write music for a VIDEO GAME, but he pulled it off. Anyways, now for the cons.
Spyro The Dragon is a very, very, very easy game. And I'm not even the best gamer you will meet. I can't get past God Of War II without practically breaking a controller (I literally did break my controller while playing Ape Escape 2, an even easier game, as a little kid... Hehhehehe..). The bosses are cookie-cutter, there is literally no story behind each level (OK, you have to eventually kill Gnasty Gnorc. Besides that, there is zero story.), and the last few levels lose some of the charming design that won me over with the first world (You know, before I realized how easy this game was). The very final level, Twilight Harbor, leaves you going in a series of straight paths, with no other direction to go. It's COMPLETELY against the free-roaming, 3D gameplay that this game was praised by critics for. There are no spoilers in this game, you know what's going to happen ever since the very beginning. Gnasty Gnorc freezes all of the dragons in stone, you save the dragons, then kill Gnasty Gnorc. Proceed to celebrations. Gnasty Gnorc, a final boss, is too easy as well. You charge across another series of paths, reminiscent of Twilight Harbor, and flame his butt until he dies. The end.",3.0
"Let me start out by saying that I am a huge Civilization fan...but....the Playstation version does not hold a candle to the PC version.  The PS screen is cloudy and difficult to see, especially your own cities growth numbers.  It's difficult to determine whose winning a battle as the stamina bar is impossible to see.  My absolute biggest problem w/ the PS version is not having ""auto"" control over settlers.  On the PC game you can set settlers to auto so they go around building roads and mining etc.. You have to do it all yourself on playstation.  Do you know how boring it is to build 5,000 roads w/ 20 settlers??  Some people want to micromanage every aspect, but there is zero strategy to be gained from controlling settlers yourself, zero.  Why take this option away?  I think this explains why they never made another version for the playstation.  Civilization is a game that apparently must be played on a computer.",3.0
"Lets just say, the other 2 are better (jmo). I borrowed this game from a friend and it was okay. The first warp room was good but once you got farther through the game I didn't like it. I know alot of people liked it but in my eyes Year of the Dragon was much better.",3.0
"What I must first say is that this game is incredibly easy, and no, I am not an adult. I am 13 years old, and I got this when I was 12. The levels of the first world, Artisans, are super easy with a very easy boss. It's harder to GET TO the boss than it is to beat it. The levels just seem to keep getting just a tad bit harder, but nothing significant. The hardest boss is the boss of the second level and he isn't very hard either. Gnasty Gnorc is a surprisingly easy boss, once you figure out how to toast him. What makes this game annoying is that there is so much treasure, spread out into so many different places, that you will just rip your hair out in some of the levels trying to get it. But there are some pros. This game is a little bit long making for long lasting entertainment. The game also has great graphics with a frame rate that never slows down, and because between screens, the game is counting treasure, so it's like there's never a single load time. Also, some of the enemies are pretty funny, like in one level, if you do the right thing at the right time, the enemy will actually MOON you, and it's hilarious to see. Also, the controls are simple enough for anyone to figure out making for not much trouble otherwise. Some points of the game are hard like recovering stolen eggs from the theives, but besides that, this is an easy game that I would recommend to anyone below teenage age. The only reason I gave this game three stars was because I know most people like a good challenge, but it wouldn't be fair to give it four just because I personally like an easy game. Still good though.",3.0

It took me 10 hours to beat the game just because the puzzle solving is very hard on normal mode. You can play an arrange game where you have unlimited ammo for a sub machine gun which is cheating but is part of the game when you first turn it on. This game is fun and challanging the first few plays with whatever character, (You can be Claire Redfield or Leon Kennedy.) but it will be a bore when you finish it.",3.0

"People used to make a big deal how Star Fox 64 was supposedly an improvement over the Super NES's Star Fox.  Not in my world it's not.  Star Fox 64 uses eye candy and colorful animations to disguise several moments of mediocrity.  No doubt it uses eye candy to disguise the lack of challenge.  The reason the Super NES's Star Fox was so successful is because it's able to combine challenge with really intense atmosphere giving the gamer the impression he's helpless in the galaxy (especially whenever your life is low- a feeling you hardly encounter in Star fox 64).  The pressure would get really intense whenever you begin to lose your teammates (Peppy, Slippy and Falco) and you wonder how much longer you'll be able to survive.  However I feel no pressure whatsoever in Star Fox 64 regardless how many of my animal friends go down or how low my health meter is.

I think the game is going for a cinematic feel while completely ignoring a degree of challenge.  The game certainly *looks* good.  Another problem is that the enemy variety is really lackluster and you're hardly ever swarmed with too many enemies which is a negative in my book because it means the intensity of the flight shooting isn't quite strong or memorable enough overall.  The music is another major disappointment.  Whereas on the Super NES the music was extremely catchy, suspenseful and memorable, no such treatment occurs here in Star Fox 64.  Instead every stage has quiet generic hard rock with no noticeable melody and it sounds really average to me.

While I don't mind having your team constantly radioing in and giving advice, it was a better format on the Super NES when they didn't actually speak.  This is because Peppy, Slippy and Falco talk a LOT.  Slippy in particular sounds like a child which is grating.  The enemy Andross talks a lot too.  Every few seconds you'll hear them speak and while some of the stuff they say is surprisingly enjoyable, I don't really want to hear it every time I fly a mission.  Most everything they say is playful anyway.  The explosion of enemy aircrafts tends to feel like an afterthought too, with no suspense occurring there either.  Tame explosions instead of violent and memorable ones like in the original Star Fox.  This is partly due to enemies appearing significantly less frequently than in the Super NES's Star Fox.

Well let me mention the levels.  Meteo is decent but a boring imitation of the same type of dark space stage we see in the Super NES's Star Fox where you're constantly surrounded by flying boulders and a high danger level.  In fact that's the biggest problem with this game- you swerve around traps and enemies *some* times, but it's never a very threatening or frequent occurrence.  It's a very tame flight you're taking most of the time.  Fortuna is a generic level with lots of flying and very little action.  Sector X is a high point due to featuring several moments of swarming around dangerous traps and closing objects while Titania is a pretty decent level while driving around on the ground in the landmaster vehicle.

Boise Defense Outpost contains a force field, and it gets tedious chasing enemies for a while.  Katina is tedious as well since it takes forever to open hatches on enemies.  It's boring.  Solar is awesome however since it involves dodging giant snake-shaped fireballs.  Macbeth is a train chase on the landmaster.  It's a pretty fun stage but the boss fight is once again tedious since it takes forever to defeat.  Sector Y is an awesome outer space dark level avoiding floating space crafts.  Aquas Ocean is even MORE awesome!  Hey alright, some memorable levels for a change.  The statues you fly past are quite intimidating and the sight to see in this stage.  The eye candy graphics from the explosions are unique too.

Toxic Waste Area is a unique toxic ocean level with a tough as nails boss fight made of armor.  The snakes coming out of the toxic water is cool too.  Sector Z is generic and forgettable since it lacks combat.  Area 6 contains a memorable disappearing disc-shaped tentacle boss with a giant golden-colored planet in the background.  I admire this stage's appearance.  Venom: Andross Homeworld begins on a lackluster note featuring generic enemy chasing and shooting, but immediately after this part is over the level turns WAY more intense and atmospheric (claustrophobic in particular).  The Andross boss itself is memorable mainly for the intimidating appearance of his first form and less about the second form which involves shooting aimlessly and hoping you hit your target.

Boss fights feel significantly less suspenseful perhaps due to them being easy with predictable weak points for one thing, and also the lack of suspenseful music.  This is why the Super NES version is so much better.  Don't get me wrong guys, I *do* admire this game, but I almost never feel like playing it knowing a better version of Star Fox is out there.",3.0
"Everyone tells me that Starfox 64 has it all: a great story mode, creative bosses, well thought of voice samples, and a fantastic multiplayer experience. Starfox 64 is another classic game on the Nintendo 64. It's designed to be a space shooter, where you fly through levels shooting down enemies and occasionally saving your friends behinds.

Now, never playing this game until very recently, it was hard for me to judge the game based on my opinion. All I've heard about this game is that it is a classic, but when I played it for the first time recently, it was hard for me to consider this game a ""classic"". The game play was very easy and also very short. I've heard that there are some secret levels, but none that I have discovered yet. During the game you are accompanied by some of your fellow pilots, who constantly need saving. A few times is ok, but in my opinion the creators of this game should have made pilots that knew how to take better care of themselves because there always whining and complaining. Don't get me wrong, this game was really fun; it has great graphics for when it was made, and definitely managed to keep me entertained throughout it. The only problem is that I'm not a valid reviewer because I didn't play it when I was a kid and I have been influenced by the greater technology and systems we have today.

Overall, I rate this game a 3 out of 5 for its graphic appeal, but its lack in greater story mode. I only wish my mom got this game for me as a child.",3.0

"Mario Party started a 10-long installment (thus far) installment of fun and great times. Luckily, it happens to be the worst installment in the franchise. The graphics are sub-par, the gameplay is more simplistic, and the mini-games are less numerous and exciting. Many the of the mini-games are just inane, boring, or frustrating, such: Grab Bag, Slot Car Derby, etc. The music in the game is great though, and is its strongest suit. I'd really only purchase the original Mario Party if you happen to be a huge fan of the series, like I've become. If you're not, it really doesn't justify paying the price these games are currently going for.",3.0
"If theres something to be sure of in this world, its that the Mario Party franchise will never die. As of the day of this review, the most recent entry is Mario Party 9, which is remarkable for a series of video games that pushes mini-games to the forefront. Since 1998, these party games have shown up on every Nintendo console since the N64 (and even on the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS). They were simple and didn't bring anything revolutionary to the table in gaming, but they were meant to be fun, quirky games that brought friends and family together to have a good time. Still, what about the first title? With all the Mario Party games released over the years, the original Mario Party is easily forgotten. But, its definitely important for being the genesis of the series, and I thought Id do a retrospective review on this Nintendo 64 classic.

To start with, Party Mode (or Adventure, as the computer calls it) is the main focus of the game. Unlike future installments of Mario Party, there isn't really a plot, so much as every character wants to be the Superstar of the land. Gameplay takes place on a board of your choosing with varying degrees of difficulty, and each board reflects one of the 6 playable characters (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Wario, and Donkey Kong). You roll a dice block to move around the board, collect coins by landing on blue spaces or playing mini-games (either on a single-player space or everybody after all 4 players move), and purchasing Stars with your hard-earned coins. Coins can also be lost by landing on red spaces, visiting Bowser or landing on his space, or having them stolen by another player via Boo (interestingly, his coin-stealing services are free here, although you tend to get fewer coins than future titles grant you for paying him 5). Items wouldnt become a fixture until Mario Party 2, so here players can land on a mushroom space that either gives you an extra roll or causes you to lose your next turn. Green ? spaces cause a happening to occur, most of which change the environment, which can absolutely screw over other players.

Stars are primarily obtained by visiting Toad on the board and paying 20 coins, although they can be stolen via Chance Time (blue ! spaces, which exchange coins or stars among players by chance), or visiting Boo and paying him 50 coins to take one from a player of your choosing. Bonus Stars are awarded at the end of a game to the player with the most coins at one time, most coins won in mini-games, and for most Happenings triggered. When the game ends, your coins and stars are tallied and collected, which you can use in the Mushroom Shop on the main menu. I thought it was cool that you could buy things like mini-games, special dice blocks (which can switch your place with another players, give or take away coins based on your roll, etc.), coin banks that increase your end-game total, and even a new board: Bowsers Magma Mountain. It was a good way of getting you to keep playing, even if Mario Party was frustrating at times. Getting 100 stars and beating all boards gets you the Eternal Star board, too.

The main draw of Mario Party is the mini-games. Most are very enjoyable, and I consider a handful of the 50-odd mini-games to be my favorites of the series, like Bumper Balls, Bombs Away, Mushroom Mix-up, and Bombsketball. Sadly though, the consequences for losing are downright unfair in this installment of Mario Party. Many 4-player games end when one person is the first to lose, and players sometimes lost coins for doing so. Other kinds of 4-player mini-games forced all the players to work as a team, which was nice, but everybody had the potential to also lose coins if something went wrong. If you failed a one-player mini-game, you lost coins for it, as well. 2 vs. 2? Same principle. 1 vs. 3? Oh, you bet the pressure was on the lone player: 15 coins lost if he/she failed to beat the other 3 players.

But lets move on to what Mario Party is notorious for: the freakin control stick in mini-games. This game destroyed more N64 controllers than the arrival of the Gamecube. Wikipedia even cites an article explaining that those games are why Mario Party isn't on Virtual Console, and its in the THIRD sentence of Wikipedias entry explaining what Mario Party even is. Believe it or not, theres an item you can buy in the Mushroom Shop that counts how many times you rotated the control stick. Might as well document your suffering, right? Yes, the game was made in 1997 and was the first one in the series, but theres no fathomable reason why the idea of spinning this awkward, little joystick with your thumb or palm should have come to fruition. Maybe Nintendo really wanted parents to buy more controllers. These problems were thankfully resolved in Mario Party 2 by making the mini-games forgiving to players for losing and eliminating joystick-waggling entirely, but it seriously dampens the experience.

Aesthetically, the game is OK for the time it was made. The graphics are blocky and gross, but the game is very bright and colorful. The music is very, very good, and is also some of the best I ever heard on the Nintendo 64, especially the title screen music (the title screen itself has a unique image for the character that last won, which is a nice touch). Theres not a whole lot else to do, aside from playing a gauntlet of mini-games on the Mini-Game Raft, purchasing Mini-Games and messing with the sound options. You can buy a parrot in the Mushroom Shop that says different character phrases, but they're randomized.

Overall, Mario Party is merely OK and deserves the 3 stars that Im giving it. I would have given it 4, but the gameplay and controller both drive me bonkers at times and reminds me that there are 8 superior console sequels to this game. If you're a collector or if you're interested in seeing the genesis of Mario Party at play, then buy it by all means. Otherwise, Id recommend Mario Party 2 and 3 as the superior must-owns for the N64. In short, this party is decent, but you're not leaving it without a headache first.",3.0

"I've played all of the Mario Party games. I started when MP2 came out and played my way up to game 6 before trying the original MP. It is so bad compared to later games that it's unbelievable. I'm thankful the team worked harder to improve the concept for games 2 and beyond; with this one it appears they didn't try to test-play it before they threw it on the market. I don't even know if I should recommend this game or not. On the one hand it's hilarious just for the sheer ridiculousness of it all; on the other, it's frustrating and gets old fast, but you can't choose to play fewer turns than 20! In fact the game makes it seem like 50 turns is the ""normal"" choice - if I played a full 50 turns of this I think I'd tear my hair out. Let me put it this way: this game hates you and works against you to make sure you lose. The mini-games don't make any sense, are hard to play, don't allow you to truly practice first, and they TAKE coins from you if you lose. In at least one of the boards, just moving around pretty much makes you lose coins so when you reach the star, there's no way for you to buy it. And if you do get a star, it's pretty much guaranteed that you are going to lose it just by taking your turn. The computer cheats like it does in all the other games but this time around it's UNREAL. TIP OF THE DAY: If you do decide to play and need a good laugh, try to play the mini-game where you run around with a bag of coins on your back and other people are supposed to come up and steal the coins out of the bag. It looks like they are trying to launch a certain type of prison attack on you that I don't think I can spell out on here. I laughed so hard I dropped my controller and had to run to the bathroom to avoid having an accident on myself. When I came back, my friend and the two computer characters had backed me in a corner and were tag-teaming me. Each time one was done and passed me off to the others, my character (Mario) would grab his backside and go ""Ohhhhhhhh"" I thought I was going to throw up from laughing so hard.

"This game is very fun but isn't very groundbreaking or original but you'll have so much fun when you configure the controls to your liking you won't really care. I however, think the Wii downloadable version has much better graphics and sound quality and the controls are easier on the Wii compatible Game Cube controller than the Nintendo 64 one. There are better racing games available but this is still one of the best old school racing games.",3.0
"I used to play Cruisin USA a lot back in the days of great arcade gaming and I was excited to hear that it was headed to the Nintendo 64. This port though is really for the die hard fans of the arcade game it is based on because the good qualities of the game do not outweigh the bad qualities.

The Good Qualities: This port includes all of the cars, stages and music featured in the arcade version. The controls are spot on so you were able to get into this game easily. It even includes the secret cars by hitting certain buttons at the select screen such as the bus.

The Bad Qualities: This game was one of the first titles to be released soon after the Nintendo 64 made is debut and it shows. While the graphics are crisp and bright, they were also choppy at times during gameplay and this game was one of the first to feature massive ""pop up"" graphics: graphics that suddenly appeared out of thin air. While the arcade game suffered from this as well, it wasn't as bad and the overall draw distance was better than the N64 port. The digital voice samples along with the audio in the N64 port were muffled; it sounded like it was playing out a paper bag. The cars controlled in the same way so there was no difference in what you picked to play during the stages.

If you were a fan of the Cruisin arcade series, be warned that this is a decent port of the first title in the series and like the first arcade game, had little variety in the control of the cars and the stages. I like arcade racers so that is why I give this a 3 star rating. Peace.",3.0
"I love every Mario Party game. They are great games to play with a small group of friends. You have to play the game a lot before you can get sick of it, which is nice. This one is very silimar to the other five Mario party games that are out right now. Personally, this one is my least favorite of the 6. In some of the minigames, you need to spin the joystick in circles VERY fast to win...I guess if you don't get too into the game it'd be alright, however I played too many of the spinning games in a row and I had a pretty big, not to mention painful, blister in the middle of my hand for a week or so and was handicapped from playing for a little while. I would advise people to buy a sequel to Mario Party if you enjoy painfree gaming.",3.0
"I see a lot of negitive reviews here. You have to remember this is an old game now, but more importantly a game that started a long line of arcade racers. This game was released in arcades in 94 and two years later it finally made it home. But unfortantly they took a bit out of the arcade game to make it ""E"". This game just came to late. It was still a fun game, but only for a little bit and the sound was down played too. But in 96 it was still really well liked, but just didn't age well. But for anyone who thinks this is terrible you have to understand its older then the 96 release date.",3.0

"This is a fun game for all you Gex fan. It's pretty nice, but to me...not really all that. I was always a Spyro fan back in the day when this game first came out, but it's something different to get into.",3.0
"I am a huge fan of Gex 2, in act, it is one of my top 10 games alongside Donkey Kong COuntry 2 and Mega Man 2. (Notice a pattern here? lol) So back in 1998 when I heard about Gex 3, I was very excited, though a bit...concerned. The screen shots and plot seemed a little different than my first Gex experience. I withheld my purchase and decided 10 years later to finally buy it...

Alright, so basically Gex 2 and 3 borrows many elements from Mario 64. You explore through different TV themed stages and collect items that unlock more levels, bosses and bonus stages. Some changes have taken place that I believe were unnecessary and badly implemented, though the foundation of a good game still exists beyond the changes to game play.

In Gex 2, you had Silver, Red and Gold Remotes. Gex 3 changes this a little. Silver Remotes are now Bonus Coins, Gold Remotes are some new thing (have yet to receive one) and Red Remotes are gold colored. The previous title had a three-tiered item set to collect per stage. You needed 120 overall and you would earn a silver remote. In Gex 3, you need to collect 100 fly tokens to earn a extra Remote, and each level has JUST ENOUGH to collect 100. Seriously. Basically, if you want that final remote, you have to trek through the entire stage getting every little fly token you can to get 100. I've managed to get 96 or 99 and wasted 10 minutes trying to find a few more for the remote. What a waste! And if you die, your collection is reset to 0, imagine that...

The new stages have some of the following themes: Egpytian, Mystery TV, Army, Pirate, Anime, Western, Christmas. The new stages are very similar to Gex 2, which is not bad. The same gimmicks are still here, like wall crawling and moving platforms, ect. Gex dons more costumes in this game, like Sherlock Holmes, DracuGex, Pharoah Gex, Mexi-Gexi and so on. Overall, the stages are interesting and graphically  in vein with the predecessor. Shame how the fly token annoyance makes some of the stages a real pain.

The soundtrack is fitting but not as good as Gex 2. Most tunes are good enough, though some could have been so much better, such as the Pirate one and the Christmas one. Gex's voice is the same actor, and some lines even return from the second title. Gex tends to repeat a handful of quotes for each level, which gets irritating fast. I am not lying when I say that Gex repeated only three different quotes, some right after the other. I felt the voice acting was done very sloppy in this game, and a big step down from Gex 1 and 2. On top of that, only a handful are funny.

It should be noted to that this game features a lot of sexual innuendo, like signs reading ""Christmas Carol's Exotic Dancing"" and ""Say no to premarital Gex"". The actress on the cover talks to Gex after he beats each new stages, and the two will converse, always with sexual undertone. No doubt Edios published this game, after all, look how they have treated Tomb Raider.

THis was a negative review, but the little annoying changes really ruined some of the appeal to me. Gex 3 is still a good 3D platformer, light years beyond Croc, but pales in comparison to Gex 2.",3.0
"The Game is allright, i just wish it were a wi bit 'arder.

it is all about stealth action, a bloody gun game and thats all

gabe is your charicture, you go through the same stuff in any other game... you got to save the world. or at least try.

there is a virus called The Syphon Filter virus that is genetticale engineered with the capibilitys of targeting spicific personel.

basic game nothin real special.",3.0
"I went in to Syphon Filter with high hopes and was somewhat dissapointed.  While the levels are large and fairly well designed, the quite average graphics caused problems when you get close to surfaces.  The games controls also suffer from problems, mostly in terms of the targeting function, which is useful for quick aiming in tight spaces, or when an enemy is moving fast, yet will often aim for enemies you can't hit, when you are being shot at by ones you can, or even aim behind you, throwing the camera into wild spinning and throwing your character out of control.  Fortunately auto-aiming removes the necessity of using targeting in most circumstances.  In some places, infinately respawning enemies will cause a great deal of frustration (just to be fair, I did set off an alarm, but still...).  Some puzzles are good without being [dumb] and contrived, but some were just plain stupid, especially one early in the game where some explosives you just happen to need are hidden in a box in a dark corner of the level.  Some triggered events (especially spawning) are odd, for example, on one level, if you haven't completed a certain objective, you will die without much explaination.[...]

While these flaws greatly detracted from my playing experience, The story is fairly good, certain levels are very fun, and the game hardly ever throws anything so hard that it's agrivating at you.  One battle with a helicopter is a little bit overwhelming, although the hardest part comes at the end of the battle when you have to remember to take off your targeting to hit some enemies.

Overall, Syphon Filter is a great game executed poorly, but I have high hopes for the sequal.  I hope I'm not let down again.",3.0
"Syphon Filter is what I call a game that was not worthy of getting five stars like what it is really getting.  The game play drove me insane, it gave me a headache because it got to boring.  I will say the creators of this game did a great job with the targeting system but everything else is not handled very well.  The story of this game, wait there is no story it just talk about a killer virus.  If you are looking to buy this game take some more time to research it and rent it.  You may like the game but I will tell you one thing this game to me was a bust.",3.0
"The expansion pak will definitely enhance many of the newer N64 games (the differences I've seen on Episode I and SuperCross 2000 are very noticeable), but for the extra bit of eye candy I'm not sure this is worth  the money.

Another  thing to keep in mind is that the N64 is becoming dated.  The expansion pak  will help it a bit, but if you are planning to upgrade to a new system then  I would save your money.",3.0

There are also several games that don't require the expansion pack, but benefit from its use (Top Gear Overdrive, Rouge Squadron). The bottom line: if you're a 64 owner/player, you should probably buy the expansion pack.",3.0

"Star Wars RACER features excellent graphics. You get your choice of pods and their corresponding character. During the race, the graphics are very smooth and the controls are very easy to master.

The only drawback is that the game is pretty much the same from start to finish. This is a must have and still today, it will show off your graphics card!",3.0
I don't understand why LucasArts is doing this stuff!  I is soo wierd why they make their games bad. First of all the problems is the race tracks are easy! Even my 8 year-old sister beat the game! It gets tiresome very  quickly! It took me 2 hours to beat it. Don't buy it~!,3.0
"OK, this game was very interesting and fun the first, second, and even the third time, but after that, well, I might as well give it to someone else.  The graphics are fairly good, the plot interesting, and the control fair.  However, it's just impossible to get really into the game, namely because a lot of things seem so fake!  Some monsters, while only a bit bigger than you, take forever to kill, (if they start to get the best of you, there are cheat codes to help you out)and you are extremely limited in what you can do.  Very fun at first, but I wouldn't recommend it.  There are other Star Wars games that are much better.",3.0
"This game is super hard the first time around. Then, when you beat it, and go for another try it is sooo easy. You can get through 1/2 the game in an hour, because almost all of it is puzzles, so when you figure them out after 1/2 an hour next time it takes 1 minite. Also i found it fristating that there are no big fights, where you can fight about 20 battle droids. The biggest, funnest fight is in the very beggining, when you are up against 6 battle droids. If Lucas Arts had put in a few more units, and better levels, this game would be worth buying, but as it is it is not all that good.",3.0
"The Phantom Menace.  Sometimes this game seems like an excellent one, while at others it is downright boring and silly.
The graphics, while not the best, are certainly the best i'll ever see on my fast-approaching  obsolete computer.  They are still pretty impressive though, as are the  reflections, particle trails, and other little graphical effects.  The  sounds and voices are all pretty good too.
While the first few levels and  the last few levels are pretty much fun, the Tatooine levels are boring and  silly.  Also, after playing the jedi for half of the game, you feel  immeasurably weak when you are forced to play as panaka or the queen with  her wimpy ""droid stunner"" gun.
The first time you play this  game, it is pretty fun and challenging.  Most of the puzzles aren't too  difficult, but then you get to those jumping puzzles like the one on level  three, and due to the awkward POV and controls, it takes twenty minutes to  cross that little bit of water.  This becomes a constant problem  later...little jumping puzzles that take a vast amount of time and get very  annoying very fast.  It's also annoying running around tatooine, running  when people try to kill you but not allowed to kill them, and trying to  trade things back and forth.
Fortunately, the darth maul fights are  pretty cool.
The second time you play the game, it's extremely easy, and  I don't think I died once, and I beat the game in one sitting.  Boring,  fast, this game is fun the first time but has no replayability value.  Add  to that the lack of variety in enemies (100's of battle droids with once  and a while a destroyer thrown in), and the lack of multiplayer, and you  get a game which is decent but not worth the original $50 price.
Now that  the price has gone down, if you like these types of games, I'd recommend  trying it, but if you prefer shoot-em-up action games, stear clear of this  one.",3.0

"After the amazing game that we all know and love Sonic Adventure 2 was released, SEGA had announced they were to leave the console industry and go multi-platform. This is where Sonic Heroes comes in. Now when you start up the game you will notice you have a selection of  4 teams, Team Sonic, Team Dark, Team Rose, and Team Chaotix. Now the gameplay does not change drastically between the 4 teams, but rather the difficulty. Team Sonic is the ""Normal"" difficulty, Team Dark is the ""Hard"" difficulty, Team Rose is the ""Super Easy"" difficulty, and lastly Team Chaotix being..... well the difficulty depends on the mission.... ""Mission?"" You may be asking. Yes Team Chaotix is a mission based mode, where you will be killing a set number of robots, finding a set number of chao/crabs/ect. And some of these can drag on for what seems of an eternity. Definitely the WORST aspect of the game. Other than that I have no HUGE issues with game, it can be fun at times, and frustrating at others. If there is a tiny nitpick I have with the game is that it puts you in too many situations where you have stop and fight a horde of enemies. SEGA this is an adventure game, NOT a brawler! Now I also have to note that there will be a couple of pretty cheap deaths, but they are so few and far between that I can't knock the game because of it. If you are looking for a Sonic game to play and you are on a budget I say that you should at least give the game a play. My overall rating of the game is 7.5/10 Hoped this helped you decide to by the game or not ;)",3.0
"I was excited to get this game.  It's apparently a sequel to ""Sonic Adventure 2: Battle"" (though, I hardly see how), which I loved, but it wasn't as fun as I expected.  There are four teams with different stories and varying difficulties, but each team plays through the same levels in the same order.  The areas have a decent variety, but when you play through each four times, it gets boring.  There were sometimes changes to the levels, but not much.
In terms of gameplay, each team has three characters, and you can switch between which one you control.  One is a speed character, one is for flying, and one is better at attacking.  This is kind of fun, and it is mainly what makes the game unique.
I also think the game could be too hard.  I don't mind a challenge, but the game could be too ridiculous at times.  It wasn't even fun many times because of this.  Once you practice a lot, it's not so bad, but it took a lot of practice to get good enough that the game finally became somewhat fun.  I believe there was a final story after the four main ones, which would have been nice to reach, but I couldn't get all the Chaos Emeralds, so I couldn't.  So try to get them as you go along, or you must redo levels.  Not much happened in the part of the story I actually got so see, and it could have been interesting, but I don't know.
So I really wouldn't suggest buying the game unless you really want to and really like Sonic games.  It's not terrible.  It can be fun, and the gameplay is unique, but repeating levels and the difficulty is what disappoints me about it.",3.0

"I begin to feel disappointed with Sonic for obvious reason - Sonic temas has traded off other factors for speed.  Sonic Heros has overly emphasized speed than defeating enemies and finding treasures.  In fact, if you don't keep rashing in this game, it might take over 45 minutes or even an hour to finish one stage.

For Sonic fans, I highly recommend Sonic Advance 1-3 (esp 3) rather than Sonic Heros.  Sonic Advance 1-3 are 2D games, but it revives the spirits of the Genesis Sonic, including the fun treasure finding features in this original games.  I wonder how Sonic has been becoming more and more mundane.  Even Sonic Adventure 1 is better than Sonic Heros.

One more thing I complain about this title - the graphics is very confusing.  There are three main characters running around in high speed simultanously on the screen, and I have tried defeating a boss without knowing what is going on in this game.

Sonic team, if you want to revive the glory as in the Genesis Age, be more innovative!",3.0

"I will open with the Pros:
Replayability - It's Hitman. What did you expect? You can go back and replay missions over and over to try for a cleaner, quicker kill or just fly right through it in a weekend like I did.
Length of game - Do not listen to reviews such as Xbox Official Magazine saying it is a lengthy game. I finished it in one weekend. Friday night, Sat and Sunday. I would estimate around 10-12 hours solid play. BUT..If you go back and replay the missions for a better score, then it can drag out much further. But like I said, to play through and complete the tasks, it is not a long game.
Story - Not bad at all. A few plot holes made me scratch my head but not bad.
Overall Graphics - Better than the old Hitman games but nothing at all like cut scenes. Don't confuse cut scenes in the trailers as gameplay.
Character dev - Although they give you a little info on specific targets, it didn't seem worth the effort to look any deeper into their back story. I just went forth on a killing spree. You point me in that direction? Here I go. There's no option to ever take a person into custody and question them. You kill anyone who you are pointed at.
Hand to hand - They kept it simple. between space bar, ""Q, W or E"" were your controls to hit when it told you to hit that key. It wasn't hard to do hand to hand. It wasn't 100% awesome like Batman but it was pretty good.
Cons:
OMG why did all the people in close-up cut scenes talk with all their teeth showing? It really got annoying. I have never in my life met a person who talks like that. Also, the timing of the voice acting was bad. Serious delays in dialogue had me thinking the conversation was over then it started up again. So, voice acting wasn't bad, but developers did a poor job clipping it.
Graphics - In regards to clipping, I would sometimes get blocked by phantom walls while sneaking up steps. I had to walk back and forth until it let me pass. Also, it would say there was a key point right in front of me (blinking sonar circles) and there was nothing there. No desk, nothing to pick up and it was floating in the air. More developer issues.
(Minor Spoiler) Don't read if you can't take hints.
Sheer ease of killing other professional hitmen was a let down. I couldn't believe how easy it was to kill hired professionals.

Professional Edition: Do not waste your money. I got some weapons you can't even use in the game. It gives you the loadout at the begining and the weapons around the map are all based off that part of the game. No point in having access to the additional weapons.
Sniper challenge is ONE challenge. I beat it hands down and it never took me to a new challenge. It just lets you do the same challenge over and over.
All in all, it's a good game discounted at 1/2 price or lower. Don't waste your $ on the Pro Edition.",4.0

"This installment introduces some unusual elements to the series -- mainly the ""instinct"" gauge, which lets you look through walls and avoid raising suspicions, but I sort of miss the older approach where keeping your distance and hiding your face did the trick. (Plus you have to refill said gauge by disabling or killing enemies to be able to use it once it runs out). The visuals are vastly improved from Blood Money of course, and I appreciate their allowing me to play with my gamepad.

Some have criticized the fact that this game has ""too much story"" in it. I may be biased (even if I play an anti-hero, I like him having some motivation to pursue a course of action), but I didn't feel that the story took anything away from the gameplay.",4.0
"It's not exactly like previous Hitman games, but it is still true enough to the series and fun in its own right to be a good game. Not great, but worth the sale price. SCORE: 80/100.

Graphics are like most Squeenix games are now: amazing (Tomb Raider, Hitman Absolution, Deus Ex, Sleeping Dogs - they nail it HARD). Played on ULTRA at 1600p and it's a beast. It taxes the ASUS 290x even more than Tomb Raider, but I don't think it looks any better, so maybe not optimized as well. Regardless, stunning.

It is a bit more closed-in and linear but not linear in the way a platformer is or anything. Still multiple ways to solve objectives.

"Fun game.  Not quite as good as the previous in the series, but still worth a discounted price for single player play",4.0
"This game is very very fun. It's what you want in a 3rd person stealth/shooter. That said, it doesn't feel at all like a Hitman game. If you're looking for a worthy successor to Blood Money, I wouldn't recommend it. If you're looking for an addicting Splinter Cell-type shooter with some stealth elements, lots of gore, cool guns, and great graphics, give this game a try. You won't be disappointed.",4.0
"I loved Dirt 2 and was like a Coke fiend with a couple of 8 balls when I purchased Dirt 3, the game has much more polished look and the tracks are more challenging. The snow driving is pretty realistic due to my own experience of hitting the ditch myself while living in WI. But if you loved the soundtrack on Dirt 2, you will hate the Dirt 3, I turned the music off. The Gymkhana portion of the game needs to be deleted, worst part of the game. It's fun and worth a buy, but I still prefer Dirt 2.",4.0
"If you like rally cars get this game you will have fun.
It is more oriented to ""European market"" since here in America there isn't a huge rally fan party. Music it is very European and even the voices from the game very ""English"" accent.

"I don't do multiplayer games, just single player against the artificial racers.  I like the realism and interaction with other cars.  I'm not used to the Xbox 360 keypad-- I wish my old Microsoft Force Feedback joystick worked with this game, but no such luck.  Also, there is too wide a gap in skill level between beginner and intermediate modes.  Unless I buy another controller, I can't do much in the tour.
This game doesn't come close to the fun of Need for Speed: Most Wanted, but it uses the full capability of my laptop video card and Windows 7 64bit.",4.0
"Overall this is a well done racing game, with very good graphics for its time period. My family has has enjoyed playing it a great deal. I personally think a steering wheel controller is almost a necessity for this game, but an x box type controller would probably work. The keyboard would be almost impossible, and not very fun. The ""windows live"" system detracts greatly, since you must log in and be online to play or save game progress. There was a mees up with my ""Live"" log in and the game would no longer accept my activation code and I had to rebuy the game if I wanted to play. There is no customer support at all. Dirt 2 suffers from this serious flaw as well. 4 1/2 star game 1 star Windows Live feature.",4.0
"This is a wonderful game.  The best game out there for rally and off road style racing.  Would be 5 stars if the single player campaign lasted longer without having to purchase a download, but still a fun experience.",4.0
"I really enjoyed the Dirt series of racing games.  I actually started with the Colin McRae Rally 3 demo, which came before Dirt.  Dirt 1 was a nice game with lots of different types of races in varied environments, including Pike's Peak.  You got to race semi trucks, cargo trucks, trophy trucks, SUVs, and rally cars in Dirt 1.  The advancement was like a pyramid, unlocking levels as you go. I have a Toyota Tundra, so it is easy to like a game that has a Toyota Tundra to race in it.  Dirt 2 made it more radical with nice music and an attitude.  The races were longer and became more X-Games like. I enjoyed the Baja races very much. But, I did not like the Microsoft Live part of it where it takes a long time to get initiated, patched, etc before you can actually play for the first time. Once you get past this, things get better. The choice of vehicles were more limited, but the liveries try to make up for it. Dirt 3 keeps the same attitude and cool music, but also has the same Microsoft Live treatment: sign in, patch , etc. before the first game time.  Once you get past this, it does get better.  At first, I could not get used to the way the game downshifts automatically in the turns to automatically slow you down.  I moved the difficulty up a notch to intermediate and it was much better and more of what I was expecting.  I use a gamepad to play on the PC.  I was pleasantly surprised that my 9800 GTX 512 MB plays this game rather well at 1680x1050 (no AA).  The races are largely rally with some interesting winter-time truck races in the snow.  The cars are not quite as varied as I would like.  I also hate that there is in-game content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live.  Come on! I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play, so you won't really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live.  Many of the cars are available to purchase too.  That is cheesy and not appreciated.  You don't need to purchase these to advance though.  The gymkhana events are interesting and challenging. Being a hoonigan takes practice, patience, and many banged up cars. The Ken Block videos on youtube really inspired me to practice as I had no idea what gymkhana was before Dirt 3.  I do miss the Baja style of offroading from Dirt 2.  Dirt 3 seems to have a focus on other things, but it is still fun overall. For $12, I got my money's worth.  Maybe I will get Dirt Showdown for some demolition derby excitement, or maybe not.",4.0
I initially gave this one star because it was crashing on me constantly but I recently narrowed it down to a plug-in I was using for my porsche wheel. Game plays well and looks gorgeous when image spanned across three monitors. I would have given it five stars if it wasn't for the annoying Microsoft Games for Live application that makes you go through hoops to set it up and causes problems of it's own (occasional crashes),4.0
"Pros:

The game is about driving all sorts of vehicles on all different terrain, and at that the game does very well. There are a number of different vehicles to unlock in each vehicle category and the tracks range from asphalt to dirt to snow, some mixing the various terrains in a single course. If anybody has played any of the Colin McRae Rally games, or naturally any of the previous Dirt games, they should feel right at home* (see Cons for *).

The game basically has the player build up his fame to gain more sponsorships and be invited to tournaments and open new seasons. In the first season you are shown all terrains types and give the opportunity to learn gymkhana (~stunt driving~).

The graphics are polished and high quality, especially on the vehicles, and engine audio is up to par.
Gameplay is fairly straightforward, yet quite entertaining. Smashing your and opponent's vehicles is a ton of fun and damage modeling is well done.

Its just fun to drive and crash in the game. The game is very ""modular"" and can be picked up to play for just a short while or you can go all out and spend hours and hours.

Cons:

Gameplay can get repetitive, and even if the type of event is switched nearly every other race, you get to replay the same tracks, a number of times in different events (which are ""different"" really only by name).

Car feel is somewhat bland, most cars in the same group feel very similar or nearly identical, the biggest difference you will feel is the stopping distance increase with more horsepower of the car. By contrast, this also makes it weird when a car actually behaves quite differently than the others, such as Ken Block's car or the Original Mini Cooper.

In conjunction to the above, car handling is a bit weird at times, might be me, using a keyboard, but, during a normal dirt rally stage, you pretty much cannot recover from a real handbrake turn. Not sure if it is because of car tuning or abs still on (abs should not matter, but it's the only thing I have on) but once the car's back-end has slid around past say 20 degrees off center, the slide is irrecoverable. Does not matter if you apply full opposite lock, does not matter if you break, accelerate, or just let go of the gas pedal, does not matter what type of turn it is (shy of a hairpin), your call will keep sliding in the same direction, potentially getting more sideways, until you crash or slow down to 10 km/h (6mp/h).

Games for Windows Live - whenever you see this logo, be afraid, very afraid! In Dirt 3, you will HAVE TO have or create a Windows Live account, or you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SAVE THE GAME. Or play online for that matter. This is just some crappy DRM scheme and I was quite sad to find out about it, as this, plus having to always have the dvd in your drive, makes just booting the game an annoyance. Once all is set up, its not that bad of a hassle, but still, why punish players that buy the game?

The menus and animations, and introductions will drive you up a wall. The are cool the first 100 times, -_- , not allowing me a way to skip them is just cruel. You will notice this the most when you enter a race: unskippable animation to show you your car, 1 second pause, menu pops up with ""Race"" and ""Mod car stuff"", etc, and then another 5 second animation to show you your car again, but on the starting grid, 1 second pause, and then its time to race, 3 second countdown till you can actually drive. Also every time you select an item from the race menu (those triangle things) again, animation, 1 second halt, here is what you ordered, oh new selection, sorry that need another animation.

* People that were used to the Colin McRae games might be wondering where real rally went in the game. The one with the stages, and having to spend time in between races to repair damage, having to complete a few stages of a race with a half broken car. The special feeling of being part of the WRC is mostly gone. Now most races are on the short side (they do get longer as you progress), can be restarted at any point and no previous-race progress is lost, and even more there is the rewind feature. Naturally you do not need to use these mechanics, but just being there spoils the mood.

Other Thoughts:

It may seem like I slammed the game pretty hard, but then gave it a strangely high mark. The point is that the game is good, quite good, despite all the above issues, which all in all are actually fairly small things. Plus the cheap price bumps it up a notch.

You will want to immediately turn off all assists (keep the driving line and abs at first, then decide for yourself) else the car basically drives itself.

The loss of a true rally mode may be a make it or break it deal for somebody. The game is really fun, the driving is very fun regardless of the issues stated above, yet you will miss good ol' Colin.
I would have given the game 3.5 out of 5, just because of the great stuff lost over the years, but I realized that it was not fair to compare it with something that (unfortunately) it is not anymore.

For $12 it's a great deal.",4.0
I recomend this game to any racing fan or rally the game has a great gameplay the servers online are great and the graphics are good rate it 4.5/5.0 because you need to make a 1GB update :-),4.0
"First of all, I bought this game for 49$ and would do so again in a second. It has amazing graphics, awesome looking tracks, and the cars handle extremely well. The only thing I am not a fan of is the gymkhana events. It is frustrating to me because I will win races to get to the end of an event, but to progress I must beat a gymkhana event. For those who don't know, gymkhana is an event where you drift through corridors, do donuts, jump ramps, and so on. I don't practice it because I don't like it, so those events tend to be frustrating. Otherwise it's a great game, I just wish they had done a gymkhana only track that could be avoided.",4.0
"Look I think all game making companies are rip offs, that's why people rather download pirated games. This game sucked Ba**s to install, error after error.
After researching on the internet for a while the solution that worked for me was copy whole game from CD to desktop folder and then installed the game. If I have to do so much work to play a game then why should I have to pay so much for it.

Game developers blame it on CD ROM. I don't think so.

After that problem fixed the game ran smooth, graphics and sound track is awesome and it looks great on eyefinity after I set it all up. Why too much work has to be down by the customer to run these fu***n games, and yet you get charged so much money, it should be cheaper.

"In today's game market it's easy to miss racing games that aren't part of the license-heavy Forza or Gran Turismo franchises. Dirt 3 for PC is in an even worse boat than most since it's been a giveaway for a couple years now with every DX11 compliant ATI video card. As a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to eBay and most people who do play it have not bought it new.

This is a shame because Dirt 3 is a fun little game. There's a great assortment of multinational tracks, and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from. As a rally game, Dirt 3 ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns. Dirt 3 wears a veneer of noisy, fun arcade-style game play, but under the hood it calls for quick reactions, a good understanding of road surfaces, and nerves of steel. Sadly, it also calls for a gamepad or wheel- you will almost certainly find the keyboard too all-or-nothing for serious racing.

PROS:
-Visually stunning engine that makes full use of DirectX 11 effects
-Soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely European and not too intrusive
-Successfully models an arcade-like complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling
-In-car camera gives a stomach-churning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and 2-wheel hairpins
-Probably the most realistic depiction of drifting/powersliding to appear in a video game (it's frightening, nauseating, and usually a bad idea)
-3D support!

CONS:
-Lower difficulties aren't much fun, highest difficulty is brutally hard
-Small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers (Dirt 3 players seem pretty nice though)
-Essentially requires some sort of analog input
-May confuse players who aren't familiar with the rules and conditions of rally-style racing

Other thoughts:
-You need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to YouTube. I don't think CodeMasters wants to rip you off, but if it makes you uncomfortable, create a new Google identity for use with Dirt 3. Easy!

"""You got the Prima Guides Zelda Collectors Box Set! You will never see real sunlight again! Happy gaming, Mr. Hero!""

As a Zelda collector, writing a more indepth review would require me to open the box.

Sometimes I think they could use a little more detail on their maps and how to accomplish certain goals...and possibly some more humour would be nice.",4.0

This is an amazing edition to and Zelda fan's collection. I don't understand why they didn't either a)leave a spot for the link between worlds guide or b)include it in the bundle. Especially since it was released at the same time as the game,4.0
"In recent memory, strategy guides have become less of a necessity and more of a collector's item.  For every game nowadays there is a guide to accompany it.  Sometimes there's a collector's edition guide as well.  For collector's these are sometimes a lot of fun.  For Zelda fans that enjoy Zelda lore this collection is a fantastic buy.  There is a limited number in print and it's simply amazing to behold.  It's great packaging and actually has things in there specifically for collectors.

Before I begin I want to stress that this review won't be going into the content of each guide.  With the exception of the Skyward Sword guide, each of these guides is exactly the same as their standard (and separately released) collector's edition counterpart.  The reason Skyward Sword is not the same is because this copy was revised and expanded upon.  Aside from that, the other five guides are largely unchanged from their original releases.  There are subtle differences but nothing that greatly changes the actual content in the guide.

To begin, the guides come packaged in a box that looks like a chest.  When you open it up there are six hardbound guides in there.  The covers all look very similar.  Each one having an embossed Hyrule symbol on them.  The covers and the borders are different on each guide.  The six guides included are for Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Ocarina of Time 3D, Skyward Sword and the Windwaker HD.  All the guides have gold leaf pages that are shiny when looking at them from the side.

There are a couple of things to note about the guides themselves.  The first is that it seems just a little strange that the guides themselves are not actually individually shrink wrapped.  This seems a little odd.  It's not that big of a deal but when you open the packaging they're already loose.  Considering each original release came shrink wrapped it's a little strange.  Perhaps the thing that some consumers might mind is that none of these guides come with their respective extras.  Anything that was considered a bonus for getting the collector's edition guide isn't here.  Likewise, when this particular collection was announced, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds simply wasn't planned for the package.  So anyone hoping this guide comes with the collection are out of luck.  That's no big deal.

There are also a couple of things to note here about only a couple of guides.  The first and most obvious is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  Prima NEVER actually released a hardcover edition of this guide.  Ever.  This is the first time that Ocarina of Time 3D players will get to grab this guide in hardcover.  Originally the guide was only in paperback.  This makes the collector's value certainly worthwhile as it means that the guide will have much more limited hardcover run than all the other guides here.  This boxset is more or less your only chance to get it.

The second thing of note is that the Skyward Sword guide included here is NOT the same as the one originally published.  It has been revised and expanded.  Even the layout is very different from the original guide itself.  It has been revised and expanded by over 100 pages.  It is almost a completely new guide from the original one that was released.  So yes, this one too is a rarity because you won't have much luck finding it outside of this particular box set.

There are a couple of subtle differences between some guides and the originals.  Most notably is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  The original guide was around 224 pages and written in three columns.  Here it's 288 pages and is written in two columns.  It's a lot easier to read and a lot cleaner as a result.  Much of the text isn't so cramped.  Some moments in the Ocarina of Time 3D guide pop out a lot easier.  It just looks better and more organized overall.  The Legendary Checklist in the Ocarina of Time Guide is also better looking.  The tables are easier to read and easier on the eyes.  Likewise, the Legendary Checklist in the Twilight Princess Guide is A LOT easier to read and A LOT less cramped.  In the original guide the entire checklist was on a single page with just the location.  Here it's expanded to be in a table format, the font is bigger and it now lets you know your first chance to complete it as well as telling you what's required.  The Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks guides are virtually unchanged from their initial releases.  The Windwaker HD is pretty much the same as well.  So for those wondering about whether or not they've changed some things from the original guides, the answer is yes.  Quite simply put some of them are a tad easier to read.

The set also came with a few bonuses of note.  The first and probably most valuable of all, is that you get a certificate of authentication from Eijo Aonuma that is signed and numbered.  The second is a laser etched metallic bookmark.  For collectors this package is a pretty sweet deal.  It's invaluable.  The only thing I wish we could've gotten would have been to actually get all the extras the guides themselves actually came with.  It is more or less the only thing I feel is missing and keeping it from being a complete package.  Part of what made the guides collector's editions aside from the hardcovers was actually getting little bonuses that didn't come with the guide otherwise.

Nevertheless, for the fan of Zelda this is a good buy.  But let's be clear.  If you are buying this, chances are it is probably not to actually utilize the guides themselves.  After all, many of the games these guides are for have been out for a while and, truthfully, you could just buy them on their own if you really wanted them for strategy.  They are a collector's item.  And it is certainly a nice one.",4.0
"I have been looking forward to receiving this set since I learned about and pre-ordered it back in August. I am a huge Zelda fan and always wanted to get my hands on the strategy guides, but never seemed to get around to buying them when they first released and, over time, they became very expensive. This works out great because we can get all of the Collector's Edition guides, plus one never released and only available in this set (Ocarina of Time) for a great price - each guide ends up being less than $20 each not including the packaging.

As other have said, the packaging is wonderful. The treasure chest box is better quality than I had anticipated and the gold, metal etched bookmark is gorgeous! The actual shipping packaging was great, as well - very well protected with lots of foam so it arrived in pristine shape.

The guides themselves are gorgeous! Great detail and amazing artwork. I also love how the paper edges are golden - it gives it a very classy look. I have yet to actually read through them, let alone use them, so I can't say how accurate and useful they are, but I am sure the do their job and then some. I was very concerned about the Skyward Sword guide because the reviews for the original version were absolutely terrible. Fortunately, however, I read that it has been updated to meet the quality of all of the other guides, so that was a huge sigh of relief.

I do have a few gripes for this set, though. They are quite minor in the grand scheme of things, so it didn't kill it for me too much - they are just things I wish they would have included.

First, I am very disappointed that no guides were made for the older Zelda games, i.e. Zelda I and II for NES, Link to the Past for SNES, LInk's Awakening for Gameboy, etc. I wouldn't even mind if they threw several games into one or two books to make it more efficient - it would just have been nice to have guides for every Zelda game in one set.

Second, I was disappointed they didn't leave an empty slot for A Link Between Worlds. They've had this planned for a while and have had to have known the game was coming out the same time as this, as well as the collector's edition guide. Not a huge deal, but again... would have been a nice consideration.

Third (and this is just something I would have thought to be cool - not dinging this set at all for not doing it) it would have been INCREDIBLE if they had some sort of audio device inside that makes the chest opening music from say Ocarina of Time when you open it - similar to when you open a greeting card with pre-recorded messages. Perhaps someday I will figure out how to do it myself - until then I will have to just sing the tune myself :)

Finally, I am sad that some of the bonus content that came with the guides when they were originally released weren't included. I will be honest, I don't know which guides came with what, but I have seen others complain about this, stating that Twilight Princess in particular came with a few goodies.

Overall, I am very happy with this set. For Zelda fans, it is a must buy especially if you don't own many or any of these guides already. Thanks for reading!",4.0
"This is the find the difference in two photos game.  If you like that sort of game, like I do, it's fun to play.

Version 12 is a quantum leap forward, though it is still not perfect.

Installation from the DVD was painless and uneventful. However, there is one issue with the installation that bothered me - the installer never installed a desktop icon or a program group, so I needed to navigate to the installation directory, from which I made a shortcut to the application binary on the desktop. After this step, everything has worked smoothly and I can launch the application without issue.

The interface has gotten a huge facelift - this is not a color scheme change or rearrangement of the menus and toolbars, but rather it is a complete overhaul with Windows ribbon controls serving up the components. Normally, I would be wary of such a large change to the overall interface, but ChessBase has done an excellent job of designing the interface and it is very well-organized. There is a learning curve, though, for people who have grown very accustomed to the older ChessBase interface, as some things are a little difficult to find unless you have familiarity... Given a couple of hours of exploration, the interface becomes second nature and finding things becomes easy again.

The Fritz engine itself is a strong one, able to crush practically any human player (including seasoned grandmasters) with ease when used at full playing strength and it holds its own against other top-drawer engines. It is not the strongest engine available, but for the vast majority of players it doesn't need to be the strongest. When using an engine this strong, playing against it is not the most useful activity; where engines of this strength are most useful is in the analysis of games.

Fritz includes several analysis modes, my favorite being full analysis for post-mortem scrutiny of games. The full analysis function works backward through a game and adds move suggestions as well as canned commentary as the selected chess engine evaluates each position. Though the English commentary is not always especially informative (for example, comments like ""This is a futile try to save the game"" are common), the comments do add a more ""personal"" touch to the analysis which would otherwise be simply a dump of suggested moves. When the engine finds an especially good move, the commentary is usually a little more helpful.

I found an annoying glitch with the Full Analysis mode. After fully analyzing a game, the interface simply chopped the last quarter of the game from the report, even though I could still iterate through all of the moves. I never could get the rest of the analysis on the screen.

Another very helpful analysis mode is ""Infinite Analysis"" which takes a single position and continuously analyzes it until the engine is interrupted or the position is changed. This is especially helpful for taking a deep look at a position and trying several what-if scenarios.

Deep position analysis is another mode, as is Monte Carlo, though I have used these so little that I cannot really comment on them.

The last analysis mode I will talk about is ""Engine Shootout"" which takes a position and feeds it to two or more engines for analysis. These engines evaluate the position and play through, with the intent of determining how the game would proceed and the outcome as a result. Though it's a feature I really don't need, it is something I use occasionally to look at games I have played when the game was unfinished but the outcome wasn't clear. Different engines arrive at different conclusions which makes this even more intriguing.

The Fritz package includes a large database of games, which can be used to explore and analyze. Where I find this database to be most useful is in researching specific styles of play. For example, it is easy to track down all of Tal's games and follow his playing style with the database search functions.

Also included on the DVD is a set of training videos. To be honest I have never found these to be especially helpful but others may very well benefit from them.

The UCI interface continues to improve, so adding in UCI engines is easy and reliable. I have found several weaker engines against which I can play so I have them bound into the interface for playing. I use the Fritz 12 engine for analysis after the fact.

Central to the Fritz interface is access to the ChessBase chess server. Through the interface, players can log into the server, play games, read chess-related news, watch seminars, and observe important matches with live coverage.

There are a couple of different versions to this package. The version sold by ChessBase and its resellers sports a green box whereas the version sold through Viva Media comes in a black box. I noticed an appreciable price difference and I investigated that difference. The software appears to be the same; the real difference is in the access given to the chess server. The more expensive package offers a 1-year premium membership which gives access to all content on the server such as seminars, elite tournament coverage and other content. The less expensive package also offers a 1-year membership but the access is more limited and excludes much of the premium content. Both offer guest access which allows anyone to log in and play games without hindrance, but as a guest so there is no tracking of progress. Which kind of access you desire should be considered when choosing which package you need.

Fritz 12 is a big step forward and is a worthwhile upgrade from previous versions. The engine is stronger and the interface is vastly superior. It is not without its glitches but the problems seem to be few in number.",4.0
"This game is the best chess program out there that I know of. It plays excellent chess and the pieces look nice. However, when you move the ELO slide to the minimum, it plays really hard, about 1100 ELO rating. I played it at this level using Online Chess Kingdom and Chess master (PSP games) at the highest level vs. fritz set to the min level, and so they lost to fritz. It was easy to tell Fritz wasn't playing at 1100 ELO, but closer to 2000. The PS3 version of Fritz doesn't have this shortcoming, you feel drastic changes at different ELO ratings, but this computer version you don't feel much ELO change. Another shortcoming is that the game freezes if you choose the ""render light"" option, it slows down significantly if you improve all the graphics in the option menu, and the game flashes once in a while. Some windows don't close despite they have the ""x"". The clicking sound can be deactivated, but it takes some googling time to find out how. On the positive site, the sense of humor is a unique touch, since playing chess can get really quiet. This game could use more chess sets and picture wall papers like in Chess Master. Everything else, I wouldn't change.",4.0

"Very hard to learn the interface, but I knew that going in.  I bought this because I use a laptop, and heard that the copy protection software used by the next-best competitor required you to have the DVD in every time.  This can be really tough on a laptop DVD player, so I went with Fritz.  Note that this is an old edition, but you get 95% of the good stuff for a song and a dance.  Unless you are planning to go pro, this is all you need.",4.0

"After I opened this I set up an engine tournament with Fritz 10 and 11 and Crafty 24 and Stockfish 2.2a.  I expected Stockfish to win because it used all 4 processors on my computer while all the others were restricted to one processor.  Fritz 12 won the tournament by 1.5 points.  To test this further I set up a 12 game head to head tournament with Stockfish and one processor Fritz 12 tied four processor Stockfish 6-6.  This won me over.  I use Fritz 12 to analyze games almost exclusively.  The major disappointment was the Fritz trainer samples which were cut down to about 2 and one half minutes each.  They became more like advertising ""teasers"" than real instruction videos.  If you are primarily interested in the training aspects of a chess program, I recommend that you get Fritz 10 or one of the latest Chessmaster programs.",4.0
"I bought the $14.99 Fritz 12 edition.  It is the same as the more expensive edition except that it does not include the premium membership to the online playchess.com.

I have used Fritz 8 in the past and was not too satisfied with it.  I decided to try this edition after reading the hype.

This is a good program for the money.  It installed flawlessly; it is strictly a Windows program so I had to run it on my Mac using VmWare.

It is still a little glitchy as in the past, but the new interface helps a lot.  The 3d is excellent and lifelike and a great step up from what I used previously.

I am not a great player (1400) and the computer's response seems to be more realistic when I tone it down to my level.

I don't doubt that a few people were not satisfied with it, but, if I can run it on my Mac, they might seek a solution to their problem instead of giving up.",4.0
Works great. Indistinguishable from the one in the original Wii Rock Band 2 bundle and helpful if you get the Beatles game.,4.0
The microphones that I ordered look just like the ones that came with the Rock Band 2 game.  I bought 2 extra microphones because I bought the Beatles Rock Band game and to do the 2 part harmony you need 3 microphones.

"Great replacement microphone. We've been using it on Rock Band 4 and it works great. Two minor complaints are that the USB cable is a little short. I'd recommend buying a USB extension cable so you don't have to stand right next to the console. Also, it seems overly sensitive as ambient sound in the room can set off overdrive. You have to sing with this mic about 1.5-2 feet away from your mouth for optimum performance.",4.0

"I own Rock Band 4 for Xbox One and I learned that you can add more vocals to tracks.  I saw that this was cheaply priced and has a high rate of success from other buyers.

though the mic does work, and had no problems with utilizing the tambourine my only real complaint is that the USB Cable length is too short when compared to my original Rock Band Mic (from RB1).

I fixed the problem by adding a usb extension cable to each mic.  This added an extra $5 cost per mic and gave me 3ft.  For 6ft it would have been a $5.50 increase and for 9ft, $5.80.  Even with the extensions you're still looking at a cost savings over the ""Rock Band"" mic of $10",4.0

If there's one thing that I don't like about it, it's that the USB cable is about five feet shorter than the one that comes with Rock Band.  I wound up having to put a USB extension on it to reach where it normally would be used.  Other than that, it's a great replacement mic.",4.0

I've read that USB mics tend to have a delay issue so i'm not sure what the main issue is.",4.0
"Got this to go with a Christmas present for my daughter, it works with Disney Sing-It (Family) and Storybook Workshop.  Noticed a little bit of a delay on my parents' LCD tv, but there was a note in the game saying that was sometimes an issue with LCD tvs.  The long cord means my daughter (4) can move around while she sings/talks.  Not the best as far as vocals goes, but it works for what we needed! :)",4.0
"I bought this microphone to use primarily for Rock Band 3, as it is the only game in the Rock Band and Guitar Hero series that will not allow you to use a headset.  After receiving the microphone in question, I plugged it into my USB port, only to find that it didn't work.  ""Odd,"" I thought and tried a different USB port.  This one worked, and I began playing.
Now, to give a bit of backstory.  I have two televisions in my room:  an HDTV and a normal ""box"" television.  After getting fed up with attempting to calibrate the system correctly, I now move back and forth between the two televisions whenever I wish to play a musical rhythm game.  Obviously, for vocals, an HDTV can be used uncalibrated, as, if you know the song, you do not need to watch the notes go by, so I had had the Xbox plugged into this.  Later, when I decided to switch TVs to play my guitar, I eventually replugged in the microphone in the same USB port that I had plugged it in previously.  It didn't work.  Now frustrated, I retried every port, only to finally find one that worked, which happened to be the very first port I'd tried previously.  I later came to find that the microphone I received had a short in the wire, almost as if it were used (which is entirely possible, as I got no packaging, only a plastic wrapper around the microphone).  As for the performance itself when I actually get the thing to work, it works nicely.  It picks up on my voice fairly well, although you have to keep it at a very precise angle, or it may lose lower volumes.  There is enough cord length that I can sing at my preferred distance (although I sit very close to my televisions, so take this statement with a grain of salt).  It's not a bad mic, and I'm sure the short was just a defect on the part of my microphone.  Not bad, overall.",4.0

While this Mic is not the best USB Mic for sound quality, I believe it to be able to handle the abuse better than the higher performing Mic's like the Logitech's.

I did check and have the problem across more than one tv, so it's not the tv's fault. I have no way to determine with confidence if it is a fault of the Wii, but I doubt so, as the Wii has no problem with its standard definition cabling that it came with (why, Wii, did you not include component/hdmi cabling by default?

"The image quality seems to be leagues better than it was before.

When I first hooked up my Wii we (my girlfriend and I) had a 27 inch Sanyo tube television.  The picture looked great because of the aspect ratio; video game systems were built around televisions like this.  We soon decided we wanted a bigger and better image and upgraded to a 37' Vizio LCD.  We were saddened to see picture quality decrease exponentially and quickly became confused as to why our Wii didn't look great on what we knew to be a much better television.  We found these cables online and after applying them noticed the picture was 100% better in quality.

The effect is almost unnoticeable during play though.

Some websites say the Touchscreen and the LCD are fused. This is NOT true. They're simply held together with adhesive. I used a spudger to carefully seperate the two pieces, and was able to salvage the original adhesive for the new touch screen. Also of note, The border around the screen on the Gamepad is attached to the touchscreen via more adhesive.

"Anyone who has ever played a flight sim can tell this is not like A10-warthog just by reading the info on the game. This is an arcade type game with some sim stuff add to make it sell more and be kind of fun and fast to play. Sometimes we all just want to blow the (blank) out of things and unwind. This is fairly well made and the graphics are ok for what it is(a game).
If you want a real flight sim this is not it. If you just want to get online and have some fun with others for a while this is it. The target aircraft can do hard right and left turns that would take the wings of any aircraft and thats not right but this is a game and not a sim. This was made sometime ago and graphics have come along way but it is ok for it's time.
You will not have any issues installing this or running this game on most systems with a gtx460 or better. You can max out all setting with one evga gtx560ti 2gb video card. The install dose take some time to get done and it will update for you when you run the sim the first time. This all takes 30min or so counting the install of the game.
It is what it is and thats a game not a flight sim but it is fun to play a few hours now and then.
I have a solid system and have had no issues running this at all.
If you are looking for a real flight sim that has ture reallistic flight of the aircraft and working cockpits, this is not for you. Try A10-warthog or wings over europe or wings over vietnam or IL-2. These are flight sims and run well on any solid sysetm with xp or windows 7 running.",4.0

First and foremost this product does work with Vista no problem. I plugged it in and it was immediately recognized and started working. There was nothing I had to setup or fool around with. I am using this with an emulator to play Goldeneye and it works great. It does seem to made cheaply but it gets the job done and performs as intended. I recommend that you place this somewhere where you won't accidentally trip over the cord and break the unit though. I have mine plugged in the top USB port on my computer and have the unit velcroed to the inside of my computer desk so It's not dangling around.

"This adapter works fine running Windows 7.

However, be aware: It requires quite a bit of finagling to get running, and you NEED (or at least I needed) a PS2 controller to configure either controller.

If your experience is similar to mine, you will not be able to stop the N64 controller's buttons from spazzing out and letting you configure it at all unless you have a PS2 controller to plug in. I also have to leave the PS2 controller plugged in while playing with the n64 controller.

Be willing to sit down and tinker around with your control settings. When I got it to work with pj64 (sorry, can't speak for any other programs), I configured the PS2 controller first with the default Jabo plugin, then switched it over and configured the n64 controller using N-Rage. If you have a basic/good working knowledge of emulators and controller configuration, you should be able to work your way through.

Once configured, she works (almost completely) like a charm. Every now and then the adapter likes to have a fit, but a simple unplug-replug fixes that.

For those wondering if you can run two controllers at the same time on this, the answer is NO. You can't use one of these adapters for multiplayer--it must be switched to EITHER n64 OR PS2. You CAN use the Mayflash adapter for multiplayer.

If you want an n64-only controller adapter, go for the Mayflash adapter (with 2 ports). I also own one of them, and really, they are MUCH easier to configure. If you also want to be able to use a PS2 controller, though, this'll do.

I may return with an update on using the PS2 controller with other games.
Hope this review helps someone out there. :)",4.0
"This adapter does work, but only with one of my 4 original Nintendo 64 controllers. (Blue, not that it means anything.) The other controllers went berserk when plugged in; the computer registered random buttons being pressed and the analog stick being moved erratically every half second.

I have heard that the controller's buttons/analog stick going crazy on the computer was an issue with the voltage being too high from USB vs through the normal Nintendo 64. However, the one controller working while the others did not is strange.

I use Windows 7. You may need to calibrate via Devices and Printers, or if it works and then stops working the next time you turn on your computer, you may get some luck by unplugging and replugging in the USB end to reload it.

It functions flawlessly on the controller that works and feels like it does on the real system. I am satisfied.",4.0
"it works just fine, for those who say it doesnt wrok for vista you couldn't be any more wrong. If your using project 64 and u think it doesnt work try going to options, settings , input controller plugin and change it to nrage. then go to options again, configure controler plug in, go to the tab devices, and go to game pad pull down and select to controller. if u put ur head in it u can get it to work, the sky is the limit-B.I.G.",4.0
"The lack of software included was a little troublesome, but it didn't take me more than ten minutes to find working software that worked with this.
I've been using this constantly, absolutely no problems at all.",4.0
This thing does work on vista and works great.  It was packaged perfectly and received fairly quickly.  Also you have to calibrate it on vista.,4.0
When I first got this; it worked pretty well. A switch on the side changes what kind of controller you can use. I first thought this switch worked like a power button and thought a couple friends could play off the 2 slots but that was not true. The only problem Ihave with it is that I can't run in most N64 emulations; and it prevents me form playing those. It works good for other emulators though.,4.0

"I bought Ship Simulator for my 11 year old son who already had Flight Simulator 2002 and X-Plane.  He loves it and enjoys it more than X-Plane.  The missions are alot of fun but you will need alot of time to complete them as they are in real time. It takes a long time to load but it could be our computer. The directions are clear and easy to follow. I like the fact that even if you crash, you can keep going and not have to start over. You can purchase additional boats to download like a cruiseship but haven't tried that yet. There is plenty to do with the base product.",4.0
"Ship Simulator is a decent product for a light-hearted simulation of powered ships. Using it, you can become the captain of a number of different vessels, including a supertanker, rescue vessel, various powerboats, and even the Titanic. Several world class harbors are accurately reproduced with realistic scenery and other boat traffic. The physics of powered boats are reasonably well done. A large number of missions take you from novice to expert ship driver.

There are no sailboats, alas, and the controls can be twitchy at high speeds. There is full support for keyboard, mouse, and joystick controls, and camera angles can be varied at will.",4.0

"I love good simulators of all kinds. It is a great way to experience things without a lot of trouble.

From a physics and virtual reality simulation point of view, this simulator is very realistic and artfully done. While it does lack some instrumentation detail, you get more than what you pay for in this simulation. I have been to Marcelles France to work on a ship there and I found the simulated harbor in this program to be very realistic and just the way I remember it from being there. It is just what I wanted and more.

"An excellent simulation with excellent ship models. In particular the model of the Titanic is amazing. It's very accurate and you can walk about on all the decks, the brdige, operate controls & even go inside parts of it. Everything is lovingly reproduced like the original.

"This Silicon controller protector is good. It's nice and thin so that the controller doesn't feel weird or bulky in your hands. But it's also a little flimsy... I definitely see it getting torn apart with my brother's constant gaming use. But so far, it's held up remarkably well.",4.0

"These covers are perfectly fine. Unfortunately, they do not solve sweating issues, but it does however give you better grip when sweating. It is very comfortable and soft, with a rubbery mixed with matte finishing feel. Although it is lightweight, it is noticeably thick, providing good protection. I would recommend this product to *anyone concerned about their controller.",4.0
"I had a theory that this might solve my sweating issue when playing for longer periods of time, and for a little while I thought it had.  I've concluded that it doesn't really stop the sweating, though it might make it easier to deal with since the surface is more grippy than the bare plastic of the controller.  The controller is comfortable to a certain point by itself, and I'd say this is just a different kind of comfort.  The price makes it a worthwhile experiment.",4.0

"The cover was cheap as dirt so even needed a little help it was well worth it. When I got mine the seems were terrible, so what I had to do was take a good sharp razor blade and CAREFULLY slice them off after I got it on the controller (which it fit very well). Once I did that the cover was extremely comfortable and well worth the 200 or so pennies I spent on it.",4.0
Works great!!!  Comfortable.  The only negative was that I had to cut a little bit off the area surrounding the analog sticks as it was interfering a little bit with movement of its analog stick.,4.0

I extremelly recomend it, since its up to task.",4.0

I retired the controller that had this protective case.. It was a very nasty, and greasy after one year of no use....",4.0
"Ordered these up on a whim and was pleasantly surprised how much more comfortable this makes gaming. Sure there is a bit of trimming (very minor) that i had to do, but for something that cost so little this was the only con i could think of.  The molding process does seem to be fairly cheap so i would assume that there is a chance a few of them may come to customers in less quality shape than mine did (which i'm sure you could have replaced for no charge through amazon if defective).  That being said, for the pocket change cost of these it may be one of the best upgrades if you suffer from Sweaty Palm Syndrome",4.0
"This is not the first one of these I have had, in fact this is about my 8th. There are many different skin types and different skin makers, so you have to judge each on it's own merit. My controller skin arrived today, well ahead of expected delivery, just as described solid black and silicone. Fit is just perfect, and installation had no problems. Good comfortable smooth texture, while still providing a much better grip than on the hard slick controller plastic. I like to clean my game equipent regularly, and I always clean even new items before using. This is a great way to test the quality of the item, I cleaned the skin using isopropanal alchohol, no gumming (like you get with lower grade skins)and no color bleed onto the rag, this tells me it is definitly silicone not some rubber stuff. Once on the controller grip is good, comfort is good, feel is natural. I am very pleased with this controller skin, I have been needing to get one for my extra controller. I will definitly be ordering a few more later, a friend has a birthday coming up.",4.0
"Have had this skin for almost 2 months and so far there are no signs of wear or tear which is good. Its sticky just enough to be grippy but not overly so. It protects the controller fairly well. Keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controller.

Overall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods. The only problem I have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides. Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it. Not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since I plan on cutting it off anyways. Plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart. Will update my review if it doesnt last long.",4.0
"Purchased the cover to help with grip issues on the controller, very satisfied with the outcome. However, it does leave some open areas on the controller's edges; which is understandable, but still could have been prevented or made a better alternative. Over all with price and value, it is a buy!",4.0
"Its very good. as advertise, really help improve my gaming experience. if there are some parts that doesn't fit well. A scissor can fix it in no time.",4.0
"This skin looks good, has a great grip and is very comfortable for game playing but I soon found an unfortunate and irritating unexpected flaw - the silicone attracts pet hair like crazy.  We have a couple cats and if you're a pet owner as well you'll know that it's almost impossible to keep those follicles from sticking to your furniture and clothes in some way.  With that in mind, when I opened the plastic packaging and merely set the skin on my dresser to pick up the controller, it had already attracted a nice array of cat hair when I came back to put it on.  Granted it was a small amount but since the silicone is rubberized it made removing the hair a real pain as compared to the controller's regular plastic finish which doesn't seem to act as a hair magnet and can be easily wiped clean with a tissue or paper towel. It's not a deal-breaker and I'd still definitely recommend the product but for pet owners with animals that shed, be forewarned about this inconvenience.",4.0
This memory card works but i have to take it out and put it back in every time i turn the system off otherwise it won't read.,4.0
"This card is huge. Basically sixteen 8 MB PS2 memory cards in one card. Had some issues saving Kingdom Hearts 2 on this card, but I basically just used one of my other 8 MB PS2 memory cards instead and copied the saved data from that card onto my 128 MB card and was just fine at saving more files after that. That's the one reason it's not 5 stars. Overall though, if you're worried this card won't work or something just make sure you got a 8 MB memory card handy. I do highly recommend getting this card. Every game I've saved on this card has worked just fine except KH2. Maybe even get 2 to back up all your saved data in case one card gets lost or destroyed.

"Card arrived swiftly in non-retail packaging, plain unmarked box though having read the description I am aware of this reason.

Works fine on my PS2 Slim though when going to save a game, the game will register the card as only being 8mb. Pretty sure this is due to the fact Sony only ever made 8mb cards so it's just using the old phrase.
Games save and load up without problems so luckily, I don't have to leave the poor console on all the time to keep progress.

Fits snugly into the card port, doesn't wobble or come loose. More or less like the real thing. Would recommend.",4.0

The only reason why I had not rated the product higher is that it requires the Playstation 2 to format the hardware to utilize it for game saves, otherwise it is a useless paperweight. Though I am sure that those who are interested or even purchasing this device would have no doubt already have acquired the necessary console for use.",4.0

One of the most amazing things is when you can, not only find new ways to bring your old consoles back to life, but go even further and find ways to STILL find more uses. Ever since the Playstation and beyond, companies have put out tons of items that help give new life to an old thing.

This memory card is no exception to that rule. I have had this memory card for well over a year now and it has not failed me yet. (This is not to imply that it will last forever, you should always make backups just in case) Imagine now being able to save ALL your game saves on 1 memory card instead of having to look for spare room on an existing 8-meg memory card. Being able to hold 16x more than what a normal memory card can is pretty remarkable. Although there have been a few odd moments that make this a bit of a... well... not so much a problem as it's more of an annoyance.

(One example of annoyance you will have to deal with is that certain games will ""READ"" your card first before it will ""WRITE"" to the card to save. This can take as much as 2-3 minutes before it will finally do anything, and that can cause a problem if either you are not a patient person or you suddenly get a power spike to hit while in the middle of a save where it READS before it WRITES.)

Other than that, the card works on just about every game I have played (Numbering 150+ games on my PS2)

Overall, all I can say is I have not had that much of a problem with it and it has kept working for well over 1 year now. Of course, like any electronic device, experiences will vary from person to person. But for the price, you can't beat it.",4.0
It does the job it was made for!!! I needed it the cheaper ones corrupt data easily and totally suck!!!!,4.0
"It was really cool to have this much storage for a ps2 but unfortunately not all games will recognize it as a memory card so i just leave it in slot 2 as storage and copy the save file for the game i want to play over to slot one first.
other than that little inconveince this is a great product i will never need another memory card",4.0
When I first put it in the PS2 it was not recognized.  Thought it was junk.  Then I read a comment from someone else who had followed a suggestion to loosen the screws on the back a bit.  I did it and the PS2 now recognizes the card.  Will see how it works now.,4.0
"Item was as described but more importantly, the customer service was above and beyond! Would definitely do business with them again!",4.0
"How can you go wrong with obtaining a 128 Megabyte memory card for the PS2! It's exactly the same size, there is no size fitting issue, it looks and acts like a regular memory card, and has fifteen times more space for saved games then the regular 8 Meg cards!

The only problems I have encountered with this card is that some games it is not compatible with, and the game will say there is no Memory Card in the PS2, or sometimes it doesn't read it at first, so try again and it should. I've never had to try more than 2 or 3 times.

The only games I have found it wouldn't work with was ""Stuntman Ignition"" (possibly ""Stuntman"" too, but I have not played it) and I can't recall the other one, but currently I own around 100 PS2 games, and it's been fine with all but 2 or 3 games! But don't complain, just use your existing 8 meg card, or buy one from a pawn shop or somewhere for a dollar or two, and use that for those games, and the rest on this awesome card!

Known games this doesn't work with that I have found.
- Stuntman Ignition.
- Guitar Hero games. (works fine with Rock Band tho)
- Action Replay Max (cheat device can't save data to it)",4.0
You have to file down the plastic pieces infront of the contacts.. so that they match up with your ps2's contacts otherwise it just won't work.. also it boots kind of slow but for 128mb its worth it.,4.0
"I was a bit suspect when I saw this card - 128 MB for 1.25 times the cost of a Sony 8 MB card?? Well, I've been using it for three months now, and it works!

There is just one issue; my PS2 console has trouble creating a new game file on the card. As mentioned by another reviewer, the workaround for this is to create the new game file on a genuine Sony card, and then copy the game file to this 128 MB card.

One other minor point ... the Amazon product listing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PS2-Memory-Card-128MB-for-Playstation-2/dp/9629971372/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PS2 Memory Card 128MB for Playstation 2</a>&nbsp;says it's ""by Sony"", but that is inaccurate - this is a 3rd party memory card.

"EDIT: This _is_ actually a 128Mb card according to my PS2. However, apparently some games aren't able to see that much space. Persona 3 FES, for example, calls it an 8Mb card. Otherwise, it appears to be a good value for the money. If your games do not have difficulty with the size, then go for it. (End of edit 28 Jan 2012)

If you think the price is good for an 8mb memory card, then by all means, go ahead. Although the card and the packaging are both labeled as 128mb, unless you are more fortunate than I, you will find yourself with no more than 8mb when you insert it into the PS2. Funny that the guys at the local game store had never even heard of a 128mb card for PS2.",4.0
It arrived on time and without delay. The card works right out of the package. It does give me some problems with the PS2 not recognizing that the card is in the memory card slot but I think that's more of the system just being old. Other than the minor PS2 errors it works fine.,4.0
"I REALLY like not having to manage what and how much I put on my memory cards, and this one is like.... sixteen memory cards in one. I use my old 16 MB one as backup. My friends get all jealous when they find out that I have a frikkin 128 MB MEMORY CARD YESSS <333

The only problem is that sometimes my PS2 doesn't read it. I'm wondering if this is because it's WAAAY beyond the typical 8MB, because it always reads my 16MB one perfectly. It's always fixable by simply taking the 128 out and putting it back in, but sometimes it's troublesome if I just got comfy.

But that might just be my PS2.
EVEN IF THAT ERROR WAS FOR EVERYONE I'D STILL HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE BUY IT!!",4.0
"What is plug-and-play anymore? The card does in-fact hold 128mb of data, however to use the card i first have to Turn on my ps2 with the card out.

"It's a great product, it does what it says...except you have to do some weird preparations before it's ready for regular use. When I first bought it, I thought I'd been duped; the games didn't recognize it, the system didn't recognize it, GameShark saw it as an unwritable 64MB memory card. What I ended up figuring out, is that Gran Turismo 3 has a memory manager in there, and once you move a working save file onto the memory card, the games and system magically start working! So after that bit of work, totally worth the buy for its size and the convenience that comes with that [ never have to use another memory card again! =) ].",4.0

"I bought this product for my little sister so that she could exercise in the house and she loves it.  The rest of the family enjoys it too.  If you've never seen the XBOX or Playstation version of DDR, then this game is fine.

"Here's the deal with this item: it's fine for little girls (and I suppose, little boys that are inclined to dance) who haven't been exposed to a better dance game.  I got this for Christmas for my 5 year old daughter; she takes dance, likes dancing, has never had or known about another 'Dance Dance Revolution' game, and she LOVES IT.  It's a big hit; she's jumping all over the place, adds up her score at the end of each song, and it's been a great, cheap gift, with exercise to boot.

No, it's not sophisticated.  Older kids or teens (not to mention adults) would grimace in pain over the ancient graphics and lousy sound.  For them, get one that goes in their PlayStation or whatever.

However, many 5 year old girls don't have a PlayStation, or need one.  This is perfect for them.  For $[...] and shipping, it worked out great for a little kid.  For a teen, it's $[...] wasted.  That's the difference.",4.0
It has a vintage video game feel to it... I happen to be a big fan of the early computer graphics Like atari and Nintendo... So I like this game... I also have stepmania and just ordered dance praise.. But I find myself going back to this one more than stepmania.,4.0
"I'm an adult and I was looking for a DDR that I could use for exercise and I don't have or want an entire video game system like PlayStation or XBox.  So I figured I'd try this.  The price was right.  (Shipping charges were a bit high, though.  But it arrived two days after I ordered it, which was great.)  I didn't find one on any other site that was less than this one after you calculated in shipping charges.

Yes, the graphics and the sound quality leave a bit to be desired.  But it works just fine for what I was looking for.  The first 25 tracks or so are strange versions of songs that I have a hard time recognizing, but the later tracks that include three different unlabeled songs are much easier on the ears and also easier to dance to.  You can actually recognize the tune, hear the beat and understand when you're supposed to make a step.  There are also a couple of arcade games - Whack a Mole and a lame pinball game.  I can't figure out how to back out or exit the pinball game without powering down the entire system, though.  So I recommend avoiding that track.

I think it will work just fine for what I want - a good workout that's also fun.  I worked up quite a sweat my first time out.",4.0

"They work well, easy to change between one devise and another. It may be old technology but if you're looking for a good RCA devise, this is it.",4.0
"Great idea for a kids room or game room.  Bought it thinking I was going to need it but realized that I just needed another t.v. Instead.  Nice idea though, and cheap enough for an impulse buy.",4.0
I've had this item for at least two years now and it's still working with no problems. It allows us to have our gaming consoles available for easy use with just a slide of the switch.,4.0
"This is just what I needed.  I have a wii system, PS2, and HDTV.  I plug all three of these devices into this unit.  I then plug the output of this unit into my surround sound system.  Then, depending on what device I am using or if I'm just watching tv and it plays in surround sound.  I used to be only able to plug one device into the surround sound at a time.  The ONLY reason I gave this 4 of 5 stars instead of 5 is because it just looks and feels ""cheap"".  As of right now, I haven't had any problems with it but I am a little worried that some of the connections my get loose.  But at this price it's WELL worth it if you're looking for something to do what I've done.",4.0
Product works very well for the price paid and I consider it a good value.  We bought a new tv with only one RCA and had a dvd player and a WII which we wanted to plug in.  Did not seem to bother wii or regular dvd player as far as speed or quality of picture.,4.0
"The product is made of cheap and flimsy plastic, and for me the A/V cable it came with did not work at all, but I got my own cord and it works fine. Even with the new cord it was a fraction of the cost of the exact same item at my local Target.

I have a Wii, VCR, and DVD player hooked up to it. All work.",4.0
"It looks a bit fragile, but this device meets its goal. It's really simple and works perfectly. And the price is really low. I recomend it.",4.0
Glad we bought 2 at once. Do not expect the switch to last very long. It is made very cheap. But IT WORKS!,4.0
"The product does not match the image on the Amazon posting.  As other reviewers have described it is a big yellow sliding switch which will change the input.

That said... the product is the cheapest you will find and it works just fine.  I hooked it up for my grandparents and they haven't had any problems with it.",4.0
"It's cheap, light, and does it's job well.

The only recommendation I have to the manufacturers is that they need to make the nob(to switch from one device to another) move more dramatically. Currently the nob slight moves to the left, to the center, and to the right. So, from a design point of view, the consumers would enjoy the product more if the nob slid all the way to each side, a bit more dramatically.

Overall: Good product.",4.0
"I received this item on the 29th of may and must say thats pretty fast considering I order it on saturday and monday was memorial day and got it tuesday. What I have to say my first impresson was when I got this selector box was that its cheap quality, the thing weighed only as much as an feather and the plastic feels as thin as paper; further more when I plugged in my rca cables the sockets kinda pushed inside the casing a little bit. The good news is that it works, I tested my xbox 360 by plugging the rca cables into the box and then after that plugged it directly into the tvs rca to see if quality of picture and graphics are affected and there was no diffrence and I also had my retron nes top loader plugged in the other box sockets and the switch works. Overall its great deal considering how much it is and is amazon prime elgible.",4.0
"The product does exactly what I would expect it to, and it does feel a bit cheap, but what do you expect for $6?  Mine had a problem where the video from Input 2 was not passing through.  I took it apart and saw the pin for that connector missed the soldering hole, something that should never get past quality assurance.  Fortunately it will be easier to fix than deal with the hassles of returns/etc.  Some people commented that the switch was really cheap and didn't click nicely between the inputs, I didn't find that to be the case, the switch seems solid and it locks into position nicely.",4.0
"For the price, product does what it promises. The switch can be a little tricky to set on the correct slot. Still, a great bargain for putting 3 video & audio sources into 1 stereo and a projector input.",4.0
"The product is pretty small, about the size of my hand, and it is cheaply made. HOWEVER... it does the job and it works great! It just isn't the prettiest looking product out here. Mine is hidden to where people don't see it anyways so looks don't matter to me, the product works just fine!",4.0
I purchased this on sale for less than a couple dollars.  It is simple and functional.  No issues with it and I would buy another one if I needed it.,4.0
"This thing feels and looks really cheap. So if you're using this things for your nice/expensive entertainment set up, I would try to find a way to hide this away some where. Also, the RCA cable that comes with it is extremely short! That being said, this device does exactly what it's supposed to do. So if you need a cheap solution to having to constantly switch RCA inputs, get this. If you don't care about how aesthetically displeasing it is, then it's even more of a bonus! Would be a 5 star product if it wasn't made out of such cheap plastic, and if the RCA cable it came with wasn't so short.",4.0
If you are looking for a good looking piece of hardware this is not it... but it functions properly. Can't beat the price.,4.0
"Kind of fragile, but works great and you can't beat the price.  Nothing broke, but I felt like if I pushed the cables on too hard it would break.  Cheaper than Wal-Mart even after shipping.",4.0
"Works as discribed and was easy to hook up. Even though it was promoted for game players, it works fine for switching between my Roku, VCR and DVD player",4.0
"Not very convincingly constructed; I feel that just inserting RCA cables or toggling the switch could break the board inside. Cables stick out at awkward angles from the body. However, for how much it cost it is certainly worth it as a simple solution, if only a temporary one.",4.0
It is just a switch so not too exciting but the quality if reasonable for the very low price.  I would buy it again.,4.0
"This product seems to work for its purpose. I do not like the design because it is hard to hide the cords, but again, it works great!",4.0
"This is a decent little A/V switcher for the money, with a few caveats. The build quality is certainly not high. I was afraid I was going to break the board inside when I connected the cables. However, once everything was connected everything worked very smoothly.

I can't give too much credit to the design. It's really quite terrible. The majority of the cables shoot out at angles toward the front, resulting in a mess of cables from all directions.

Overall though, this isn't an expensive little switcher and it does what it's supposed to do. I'd recommend it if you find yourself needing one and aren't concerned about it lasting a long time.",4.0
"Received my package today just in time to hook up systems to my new TV set.
exactly what I was looking for. this enables me to have three systems hooked up to my Tv when there are limited connections.

  for folks who have multi-equipment. This is highly recommended.",4.0
"I bought this item to connect my Wii, DVD Player and Directv receiver with my LCD TV using AV RCA Composite, It is a useful selector... I recommended!",4.0
Easy to use and does what it should. less than 5 minutes  to set up and hours of frustration gone.,4.0
"I thought this little device was going to be the answer to my prayers BUT it only came pretty close.  I was so tired of changing the cables on the back of the tv every time we wanted to switch back and forth from the Wii to the DVD player.  The problem with this gadget is I still have to switch a button on it back and forth from the DVD to the Wii.  I thought I would be able to use all the products at once theoretically, without moving anything.  But no, I still have to go behind the tv and move a switch, at least it's easier then unplugging and plugging all the colored cables in.",4.0
"While I have only used one of the two memory cards you get in this configuration, it has worked perfectly and served its purpose.  I have not had any problems whatsoever with it.",4.0
"The product works and does have the 32MB memory it quotes. I've only had the cards for a few weeks, but so far, no problems. The packaging is shady and doesn't reflect the product it holds, but the product is the end result for me.

Keep my fingers cross that nothing breaks in 6mths time because I wouldn't know what warranty comes with these cards.",4.0
"I bought this for a gamecube controller. The reason I bought this is because Wavebirds are discontinued, and they can't rumble! Also, wavebirds eat batteries. The point is that I bought this. They work great with no lagg or anything wrong. You can also plug 1 extention cord into another extention cord for tons of feet. Since the only seller of this on amazon is mycarryingcase, this will probably come from them. When I got my cords they were defective and I e-mailed there customer servace. They are going to send me new ones to replace my defective ones free of charge. They were very helpful and got back to me fast. I would buy again from them, and definetely more products! Again, this is a very good deal for these cables, and they work great!",4.0
"My living room is fairly large, so these chords make it nice to play games which require the old controllers. My family can play video games from the comfort of our couch rather than sitting on the hard floor close to the console.",4.0
"These things work really great and can be combined for even longer cable lengths but be warned that the rubber shielding seems to slip around the plug head. Not a big deal, but could lead to eventual short.",4.0
it does what its designed for and does it well for those old school wired controllers. no trip zone here.,4.0
Exactly as expected.  The product doesn't receive substantial use but is working well for my three sons who play daily.,4.0
"it was just what i was looking for. the time that it took to get here wasn't very long, and the price was  fair.",4.0
it is a good product its not 6ft like it says we measured it but it is a little over 5ft which is good enough for our use,4.0
ok so it says 2x. i thought that meant that it was twice as long and ordered 4. it actually means 2 extenders. so i got 8 extenders. ROFL!!!!,4.0
"The chord is 6 feet long which should be long enough for most home theater/entertainment room setups.

Up until now we have been pulling the Wii out of the shelf it sits on and setting it on the floor so we can have it close enough for our GameCube controllers to reach.  With the chords we can now sit comfortably on our couches and not have to move the Wii anymore.

Wireless controllers are very expensive, and if you don't mind the long chord this is a very cheap and efficient alternative to buying wireless controllers.",4.0
My son is very happy that he can play his GameBoy Micro again. I am happy I finally found a charger after searching all the game stores in my city with no success. Thank you Amazon. Whew.,4.0
It works with no issues.,4.0
OK,4.0
Works great.,4.0
This unit is an excellent replacement for the stock charger. Only downside is the size of the wall wart. It's useless on a power strip unless it's the last plug on it.,4.0
Does what is supposed to.,4.0
charges my micro just fine. take it with me most the time. worth getting if you have a micro,4.0
"It does what it's supposed to do, charge a GBA Micro. Quality of materials is low and the plug to the GBA Micro is a tight fit but for $4 I wouldn't complain too much. If you need a new charger for your GBA Micro then this will get the job done.",4.0
"It's a charger, it does what it needs to, that's all there is to say.",4.0
Works.,4.0
Great. Works,4.0
It works,4.0
Thanks Gen for continuing to sell these chargers. I didn't think id find a good one. Works fine and charges that lenmar battery i got in good time.,4.0
"They're cheap, and they adequately charge the GBA Micro.  They are not official chargers, and they seem to be a bit more flimsy-feeling than the official Nintendo product, but for the price I won't complain much.  Bought 3 of them and they all work.",4.0
"This adapter's wiring feels cheap but for around $6 you can't really expect everything to be top notch. It's done its job flawlessly for me so I don't really have any complaints. Although my package came damaged, it still worked without a problem. I would recommend this replacement adapter to a friend if they needed a new adapter for their GBA.",4.0
"The Game Boy Micro I purchased already had a charger, so got a spare to boot!  If the Game Boy Micro mentioned that it comes with a charger, If the ad showed that it did not come with a charger, I would have ordered the charger the same time. But it does work with two AA batteries, so no harm.",4.0
"works great! but this is the second one that i have had to buy, the other one broke at 3 months",4.0
It works.  Looks and performs just like the orignial charger that came with my Gameboy Micro.  Now my Son can enjoy the cool new video games that came out of an old dusty box in the garage from when I was a kid.  Definately recommend.,4.0
"Ok so first of all I ordered this because I lost my original AC adapter for my GBA Micro, at first I was worried a little because i saw some reviews about the product, that people had receive the wrong Ac adapter, they wanted a GBA Micro and they ended up getting a Nintendo DS ac adapter, well the picture of where they are selling this i must say is wrong but when I receive my product everything was perfect and it was a GBA Micro AC Adapter, it works fine, its not perfect but it does the job I am so happy with my product that I would recommend this to anyone who needs something like this",4.0
when i ordered it i read the reviews and some people received a ds charger instead of the gameboy micro one. they do look alike. the first two pictures are the wrong charger for the micro but the last one with the 20th anniversary micro is real. luckily the one i got was real but be careful and read the description and their return and refund policy. if they don't refund or replace and and they pay for the shipping back then don't do it. if they care they'll pay for everything for your satisfaction. but i did get the right one and it worked well i've had it for more than a week and don't have problems. i bought it new From Hitgaming Video Games.,4.0
"It does whats its suppose to do; keeps the gameboy micro charged and it still works.
Cant go wrong there.",4.0
"Upon receiving my GBM charger, I immediately snapped the cable in half upon opening the package. Thankfully, this was easy to fix with just a little electrical tape and an exacto-knife. If any of you have the same problem, the repair process is easy. Simply cut back a bit of the outer wiring on the side without a red or black wire hanging out CAREFULLY. Once done, move one set of color wires out of the way and carefully place the other color, making sure they connect, on a small piece of electrical tape. Gently fold the tape over and PUSH down hard on the now covered wiring. Do the same with the other wires, making sure to keep them within their tape and away from the other color's. Once both are securely inside, Wrap up the snapped pieces in a third piece of tape to ensure they stay snug. THIS IS NOT A PERMANENT solution. In doing this, the cable should be cared for gently, due to it's fragile reconstruction. A more permanent solution would to be to solder the wires back together, and tape them up.",4.0
"This Is Eaiser Than the first one, but it's pretty fun i liked it. You get to play some original characters like, Bad Mister Frosty, Taffy, The Blob,  Bonker& Ickybodclay(My Favorite).

If You liked this game then check out, Clayfigter, C2: Judgement clay, Clay Fighter Extreme, Clayfighter 63 1/3: Sculptor's Cut, Clay Fighter: Tournament Edition.",4.0
"I have been a fan of the whole of the Clay Fighter series and i have to say that i am slightly disappointed with this one.  The graphics are okay, there are plenty of characters to choose from, but i think that it is far to easy and that the game had been rushed.  The price is excellent and i recommend to everyone that you get this as the price of this game won't be around for long.  If you want the best fighting game on the N64 then i wouldnt recommend this, but if you want some fun then this is the game for you",4.0
"I liked this game alot, it's challenging and it took me awhile to beat (longer than most other games). I do recommend buying the strategy guide because it's easy to miss alot. Anyways if you like the original Myst you'll love this. Great graphics, only flaws was there was a glitch here and there but nothing major.",4.0
"The Playstation version of Riven is definantly not as good as the PC version, but it still adds up to be a great experience. Solid gameplay, crips graphics, and top-notch sound. But still falls short in some areas. Disc changing can get very tedious. That's one reason why I recommend the DVD version for the pc. But it's no doubt this game will suck you in and keep you sucked for a long time. Get ready to experience a whole new world.",4.0
"This is the game you M (Y) S T  try! I can tell you one thing,if you like beatiful landscapes and mystiqe music,this game will
N O T  let you down!!! I haven`t Counted all the hours I`ve played this game,and I`m still not finished..!So,do I need to say more..?",4.0
"First if you are a myst fan then Riven is a must-have. Riven the sequel to myst easily lives up to its name. The graphics are magnificiant for playstation although it may be sticky at times.
Riven is a thinking puzzling game if you like to be confused to the point you don't know what to do then it hits you and you know what you have to do this was made for you. Riven is a five disk game and its length mainly depends on how fast you can put things together, so don't be intimidated by the 5 disks. Althought Riven is the sequel to myst you can play it without playin myst first. I would suggest playing Myst first thought to learn the storyline. But if you haven't played Myst, Riven is still a game that is worth having.
See if you can solve the puzzle......",4.0
"Back in 1993, a little game called Myst appeared. Everyone went crazy for  it -- it featured amazing graphics, addicting search and explore gameplay,  and it was actually educational. A main part of the game was reading, so it  figures that many parents were so supportive of it. It was also, though,  terribly spooky at times. You could be anywhere in the world of Myst and  still feel a general sense of... well, spookiness.
But Myst was in 1993  -- and even though it held well throughout several years (which is  amazingly good), it started to be noticed more as a classic than current  technology.
So how well can ""Riven: The Sequel To Myst"" hold up  against ""current technology"" and the original classic? By simply  making the adventure more intresting, more long, and with more  ""spookiness"" -- an original Myst-cliche that adds drama to the  game.
""Riven"" is even more rewarding than ""Myst"" so  much to the fact that it is sometimes speechless. There's five CDs to the  game -- that's clearly enough for anyone to buy this game. Even as it  starts out, you better look for clues. The developers made it so that if  you do not look for enough information, you could go from one disc to  another in less than 20 minutes.
The graphics, while nice, aren't the  best in the world. Even the control (using the Playstation controller) is  sometimes sticky. But believe me, you'll get used to it.
It's definetly  worth a buy from any fans of the ""Myst"" era.",4.0
"Games a bit slow, music/sound effect was great, but the animation was X-cellent!!!:)  Psylocke is the best character of them all!!!:)",4.0
"Marvel Superheroes was another game that came out of the post-Street Fighter 2 blaze of glory days from Capcom.  It came out near the same time as the Darkstalkers series and the Street Fighter Alpha series, and not surprisingly, there are a number of similarities between all those games, especially in terms of graphics.

This game plays like a slightly hyper version of Street Fighter with a few twists.  The wahoo-super jumps allowed to you go a good 50 scale feet up in the air and do all kinds of stuff while up there, and the super moves were similar to those in Street Fighter Alpha, although graphically more flashy.  The game came included with a number of ""gems"" you could collect and activate during the game for minor bonuses.

The fun part, though, was simply being able to pick Marvel characters (as they appeared in the mid-90s anyway; as they kept using those sprites for years and years they started looking more and more dated) in a good fighting game.

The game comes with a few unfortunate minor nitpicks.  1) A the follow-up to X-men: Children of the Atom, the roster was surprisingly sparse.  Only four characters return from X-men, two characters are bosses (Dr. Doom and Thanos), two characters are really quite obscure (Blackheart and Shuma-Gorath) and that means that really only a handful of new characters are added to the game: Spider-man, Hulk, Captain America and Iron Man.  A broader selection of characters would have been nice.  If we had all the Marvel characters that were later to feature in Marvel vs. Capcom 2, that would have been *WONDERFUL*.  2) The Playstation struggles with ports of these types of games, really.  This one isn't bad, but there are some notable slowdowns while playing.  Some animation frames are missing too, but you've gotta be looking pretty hard to spot those, for the most part.",4.0
"This is a great beat-em-up with a fun twist on the usual engine; this being that your new super-powers and infinity gems!

The characters are selected from the most fighter-friendly gallery of Marvel, this including the little mentioned Blackheart, and the overly mentioned Spider-Man.

Also fun, is that in this game you can fly (certain characters) or at least jump high enough to make your enemies dizzy. Infact, ariel combat is probably the best part of this game; especially after watching movies like Hero or Advent Children.

The characters are suprisingly well-balanced, and fun (even Captain America, whom I'm going to hack to become ""Comrade Canada"" at some point, once he no longer amuses me...) And the gameplay is a good precurser to the Smash-Bros style fighter.

Infact, the game reminds me a lot of Smash Bros.

Infact, if you could throw people off-screen, I'd say it WAS Smash Bros, with Marvel chars.

Hmm.

Until next time:

i've played all the capcom maevel games and this is the best the hulk is actually green .not pink or grey but green like he is suposed to be.the rounds go fast,4.0
"Don't you remember the times about 7 or so years ago before the vs. games like X-Men Vs. Street Fighter or Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter were out, when you were at your local mall's arcade room, and you spent so much time and needed money on this one game everyone was lining up to play, you kept winning and no one could beat you, you had a blast and you ruled the arcade, you used the Amazing Spider-Man, or Good Ol' Stars and Stripes himself, Captain America, and maybe a little Incredible Hulk was throw in just to show off your skills with multiple players, and you used the Infamouse Yellow, Blue, Green, and all other Gems you could get your hands on to build Speed, Strength, Power, Defence and pretty much eveything else with your character! Well I do, and I was so stoked when it came out, and now you can bring those great feelings back with the PSX Version of this classic fighter from Capcom!

Gameplay: Almost arcade perfect with minimal slowdowns, barely noticeable, and you can still pull off everything in here that was possible in the arcade version.

Sound: Perfect, unmuffled voices that match perfectly to all characters, and music is still here(and still rules)with no remixes(Thank God)! Music plays just like you would hear it in the arcade!

Graphics: Great considering the Ram limitations of the PSX(like that was a problem for this game in the 1st place), and they were done with POLYGONS, yes, POLYGONS!

Characters: You get a line up of the following characters:
1. Spider-Man (My favorite! ""Maximum Spider!"")

2. Captain America (""Justice Will Prevail"")

3. The Incredible Hulk (What's to say, he's a ""Monster"" hahahahahaha...sorry.)

4. Magneto (He rules and can pull off great combos!)

5. Wolverine (The cheap one)

6. Juggernaut (He's huge and probably deals more damage than anyone!)

7. Iron Man (With the Infamouse ""Proton Cannon!"")

8. Blackheart (A good and Cheep caharacter, but not as much as Wolvie.)

9. Psylocke (One of my favorite X-men, and overall choice over Wolvie, to bad Gambit wasn't included.)

10. Shuma-Gorath (Not used by me, but still deals damage needed to prevail in this game.)

Over-All: If I could, a 9.3/10.0, but I can't, so 4 out of 5, the reason being, could have been one point better if it weren't for the PSX limitations, but man, that definetly didn't stop me from getting it AT ALL! GET IT IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT!!

Thank's to Amazon.com for posting this review and YOU for reading it!",4.0
Mega Man Legends is a great new series for mega man.  The story takes him to an island searching for energy crystals on his dig adventures.  Game play is fun and easy to learn.  The game has plenty of secret goodies for you too discovery adding hours of replay value.  easy and fun to play but not easy enough that you'll only spend oh...one week or so one it.  Loads of fun a most have for hardcore mega man and new mega man fans of all ages!!!,4.0
"Great game, lots of fun, but becomes redundant after you make it through the first half.",4.0
"This game was a blast! At least 7 years ago for me. But I have fond memories of it, and enjoyed playing it with friends. That's all I have to say about that.",4.0
Good game overall. Its fun and easy but rewarding. The voice overs are so cheesy that its actually funny and enjoyable to listen too. If you have not played this game yet and you enjoy mega man get this game.,4.0
"I love this series of mega man. I had this version before but I think I lost it or traded it with a friend for the second one. So I wanted to play it through again. The seller who I bought this from marketed it as an ""original black label"" which was bogus. It came with one they printed out and not the original slip in paper but regardless, the game was in the condition seller labeled it as and the game works perfectly. Love it.",4.0
"If you're looking for a good action game then you need to consider this one. Movement and camera work takes a little getting used to (it is an early PS1 game after all) but everything else about the game just reeks of charm and silly fun. From the wealth of new weapons to create and upgrade to the bumbling pirate family the Bonnes, you won't be sorry with this game.",4.0
"I will never forget the first time I played this game. A friend of mine had been talking about it for months when I was finally able to borrow a PlayStation and rent a copy of this game. It is really a fun Action RPG with elements of Mega Man, Indiana Jones, and Zelda.",4.0

"This was a very chanllenging game for me it. Took me about three months to beat the even old original 64 verison way back in mid 2000 I think it was when back when I was about and was midway through my final and last growth ssuppert. I belive I later when I was about 14  got the newer playstation version. I unfortunatley due to a couple years lack of experience had to use the invulerability and zeeny to comple in a lower completion time of about maybe 10 to 40 hours compared to the original  completer time of about maybe 30 to 80  hours maybe more or less. This game will be fun once you get used to some changes. One megaman like in the later  games of the original series was original drastically increased in size at a huge height of abou 4 to 6 six feet tall and abhout probaly weighs about  130 to maybe 350 pounds witrh his armor on this is the biggest mega man ever made.  Once you learn how to concort the stroneger boss with high atatck strenght and to dog them this may be a piece of cake.  To beat Jungo increas e every thing one the midssle launcher to max this will give you infinite ammo. With this one the ammo update to unlimited if you pay up enough zeeny You cane beat juno easily. Just hold down the button the missle will shot of function like heat seakers. As long as you have infinite health slash cantina points one you can sit there turning your missle into the ultimate automatic fire weapon. Pushbed the out fire down and  keep shooting them of at rapid speed. Even if you get hit you should be able to take this boss down and complety both parts of the battle in about maybe 45 second  20 minutes maybeless. This  is a fun games I hope you enjopy it even though roll is now longer robotic, and Rusha and Beta no longer exist. If you like this and want a really challange to test your patience and enduranc eplay the insanly hard megaman legends 2 also avilable in playstation format.",4.0
"I played this a long time ago back in the year 2000 with my cousin. I thought It was not a very big deal, but it whent from not-so-interesting, to very fun and challenging (at least for the kiddies). A good game for the young RPG begginer, and fan of the MEGA MAN series.",4.0
"Finally, after YEARS of seeing Mega Man in 2D shooter side-scroller gameplay, Capcom began to realize the video game scene was changing, and realism was becoming more important than ever.  So in 1997 Capcom decided to take the classic gameplay of the old Mega Man games and bring Mega Man to an ENTIRE new 3D world.  I finally got to experience the 3D Mega Man adventure a few days ago, in July 2006.  So it took me NINE years to finally play it!  What can I say?  I'm slow!

I have a few problems with certain parts of the game but overall, I'm happy to report that the jump to 3D was a good one (not to mention a NECESSARY one!)  Mega Man spends the entire time in Legends jumping and shooting through a unique 3D environment.

I'm surprised so many people hate the graphics in the game.  They're quite wonderful if you ask me.  Sure, the graphics may be dated because the game is nearly 10 years old (and walking around in Mega Man Legends is sort of like walking around in a giant land of legos) but none of that should matter because you have to take into account the amount of FUN a game provides.  Mega Man Legends provides a LOT of fun.

I really loved one of the very first boss fights in the game where I had to keep running and hiding behind buildings because these giant walking blue, red and yellow machines were throwing bombs and shooting laser beams at me.  The first time I completed this battle it took a good 30 minutes ONLY for a bigger, badder machine to come in and defeat me in seconds.  At first I was angry because the game wouldn't let me SAVE before fighting this fourth boss.  ""A half hour of work flushed down the toilet"" was the thought that went through my head.

That led me to think the game might be too hard for me to handle, but it turned out I just didn't have the right upgrades for my X-buster equipped (actually I didn't have ANYTHING equipped!) so when I went back to do the battle again I defeated him (her, actually) rather easily.

Most of the enemies throughout the game are rather easy to defeat (including the boss fights).  Many of the boss fights will keep you on your toes, though.  The strategy to defeating many of them is to KEEP RUNNING and only turn around when the moment is right and BLAST them!  The only boss who isn't easy is the very last boss (who sounds like Michael Jackson) because he has TWO forms.  The first form you can figure out with practice, but on the second form he turns into a giant machine and THEN the challenge increases.  But it's possible to find enough money to carry up to 10 Sub-tanks to help you out DRASTICALLY.  If you were to carry 10 Sub-tanks he would be a VERY easy boss!  Despite that, the game provides a nice challenge because the way the story unfolds forces you to do a LOT of things.  You have to go HERE, you have to go THERE!  You have to collect THIS, you have to collect THAT!  You'll find out just how many items and weapons are in the game when you hit the Start button and see everything in your inventory.  It's borderline INSANE.

You see, to help make the game easier, what you have to do is go around searching for things (things located in treasure chests or holes in walls) and then you have to bring the things you collect back to this yellow vehicle where your female friend (or sister, I forget who she is) will be inside.  She can find ways to turn many of the things you collect into important weapons for you to use.  She must be smart!

I think I explained myself correctly, there.  It's kind of confusing because there's so many things you have to collect and that's the main reason I can't give the game a perfect 5-star rating.  TOO MUCH!  In Mega Man Legends you will find SO many weapons and SO many upgrades that it can easily confuse someone (like me) who's normally not exposed to this much activity in a video game.

You have to find a little dancing monkey to save your game.  When you're lost, he can also help you by telling you where to go, unfortunately many times he doesn't provide enough information.  So you can be left wandering around for hours until you finally have no choice but to find a strategy guide on the internet to help you out.

The music in the game is nice.  It's usually played quietly which is odd because most Mega Man music is RIGHT in your face.  If you can actually hear the music, it's pretty much what you'd expect from a Mega Man game.

Listen to those sound effects!!  Sound familiar?  Think South Park!  One of the children (or ""pirates"") sounds JUST like Butters, and a newswoman who appears later in the game sounds like Kyle's mom!  Some of the animation looks like South Park, too.  When did South Park come out?  1997?  Hmmm, makes you wonder...

Once again, the graphics.  They aren't as bad as I thought they'd be.  Sort of blocky, of course (since this IS Playstation ONE we're talking about here) but I can't bring myself to really hate the graphics because there's a certain mysterious charm about them.  Mega Man Legends LOOKS like a children's game but it's not, really.  Most children wouldn't be able to complete the game because some boss strategies require careful timing and it would be difficult for a child.

The play control... goodness.  It's definitely not easy to figure out at first.  To make Mega Man walk straight, you have to hold down the L and R buttons (this rotates the direction Mega Man is facing) while at the same time you have to use the up, down, left and right buttons to make Mega Man walk forward.  So, because you have to do a lot of running in Mega Man Legends, when an enemy is chasing you and RIGHT behind you, you have to turn around, use the L and R buttons to face him, and THEN hit him.  In the middle of hitting the L and R buttons will probably be the time you take the most hits.  It may take a few hours to properly pull off but you *should* become better at it with practice.

A trick to help you: when an enemy is chasing you, run as far away from him as possible and THEN turn around.  Usually the enemy will be far enough away that you will have time to control Mega Man so he's facing the enemy directly.  Then, simply wait for the enemy to get close and fire away!  I wouldn't blame you if you couldn't figure out the controls- it's not the greatest way to control a character.  I'm not sure if Capcom improved the play control in Mega Man Legends 2.

I find it funny and insulting that when you find a hole in a wall, many times a *very* small amount of money will be located there.  Small enough to not be able to afford ANYTHING.  It's funny because Capcom made it like ""wow, you found money!"" only to insult you with sofa cushion money.  To find a LOT of money you have to run around shooting enemies.

Just running around shooting enemies and collecting zenny (money) is a lot of fun, not to mention addicting.  A pretty good game worth picking up.",4.0
"Its a pretty fun game, and you can spend days running through the levels to see what happens next. It takes place in a diffrent reality than regular Megaman games. However thats not a bad thing. You mostly run through Labrinths collecting Money called zenny and fight a buch of pirates. If you buy a MM Legends game get this one, it's the best by far.",4.0
"To me, Mega Man Legends is one of those games you'll remember years after playing it. The game itself doesn't break any new ground and has its share of flaws, but the overall experience is definitely rewarding.

Mega Man Legends pretty much plays like the earlier Tomb Raider games control wise. Unfortunately, there are a few problems with the control scheme, such as a lock on system that doesn't allow you to move while locked on an enemy (which was fixed in MML2), and the fact you also must contend with moving the camera manually in order to compensate for the lack of a better lock on system to hit your mark.

Legends also uses a pretty similar graphic engine as Tomb Raider as well, complete with all the flat, 2D scenery that rotates with the camera and all the pixilated surfaces and clipping problems that accompanied that era of Playstation gaming. Unlike Tomb Raider, the environments in Mega Man Legends are much brighter and colorful, adding to the games cartoon-like feel, rather than the dark, dank death-trap ridden tombs that Lara Croft raids.

The pretty low difficulty level of the game is also an important factor to look at as well. Considering this game is somewhat geared towards an younger audience, this isn't an error so to speak, but older, more experienced players will fly through the game in a handful of hours (especially considering most of the game bosses can be defeated by constantly circling around them and firing). Thankfully, Capcom added an unlockable difficulty setting to make the game harder for those looking for an additional challenge (oh and is it ever a challenge). Add to this Capcom increased the difficulty on Mega Man Legends 2 a few notches, and all can be forgiven here.

So with all these problems, why is Legends such a good game? Heart, and lots of it. Mix in a good story, a wonderful cast of characters (and enemies), and throw in some of Capcom's more respectable forays in voice acting department, and you got a winner. While some may claim that Legends carries a ""kiddy tone"", I actually find this to be one of the game's charms and strengths. Honestly, if you don't laugh when one of the Lego Men, err, I mean Servebots messes up and angers Tron, there is something wrong. Seriously, it isn't anymore kiddy than a Mario or Zelda game (or most of Nintendo's gaming library for that matter).

The other thing that makes the Legends series so great is the fact Capcom decided to quit while they were ahead. While I myself still wish they would churn out a Mega Man Legends 3 (considering some of the unresolved issues in Mega Man Legends 2's ending), at least Capcom didn't make a zillion sequels and drain the series of all it's fun and respectability, of which they have done a fine job of doing to the original series and X series.

In the end, Mega Man Legends is not a game you'll remember for amazing graphics, razor-sharp control, or challenging quests. Instead, you'll walk away with a overall memorable experience.",4.0
"For the ""Ace combat"" initiated, this game is a lot better that the original ""Ace Combat"" for it's graphics and play, although I have to say how much I enjoyed ""Ace Combat"" too, in the beginning. Not only have the grapics been improved but the game now includes a scannar that actually tellls you which way the enemy planes are pointing - a must for the correct deployment of missiles. Missions are plentiful and, in addition to the possibility to select a wingman (or, indeed wing""woman"" as sexual equality aware NAMCO has included) you can even direct him or her to take on a certain part of the mission, or do the mission without support, as you wish. There are the usual night missions and canyon-runs, and plenty of planes to choose from. Game action is very smooth too. The planes available in the more advanced stages of the missions are great. An enjoyable game!",4.0
"I've played nearly EVERY ace combat game, and this one ranks up there with Ace combat 4 and 5.  This one is a HUGE improvement over the first one (titled ""Air combat"").  The story isn't as good as the playstation 2 versions (4, 5, and Zero) but the gameplay is great , especially if you have a dual-analog controller.  I give this game a 8.5/10",4.0
"My first Ace combat game was Electrosphere or number 3 in 98 so 12 years later i decided to give this one a go.  It's a lot of fun, and after you configure your controls to how you like it becomes even better.  Compared to 3, this one is a bit more fast paced, but the graphics are noticeably lower in quality.

The one quarrel I have, though it is a given for all pre 96ish (i think) PlayStation games is you can't use the analog sticks, which i always used in the third AC, and even though it's just a little stick, not having it really takes away from the flying feel.",4.0

"While the game may be outdated and not as fun to play as some of the more recent titles, I can't fault this game because this is where it all started.

On its own merit in 1995, it was a smash-box hit and everybody was ahhed by the graphics, 3d environments, and the musical score. Back then, we were used to Super Mario World and Final Fight. This was something completely different. No one cared about the flaws the game had back then. It was par for the course.

Now, in 2012, a whole 17 years later (really? that long ago...), a person can easily recognize the flaws of gameplay, sound, and playability. Sound effects are lo-fi, almost like comparing a cassette to a CD. The soundtrack is still amazing though, as if it were mapped on an entirely different bit format. Playability, there is one overall mode - the 1P Arcade mode (unless you count options and 2P). Every successful completion of the game with a character unlocks a new character to choose - the same one you fight in round 8. After that, you have all of the characters and there's not much else to do. There's no team battle, no survival, just...1P Arcade. So it works for 1995. The ending movies are pretty bad, all having the same soundtrack and really blocky ugly CGI. Of course in retrospect, this WAS 1995.

The movies never got better in the series until much later, but they did improve some.

Overall, Tekken deserves a place in your PSX collection, right next to 2 and 3. You won't play it often because Tekken 2 covers all of those bases and more. So to me, at least, this game is merely a collection piece.",4.0

"The first time I played this game I was amazed by the sheer quality coming out of this game. The grahics were absolutly incredible and the gameplay was out of this world. This was all in 1995. Now that tekken2 and tekken3 had arrived on the scene it seemed as though tekken had faded to a fairyland. Back then in junior school everyone was in conversation about all the characters and the secret ones and how you unlocked them. And know that games like tekken2, tekken3 and soulbade coming to the playstation tekken was suddenly never an issue. All I know is that tekken was a fantastic game at launch and had also beaten virtua fighter on the saturn which was a rival to tekken. If tekken had never come out then I believe with a 100% that none of the existing games that I have mentioned above and their sequals would have been in existance. Despite these games being in existance tekken is still a soulfighter and is the game that made namco famous on the playstation.",4.0
"After defeating Xenogears, I was looking for a game that was fun to play, and didn't require me to do much thinking. Xenogears was a monster game that had a fantastic, yet confusing plot that really made you think. Breath of Fire 3 is a complete change of pace. Instead of going for an engrossing and confusing plot like FF7 and Xenogears, Breath of Fire 3 continues a simple, but fun plot that feels refreshing to play after finishing a monster game like Xenogears.
Breath of Fire 3 doesn't have an overly confusing story. Once long ago, there was a clan on earth known as the dragon clan. After gaining enough power to destroy the world, the dragon clan suddenly disappeared. You play as Ryu, a young boy who suffers from amnesia. He soon befriends two thieves named Rei and Teepo. After he gets into trouble with the authorities, he soon finds out he is an ancestor of the dragon clan. So he embarks on a journey to uncover his mysterious past.
Sound original? Sorry, but if it's originality that you want, you won't find it here. Even the battle system is painfully unoriginal. As you play it, it will feel like you have played something else exactly like it. The story, the battle system, everything feels like it was used many times before, and i hate to say this, but the ending is very disappointing.
However, with all gripes aside, Breath of Fire 3 is a fun and engaging quest. My favorite part of the game was the characters; they are interesting, and very funny. I also liked that the plot never once got confusing. Even though it was unoriginal, it never got off target and it even sometimes kept you on the edge of your seat.
With all the complaints aside, Breath of Fire 3 is fun game to play through. After playing through a monster game like Xenogears, it is refreshing to play. Unfortunately, don't get too excited about the ending.",4.0

"This is a great game.  I had this game for the first time when I was in high school, and since then this has always been one of my favorie RPG's.  The Accession system is very unique, as are other elements about this game. The Master system/Skill Notes options is one of my favorites, as not only do characters learn spells and abilities unique to each character, but the fact that you can apprentice any character to a master, remove any skills taught that you don't like to the Skill Notes, and perhaps most importantly, give the skill to the proper team mate.  The story itself is addicting, as are all the party members, side quests, and enemies you will face.  Some of the things you must do to continue the story itself aren't your average run-of-the-mill RPG way of doing things, but Capcom indeed has a jewel here that will glimmer for the ages.  It's too bad that they just don't make them like they used to.

In case the title of this review confuses you, I did purcahse this game from an Amazon.com seller, but it was lost in the mail and my money returned.  I don't blame Amazon nor the seller for this, as our USPS central hub was moved from London to Lexington, which is much farther away and apparently still learning the ropes.  Enjoy!",4.0
"This game was a refreshing change from the normal RPGs I had been playing when I got it.  It's been a few years since I bought the game, but it's still fun to play.  There were a few things about the game that I didn't like, but they were nothing that would keep me from playing it.
I enjoyed the battles.  Some enemies had abilities you could learn by having your characters watch them until they used it, this was a good way to get a few abilities for characters that can't learn decent ones on their own.  Some of the enemies were interesting, and as the story progresses you get to see Ryu grow from a kid into a man.  When you begin the game, he covers his eyes and flails his sword when he attacks.  Later on, he has become comfortable enough with fighting that he stops hiding when he attacks, and when he's grown up, he just looks cool doing it.
The only things that detracted from my enjoyment of the game were hardware issues and a scratched disc.  Granted I had to start over once because I killed off all the fairies in the fairy village, but that was an accident. . .",4.0
"Breath of Fire III arrives almost three years after the fun-but strictly orthodox-Super NES title, Breath of Fire II. Although BOFIII isn't a radical departure from the earlier games in the series, don't let that turn you off; it's reassuring to see that sprite graphics haven't given way entirely to origami-style polygons. Sporting a quasi-medieval European setting, a heroic story line, and turn-based battles, BOFIII will appeal to fans of Square's Final Fantasy series and Working Designs' Lunar titles. An Epic Journey Breath of Fire III starts with the discovery of a tiny dragon that goes on a deadly rampage before it's captured. The dragon escapes and is transformed into a young boy named Ryu, who is befriended by a pair of delinquents, whose thoughtless pranks get them captured by some truly evil people. Ryu is left for dead, but his dragon powers revive him, so he sets off in pursuit of his friends' captors, unaware that he's about to be drawn into an ever-deepening pool of danger, deceit, and death. Like earlier BOF titles, Ryu can befriend several partners during his epic journey. Nina, the princess of Windia, makes another appearance in the series, although in this game she's apparently unrelated to her earlier incarnations. Ryu, too, shares the name of a character from the series, but he's also unrelated. However, Gobi, from the first BOF game, makes a cameo appearance. Nostalgic Graphics Graphically, BOFIII is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors. Texture-mapped polygons are used to create the backgrounds, terrain, and buildings, while sprites are used to compose the various characters. More animation, colors, and special effects have been added to this version, but the look of the game will still be familiar to fans of the BOF games. The three-quarter-overhead view field map can be rotated somewhat so you can peek behind obstacles, but not to any great extent. Battles are fought directly on the field map, with characters and monsters displayed diagonally in one of four directions: Two are seen from the front and two from the rear.
Solid Craftsmanship The battle system is turn-based, with some consideration given to quickness: Characters move in sequence to their speed parameter. For example, in some battles you may want to use light armor so that your character moves quicker instead of heavy armor which can slow you down. Also, certain characters have speed parameters higher than their enemies and may get extra turns while fighting. Beyond the usual manual, magic, and item attacks, characters can transform into dragons. Initially, only Ryu has the power to transform (and only when he's far into the game), but the other characters gain that power later. Transformation, though, requires crystals called Dragon Genes and AP (magic points) for the Genes chosen. By combining up to three Genes, different dragons can be created; the more Genes you use, the more powerful your dragon, though you'll use more AP. AP is also consumed at a constant pace while the dragon is in battle. Finally, you can learn monster skills for special attacks and spells. The construction of Breath Of Fire III's battle system-and of the whole game, for that matter-is very polished-thanks to excellent controls. You won't be moaning about the way this game handles. Sound Bites However, all isn't well in BOFIII. The sound effects are fine, if not particularly inspired. In battle, the characters emit rudimentary shouts, screams, and spell names, but not much more. And even though the sounds can get annoying, they're not anywhere near as badly done as the soundtrack. The music veers widely from unmemorable electronica to hopeless schmaltz, and more often than not, it doesn't add to the atmosphere of the story. The music seems more appropriate for a corporate infomercial than a heroic fantasy RPG. Aside from the inexplicably bad soundtrack, BOFIII is worth a long look from RPG fans. Although it doesn't possess the visual and aural magnificence of Final Fantasy VII (which few games will ever accomplish), Breath of Fire III holds up as a very enjoyable RPG in which sure craftsmanship is easily evident.",4.0
"With the genre monopolized by the the Final Fantasy series, it is not suprising that this game is absent from most people's top RPG list. To clarify, it is not as good as an FF game, but it is nonetheless enjoyable and fun.
The story is pretty linear, the characters are well developed, and part III offers much of the same fun that was the original BOF for the SNES (which was produced by Squaresoft, not Capcom). The only drawback is the clunky controls, which can be frustrating when you are trying to move down stairs or bend around tight corners. And while the graphics are not on par with Final Fantasy IX or Chrono Cross, this is still a great looking game.

"In all honesty, all of the Tekken games were a blast, from one all the way to four (only on arcade as of now).  And like the others, Tekken 2 is a [kickin] game.  Comparing it to other Playstation One games, however, leaves it lacking, but at best it only loses one star.  The game play is rather slow compared to other fighting games and the players are not as agile.  The graphics are excellent compared to it's predasessors but are nothing compared to it's sequal Tekken 3, which blows both it's prequals out of the water.  Among specific complaints I have heard from avid game players are that the game is much more challenging than the others, King looks like a panzie in his shirt and tie, Kazuya is too hard to beat, and Paul's voice coupled with his lanky body size makes him seem like he's going through puberty.  Whether these are real complaints or not is up to you.  The only personal complaints I have are the time a character spends on the ground after being knocked down (a good 2-3 seconds), and how high the players jump on a high kick (enough to have a whole second of air time).  But the game's positive aspects overshadow many of it's weaknesses.  The background scenery is excellent and even comparable to Tekken 3.  The characters have history, purpose, and are varied.  The gameplay is revolutionary to it's date of release and and the character moves are well analogued according to their respected martial art.  That is what makes this a four star game. Unless you started on Tekken 3, or Tag, it will impress you.  I would definately recommend it for the very experiece.",4.0

"To me, Tekken was the start of a new fighting game genre. It's Arcade style and it's need of strategic moves was a definition for the PlayStation Console, and it made itself high on the lists of wanted games back then.

Now in 1996, we have Tekken 2. This set the game even more higher on the charts than before. With awesome characters like King in the game plus more to unlock, including the bosses, this game will keep you playing for a long time. If you can.

The difficulty in this game is definitely noticed after the first two or three fighters, and from there it just gets harder. Luckily, Namco included a new Practice mode, which definitely helps. It also tells you all the commands your character(s) can do and what buttons you previously pressed.

"Street Fighter EX Plus Alpha is an update of the original arcade game, Street Fighter EX, which had weaker graphics, fewer characters, and of course no extras, being an arcade game. The arcade version of this game shared the same problem, but the PS version is probably one of the more addictive fighting games I've played. At first glance the game is simple and reasonably easy to defeat on normal difficulty level. The plot thickens, though, when the practice mode (where I finally learned how to do a screwdriver) is taken into account, along with the multitude of characters and hidden bosses. Admittedly, some of the new characters are pretty lame, but they all have distinct fighting techniques, timing and drawbacks. And of course, some of them are wicked cool (Doctrine Dark and Garuda come to mind). For the record, this game probably has the best rendition of M. Bison I've ever seen (he appears and sounds just the right mix of powerful and disdainful. His kick throw is still one of my favorite impossible video game throw techniques=)). Then, there's the music; I've spent many hours just listening to the inspired soundtrack. Synthesizer-dominated or not, something about it just made it stand out from the crowd (Guile's music is probably my favorite). That's not even getting into the Meteor combos, combo chaining, throw system (with specific characters), and the missions used in the training mode to teach basic and advanced Street Fighter skills. The only sore point is the graphics. This game is old, old, old! I think it came out in the late 90s, and there have since been two graphically superior sequels. Somehow, the gameplay was never the same. Ex2 took the combo thing a little too far, and three...well, let's just say that game is not my cup of tea. This is a great older game, if you can withstand the graphics, but I suspect I won't mind them too much. Props to Arika for trying something different! Especially now that Capcom has canceled the 3d Capcom Fighting All Stars...and I was so looking forward to see what they would do with Strider! Cheers...=)",4.0

"The original Tomb Raider was a landmark game for the Playstation and the start of a very long running series. It holds up well, but is a definite acquired taste.

Tomb Raider begins with adventurer and treasure huntress Lara Croft being hired by business woman Jacqueline Natla to search an ancient cavern in Peru for a piece of the Scion, an ancient talisman of great power. However, after finding the piece, Lara is betrayed by Jacqueline's men. Now it's a race across the world to find the remaining pieces of the Scion before Jacqueline attains its mythical power. Tomb Raider is an early Playstation game, and unfortunately the graphics haven't aged very well. Although many set pieces in the game are very impressive all the levels tend to feel very samey. Despite this the game's length is impressive. There are over fifteen massive levels with hidden caches of ammo and first aid packs, giving you a great sense of exploration throughout the game. Lara moves in a very stiff fashion. Her controls are tank-like and You have to hold down a button for her to walk. She takes very long jumps, but running jumps have a delay that requires you to plan your jumps ahead of time in most cases. Fortunately there is a training mission where Lara instructs you on how to play in her home. The game is primarily a puzzle platformer. Each level contains a series of puzzles that will test your problem solving skills.

Scattered throughout the many ruins and caves are vicious animals and hired goons all chomping at the bit to impede your progress. This is where combat comes into play. Lara starts off the game with twin pistols that have unlimited ammo. Through out the game you will find a variety of firearms, however these weapons do have limited ammo, but the pistols ensure you will always have a fighting chance in battle.
The last gameplay feature to talk about is the process of saving your game. The PC version of the game allowed the player to quicksave wherever they wanted. The console versions of the game on Playstation and Sega Saturn do not have this luxury. You can only save with the use of crystals that are placed along the path you are intended to follow. Unfortunately, once a crystal is used it is gone. This makes it really difficult when you've got a very long stretch ahead of you and not much health. Some areas have multiple crystals forcing you to carefully plan how often you save.

This game has many flaws, but it is a very rewarding experience. I would recommend the game for those expecting a challenge. The later games in the Tomb Raider series ironed out many of the issues experienced here. If you're curious about the beginning of the franchise you won't be disappointed, but maybe a little stressed.

For classic PC gamers I'd recommend Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business. This is the original game plus two bonus missions with two new levels a piece.",4.0
"I bought a used game and was very satisfied. I was told that there would be no bookklet and there was. There is some minor scratches and I have yet to play the game ot see if these are detrimental to gameplay but they look simply superficial. The time in which I ordered the game and I recieved it was much shorter than I anticipated, which was a pleasant surprise.",4.0
The story line for both the orginal Tomb Raider and Tomb Raider Anniversary are the same. I would consider the old Tomb raider is more harder then the new Tomb Raider Anniversary. If you like better graphics and such get Tomb Raider Anniversary. If you like harder challenge get the old version. Either one is both good on game play.,4.0
"Tomb Raider was definitely one of the best games to be made for the original Playstation. Obviously when you compare it to today's games it looks totally awful but the truth is it's still excellent.
The graphics still don't look too bad (considering it was made in 1995) but there are quite a few glitches (you can see through walls and animals etc..).
The gameplay is superb! The levels range from being very simple to extremely difficult. I have to admit I couldn't complete the game properely without a guide book but the first 5 levels are easy enough. You'll find yourself doing a number of different things such as running from boulders, swimming underwater and shooting strange men!
The storyline is very good but it isn't really explained too well. It's very clear who the baddies are but why they're baddies is still a mystery to me!
The weapons aren't that good- there's only a few you can obtain and none of them are outstanding.
Tomb Raider isn't at all realistic in the way that it can sometimes take 7 or 8 pistol shots to kill one animal. I don't think realism actually came into it, though.
The cut scenes are done quite well although the characters' mouth don't always move!
There are also quite a lot of bonus things packed into the Tomb Raider package, the best being Lara's home. It isn't incredible but the fact that you get to know the main character a bit better is great.
All in all I'd say this probably the best Tomb Raider to date (TR3 following a close second)and if you can find it cheap, buy it! (Oh, and don't let the bad movie put you off, either!)",4.0
"From the ruins of Rome to the futuristic setting of Atlantis, Tomb Raider takes the gamer through a variety of wonderful worlds.  Unlike its sequels, it stays in the tombs and out of other settings.  I believe that it is one of the best games ever made, and it certainly is a classic.  However, I believe that its sequels in many aspects overshadow it.
The scenery in Tomb Raider is better than most games, although it is mostly cubed and flat.  The game play and plot are wonderful, and the graphics and sounds are acceptable.  However, the artificial intelligence enemies are less than intelligent, and the gamer is often left feeling underestimated with the ease of some of the puzzles.  Laura's moves are limited, and the weapons supply is less than perfect.
I would recommend this game to any fan of the Tomb Raider series and to the average gamer.  However, I do feel that other versions have better qualities.  Tomb Raider II offers wonderful AI and is perhaps the best for a gamer seeking combat. Tomb Raider III combines the better aspects of the previous two, and Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation offers the best plot and character mobility.  If you are looking to stay in the tombs, or if you are not into puzzles, stick with this game.  However, don't miss out on the other great qualities the Tomb Raider series offers.",4.0
"This game is basically a 3D enhanced version of Streets of Rage. My only complaints about this game are the long loading times and the slow animation. Slowdown occurs periodically, and some bosses are insanely tough to beat (Try the naval base boss, he fires lightning at you when you're near him, no way to hit him! It took me a while to kill him off...). Also, the game ends too abruptly and the enemies can become cheaters, blocking all the time and then getting multiple free shots, sometimes enemies can even use guns! IF AT ALL, RENT THIS GAME BEFORE BUYING.",4.0
"Fighting Force was the wanna-be ""Streets Of Rage"" for PlayStation. If you grew up in the 90's and owned a Sega you'll know what I'm talking about. The game had tons of flaws such as the lo-fidelity sound effects (sssshhhhheeeewwwmmm) and the blocky PC-like design of the characters. Heck, it looked like a Windows 95 platform game.

There are four characters to choose from : two chicks, a big giant and the handsome one. They each have their own moves but have serious shortcomings. Smasher can take a lot of damage and deal it too; but he's slow as a mule. Hawk is a decent fighter but is open to a lot of hits. Alana and Mace are both quick (alana moreso) but are weak and fragile.

The game was unduly hard due to the overhaul of the game's engine. Back then, games overloaded easily especially if they were not rendered correctly. The load times on this game tell you there's a lot of extra space here. An obvious pitfall is when there are many enemies/items on the screen it evokes slow command response but ONLY from players' controllers (remember trying to grab a guy and your player executes an 'air grab' 1 second after you press the button?). This resulted in getting beat up from 5 or more directions and having a briefcase hurled at your head. Not fun. Items were also a bother as you found that punching a guy mysteriously involved you picking up a crate first. Then you got kicked in the shin and you dropped the crate as two more guys fired shots at you and you're spinning through the air. Fun! Yet when you want to pull a pole off the wall you instead invoke a reverse backhand that misses and makes you look like an idiot. And for that ugly move sir you get a pipe to the face.

You eventually either get frustrated with the game or you learn to live with it. The game experience for me is always bitter sweet because even though I've learned to live with the quirks they still get in my way. The game gets progressively harder as you advance through the levels and sometimes you white knuckle your controller to keep from using a continue (which, by the way starts you over on the level...totally bogus!). When you finally DO finish the game it seems underwhelming. You'll see what I mean when you finish it.

All in all, despite its obvious and frustrating flaws, the game is still a classic. If you don't own it you owe it to yourself to take a trip back in time. Re-live the polygonal loading-screen glory!!",4.0
"i would recommend getting this game for many reasons you have 4 characters to choose from you can pick the route you want the levels are well designed along with the chaacters , the fighting style are also great you get to pick up weapons & use tit against them the playstation version is the best one to buy",4.0
Best Playstation 1 game ever!!! ... As long as you get over the fact that loading is way longer than modern games of course.,4.0
"Deathtrap Dungeon is a simple game: enter the dungeon and survive.  Once people realize that, it is a lot more fun.  This is a dungeon crawl.  In other words, you explore a dungeon while killing monsters, collecting items, and solving puzzles.
The ""plot"" is simple.  A powerful magician has a nasty dungeon and he allows heroes a chance at cracking it once a year.  You get to choose one of two characters, a brawny male warrior or a scantily-clad female warrior.  You then enter the dungeon and start hacking away.
The playing system is rather nice.  Play will actually pause as you toggle through equipment menus to get just the right spell or object for a battle.  The monsters are nasty and the graphics are, well, graphic.  Watch the heads fly or the monsters get squashed and you will see what I mean.
I find this a level above a shooter as there are more puzzles than in an average shooter.  There is less development than a role-playing game.  I do find it a useful stress reliever at the end of the day.
If you like dungeon crawls, then this is a good game.  If you don't like dungeon crawls then you will probably not like this one.",4.0

This game is for beginners of the Street Fighter Series. The game was rather quite slow compared to other Street Fighter games like Street Fighter Alpha 3. I give it a basic average.,4.0
"Forgotten amidst the blood of Mortal Kombat and 3-D presentations of Virtua Fighter and Tekken, the Street Fighter II series initiated the fighting game craze.  Whereas its successors won their fanbases with graphical geegaws, Street Fighter II's strength was superb, well-balanced, uncomplicated gameplay that was simple to learn but exhausting to master.  Street Fighter Collection accurately reproduces that gameplay, making for an excellent anthology, but not a flawless one.
Firstly, the omission of the first three iterations of Street Fighter II is glaring.  Given the lack of complexity of those games, one has to wonder if Capcom's developers were too lazy (or their marketers too greedy) to finish those titles for this release, instead leaving them for Street Fighter Collection II.  Graphically the games are preserved admirably, although CD audio forces the game to start each track over when speeding the tempo up, unlike in the arcade games.  The long load times are excruciating, as is each title requiring its own Memory Card block, when the high scores for both titles could easily fit into a single block.
The inclusion of Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold is nice, but seems out of place in what is supposedly a historical collection.  Perhaps the developers felt they rushed the original Street Fighter Alpha 2 to market, and tried to save face by placing the more polished Gold version in this compilation.  And since this third title requires its own Memory Card block, Street Fighter Collection actually requires three blocks in all, not one as is advertised on the packaging.
Still, all three games have withstood the test of time, and are worth purchasing for gameplay if not historical value.  But the aforementioned drawbacks of the Street Fighter II games and dubious packaging do detract from the compilation as a whole.",4.0
"this game I remember being really fun as a kid and I played it all the time. Being able to play it again 12 years later as a grown up bring back fond memmories. Graphics and game play is not as good as it is now day, but is still fun to mash buttons. To hit a finisher is more challeging on this game because you got to fiqure out like mortal combat what to press to do a finisher. As where now days you hit one same button to do every wrestler finisher just in different position. Warzone will always be remember to me for being not only the first wrestling game I played, But a game that usher in the attitude era and led to the standard to later game to bring in the hardcore type of match in to games.",4.0
"Kartia: ""The Word Of Fate"" (recognized as Rebus in Japan), crams  fabulous innovation in one decent Strategy/RPG. Although Atlus has released  a few worthy games on the PlayStation console, Atlus begins to grow as a  company who'll soon promote their selves into a house-hold name. Like the  arising empire of Enix. Despite the humiliation from their most  embarrassing game, Eggs of Steel, Atlus is gaining momentum with their  not-notch RPGs.  Taking corresponding steps alike with Ogre Tactics and  my all time precious- Final Fantasy Tactics-, Kartia packs  charming  innovations. Sure, Kartia may not have the excellent job systems like FFT,  or any archers for the matter, yet it brings temples of innovations to bury  the burden. It has Phantoms. Once the player ons his PlayStation, the  player selects his  decision to accept the role of Toxe or Lacryma. Each  character has a totally different story process.  The niddy-griddy fun in  Kartia is concentrating on your arsenal of Phantoms. They are  paper-rock-scissors monsters.  All phantoms can be defeated by a specific  one and vise versa.  Phantoms play the most basic role.  During the game,  the player uses them to create elemental magic or specialize weapons.  Assembling the player's own infantry takes a critical job for victory or  instant death. The objectives in Kartia are alike with FFT's system. From  claiming the lives of your adversaries to escorting a vital character,  Kartia has the same fundamentals of any Strategy/RPG game.  What really  amazes, is the addition to disturb the environment. Players have the  opportunity to cut down trees down for a bridge and order a magician to  freeze a pool of water for walking.  Battling enemies on the vast  terrain is exciting, but the game loses some valuable points from being  completely linear. Gladly, there is another innovation that covers that  burden as well, the 2P Mode. Final Fantasy Tactics could have been truly  flawless if Square decided to include the 2P Mode. Kartia takes  Strategy/RPGs deeper. The 2P Mode allows two players to battle their armies  on saved data. Players can also trade items.  The ONLY downslope going  for Kartia is the abrupt end.  Kartia is an engrossing story. With  a tale like this, why not bring an anime in the movie industry?  Both  characters have dissimilar story progressions. Loxe is a young boy who  enjoys the elegance of swordplay a bit too much. Lacryma is an incredibly  robust Shrine Knight. It's up to these two heroes to protect the land from  barbaric rebels. Heroes fighting the bad rebels may sound dull and boring,  but once the backstabs roll in, there's no way the player can let the  controller free again. Someone, anyone, make Kartia an anime!  Graphically Kartia is a 3D splendor. The vibrant colors hold an artistic  environment. When a person speaks, a dialogue box is set above the screen  and the character's faces appear. At the FMV department, the videos are  dark, and morbid that triumphantly stimulates your daily dose of eye-candy.  Music thrives to hand the player spectacular soundings.  The beats can  really adjure you in an edge of your seat thrill.  Atlus has succeeded to  create a game that goes beyond the redundant  RPGs today.  Don't be fooled  by Kartia's age or lack of popularity. This is a solid buy.  FFT fans, run-  kill only if necessary- to grab a hold of this monster.  2P mode shines and  awaits for your arrival. In return for your forty bucks you'll get the  chance to trade items with a friend, and get sucked into a extremely  addictive play!",4.0
"Way back in the day, I got hooked on the SNES version.  It was an interesting and unique game play style I hadn't seen before.  It was also rare and really expensive for a young kid, the most expensive game I ever bought and waited 6 months for.  (This was pre-Internet!)  Well I'm all grown up now and money isn't quite as hard to come by, so I figured I'd pick this up and play through an old favorite one more time and see what changed since the SNES version.

First off, it has received a bit of a face lift, though it's largely similar to the SNES version.  It has also received some new functionality, such as the ability to Save/Load anywhere, which is HUGE if you're into Min/Max'ing.  Like amazingly huge.

Though it does have a few drawbacks.  Being that it is on a disc, and not a chip, there is a bit of a read time any time you enter a new level, which does include the combat screen.  This means every time one of your units engages an enemy unit, there's about 7 seconds of loading before the fight actually begins.  This is the game's largest drawback.  The sensitivity of the cursor has also been increased, which I find makes selecting units and setting exact positioning a little harder than it was on the SNES version.  And for some reason, I have difficulty pulling up the menu with the Square button.

It's still a fantastic game and an old school classic with unique game play unlike anything I've seen since.  It was also the beginning of a very prestigious lineage that lead to the boom of an entire genre.  A number of key team members, lead by Yasumi Matsuno, went on to work on Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together and then Final Fantasy Tactics under Square.  If you enjoy the Tactics genre of games, this game was the snowball that started it all.",4.0

"This wasn't widely released in America though those who have played it swear by it as being just as fun as Mario Kart 64. I agree with this comparison. However this has some fun twists that Mario Kart 64 lacks. One such twist is that laps occur when you get to the bottom of the hill and jump back on the lift. This can cause for some HILARIOUS chaos! If two racers have a good lead on opponents but are trying to bump each other out of the way to jump on the next lift chair, it can give other people a chance to catch up and possibly sneak onto a chair first if their opponents knocked each other over. I love this dynamic! Because it makes it more than just your average Mario Kart racing clone.

Other features include the ability to buy new boards and perform aerial trick to earn extra cash. Money earned during a race can also be used to ""buy"" weapon items encased in boxes littered throughout a course. I also ought to mention the music; it's wonderful!!! It features bubbley techno music reminiscent of dance/pop groups like Aqua. You'll dig the energy the music provides.

If you are a fan of Mario Kart 64 style crossfires, I think you'll find this is a unique addition to your N64 collection.",4.0
"This was not the best mystery/adventure game I've ever played, and I'm not even a big fan of such games to begin with, but I am a serious X-Phile.  Despite the seven CDs full of Full Motion Video than make up the game, it wasn't a whole lot like being in an X-Files episode.  Instead, it was more like being one of those ""other agents"" who make brief appearances two or three times per season.  You actually have to do some of the tedious legwork to collect evidence instead of having it conveniently handed to you after the commercial break.  Of course, the up side to that is a more immersive, believable feel to the game and a feeling of accomplishment when you finally do spot the crucial clue.
Fans of the series will find plenty of references to themes, conspiracies, events, and trivia from various episodes, as well as the familiar faces.  While it's not strictly necessary to recognize all the references to the series in order to solve the mystery, it does add quite a bit to the game.
If you're not a fan of The X-Files, there are better mystery/adventure games out there.  If you find mystery/adventure games frustrating, you probably won't like this one even if you are a fan.  On the other hand, if you do enjoy both this type of game and the series it's based on, you'll have a lot of fun with this game.",4.0
"This was a pretty good game, but not a great game. I'd probably rate this closer to 3 1/2 stars. You are agent Craig Wilmore. Scully & Mulder have disappered and it's your job to find them. You have several locations to go to and many people to talk to in your search. A couple of the features I really like was you actually have a shoot out that you control in one location and in another location, you have to do a real time search to catch the ""bad"" guys towards the end. Most of the cast members from the show are here (Skinner, The Cigarette Smoking Man, & The Lone Gunmen), but they weren't used nearly enough. There were some cool explosions and the story was pretty good, but they could have made this a little harder in some aspects and a little easier (like being able to get a password for your own computer. Why was this so hard?). Overall, a good game, but just a few more additions and changes and this could have been a great game.",4.0
"There could have been nothin better for x files fans when they heard of this game being released.it had actual movie graphics,a good gameplay,what this game lacked was the chills one gets while watch x files.there wasn't much action or a spooky feel to it.the biggest drawback was that u don't get much of mulder and scully.the biggest advantage was that u play as agent craig wilmore in search of mulder and scully who have dissapeared and make them look like two rookies throughout the game.whatever i say or one has to say,i feel u must buy this game,cause u won't be dissapointed.i personally feel that another game on x files should be made but with a little more of horror.thats realy what this game lacks.once again id still say its worth the money.",4.0
"First of all, I'd like to say that if you don't like mystery games you shouldn't even attempt to buy this game. However, if your a big X-files fan you might like this. In this game, you play FBI agent Craig Willmore. You get this assignment from your boss saying that two FBI agents are missing. Your mission is to find them. I know the word ""FBI"" might remind some people of shooting and killing, that's not the case. If your expecting this to be an action game, your wrong. The game is to gather evidence that will lead you to finding your agents. So if you're looking for an action game, buy a game like Quake. I'm not saying this game doesn't have action, but it doesn't have as much as you'd probably think. I'll say that this game runs very well and the acting is great. You feel just like your an FBI agent when your playing it due to all the supplies you have. For example, you have a badge, cell phone, evidence kit, gun, handcuffs, ect. A negative thing I have to say about this game is that at some points in the game it just turns out to be a scavenger hunt for eviedence. Overall this game is very good. It's very realistic and is very replayable. If you want a mystery, or want to feel what it's like being an FBI agent, this is the game for you.",4.0
"We stopped watching the series (lack of time) and so this was a nice way  to keep the excitement going. The game is good, perhaps a little  disorienting at first. I spent the first hour sitting at Craig Willmore's  desk, doing nothing :)
Once you get the hang of it, though, it follows  quite nicely. Because you have so much freedom in navigation (you decide  where to go, but things won't happen until you come back to the right place  at the right time), it feels like the game is non-linear. In fact, it is  rather linear, although you have a few variations. I wasn't disappointed in  the ending, but not thrilled either, it didn't blow me away. We got stuck a  couple of times, but we managed to make it without a walkthrough in about a  week.
The rule of this game is SAVE OFTEN. And organize your saves. Keep  the last save before you change CDs (they correspond roughly to major  developments). You might need to restart from there because you forgot to  do something crucial. Or because you died (I got killed a lot too). You  need lots of frequent saves, and a few less recent, and a few even less  recent not to have to restart from scratch if you believe you forgot  something at the beginning of the game. But overall, the storyline is quite  intuitive and you'll be fine if you make connections.
Buy this game if  you like the series but you're not a fanatic (you'd be disappointed). And  you'll have a good time if you can stand occasionally being stuck and turn  it into a challenge rather than into a frustration.",4.0
"Since I am a fan of the show I decided I needed to try out the game as well. The concept was wonderful although a bit trying at times when your character is wondering around bumping into walls. I did however, think it  was great to find out what you can make your character do. As I wondered  around through the first couple of disks I wanted to find out what the  creators thought a gamer might try. When I shot the big boss, Shanks, I  thought the ""booking"" sequence was hilarious. It actually starled  me because it was such a surprise. I also loved a couple of the other  ending before completing the actual goal. Maybe I'm biased but even though  the story could have been a little strong the game was left open for X  Files II. Well if X is telling the truth then I'll be in line to own the  next game.",4.0

Hey, they even have a story and little logs you can read to get a  feel for the story.
It's not as story-scripted as Half-Life (but then, it  doesn't have the awful Xen world either), and many people prefer the  realistic weapons of Quake to the unusual ones of Unreal. i like the  built-in bots in multiplayer (i think this was the first game to ship with  them), but i'm told the net play is really slow",4.0

"I was never a really big fan of sci-fi, and Star Wars just wasn't my thing. I couldn't really care less about those darned rebels. Obviously, my expectations for Rogue Squadron that summer day were not very high.

But you know what? I played the first mission and I was pleasantly surprised. The game actually wasn't that bad!  It was actually quite entertaining just flying around and shooting these drones out from the sky. The game really isn't that easy to learn, especially if you buy the game used without an instruction booklet. There are basically a lot of nooks and crannies that I have yet to figure out, like what right-C does, or how bombs work. But the introductory missions are fun and pretty easy. However, the gameplay got to be quite repetitive. I mean, you just go around and shoot enemies from the sky. Yay. There are also a lot of sections where you have nothing to do, and it gets boring. Maybe I could have moved on to the third mission.

I also realized how visually stunning the game is. I have an Expansion Pak, so I really don't have a clue what the game would be like without it, but the graphics are just so crisp, at least certain features. The buildings and structures and ships and stuff look great, almost to the level of Half-Life. But the graphics for the people/Storm troopers leave more to be desired. They are obviously sprites. The music does have a Star Wars feel to it, and that's growing on me. I sometimes get certain tunes stuck in my head, and I don't mind. Most of the music is in the menus, though. 40 minutes of speech is nice, if only I could understand half of it. Rogue Squadron has no multiplayer, which is too bad. It would have been fun. Oh well. Overall, I actually kind of enjoyed this game.",4.0
My brother who bought this game and gave it to me because I a huge star wars fan. Right now I have 4 medels and my rank is cadet and my favorite ship on the game that I pick is the X-wing. I play this game everyday when I finished my homework! I rrecomend this game for any star wars fan!,4.0
"This game is one of the best I have ever seen. Although many will argue that Half-Life may be a better game, I find it annoying. There is too much story and too many things to do. Unreal, meanwhile, is a simple ""shoot  now, never ask questions"" kind of slaughter house.  But it does have  a collosal story line which is revealed as the game progresses. The AI will  make you sweat as you try to outmaneuver and outshoot (not to mention  outrun) a horde of enemies as you fight for your life.  The weapons are  unique, and somewhat strange, but they suit their purpose. The enemies are  many and visious.  Also, note that it may take you at least a solid week to  beat the game even on easy (that's assuming you are really good! ). Enjoy!",4.0
"First of, let's just say Unreal could've been one of the best games released in the 90's if it wasn't for a few flaws.
First, the networking code for multiplayer gaming was disastrous. Eventhough it was somewhat  fixed about 6 months later, it hurt the multiplayer community of Unreal  enough that it could never really compete with the established community of  iD's software's Quake and Quake II. Now, however, the network code of  Unreal (thanks to recent patches) is rock solid, and the community,  although small, still exists, which is more than you can say about some  releases of 1998 (like SiN or Shogo).
Second, it was too much game for  the hardware of the time. The game code was a bit bogged down, Unreal was  said to be a resource hog, and it brought even brand-new systems to its  knees at the time. When it was originally released in early summer 1998, no  Riva's TNT video cards or Pentium-III chipsets had been released. The most  consumers could hope for (as far as power was concerned) were 3dfx's  Voodoo2 cards in Scan-line Interleave (SLI) configuration so they could  keep up with the graphical demands of Unreal, which ran choppy and slow on  older systems. And this particular configuration ran at well over $400 at  the time, a bit much for the casual gamer. Now, of course, new  ""gaming"" computers ship with Voodoo3's, TNT2's, or GeForce256's  standard alongside a Pentium-III or an Athlon, which is more than enough  power to run this game. Now everyone, even those buying $1500 PC's can  enjoy stunning graphics and captivating imagery without slowdown. Hardware  is not a problem. If you bought a new computer since the summer of this  year, you can run Unreal, and you can run it quite well.
What about the  game content itself? I will be perfectly honest when I say that Unreal, at  it's time, had some of the most amazing graphics I had ever seen on a  computer... ever. The first hour of the game I was mesmerized by what you  encounter... Shiny floors that reflect your image, halos of light appear  around spotlights, you creep through a system of vents that's completely  clouded by a green fog. Then when you step outside you are in a natural  utopia. You can hear the wind howl as you are in a canyon stepping out of a  crashed spaceship. There's wildlife (both friendly and un-), and beautiful,  rippling pools of water. Further in the game, there's more emotional  encounters. In a deserted battle arena at nightime, you face down with the  first boss, a creature the size of a house that you pulls up rocks from the  earth and throws them at you. Throughout the game, you travel through  occupied spaceships, medieval castles, ancient Aztec-themed pyramids, a  village in the sky, a crater in the middle of a volcano where a demon  lives, underground rivers that must be navigated by raft, and plenty of  challenging, but not too-challenging puzzles to give you rest from the  action.
When you are done playing the single-player mode, you can play  online against other opponents, or use Unreal's unique feature of 'bots',  artificially intelligent opponents controlled by the computer that fight  you on multiplayer levels and act many times as a real player  would.
Included with the game is the actual map editing package that Epic  Games, makers of Unreal and Unreal Tournament, used to design the whole  game! This means not only can you design your own deathmatch arena  (complete with any props or effects you saw in the game), but that there's  also hundreds of user-made maps that you can play once the game gets a bit  stale.
Overall, this game is an absolute STEAL for this price (at time of  review about fifteen dollars). It's fun for both the beginning and  experienced gamer, and there's an option to cut-out the amount of blood  shown so it's also kid friendly.
Highly recommended for gaming software  under $20.00",4.0
All the missions are land missions and they get boring after awhile. This a good game to play when your bored. It's one of my favorites. Not close to  Colony Wars though. If you like Star Wars buy this. It is a good space  battle game. It would be nice if a battle took place in space though. I  give RS *Bulls-eyes four womp rats* four stars.,4.0
"I have played all of the TM series including TM4. Considering all of the games out there. This is a GREAT BUY. TM and the entire series are fun games TM3 has great music, infact I bought the sound track Rob Zombie  ""music to strip to"" or something. PS seems to process this game a  little slowly, it might be better on PS2 but it is still a great game. I  will have to admit TM2 is the best game I ever played and that is why you  are probably seeing mixed reviews. People had a grand expectation for this  game. It is a good game and TM3 has a fun final board. I would not by TM4,  that one was a waste of money.",4.0

"I'd heard good things about this N64 game, I'd never played it when N64 was very popular, but since I found it for cheap on Amazon, I figured why not buy it? I've played it a few times, it's ok, but it's definitely not a favorite.

It's pretty easy to figure out how to maneuver and stuff, it's just not exactly what I was expecting.",4.0
"For N64 this game is way fun. The races aren't too hard to beat and riding the penguin cracks me up. Obviously the graphics and controls aren't perfect because it's an older game, but it's for 64 so what more do you want? It's totally kid friendly and considering how cheap it is I definitely recommend this game for your collection.",4.0
"I used to love this game; but now it's dated and now that I look back on it, it's not as fun now, either way, here's my review.

Graphics: 8.5/10. This is a more realistic snowboarding game, so there are very realistic colors; unlike snowboarding kids or anything with very bright colors. 1080 features very realistic physics and is very sophisticated. Anyways, the graphics I remember loving mainly because of the powdery snow. I liked to edge in deep snow just because it was it was so fluffy. For that, this game got what it got in this category.

Sound: 9/10. Whether you go through a foot of snow or right accross jagged ice, there's a different noise. There is a different sound for everything, which is strange because really for the most part in many games on the N64 there is the same or a very similar song for everything in the game.

Control: 8/10. Very, very realistic and solid, but It's frustrating for that reason. it is really realistic so you really have to land FLAT to get land, which can be frustrating for little kids. There is also damage; so if you get beat up a lot you will not win the race.

Fun: 8.5/10. Nice and realistic, great events, and different difficulties for every age and cool characters make this a must play for any  owner of an N64.

9/10",4.0
This is the best Snow boarding game you can get but you will get tierd of it soon,4.0
"This game definitly fits the thought I had of a snowboarding game when I set out to buy one. The graphics are moderately realstic, the control is ok, and the sound is mediocre. I think they could of done a lot better job designing a game like this, but this edition suffices.
  It is one of the only snowboarding games on the N64, which was one of the reasons i bought it. Another reason is the outstanding multiplayer coordination. I bought this as soon as I played it at a friend's house. You unfortunatley play with only 2 players at a time, but it is still fun to play your friend head to head.  There are 6 courses, and under single player you can also do half pipe and air make. There are 5 characters that you can use to race, and more of which you can unlock. since there are only 60 head to head course combinations, there are other things you can do, like trick or time attacks.
  This can take a bit to get used to, as it can be boring for the single player. If you have a will and a friend however, this game will surely be worth it.",4.0
"I know this game sometimes has a bad rap due to being often lauded as the pinnacle of gaming,but don't let that turn you off. This hype is due to the innovations it brought in its time which are now common place mainly due to the influence of this game. The graphics are really bad, I usually like old graphics but these are just horribly blocky, I did not even like it back when it was new. This is not that important to me, but I figured I should let you know in case that is really a deal breaker which makes sense as aesthetics are part of the entire art form. Nevertheless, the music and gameplay are still superb (it is a turn based game, must let that be known if you are more into the newer FFVII games which are much more action based).",4.0
"1080 is a pretty good game, BUT, it WILL take you time to master the quite difficult controls. First of all, the game is worth the money, but if your not good enough to master the controls of a snowboarding game, or just don't have the time, don't get this game. It is fun, but I got tired of it after I beat it, which isn't a difficult task to accomplish, and I can bet money that you won't play it any more after you beat it to. I didn't want to give it a five solely based on this reason, and this reason alone! Another bad point of the game is that it isn't fast enough for me, you don't go nearly as fast as you would if you were really snowboarding. The only time I would play this game anymore is in the dead of winter time, because then your really in the mood to play it! Go back and really look at what i've said, I am a critic/gamer just like you, and I look at these reviews just like you. I am sitting here typing this so you won't throw your money away on a game you'll get tired of after beating it! Rent it, buy it, I don't care, just have fun!",4.0
"Arguably the best of the Final Fantasy games, FF7 offers some great gameplay and storytelling.  Admittably the graphics are not up to par with current expectations, but they aren't actually as bad as some reviews would lead you to believe.  The graphics of the characters themselves are fairly primitive, constructed of simple shapes, but this does not usually pose much of a problem except in closeups.  The backgrounds and cutscenes however look excellent and are occasionally quite stunning.

The port to PC of this game has a few minor problems.  The Disks are mislabeled as 1 through 4, whereas the game will refer to them as the Installation disk plus disks 1-3.  In addition, the default controls are somewhat awkward especially on laptops since they use the numpad which requires the use of the Fn button on most notebooks.  Unfortunately these default controls must be used to access the ability to change control schemes and also each time you name a character during the game.

Also be wary that this game is not fully compatible with Windows XP, and will crash upon reaching the chocobo races.  This compatibility issue is easily fixed however by downloading a patch (just search for ""ff7 XP patch"").

Despite these few issues this game is still a great buy.  The storyline itself is very immersive and I find you spend most of the time progressing through the intricate storyline and new landscapes.  Unlike most rpgs, it doesn't just become repetitive or waste your time with mindless leveling up.  There are enough twists and variety to make this game very interesting to the casual or hardcore gamer.  This is truly a game that defined gaming as we know it today.",4.0
"Sure, the graphics were amazing for it's time, but let's focus on the real thing that makes people continue playing the game... the story... It was so amazing, and it could only be two things: A movie or a game... Square had no experience with movies, and it wouldn't have been as popular a movie because it wouldn't be 60 hours long.

The fighting was actually better than most Final Fantasies, if you ignore the slowness of a single battle, which I did somewhat. I liked the system where you could level up your materia.

Pretty good, not worth the hype thoughm sorry.",4.0
"I think it most fantastic game. Not so complex system and yet we can feel sympathy for the humanistic story. Hero and heroines put a question about ""human love"" to us, and it is in form of gaming, which even children can easily enjoy. So this is a new attempt in gaming industry.",4.0
"All the legendary RPG fun, but on PC. This version is really rare and hard to find; mine was borrowed from a friend. If you've never played FFVII, and see this somewhere, I'd pick it up. It's just as good as on PS1, especially given the fact that virtually any current computer can run it.

It has everything a great RPG needs - strong characters, a great bad guy, some bumbling idiots, a great magic system, lots of sidequests, awesome cutscenes...the epic quest spans 3 disks, so be ready for a good while of playtime. The graphics, by today's standards, are quite weak. Walking around in towns/buildings, things look kinda flat. However, the graphics for in-battle scenes are much better. The cutscenes are awesome, and frequent. And if you pop in one of the 3 disks, you can open and watch whatever cutscene you want with Windows Media Player. The sound and music is pretty good. Lots of nice BGM, and some cool sound effects.

Controls are a bit iffy, on PC at least. You have to use the Num Pad to MOVE. It kinda strains your hand. I don't know what people on a laptop would have to do...at least, you can use a gamepad or customize the controls to your liking.

One more thing: if you're playing this on a computer that uses Windows XP, the game will always lock up and exit out when you try to do chocobo racing. This isn't good, becuase you're required to race chocobos at least once to continue through the game. Use this patch to solve that problem. Google ""Final Fantasy VII PC chocobo patch"" or something, and you should find something that will help you.

Anyway, FFVII is a truly amazing game, anyone with a PS1 or a PC should buy it and play it through at least once.",4.0
"OK, most people probably won't take me seriously, when I say:  THIS GAME WAS TOO SHORT.  Well trust me, when you get this game, you will see what I mean.  Although the AI isn't the best, this game presents a great challenge.  As you work your way through the missions, you will get caught up in the complex story line, full of twists.  This game gets your adrenaline flowing.  Choose your anti-terrorist team from a list of experts, your weapons, your gear, and make a plan.  You can send one team of your strike force around the back of a building while you storm the front, or do any number of other plans.  This game was EXCELLENT.  While it is a great game though, I can't give it five stars, because the AI has room for improvement, and because it is too short.",4.0
"Rainbow Six really brought me into computer gaming. Before I never played games on computers. Now that I've played and owned this I play this and Rogue Spear, (the sequal), all the time.

It's like your there. The game has great graphics and non-stop  action. It's intense and you sit on the edge of your seat the whole time.  The weapons in this game don't have the great collection like Rogue Spear  does, but once your in the setting your weapons don't matter that much. If  you like first person shooters or any swat team type of games than you'll  like this. It's a classic. BUY IT!",4.0
"This Game is Awesome in every way except it only has 5 Mguns 1 Sgun and a few pistols, and the storyline moves toooo quickly but the graphics and stealthy music make up for the minor loss quickly.  iF You beat R6, and  Eagle Watch (like me) then get Rouge Spear",4.0
"I don't know what the other guy is on. This game is sweet and so are the graphics. By the way, It's not one-hit-kills, b/c you have armor. This is both a stragedy game and a doom-type game in one. I thought the only bad  thing about this game is the other people. They sometimes get stuck and  stuff but you can swap your controller guy to the leader of that group to  solve the disputes. Other than that, they're not bad (I could take 'em).  Have fun!",4.0

"I played Grim Fandango in the winter of 2009, a decade after the game was released.  The years showed a bit when I played it -- just getting it to run on my super-ultra-powerful Windows XP Home Edition machine (itself 6 years old) was a bit of an ordeal.  The controls at times were clunky and unresponsive, and I would often find myself piloting Manny into a wall.  The gameplay was rigidly linear, often arbitrarily so, and I was much more dependent on a walkthrough while playing the game than I normally am.

So, as part of the video game medium, I can't give Grim Fandango a perfect rating because it was so frustrating at times.  Otherwise, though, everything else about the game was absolutely excellent.  The story, the graphics, the music, the characters, the dialogue, the voice acting -- everything about the game that was cinematic or literary was better than nearly every other game I've ever played.

So, as a game, it was good but not fantastic; as an interactive movie, it was incredible.  I recommend Grim Fandango to anyone with a bit of technological prowess (it's hard to get running on a machine newer than Windows 98) and a whole lot of patience.",4.0
"The copy I recieved takes a couple of inserts/tries to startup, otherwise both the single player and multiplayer modes function properly.

As for the game itself, if you're into the mission-based FPS genre, or an action packed party game, then you've come to the right place. This game offers both a single player mission based campaign, where you complete certain objectives to reach the next level. The multiplayer is a blast to play with 3 other players. There are multiple weapons, maps, characters, and secrets to keep you and your friends invested. Not to mention the different game modes, control styles, and weapon sets.

Truly a classic and pioneer for the N64 and FPS genre, this is a must have if you own a N64!",4.0

"I must admit that Final Fantasy 7 is more than just a bunch of pingy sound effects, orchestral quality tunes, and colorful graphics. It's more than just a waste of time.(30-60 long hours) It is an emotional mind trip that  takes you into a world where you take on the role of a hero with an  assortment of psychological problems, indeed human flaws. The emotional  depth of Cloud's interactions with his companions is both heartwarming and  sad. (Spoiler Warning) The death of Aeris at the end of Disc 1 will spur  you on in hope of seeing the vile Sephiroth dead at your doing. The man  against man war that his Final Fantasy 7 starts there. Cloud against  Sephiroth as well as at times Cloud against Cloud. The script at times is  childish and at times doesn't exactly have the greatest syntax but it  works. By the end of this adventure in imagination you will be completely  spent. The ending sequence is magnificent and is quite long. As far as the  game itself it deserves a five and then some but the technical negligence  in the development of the PC version is just unacceptable even if it maybe  forgivable and perhaps understandable from a monetary perspective. Final  Fantasy 7 should have had scalable resolutions all the way up to 1600 *  1200 and beyond and supported 32 bit color. The movies should have been  redone to also support higher resolutions.(AVI really looks pathetic.)In  summation the story of Final Fantasy 7 has a number of flaws that are  acceptable and don't destroy the overall experience, but the graphically  low resolution as well as compatibility issues and the grainy AVI  cinematics(They were caused by stretching 320*240 to 640*480 resolution)are  too much not to be a bit annoyed. In short, the translation to the PC seems  to show an apparent lack of effort on the part of the developers.",4.0
"Final Fantasy 7 is yet another gold brick in the shimmering castle of Squaresofts frequent triumphs. You will fall in love with the characters, you'll wish you could jump right into the world. The game's events are structured very well(except for the ever-present ""level up before the final boss"" stage of the game). The graphics are wonderful in their own right. It's just as deep and enthralling as any Final Fantasy should be.
But, to be honest, it's a hassle to bother with the PC version. It's best to get a playstation and play it that way. FF7's system requirements are strict and tend to make the game look and run worse than on the Playstation even if you have a good computer. And keyboard control is no fun at all(ironically, I used a gamepad that resembles the PS controller). And otherwise, this is a striaght port so you're not missing anything if you go for the PS version. But, if you refuse to/can't buy a playstation, this version is better than nothing and you certainly won't want to miss out.",4.0
"Grim Fandango is best described as a detective story in the Film Noir tradition.  The hero of the piece, Manny Calavera, evokes the private eye of the 1940's or '50's melodrama whose story begins with a dame walking  into his office and who quickly finds himself enmeshed in a vast and  corrupt conspiracy which may do him in. The difference here is that at the  beginning of this story, Manny is already dead, and the events transpire in  the Land of the Dead, the place where, according to Mexican folklore,  departed souls go to embark on their journey to the hereafter.
Blending  Mexican folk mythology with the Film Noir genre, Grim Fandango is  ultimately respectful of both traditions, and the striking art design is in  keeping with this approach, combining Art Deco and pre-Columbian elements.  The dialogue, refreshingly witty and literate, draws the player in to the  characters and the story, as does the varied musical score, which includes  Mexican folk melodies.
The characters are for the most part vividly  drawn, and due to the superb performances by the voice talent (particularly  Tony Plana as Manny and Maria Canals as Meche) are fresh despite their  mostly formula roles. One character which may provoke mixed reactions is  that of Glottis, Manny's driver. A cartoonish, Jar Jar Binks-like figure,  Glottis skews the story in a younger direction (at odds with the mild  epithets employed by other characters in a few instances), and while my  children liked Glottis, I expect most players will find him either  endearing or irritating.
The interface in this game is unusual. Rather  than pointing and clicking with a mouse, the player controls Manny's  movements with the arrow keys, waiting to see Manny's head turn to an  object he becomes interested in and clicking ""enter"" to see what  happens. This approach takes some getting used to, and can be cumbersome at  times, but it places Manny at the center of the action and increases the  player's identification with Manny, ultimately serving the story.
The  puzzles, many of which are multi-step, involve crafting Rube Goldberg  solutions to various problems. Some of the solutions are thoroughly  counterintuitive (I won't give anything away, but let's just say that  objects such as balloons or a crystal paperweight are employed in bizarre  ways), and are best solved through aggressive trial and error.  Clues may  pop up from time to time to expedite this sometimes tedious process. That  aside, the Lucasarts team, especially writer Tim Schafer, deserve high  praise for this highly original and literate adventure.",4.0

"Hard to believe it has been almost 20 years since the release of Goldeneye. It makes me feel old and decrepit. Those were the days of actually sitting down with your friend and playing multiplayer together. Xbox Live and online has since essentially ruined those days of genuine bro bonding. Now texting and Facebook has taken over anything social with letter writing and actually picking up the phone and calling someone is becoming rarer. It's sad really!

Thankfully we can go back to simpler times and dust off the 64 and play Goldeneye. What was I even doing in 1997? I was 10 and had not one care in the world. All the main players are here doing the actual voicework and even the director of the Goldeneye film directs the gameplay. The graphics are still passable but something I didn't remember is the extreme slowdown during lots of on-screen explosions or action. It can take quite a bit outta the game and cause the shooting of your weapon a slight delay or lag. Not a complete game changer but certainly takes a point away from an otherwise excellent game.

The kills are hilarious, shoot a guy in the leg he hops, or he will hold his wound and croak slowly. Really amazing and funny AI here, certainly revolutionary as they will even attempt to hide behind cover. Not sure the exact number of missions, maybe around 20? Including the jungle, snowy and runway areas. Bond sports the classic PP7 along with other cool gadgets and weaponry, you can even man a tank in a certain mission. The cheats are great, including a paintball mode, all guns and others. The juiciest part of the game is certainly the multiplayer. Nothing beat grabbing a few friends and karate chopping away at each other or just use the throwing knives.

Definitely a game that revolutionized console FPS shooters. A definite must have for all retro gamers and Bond fanatics alike.",4.0
