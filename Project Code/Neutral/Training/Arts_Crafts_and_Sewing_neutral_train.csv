Review,Rating
I am new at rotary cutting so decided to buy this product to help me do a better job of cutting for my second quilt. I didn't notice any change - still slippery - moved while cutting. I am aware that as a new quilter I probably need more practice rotary cutting.,2.0
"We applied this product to our templates used for free motion quilting.

Application was easy, but the templates still easily slip on the fabric.

Really not worth the money.",2.0
"This did not do a great job at preventing slipping.  The plastic is just not ""sticky"" enough;  It is too slick and the ruler still slides.  It is clear and easy to see through, though.  The little sandpaper dots work better, but they block the markings.",2.0
"I thought I would give this a try, but I can't say the slipping quit, plus at moments it would come off the back side. I have noticed on some fabric the slippage is not as bad, but I use cotton a lot and it just didn't work.",2.0
"a group of ladies that sew Quilts of Valor together tried this product on several rulers, and several cutting mats.  We could not tell there was any help with the slipping of rulers no matter the combination of brands of rulers and/or mats",2.0
"It really doesn't keep your ruler from moving on the fabric.  It's better than nothing, but it's probably not worth it.",2.0
I didn't find this worked well at all.  Don't waste your money here.  Rulers did not hold place any better with this on it at all.,2.0
"Like most quilters, I have a big inventory of rulers.  The key is to keep them where you put them to cut accurately.  I bought this product with the expectation that it would help.  Unfortunately, I found that it doesn't really prevent slippage.  I have experienced much better grip using the little sandpaper dots.  They don't really obscure the marks and are cheaper.",2.0
"Right out of the box, the machine was missing the zigzag presser foot. I called Brother and they said I had to contact the retailer. When I finally got the foot, the machine was inoperable. I never even got to sew anything! I purchased a Singer 1507 and I am very pleased.",2.0
"I've had this machine little more than two weeks, and every day I run into some sort of problem. For $100 you can't expect great quality, and you certainly don't get it with this machine.",2.0
"This machine is a nightmare, it is hard to use for my mother who is an experienced sewer and has been sewing since her 20's and sews very often. The machine is lacking in many simple thing such as the fact that the thread guide in step 4 doesn't stick out of the covering and so you have a hard time threading it, the needle threader instructions aren't clear and we still haven't figuredout how to use it, and the presser foot is just simply slid on rather than screwed tightly and so it often falls off if you move your hand over it while trying to thread the needle. This is so cheaply made and not at all user-friendly. It's a waste of $100. At least if you buy it at a proper store, you can try it out and have someone show you how to use it before you buy, by ordering online, you don't know what your getting nor have anyone to show you how to use it.",2.0
"We ordered 7 of these machines for our school sewing class, and each machine is in use approximately 1-2 hours per week.  Upon receipt, one of the machines would not work, and we received a replacement.  We have now been using the machines for about 6 weeks, and have consistently had problems with the bobbin casing dislocating and causing the needle to jam or break.  The sewing instructor, who has extensive sewing experience, used the word temperamental to describe them and said that they are a nightmare for the frustrated students attempting to learn to sew.  They were reasonably priced, but I guess you get what you pay for.",2.0
I was hoping this product would work on silver/crystal jewelry combinations but it is best for the crystal. Not effective on silver.,2.0
This product did a really poor job of cleaning my silver earrings; it didn't remove much tarnish.,2.0
Doesn't clean very well.,2.0
"This product just doesn't work! The cover doesn't fit right and the product leaks. Additionally, if you are looking for a silver or platinum clean, this product just isn't for you. It does an okay job on stones and gold. In my opinion, this product just isn't worth the money!",2.0
"This cleaner works just fine. That being said, the bottle leaks like crazy even when closed. It leaked so much that I kept it in a zip lock bag, which began to smell terrible.
I ended up throwing it away. Waste of money because of the horrible packaging.",2.0
I did not find it to be very good. Bought by reading the good reviews and got fooled I guess. It doesn't do a very good job. I would say it is just an okay product.,2.0
"The liquid works as well as the more expensive brands, however, the packaging is very poor and cheap.  The top was difficult to screw on properly once opening and this caused a lot of the liquid to evaporate and was a nuisance. In addition, the tray and brush inside are very difficult to reach/grab so you end up sticking you fingers inside the liquid for every cleaning.  I am happy to pay more for the better packaged jewelry cleaners.",2.0
"The stamps themselves work well. The brass spring-loaded tool that goes with it is junk. When you try to strike it slips up and down and you lose the firm grip and placement on your piece. If you use this to stamp any metal the punching tool just brakes. The spring failed and the upper portion of the handle just slid over the lower part and split apart, pieces going into my engine block! Not fun at all. I would suggest buying a kit that has longer stamp shafts and just using a pair of pliers to hold it.  A jeweler's hammer doesn't have enough mass to mark what you are stamping. Any heavier hammer smashed the tool. Just stick with a tool without the spring in it for the next kits.",2.0
It does not come with directions and I don't know how to use the punch.,2.0
"This is a SINGLE pack of 5 needles (at over a dollar per needle), not a ""3-pack"" or ""3/Pkg"" as description suggests.
Decent needles, faulty advertisement.",2.0
"not made in England as the ad states.
quote from the package ""assembled ans inspected in England using needles imported by Entaco to our Quality and specification""",2.0
This is not quite what I thought it would be. The sand comes off. It's not see through so it obscures my cutting ruler measurements. It's small so it's not big of a deal.,2.0
"I definitely would not waste my time and money buying this variety of needle threaders.  I have used these and they do work great, but they are SO easy to lose and bend.  For just a few dollars more you can get a very sturdy Clover needle threader that works like a champ every time and includes a thread cutter!

Here is a great overview and tutorial on how the Clover needle threader works.",2.0
"I wouldn't recommend this for hemming pants. The hem stayed in place while I wore the pants, but then I washed the pants ONCE and it came apart. I've used other hemming tape that lasted much, much longer. For this to fall apart after one wash is ridiculous.",2.0
don't use on heavy fabric. it won't hold. didn't hold my son's taekwondo uniform hems. this stuff looks like a fabric softener sheet. very lightweight. probably good for the lightest materials but won't hold up jeans or kakis.,2.0
"They can thread small sewing needle eyes, but only with some finagling. However, they'd all disappeared within weeks. They're IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP TRACK OFpractically invisible. Staggeringly OVERPRICED for something that's apparently MEANT TO BE DISPOSABLE. Nothing special about them to make them worth over a dollar apiece.",2.0
Not for serger machines.  To thick.,2.0
It did not hold the frantic together. I would only use it for very light duty jobs.,2.0
"Mediocre, compared to store bought brand",2.0
The threaders will work only on large eye needles.  Is too large for embroidery needles.,2.0
DOES NOT hold well at all..... and takes numerous times with the iron to even start the fusing process,2.0
"Didn't stick well, especially after clothes went through the laundry once. You'd do better to bite the bullet and hem your pants the real way, with a needle and thread. That's what I did.",2.0
I'm sorry for a bad review. But this needle threader is thick. Probably can be use for big needle head. If you plan to use for embroidery needle. Then it doesn't work.,2.0
"I don't know if it was my iron that was not hot enough, but this tape wasn't really that sticky. I used it for some lightweight canvas drapes and it's holding OK for now, but doubt it will last through more than a few washes.  If I need to buy more I'll probably try a different brand.",2.0
"This product is marked as a number 1 seller in the sewing and crafts department. I was amazed by how easily it ironed onto the pants i was hemming and it seemed to hold up fine while wearing the pants. However after washing the pants once in cold water the hemming tape began to let go and seemed to disintegrate. If you're using this for something like curtains or another craft project that won't ever need to be washed, I recommend this product but for clothing for something that will be washed on a regular basis this hemming tape will not hold up.

I did follow the directions very carefully and it did initially bond to the pants.",2.0
"Thought I could hem a skirt myself even though I do not own a machine.  After fighting with this for some time, following the instructions, I called my neighbor with a machine and she sewed it for me.",2.0
"Very flimsy, two in package already broken when received.",2.0
it disintegrated beneath and did not ad hear to fabric and scorched my hoodie - be careful!,2.0
Barely works,2.0
Worked for a while until the rubber grip came loose.,2.0
"Worth $6? Nope. I should have just purchased wire and folded it in half by myself. Yes you can add many beads at once but gripping this ultra thin piece of wire and pulling the beads onto the yarn is tedious. For someone making jewelry it might be better but like I said in the beginning...
Buy thin wire, fold it over and thread your beads. Delivery from this company is also unbearably slow and when I contacted the seller  to find out where my package was the response was merely... ""It will be there soon.""",2.0
As near as I can tell (and I work leather as well as sew with fabric) this thimble is not made of leather as advertised.  We will see if the vinyl holds up to use.,2.0
"This was my favorite thimble for years, but the three new ones I purchased last week are leagues below the quality of the ones I purchased just a few years ago.  Unfortunately, they've gone to a thinner leather that wears out after just one day of quilting.  Also, the sizes vary tremendously -- I bought three medium, but all three are significantly different in size.  One is too big, one fits as expected, and one is slightly big.  Yes, after just three days, I'm on my last thimble.

The design is superior to anything else, but they'll need to put the quality back before I buy more.",2.0
Doesn't have a metal tip. Just leather.,2.0
"This punch was awesome in theory, but from the moment I got it, it stuck when punched down. You had to pry it apart. It lasted all of a month or so before it broke. I fixed the spring (which is the part that broke), and within a week it broke. I was super bummed, as I use it daily in my classroom.",2.0
The tool was great for the project I was working on for Valentine's Day but the tool's spring came out and the tool no longer worked after a few punches. I was disappointed because I still had a couple hundred punches I needed to make and therefore had to use a round punch. The tool took considerably longer to ship than other products I have ordered on Amazon. I believe it is a good tool and rectangle punches are hard to find.,2.0
Bought this to fix the hem on my shorts. Looked great until I washed it once and then the material came unglued and I'll have to fix it all over again.  Wouldn't buy again.,2.0
"Could not use, size was very large.  Good product for people who have nails, but, site is not helpful in letting you choose the correct size, maybe you could select right size if it went by your ring finger size. Too bad, it seems to be a good idea for stitching thru thick fabric.",2.0
Not as I expected.  Didn't do as I was expecting.,2.0
"This product worked for about 300 clicks, then it became misaligned and wouldn't close anymore. Luckily I only needed it for a one-time project but beware of you want to get prolonged use out of this.",2.0
"I have small hands, I need to wear children's gloves in order for them to fit. I purchased a small size and it doesn't even fit my pinkie finger. It doesn't appear that it will stretch so I have a thimble that I cannot use.

I like the style and will probably try again with a larger size, but what to infom that sizing seems to run small.",2.0
Did not have a metal tip.  It's just a small leather cup with an opening in the end where perhaps a metal tip was planned to fill.,2.0
"This does not even punch one small piece of paper.  I would not buy this product again.  I bought this to give special punches for student behavior cards, and I couldn't get it to work correctly at ALL.  A regular hole puncher is much more effective.",2.0
not very moist. had to press hard to pick up color,2.0
Wasn't as big as it looks!,2.0
This order was for ONE purse handle? I Will be returning the purse handle unopened. I should have read the description better.,2.0
Doesn't seem to punch very cleanly at all. The alignment is off and one can't even get the punch to fully depress with nothing in it let alone a piece of paper.,2.0
"The pads are not big enough, should only be 4 colors.",2.0
It's difficult to punch even one piece of paper.  The handle mechanism is very stiff.,2.0
"The instructions seem redundant to me. Why use a damp pressing cloth, if one has a steam iron? Wouldn't the steam do the same job? I haven't washed the jeans yet, so I don't know, if this flimsy tape will hold.
Later....the TAPE DID NOT HOLD IN THE WASH!",2.0
"The product was way to small to use for grading stamps....
It was suppose to be used for grading class papers.",2.0
"I completely misunderstood this ad, I thought that each of the pads would be 4 inches, but the ENTIRE pad is 4 inches.  For the purpose of this pad (kid's craft time) this will be completely useless unless I want rainbow foot and hand prints.  Highly disappointed.",2.0
Does not work well on khakis or jeans. Essentially useless on these products. Probably works fine thinner fabrics.,2.0
"Purchased for punching pages one at a time.  After about 50 pages, the ""clamping"" mechanism became more difficult and pages were getting stuck. Seems to need sharpened frequently.  (I've heard to use aluminum foil to do this).",2.0
Didn't work.  I'm going to have to pay to have these pants hemmed.,2.0
Didn't work to well :(,2.0
Good design But poor quality threads.,2.0
Not at all what I expected. Sent it back,2.0
"This punch was not sturdy enough for what I wanted, punching through plastic.  It would probably be fine for paper.",2.0
I found this tape to not work very well at all. It didn't hold the gauze to my skin for very long. I don't know if it was me or the tape.,2.0
Tried my wife's work pants and I really had to get the iron overly hot to get it to stick. After 2 washes it was falling out. It's a good temporary fix but not permanent.,2.0
"I bought this to punch holes in Id tags, but instead of the rectangle running parallel to the punch it runs perpendicular, making it impossible to get the hole where you need it.",2.0
"Instructions are extremely hard to follow. Colors blend into each other and you have to guess where to start each color. Chart doesn't help much, since it's not clearly labeled, and just gives general idea of the colors but not where they begin and end.",2.0
Hated it - way too difficut for a beginner - ended up using the thread for other stuff :(,2.0
I was making my own curtains and bought this to hem the bottoms of them easily. It doesn't really hold the fabric together really well.,2.0
"I had hoped that it would punch holes in polyethylene Ziploc bags but it failed to punch them cleanly.

It punches paper and card stock well (for which it was designed), but I was expecting (hoping) more from it.
We have several Fiskars scissors which are GREAT, so I had hoped that this Fiskars punch would have sufficiently close fitting clearances to punch this ""stringy"" material. Not so.

At this date, I have not found any punch that will do the job.",2.0
"Ordered 2 of these, one works perfect, the second one won't cut, very disappointing since we were trying to decorate out Girl Scout Cookie boxes for Valentines day",2.0
"I was not expecting a large colored mesh canvas.  I wanted the 14 count closed canvas with a nice graph to show what colors went where.  The colored mesh uses colors that are so close together in hue that it is difficult in good light and impossible in lower light, to tell what color it should be.  The picture is beautiful.  The yarn is packed very nicely and easy to get to but I won't get another kit from Dimensions.",2.0
"Item I received is marked as defective and has heavy staining from the instructions panel, it can not be used for any light colored projects. This was not listed as a ""second"", which it should have been!",2.0
Canvas broke in the middle after one week. Threat is cheap and hard to work with,2.0
Several thread colors run short and have to be reordered before item can be completed.  Often color changes are not visible from the canvass and have to be guessed at from the diagram.,2.0
broke in less than 2 mos.,2.0
This is my second time purchasing this item and for whatever reason they just don't hold up.  The punch dulls very quickly and the mechanics give out.,2.0
Have had good luck with several Dimensions Kits.  This one is way short on some colors of floss.  What a pain to keep having to find color matches.  What happened to cause this ?,2.0
The heart is up side down for many projects...get what you pay for.,2.0
sticks when you punch cardstock,2.0
"I got these tools to create slots for slot sculptures - ala the Charles and Ray Eames cards - with my students.  I tried the Slot Punches for ID cards, but I needed a vertical, instead of horizontal punch.  Day one of using the punch, on lightweight cardboard, and the punch bent.  The metal part.  It bent from my trying to squeeze it enough to make a hole, and while my hands are strong - a hole punch should be able to handle a human squeeze.  The other one works okay, but not great with the weight of the material I am trying to punch through.",2.0
doest really hold that well,2.0
Wasnt what i expected. My jeans still need a stitch or two,2.0
"Having bought several June Tailor items, including thread racks, in the past, I had no qualms about ordering my first mid-size cone rack.  Boy was I disappointed!  The dowels were loose and crooked.  The racks were stapled onto the slats and were not very secure.  Before I could use it I had to re glue the dowels, reattach one row and drill holes for hanging.

Oh June!  What happened to your pride in workmanship?  These are made so cheaply, yet the price is anything but.  I'll not be buying any more of these.",2.0
"It was the correct brand and color, but both cans of paint that I purchased either had bad spray nozzles, or the paint was too old to use!",2.0
Worth about what I paid got it.  Not much.,2.0
"Decently well made but the geometry of the stand is all wrong. Wobbly if standing. Don't expect to keep the bobbin with the spool.  Sticks are long enough but larger in diameter than the hole in every bobbin I tested.

I kept mine and doctored it.  Drilled top and bottom so I could screw to wall mollies and whittled/sanded the sticks so the bobbin would fit.  What was June Tailor thinking????",2.0
"I'm not sure if mine is an exception to the rule, or what, but I found this hole punch very difficult to use. I'm relatively young, my hands are strong, but my hand aches after just a few uses. I feel that the product should not be this difficult to use.

I won't be returning it, but I won't be buying the other Fiskars shape punches that I was previously considering purchasing.",2.0
Something wrong with the tip.  It splatters out the paint and gets on your fingers and the top of the can.  It came with a small pin that blocked the nozzle.  Maybe I shouldn't have pulled it off.  But it looked like it was blocking the nozzle.  A simple spray can usually isn't this complicated or messy.,2.0
"I had the same experience as several other people have mentioned here. I picked up a bottle from Wal-mart and it said paint and primer in one and 25% more, but I used 75% more trying to cover, so you really get a lot less. I have also had much better coverage experience with Rustoleum. I can't speak to the color because it is so sheer I couldn't even get enough coats on to see what the final color would look like. If it is good on plastics or something, maybe that could justify the purchase (even then I don't know), but for first cover on pine or plywood, no way. You have to prime first, which defeats the purpose. Yes I shook the bottle, sprayed at appropriate distance in long sweeps, etc. It's the product.",2.0
"Its... ok. REALY thick, and when you try to spray it, it pushes the metallic filling out of the way, so you CANNOT get an even finish. At. All. Wouldnt realy recommend.",2.0
This product is meant for punching water or air only! We were trying to punch ID cards and it broke on the first ID.,2.0
"So, the thing punches a hole too small and in the wrong orientation?  Did you research this buy or just hit the button?

Of course, some confusion is brought on by the advertising idiots at Fiskars writing the cover blurb.  They got the size wrong in both metric and imperial.  Quite an accomplishment there Fiskars dudes and dudettes, congratulations.

The package says ""Rectangle, 1/4"", 6mm"".  They even put the ""1/4"" in BIGGER text so us American dummies that refuse to convert to a less idiot measurement system THAT THE ENTIRE REST OF THE WORLD USES can read it.

Well, it IS a rectangle... but the actual measurements of the hole it punches is 2mm X 5.5mm.  And yes, I have one and yes, I actually measured the hole.  It works for me punching stringer notches in model aircraft formers... provided the formers are thin.  How long it will last is another question, but being Fiskars I don't think it will be long.",2.0
"watch out for the high delivery costs.
might have been better to just get it from a shop.",2.0
"Thought I'd give Krylon another shot. Not impressed. The paint easily scraped off metal with a fingernail while handling so where's the primer at?  Had to redo an entire project and also had bubbling in spots I tried to recover. As a cheap paint for wood it's fine I guess, I prefer Rustoleum, coverage seems smoother. I'll buy a straight primer paint next time as a prep. Don't buy into the primer duo nonsense.",2.0
"With first couple of uses spit out chunks which ruined work...tried turning the can upside down and spray to clear it but it would not work at all...
This was the same with both cans I bought...Black & White of the same product worked well....I can only guess that product was old and had coagulated to the point that it could not clear the spray cap even with extended shaking...",2.0
"I purchased this heart hole puncher to use as the hole at the top of my tag cards through which to thread a ribbon.  However, it is only possible to punch holes on the BOTTOM of cards to have the heart in its correct side up.  With the inability to switch or alter the punch shape, I am only able to punch upside down or sideways hearts at the top of the card, which is disappointing as it looks terrible.  Will return.",2.0
"I bought this to replace a hole punch I'm sure I've had for 20 years. The new one didn't work as well as my old one. My old one is just a standard punch I had in school -- nothing special, but after all the uses it still punched through paper and thicker stock better than the new one.",2.0
"I tried to paint my phone case with this at least 3 times last week. I waited for it to dry each time, but it never completely stuck. This paint may be able to stick on other surfaces, but definitely not rubber.",2.0
"doesnt work too well when making holes, i would use it mainly for cards, not everyday paper use, cute though",2.0
this stuff does not stick for anything!! i tried to use it to take my pants up an inch and it would not adhere even with constant heat. i definitely would not recommend this to use as hem tape!,2.0
This worked great until I washed my pants. Then it fell right out and I was back where I started when I originally tried to hem my pants. This wasn't worth the time I put into trying to hem 6 pairs of pants.,2.0
"The eye of the needle is too small for embroidery floss.. You may be able to get 2 strands in it, but forget about 3 strands, which is what i use..Way too expensive for needles that can't be used for their purpose.. I've tried using a threader, but it just pulls apart trying to get through the eye... I have now purchased 4 styles of the John James needles and none of them seem worth the extra money...",2.0
"I typically use Rustoleum 2x Ultra Cover spray paint. I decided to try the Krylon as they were offering 25% more for the same price. This was a mistake.

The Krylon was very difficult to apply evenly, created alot of dust and overspray and came out thin and pooled easily. Perhaps it's meant to be applied in many very thin layers, but I find the Rustoleum to be much easier to apply with better results. The Krylon sun yellow is also flatter in color than the Rustoleum which is noticeably brighter. I regret trying the Krylon and have gone back to the Rustoleum.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rust-Oleum-249092-Painter-s-Touch-Multi-Purpose-Spray-Paint-12-Ounce-Sun-Yellow/dp/B002BWOS0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rust-Oleum 249092 Painter's Touch Multi Purpose Spray Paint, 12-Ounce, Sun Yellow</a>",2.0
"I tried everything, read all the instructions, this just does not bond strong enough to hold up the hem of my pants. It came loose after a few days. Can't see how it can survive any washings. Time to break out the sewing kit.",2.0
"Incredibly unimpressed with the quality of this hole punch. Admittedly, I was looking to punch holes in an Altoids mint tin, but these things didn't hold up at all. They deformed from hand strength alone. I'd return the item but it's nearly unrecognizable after I vented my frustration.",2.0
"It would probably be fine for one sheet of paper, but broke when we tried to punch a key card.  If all you want it for is paper it is probably ok",2.0
"Bought this to remove the logo off of old scrubs, but it ended up tearing holes through them and making them unwearable.",2.0
did not work for me,2.0
"The hole this tool makes is not as large as I needed it to be (wide enough to clip a lanyard to), so I have to punch everything twice.",2.0
Small bubbles and ran a lot...I will try another brand,2.0
"it did not cut like i thought it would, their was a review that said it cut through a thin tin container so i figured it could cut through three thickness's of material it doesn't now i still have to find something else",2.0
"I liked it at first, but the blade dulled very quickly",2.0
"IMO, it's a nasty color blue. Looks kinda loud and cheap. But, we're all different, and you might like it. It just doesn't tend to look like the color on the cap.",2.0
Worked for 2 minutes and then I couldn't get anything to come out of it anymore. I used it exactly how they said to use it in the directions. Very frustrating since I had to finish a project and had to go buy a new can last minute.,2.0
The ridges on the handle make for an uncomfortable grip when ripping the stitches out.  Also thought the head of the ripper was a bit big to get into the small areas of needlepoint.,2.0
"Long prong broke the first time I used it removing dog hair from my vac.  Probably is fine for ripping thread stitches, but don't get creative.  And in all fairness, they never said it would cut dog hair.  Thanks for the replacement, Amazon.",2.0
"This was supposed to be good on almost all products, it will NOT work for Styrofoam.  It caused it to melt, kinda odd.  I needed it for my daughter's mickey mouse party.  Good Price, but didn't work for what I needed.",2.0
"This yarn is probably fine for kids' craft projects and maybe some lessons in the most basic of knitting or crochet stitches, but it was a poor choice for crocheting a hat. It's not soft at all, and it's so very inelastic. Even having made my gauge swatch, I ended up with a hat that was too big simply because the ribbing didn't hug in like it was supposed to. It stayed stiff and extended. I made the exact same pattern with an alpaca yarn and it came out beautifully, but the hat from this yarn I'll chalk up to a learning experience.",2.0
The Spinrite Softee Baby is inconsistent between solid colors of the same brand.  In this color (Little Bo Peep) the beige and white matched with those solids but the pink is much much brighter than the pink of the same brand so I could not use it for my project.,2.0
"Terrible for painting steel plate pistol/rifle targets. Runs extremely easily, almost like water. Coverage is terrible. Requires light spraying, waiting , repeat.",2.0
I thought that this was the larger size skein because the description said ECONOMY but it turned out being the regular size skein (I didn't know the size by ounces at the time). Just so everyone will know... I would of never paid over $7.00 for what I could of got for $3.00 at Walmart. My bad!,2.0
"Picture not printed on cloth. Otherwise it was great. But without the picture on the cloth, I haven't the time or patience to count squares. Disappointed because it was to be a gift.",2.0
This is not good for any kind of small stiching and it doesn't work well on most material.,2.0
"I have been stitching the Mariner's Light kit.

I do not like the fabric, floss or needle. The fabric is stiff, unpleasant to work with, the floss is nowhere near as nice as DMC, resists frogging, tangles even when I use Thread Heaven. The needle is flimsy and bends easily.

I do like the thread organizing system.

I do not think I will be purchasing any more Dimensions kits - too expensive for Chinese manufactured near-junk.",2.0
I liked the product but have discoverd it was wsyyyyy overpriced!!!,2.0
"This yarn should not be called ""glow"" anything.  It is misleading.  I would not have purchased it had I known it does not glow.",2.0
Rustoleum goes on much thicker and cleaner,2.0
"First time working with this brand yarn, and never again!  It felt soft while on the skein, but it's such a light weight yarn.  I hate it.  The baby blanket I'm making looks and feels cheap.  So disappointed.",2.0
"I bought this to spray in our driveway, with 6 coats you could still barely see it.",2.0
Horrible. Sprayed everywhere like many other reviewers mentioned. I bought two cans of this to cover a 2x2 Expedite unit and it wasn't even close to being enough.,2.0
"We ordered this to paint some white pic pipes in the garden. This was a good deep green color for it. It went on smoothly and easily. Unfortunately after 3 months and rain, it is starting to peel off. So not great for pvc plastics.",2.0

"I agree with a LOT of the other reviewers in regards to the poor spray quality of the application. I LOVE the color, however, after beginning my project (bottom drawers for a crib) I began to notice how many coats I needed to do in order to get a smooth, fully covered finish. I am on my SECOND drawer face (maybe an 18"" wide flat drawer panel) and am already almost out of paint. The majority of paint goes anywhere but on your project. The fancy new spray nozzle basically forces you to deliver several thin coats of barely there paint (which comes out in a splotchy manner) or get so close you develop runs and crackling. I actually sprayed a ceramic owl with this paint prior to my crib and ruined the owl from what I thought was my poor painting technique. Turns out after much more use with this can it can indeed be attributed to the nozzle and spray coverage. I now have to sand down one of my crib drawers that resulted in severe crackling and hope I can obtain an even coat with this horrible product I already committed to. Scratch that, I'll sand down both drawers, trash this mess and use Rust-Oleum.",2.0
very hard to use - nozzle was hard to hold down to spray - paint dripped,2.0

"This was a complete bust. I was painting a wicker chest, and the paint immediately beaded up and dripped away, offering very little coverage, even over primer, even after many coats. I had to buy another brand that's still not great, but is better. I had great success with Krylon gold spray paint for some plastic dinosaurs, but this was pretty useless.",2.0
This used to be Great paint with a lot of the body shops using it for small touch ups where it wouldn't be noticed but I got a can of their flat and their shiny and while the FLAT worked very good to the last the SHINY Krylon paint plugged about half way through and even changing tips wouldn't help it to spray so I bought HALF a can ! IF it had been a store around here I would have at least been able to take it back and get some satisfactions but not on line. I am pretty sure that this will be the end of my using Krylon paint. They also have a new spray tip that plugs and might have something to do with their paint cheating you out of at least half a can. I talked to a lady at ACE hardware and she said that this problem isn't just an Isolated incident either? Sorry but I won't use their paint again.,2.0
the color pictured is very very very different then the color received - more of an eggplant color  tooo dark,2.0
"The color was exactly what I wanted. (Spider-Man blue for my kid's swing) The can, however, came without a nozzle. If I hadn't had an old krylon can available, this review would have been 1 star and a personal call to the company. Other spray paint nozzles I tried would not work because their nozzles go directly inside the can while krylon's nozzles attatch to a tip coming from the inside.",2.0

"The color I got was named bright red.  The color is not bright red.  It is more pink-ish, like watermelon, and not bright.",2.0
"I have used Krylon as my go to paint for many projects over the years. It always went on easily, laid down nicely to a good finish, covered well, and rarely sagged or ran. in short it was very forgiving for an occasional user like myself. These properties were a result of getting the formula just right for surface tension, viscosity, the perfect ratio of pigment to solvent, and the correct drying time to balance between flashing off too fast so it can't flow, to drying too slowly so it won't sag or run. Because of this for decades Krylon was my go-to spray can paint choice every time. I would drive to another hardware store in another town to get it over any other brand if I had to. It used to be that good.

Well the regulations about paint have changed and virtually all paint manufacturers are scrambling to change thier formulas to comply. Not just spray cans, but all paints from professional automotive finishes to house paints. Like everyone else Krylon has had to change thier formula.

But the new Krylon is not so great. It has too little pigment to solvent, which means you have to put down multiple thin coats, or apply a thicker coat to cover. BUT WAIT!  When you lay this new formula paint on thin you get flash-off before it flows.... which resluts in a rough granular sort of surface, and if you lay it on a little thicker it dries too slowly which then leads to two kinds of problems: One is runs and sags.  The other is the top-most surface dries faster than the underlying paint, which causes alligatoring. Once you get alligatoring there is no way to fix it save removing all the paint right back down to the bare workpiece. And of course the only way to fix a run or sag is to let it dry for a good long time, 24 to 48 hours minimum, more if you can afford the time...and sand it out and recoat.

Next; the new style spray tip and can are very sensitive to can position. Even a brand new full can will sputter if held at an angle as little as say 20-30 degrees from vertical. This will screw up your painting for certain. Somehow the old style cans were better in this regard. Again, just more forgiving of off-vertical shots.

Also this new formula can puts a ton of mist into the air. Several minutes after spraying even a very small piece a large cloud of paint mist remains surrounding the piece and everything near it. Mostly I worry about this in terms of it settling back on the new work and ruining the finish. You could set up a fan, but that can cause other problems of its own by stirring up dust etc. The old style Krylon was never a problem in this regard.

It claims to dry in 10 minutes. The old stuff really did dry fast. You could over-coat in about 15-30 minutes or so depending on the humidity and temperature. This stuff is at beast tacky in 10 minutes, and still very soft after an hour or more, certainly not ready for another coat or to be touched or handled not even gently.... and no where near ready for the next coat. Which is an issue because....(looping back...) there is not enough pigment to cover, so you need lots of coats. That longer drying time translates in to longer project times, but also into more dust and debris settling into your painted surface before it is hard.

Bottom line this paint is persnickity to use. It is NOT AT ALL like the old formula Krylon. The easy and reliable nature of painting with the old Krylon was my main reason for choosing this paint for a couple of recent projects over the past year. At first I thought I had just gotten a bad can.... not so. Multiple cans exhibit the same faults.

 Then I thought it was just life with the new formula paints and I had to learn to deal with it and become a better painter.... but honestly I'v come along way since I first picked up my first can of Krylon back in the 70's and I have become a decent home-project painter... and unlike back then I now have a shop with controlled temperature and good light and so on. I still can't make this paint do the job.  I have a current small project that I have had to take back to bare workpiece TWICE now because of this stuff.... causing a delay of at least 4 days while I wait for the paint to get hard enough to sand off cleanly. I'm ready to give up and move on. I'm on my way out right now to buy another brand.

If you are not very experienced with spray paints and you don't have a lot of time to mess around with a learning curve for a home decor or modeling project, stay away from this paint. Come to think of it, even if you ARE a prety darn good painter, stay away from this product.",2.0

"This seam ripper is not as good as it's smaller counterparts. The handle is bulky and awkward to hold. With this design you are unable to place the cap on the end of the handle so the cap is easily lost. The tip of the seam ripper is too large to large to get into delicate parts of the seams... you end up having to force it thru the threads risking putting holes into your project. The blade itself was not sharp and seemed to have flaws in it before the first use. After a few uses the little red ball that protects the short end fell off making it almost impossible to not damage the fabric you are working with. This may be a low price but you definitely get what you pay for. The smaller ones work better and seem to hold up better than this ""deluxe"" one.",2.0

This is usely a good yarn for price. I pitched 3. The first one was really nice when I started on my blanket. Half way through it was not twisted as well as at the beginning but still it was fine. The other two was separating and catching on the crochet hook. I was making a baby blanket but because of the separating of the yarn I decided to make it a smaller blanket for my grandaughters dolls. I would not buy this again because of the time you lose when it splits on the hook and the stitches are not always smooth.,2.0
I was quite disappointed that the fabric for the pillow cases was not very soft.  I haven't done stamped cross stitch for some years now--sticking to counted cross stitch.

"When purchasing a multi-colored skein of yarn like this, I want to make something multicolored using the blend of colors displayed in the yarn ball. I don't want something that only changes color every 12 feet, and which results in a striped piece of work (which I can do myself with multiple yarn colors!) rather than a nicely blended multi-color pattern. See attached pictures for an example where this ""Deep Sea"" yarn resulted in a striped scarf, while the YarnBee purple scarf I made previously had a much more blended result of colors.

In addition, the actual fullness of the fake furn yarn was not nearly as full as what I was used to, resulting in me having to use a much smaller hook for the same fluffy effect. And it doesn't feel as soft as other fake fur yarns I am used to.

The one positive thing I think is I haven't found any breaks in the yarn yet, and it does seem to be a nice quality, which results in me giving it 2 stars despite it's lack of fullness, softness, and color variety. This brand might be nicer for solid color work using smaller hooks, but I'd advise against their multi colored yarns, or using this brand if you want to do a larger/looser pattern.",2.0

From lion yarn, http://www.lionbrand.com/faq/5.html
For example, one Pound of Love is 16 ounces, 1,020 yards. To use Fishermen's Wool in a pattern calling for one Pound of Love, one would look at the yards in Fishermen's Wool: 465 each. 1,020 divided by 465 = 2.19. Each Fishermen's Wool is 8 ounces, so you can see if you just bought 2 Fishermen's Wool (to equal 16 ounces), you might well come up short, depending on whether the designer used the entire amount of Pound of Love for her design.",2.0

If you pull to unravel the yarn not knowing it's knotted, it gets thin and then snaps off. Once that happens good luck finding an end again!

"I am just learning to crochet and selected this yarn because it had great reviews, the skein was large and the price was low. The color is as vibrant and wonderful as the picture would lead you to believe, and the skein really is huge given the low price. I figured this would be a great yarn to learn and practice on. However, I think this product is for those who have a lot more experience working with yarn than I do. The yarn kept splitting apart. Very often my hook would go through the yarn itself, instead of through the stitch, causing catches and knots in my work. I found this very frustrating and it slowed me down a lot. Finally I gave up and passed this yarn on to a friend who is a lot more experienced than I am. The yarn is beautiful, but a nightmare for beginners like me.

They are somewhat pricier (and the skeins are usually much smaller), but I found that yarn to be much easier to work with.

So I took the page with the diagram and folded it so I could lay it face down centered on the glass of my scanner.  Then I scanned that image and saved as PDF.

I adjusted my printer resolution to maximum or 1200 DPI, this is a laser printer, not a dot matrix (won't feed) and not an inkjet (will smudge).  I adjusted the feeder to ""thick envelope,"" and the feed from automatic to ""manual.""  I have a Brother Multi-Function printer, not a big one, a desktop one, and a medium priced one, available here, or from Brother, etc.

I then fed the cloth into the printer through the manual slot pushing gently and I got a ""stamp"" in other words, a printout of the scanned diagram onto my cloth.

It's not perfect because it's not centered and I did not edit out the words above the image but it can be blocked and framed to hide those and to compensate for a slightly off-center image.  With some practice, one could conceivably set the printer to 8.5X10 instead of 8.5X11 because that is the size of cloth provided.

The ""stamped"" image is very detailed and clear and easy to sew for someone with good eyes, me, I use one of two magnifier lamps purchased on Amazon, but after doing the steps (Abby's Kludge) above, I was able to start and in a day or so complete the left frog's right foot, because there are not a whole lot of stitches, it's a beginner's kit.

I would not give this to a beginner without printing the image on the cloth!

I googled ""how to transfer embroidery image"" and the first suggestion did not work for me--tape the diagram on the window and the cloth over it and trace--I could not get enough detail in that manner, perhaps a lit craft table (available on Amazon but pricey and takes up space) or a drafting table with a lamp underneath would work, a laser printer works quite well, but does put extra ink on the image that has to be blocked out by a frame shop unless the person sewing can cut art card stock or find a suitable frame with precut stock just the right size opening (can be done by shopping around at art supply stores). I figure if I complete it, it's worth a framer's fee to preserve it.

This is the first such cross stitch project I've done in about 44 years, it brings back some memories. One thing I noticed is it creates calm to do it as pickup work, and if I make a mistake I can rip it out start over and no harm done. 44 years ago I used to have less patience with myself when I made these mistakes, despite having better eyesight then.

I don't have the pieces I made when I was 10...if anyone reading knows where they are, I would like them returned.",2.0
"I ordered this to see what it was. So yeah.. This is the normal, small size that you get at Michael's for 1.99. Don't waste your money.",2.0
"Love the color, however, the yarn gets stringier as you use it until it is very hard to use due to extreme stinginess. The yarn threads do not hold together, after project is finished I will not purchase again. Very disappointed in Red Heart Quality. Have used Red Heart for decades, maybe I got a bad one????",2.0
"Yarn has a beautiful color and it is soft, however it is pretty thin, compared to other Red Heart yarns.  In some areas has some knots that needed to be cut out.",2.0
"From the picture, this looked much more of a finer yarn than it is. It turned out bulky and unuseable and was not soft at all. Disappointed.",2.0
Beautiful colors but very thin. It's more like a size 2 baby yarn without the softness than a size 4 worsted weight. Also it cost too much. You can save almost $5 per skein by buying the same brand at Wal-Mart ($2.88 each).,2.0
"In the past, I've bought this yarn from Walmart and really liked it. However, it hasn't been available for a while, so I thought I'd just order it online. The packaging looks the same, but the quality of the yarn is not good. It's thinner than usual, and it's difficult to work with because it snags easily.",2.0
"I have etched more glass than I care to admit. This is the first time I have used this brand of product. It does not come with instructions, so I looked it up on the internet. Doing as it says, I applied a thick layer of cream. I washed it off after the appropriate time and it looks awful. It is variegated in the etching. It looks like my 7 year old did it, whereas with previous etch creams I have used looked wonderful and sandblasted almost. This cream makes it look tacky and homemade.",2.0
"I've been using Red Heart yarn for years and it's always been nice and soft and easy to work with.  However when I chose this variegated combination to use in my current project I noticed it's very scratchy and rough feeling and also hard to work with.  It doesn't slide off the crochet hook easily.  I love the colors they make in this combination yarn but there is something about the fabric content that makes it scratchy so I won't be using it again.  I compared the content to the plain colors and it's the same so they must be doing something in the color process that makes it rough.  Come on Red Heart I know you can do better, your yarn has always been so great to work with and such a bargain to buy.  Don't mess it up now!  I'll stick with the solids.",2.0
"If this item had been available, it would have only been priced at $2.44 per skein. I needed the yarn to
Complete a project that I was working on, or I wouldn't have ordered it at the price that it was sold. I checked stores
In a 25 mile radius before I ordered online.",2.0
"This yarn is very coarse. It was not nice to work with. The colors are play, but I hated crocheting with this.",2.0
Working with this yarn on plastic canvas is not recommended as it broke apart to easily and shredded apart to easy,2.0
It really took a long time to get here. Found what we needed at a local store to complete the project.,2.0
Only good for real small projects! Need real thick amount.,2.0
"I triple checked the numbers before I ordered, and they didn't match what I had.  I made due, but was unhappy.",2.0
The painted desert yarn  is very thin and texture is rough i have used red heart many years and haven't had this problem,2.0
"The item came quickly and was as promised, but the cream barely made an etch in the glass, you have to tilt the item to see it even though I left it on for double the recommended time (10 min).",2.0
Too expensive for the little bottle.,2.0
"Did not etch the glass, just slightly clouded it.  Left it on, per instructions; tried it longer, still no major etching.",2.0
The pumpkin color is more tangerine then what is shown in the preview.  Would be nice if they had a more true to color picture.,2.0
"I have used a LOT of RED HEART yarn over the years but never have I used anything this stiff and unyielding. I bought this because I thought it was pretty. I knew I wanted to use it, but wasn't quite sure what I wanted to make. I ended up using it to crochet 5 squares of a 25 square blanket. This was the most difficult yarn I've ever worked with. On the bright side, my blanket is beautiful...",2.0
Did not remove coating on eyeglasses as shown on YouTube,2.0
Did not work to remove coating on my lenses. It just laughed at this stuff.  No effect whatsoever. Did not try it to etch glass.,2.0
I purchased this product to use for a purpose it is not intended - to dissolve  the anti-reflective coating off my eye glasses.  It didn't work.  It did soften the plastic lenses to the point that simply cleaning with a soft cloth scratched the surface.  Buyer beware.  Use as intended - to etch glass.,2.0
"The price for this product was much more than I would have paid in the store, but I needed it and could not find in any stores.  The color was slightly different although they were both light gray.  I will definitely make sure that I have enough of the necessary color before I start another project.",2.0
The final product was very scratchy.  The yarn had several tie-on knots.  Two of them were only a few yards apart.,2.0
Color is a Bright Pumpkin Orange NOT golden yellow as shown. The color recieved is a nice orange for pumpkins and pumpkin hats so I did not return.,2.0
"If its a kitchen drinking glass, works just fine.  Trying to fog up an outdoor light, or any other type of light, forget it.  Just not powerful enough.",2.0
not dark enough etch used it by the suggestions an the etch was see through. I would not recommend this for etching,2.0
I got it as it was recommended for cleaning plastic.  It worked a little but nothing like I thought it would.,2.0
I only rated this 2 stars for the price. I just bought the same yarn. Same weight and length at Walmart for 2.77. That's half of the price they have it on here.,2.0
"Just plain didn't work on my poly carbonate lenses.  Not sure why, but it just didn't have any effect at all.",2.0
Right color but not good to use when making stocking caps as product does not give. It also takes quite a bit more as this yarn is very thin!!!!!,2.0
"Me and my insurance company paid about $1000 for these variable focus glasses with titanium frames and anti-glare coating about two years ago. A few months ago I noticed something that looked likes scratches or smudges on both lenses that blocked my view while reading. I cleaned them and tried to ignore them but finally brought them back to Physicians Eye Care where I bought them and they told me that the anti-glare coating was to blame and there was nothing they could do because it was over a year since I bought them. I tried to ignore it some more but finally I was fed up and decided to see if I could remove the coating. That was when I discovered this product online and read some promising reviews about successful restorations. I tried it first on one side of the lenses for 5 minutes, rinsed it and washed it and it left some marks from the Q-tip so I figured I just was too timid with it so I applied it to both sides and let it sit for 30 minutes then rinsed and cleaned them. Still had the original smudges and a few of the Q-tip marks so I tried it again for two minutes on both sides rubbing it with rubber gloves. Now they are all scratched and foggy so I guess I loose. I don't blame the product which clearly warned against this, but if some optician tries to sell you anti-glare option get them to back it up with a warrantee that lasts as long as the glasses are supposed to. This coating ruined these expensive glasses and the optician was no help at all. Beware that trying this product may make it worse.",2.0
"I got this product to try to repair tiny scratches on my plastic lenses of my glasses. I have a scratch resistant coating and invisible bifocals with an internal sun sensitive darkening. These glasses are about four years old. I applied the product, waited five minutes, rinsed with hot water and gently removed the haze. I repeated the process. Folks, the scratches are still there. The product arrived in a timely fashion, it just doesn't seem to work for me.",2.0
"I was a skeptic about Armour etch being able to remove scratches from glasses, and for good reason. I didn't work for me at all, in fact it might have made my sunglasses worse.",2.0
"The design is cute, but this kit is marred by a skimpy allotment of embroidery floss and the absence of a diagram to complement the sometimes fuzzy design printed on the canvas.  This makes it somewhat difficult to match floss colors to the canvas-- for example, it's easy to mix up the three different shades of green.  Overall, I much prefer the Janlynn needlepoint kits, which all come with good diagrams and a much more generous allotment of floss, allowing one to create a plusher piece.",2.0
"I have done a number of Dimensions stamped needlepoint kits.  This one is by far the worst I have done.  The colors of the stamping are so close that even in direct sunlight I couldn't make out the color difference enough to do the stitching.  I ended up having to use the printed instructions like a counted cross stitch (with the help of the picture from the front of the package).  Additionally, the entire kit was cotton floss, unlike some of the other kits I have done, where nicer wool yarn was provided.  Finally, there was not enough of the background color to complete the piece.  I ended up having to use yarn from an earlier kit.  Not a good beginner kit.",2.0
not thrilled with this canvas The colors are hard to differentiate and clear  bead instructions are lacking.,2.0
"This is a beautiful little needlepoint with glittery wings.  I have to give a low score because there wasn't enough yarn in two of the colors. I contacted the manufacturer to get more yarn which I never received.  Originally, I purchased three different 5X5 kits and and all three of them were short on yarn.  In the end, I mixed and matched yarn from the other kits and was able to finish them all, but wish I could have completed them correctly!",2.0
"The Moon Dreamer kit was disappointing.  The stock photo is color enhanced, the finished piece looks duller in real life.  The threads are mostly yarns instead of embroidery floss.  Not to mention that the stamped canvas is difficult to interpret.  It would be nice if these also included a counted stitch diagram for those of us who like to be more precise.  I was going to stitch this for a gift, but in the end I threw it away because even I didn't like how it turned out.",2.0
I have only been using this for a few weeks and the wheels are so loud and coming apart. I use it for school stuff because I'm a nurse and in graduate school. Don't take it through any parking lots or your wheels will be torn to shreds and people will be able to hear you coming from all the way down the hallway.,2.0
"Ummmm
I just received the kit everything was there except directions on how to do the work in English! I have never done needle point, an there is no stitch chart, or directions of how many threads to thread through the needle and what stitch to use where were not included! I am so bummed. I can't do the project without knowing what I'm supposed to be doing",2.0
Too Small !!!!,2.0
"Cute piece. Did not come with needle. Bought to do on a long cross country trip, but without the needle it was useless.",2.0
"I was looking forward to learning needle point, but ended up very disappointed in this kit!! The instructions are imposable to understand!",2.0
"There are two types of white (one should have been silver or something like).  Instead of being able to match canvas to thread, you must match canvas to key and key to thread.  Dark grey is used to indicate green for example, rather than using green to indicate green.  The light and medium greens, on the canvas, are one shade apart.

Not one of their better kits.",2.0
"The picture is misleading -- change that to WAS misleading.. The picture on my order page is of the square set, but the picture on the product page is still the rectangular set.  I searched specifically for the 4 x 8"" ruler.  When this set came up in the search results, I ordered it based on the picture, without carefully reading the description.  Big mistake.  I ordered this on Wednesday, My order arrived today and now the picture and description are both changed to squares on my order page.  Of course, I already had the rulers in this set, but it would probably cost as much to return it as to just keep it.,",2.0
as expected.,2.0
Bought this to make a quilt with as I thought it be nice and warm but it is sooooo difficult to work with.  Very thick but way tooo stiff and heavy.  Very hard to bend and control while trying to quilt it.  Took ALL day to quilt a 4 x 5 quilt.  Even after washing its still quite stiff.  I bought 4 of the 1 yard pieces and Im going to return 2 of the ones that I won't be using for my next quilt,2.0
"There was a strong and unpleasant odor in this batting. I washed it and hung it to dry overnight and got rid of most of the smell. However, there is still a faint scent of it in the finished quilt that I hope comes out with washing. I have since purchased another brand and it does not have the odor.",2.0
it is not the one I want and I hate that there is no specific explanation on it,2.0
"So, at the time I couldn't find the crib size version, I did get the twin.  Nevertheless.  I made a quilt for my newborn.  I didn't want high loft, as I didn't want him to get too warm.  I also use their crib sized blankets to swaddle my babies in, just what our family does.  Anyways.  This stuff is thin!  It was easy to free motion quilt.  But, it is so thin after 4-5 washings.  I think taking scrap yardage and using it as the batting would be thicker!  Best way I could describe the thickness.  Take 3 cotton/jersey fabric layers put them together.  That will be how thick your quilt will be.  Awesome stuff if you are making like a baby doll quilt, or if you like to layer and layer and layer your bed.  I do not, like layering beds.  Sheet/quilt or blanket done.

I hope that helps.  It could be worse.  It isn't warm for me though.",2.0
"It is not exactly the same as the picture, and it is almost big for a pencil case. All in all i found it very different from its picture. it is soft, and it does not stand in a stylish and solid form . The Kipling brand sewed on it is red while the pictures shows it black.",2.0
"I bought one of the smaller ones to try the product. It has a ridiculously short burn time and almost no beeswax scent. The light honey scent is one of the reasons I buy real beeswax candles so that is a major failure of this candle for me.

It also was really hard to light. The wick was loose and burned down under the wax level quite quickly. It took a bunch of times melting down the candle before the wick would finally stay lit. I haven't had this experience before.",2.0
"Given the price, I justified ordering this product because of the long burn time it was supposed to have.  Both pillars that I ordered were done in 6 hours.  I burned them 4 hours the first day (I trimmed the wick as directed on the candle) and they lasted an additional 2 hours the next day when I lit them again.  For twenty bucks for two, I expected a little bit more I suppose.  I'll keep looking.",2.0
I can not get them to light and stay lit. I ove beeswax candles and was very disappointed. I am too busy to return and I will melt them down to make other candles.,2.0
"Measurements misstated in item description. The 2 inch x 3 inch candle is actually 1.75 inch x 2.75 inch. I already knew I was paying a steep price for a 2 x 3 inch candle, but the price I paid is truly a rip-off for a candle even smaller. I regularly buy 100% beeswax candles locally, at stores and farmers' markets, as well as online, for much better prices and similar quality. Would not recommend these candles at this price.",2.0
"I really did not feel that the burn time was long enough. I had similar candles that burned a lot longer. Also, so much smoke came from the flame eventhough I constantly cut the wick as suggested in the manual. All in all, not too happy with it.",2.0
"The ShapeXpress cutting tool is easy to use, and very easy to change the blade, but don't cut well... I don't know if this is 'cause I'm left handed, but the blade turns everytime, can't complete any shape without spoil at the end... If you want good shapes, I better recomend a paper trimmer/guillotine, and a corner paper punch, or shape paper punches.
The cutting mat that came in the set is very good.",2.0
The stencils themselves are great but the cutter is horrible. Unless the blade is perfectly aligned to the stencil it doesn't work or it destroys the paper. The instructions are useless.,2.0
bad cuts.,2.0
"I recently ordered the beginner kit from amazon that came with a mat and 4 templates along with cutter and 2 extra blades, also purchased another set of templates. My Mom and I both tried repeatedly last night to cut something, ANYthing, with this tool using the various templates. Not one shape could we get without ragged, uneven torn edges.  :(  Cutting freehand is no problem, it worked fine. However, I would love to be able to use the templates - the reason for purchasing. Today I tried again and the first blade fell off (the metal cutting tip) so I put the other new one in and not one difference (no improvement) in cutting. So disappointed I wanted it to work.  :( We tried 2 weights of card stock, scrapbook paper and plain old computer paper. :(  I have watched several YouTube videos and can't see anything we omitted in trying to use the Xpress Cutter. If anyone has any helpful advice on getting smooth edges please share.",2.0
"I tried to like this candle, but for the price, the wick is too smokey and we can
barely smell the natural beeswax smell...won't purchase again.",2.0
"I am very disappointed with the fairly expensive pillar candle I bought.  I was expecting the beautiful fragrance I experienced years ago. This candle has no fragrance.  I know it has other attributes, but I bought for the lovely aroma.  Was it my error in looking for 100% raw beeswax?  The ones I had before were hand-dipped tapers, and we're darker, brownish.  Please educate me.",2.0
This product does not stay put at the measurement I'd like it to be. Will purchase a plastic one instead and will not buy another one of these nor recommend it.,2.0
"The calipers I got had the threads on the nut stripped so you can't tighten it to hold the calipers in a certain position. I found some locally that work, so this one is just a loss. I suppose they could still be used in some capacity.",2.0
I found it too dull to others I've used.,2.0
I have had my machine for a little over 3 years and it has had numerous problems.  It is very difficult to thread.  My bobbin casing is always catching the thread and coming out.  I have had to fix it many times.  Sometimes the machine just doesn't sew right and I have to turn it off for a while and later it is just fine???  It is a very inconsistant machine that has little to no direction from the manual on the problems I encountered.  I would spend a little extra and get a better machine.,2.0
"I bought this machine two years ago.  At the time, it was $800 (no, I didn't buy it from Amazon).
I have never been able to use the embroidery feature.  Set-up is VERY involved.  Once set up, I was unable to figure out how to download the design into the machine, so that feature is a bust.
As far as sewing, I like the one step buttonhole foot.  I DON'T like that the needle down feature has to be tapped every time you stop the machine, so that feature is a bust.
The zig-zag feature is not adjustable.  I am forced to sew with a wide zig-zag.
I use the machine for general sewing, but I really don't like it.",2.0
I bought this ready to do a lot of things with it. I haven't been able to sew one thing. You have to use it with the laptop at all times or it will complain with an annoying beep again and again. I tried to sew a light material curtain with it the needle poked at the bobbin holder and now I can never use it again. I have to get it repaired because I am unable to find a replacement part for it where I have looked. Offers a lot of options and I am sure once its repaired if ever I will eventually get to sew one thing.,2.0
"My daughter was very excited to receive this for Christmas, until she tried to change the thread that came with the machine.  It literally would not work anymore.  I tried everything.  Maybe it's defective.....but from other reviews I read, I think it's just a really bad attempt at a great idea. Too bad....she is very disappointed....",2.0
"I got this for my daughter who will be 10 in Feb. She has wanted a sewing machine very badly. This one is made of cheap plastic, and no matter how many times we read the instructions and try to close the end, as soon as we remove it, it unravels. I think I'd spend more money and get something better. As my daughter says ""It's very irriating.""",2.0
"Multiple people tried to thread the needle, don't even waste your time with it. But the great thing with Amazon is it was easy to send back.",2.0
It is a mess that at the end of the stitch i have to saw it on hand otherwise it Unraveled :(,2.0
"I gave this as a gift to my Granddaughter on Christmas Eve. She was not able to tread the needle so I gave it a try. After  10 minutes I still could not thread it. My daughter in-law finally was able to. Once that was done, everything else worked fine.",2.0
"So my daughter received this sewing machine for her 6th birthday from a friend. Right out of the box it did not work. None of the stitches would ""catch"" underneath to make the chain stitch.

I spent some time fully reading the directions and adjusting the tension dial with no luck. I am a technically competent man who knows how to work a sewing machine, so not being able to get this machine to work was very frustrating. I spent way too much time assuming that this machine should just work if I got the tension right!

I decided to take the machine apart to get a better idea for how this thing was supposed to work. This is not as difficult of a task as it sounds, for I really only took the under-compartment apart. I first removed the batteries, just to make the job easier and so that I would not stitch myself accidentally. There is one screw on the bottom that is recessed that needs to be removed, and then the entire bottom can be pulled off. Without a bobbin like a regular sewing machine, I figured there had to be something underneath that was not working properly. Bingo! When this unit pushes the needle through the material, it is then supposed to engage a spring loaded hook, which pops up to grab the stitch and holds it for the next time the needle comes down creating the chain effect. My needle was not engaging the body of the spring loaded hook, thus the hook never popped up to grab the next stitch and no chain was made (the directions describe this as a missed stitch and tell you to adjust the tension). The hook assembly is attached with two screws, one acts as a pivot and the other a slide. My hook assembly was pushed all the way to one side on the slide. By loosening the two screws a turn, I rotated the hook assembly on the slide so that the screw was centered in the slot and then tightened everything down. Don't forget to put the flip out storage lid back in place before reattaching the bottom to the unit. After making these adjustment, the machine now works as it should. I think if I spent a bit more time, I could adjust the hook assembly to get the stitches a little tighter, but I am just happy to get the unit working for what was a very sad 6 year old!",2.0
"We received this as a gift, so I'm not out any money. However, what effort I put into helping my daughter set up and then sew is wasted when the chain stitch immediately unravels or pulls out of the fabric. It worked the first 3 times we sewed, and that seemed good enough, despite the unraveling. She understood to be careful with the fabric until i could anchor stitch the final thread to prevent unravelling.

Now, it doesn't work anymore. The stitches don't seem to be linking properly.

The safety is good- there's no chance of caught fingers. it's easy to use and makes a satisfying ""sewing"" sound for little ones, but for other than pretend, it's useless.",2.0
"I got this toy to work, you have to set the needle deep into the fabric to get it to hold the fabrics together. Maybe they improved it after all the complaints the past few years? The stitches it makes are pretty loose and come apart easily if you don't have the tension just right. Don't count on it to make anything too sturdy, it really is only good for a toy for a beginner who just wants the satisfaction of sewing a line or two pieces of fabric together. So far, that's all my daughter wants, so it's okay by me.",2.0
"My daughter got gift money for Christmas and when we found this she knew this was what she HAD to HAVE.  Unfortunately it was a constant problem.  She wanted to change the thread color (comes pre-threaded with white) and we found that threading it can be tricky.  There is one small area that is easily missed and can cause it to not work.  We also realized after buying it, that it does not have a bobbin, so it only provides what is called a chain stitch (I don't personally sew so am not familiar with the different types of stitch). Come to find out, this stitch is not permanent - unless you take it out of the machine and then hand sew through the stitches to keep it permanent.  This seems like a tedious extra step and many kids won't want to (let alone have the skill).  So we returned it and will be spending a few extra dollars to get one that will better serve her.  The machine quality seemed ok in terms of durability.  If you don't mind a sewing machine which makes a stitch you have to hand sew to finish, then perhaps this will be ok for you.  But it wasn't for us.  My daughter is 8 years old and is busy with school etc and wants to be able to sit and quickly sew something based on her pattern.",2.0
"I bought this for my daughter who was showing a real interest in knitting. The needles are quite big for little hands, but almost make it harder for them to manipulate. The yarn is awful. You can't pick it up with the needle without getting in between the threads.  This became source of much frustration on her and my part.  It was good enough to teach her how to cast on but that was about it. The best part of this product is the box where I could put the other needles and yarn I bought for her, but I could have purchased a nice bag or basket for the same amount.",2.0
"I was not impressed with this product for the price I paid!
This product was missing the crochet hook as well which I was not happy being that it was a Christmas gift.",2.0
I bought this for my 10 yr old grandchild who is learning to knit. The needles are horrible - very rough and unfinished. They snag the yarn. This alone is frustrating enough to discourage a child from continuing. A better set of needles would improve this greatly.,2.0
"Unless you know how to knit already the directions in here are not good enough. It says this is for ages 8 and up and I bought it for my 8 year old but it was incredibly frustrating! Not a good gift, it's only good if someone already knows how to knit or crochet already.",2.0
"I bought this for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas based on the reviews it has already received.  She has been asking me to teach her how to knit and I thought something like this under the tree would really surprise her.  It did.  It looks very attractive from the outside but it's what's on the insides that I'm disappointed with.

The wooden knitting needles were very rough and snagged the yarn when attempting to use them.  I had to take sandpaper and sand them relatively smooth.  The points at first are pencil-point sharp so I had to sand them down a bit too.  Just 8 tiny skeins of yarn, a cheap plastic sewing needle, 1 pair of very course wooden knitting needles, and a crochet hook are all you get, including some hard to follow directions.  I ended up using other knitting directions instead that were much clearer and easier to understand.

Tomorrow I'm going out and getting her a real pair of short, fat knitting needles and some more yarn.  The cardboard box is o.k. to use to carry around the small skeins and small wooden needles, but it won't hold any knitting project bigger than a child's knitted scarf.  I'd really rather have my money back to use to buy her real knitting needles and yarn.

UPDATE 1.17.12
I went to a Arts and Crafts store and bought her 2 pairs of fat knitting needles (aluminum), tons of wool yarn and some scissors for 26 dollars.  I wish I hadn't bought the Alex Yarn Craft Kit.  It could have at least included a pair of scissors to cut the yarn with.",2.0
"This stabilizer is very thin and can tear during the embroidery process, which can ruin a project. It doesn't have the stability in the hoop either, if it doesn't tear, it shifts and can get lettering off. I would not recommend this. I waited for a sale at my local craft store and bought a different brand. I like Sulky's other stabilizers, but not this one. When it says, ""Tear Easy,"" take that literally, it tears too easy.",2.0

"This is not like the Buttoneer from years back, its very hard to use! Needs better instructions, or a remake of the older model that was easy to use.",2.0
"instructions a little weak. trial and error to get it to work.
will not work when attaching buttons to heavier material, shorts, jeans.  works OK on shirts",2.0
I revived some of the refills that will not fit down into the needle and 1 BUTTONEER that one of the needles came off & bent the first time I tried to use it. It is no good on thicker material. I gave up on putting buttons on the waist line of pants to hold suspenders & am using needle & thread.,2.0
"Searched & read & tried to see pictures of construction of the refills to make sure these ""originals"" would work in our ""original"" buttoneer. They don't, but we had no way of knowing that the whole insertion mechanism of the Buttoneer had changed so much and was still being called ""original."" I'm sure there is nothing wrong with the refills, but we can';t use them in our 30+ year old Buttoneer.",2.0
Would not stamp correctly no matter what I tried. Cheaply made!,2.0
"I thought this was a wool blend yarn, I didn't realize that it was all acrylic.  All acrylic would be good for knitting blankets.  I was knitting socks and hats.  I knitted a pair of slipper socks because I didn't know how this yarn would turn out for slipper socks unless I tried it.  The yarn knitted into a really cool design, but my husband said these socks are not as warm as the wool-blend slipper socks that I made for him.  Therefore, my husband doesn't wear the acrylic slipper socks because he always reaches for his wool-blend slipper socks first.",2.0
"I love Lion Brand yarn. However, this yarn tended to be a little too fuzzy.",2.0
It's true to the photo colors but I didn't  like the texture of the yarn.,2.0
Did not like this yarn at all......colors were way off.,2.0
Its stiff & itchy.,2.0
Would have been better if the paints actually sealed after use.,2.0
"The colors are actually pretty good, opaque and pretty bright, unfortunately after I washed it off my arm after testing it left a rash. I'm not really allergic to many things but I got a rash both times I used it on myself. I had done the spot test on my arm and that was fine only when I washed it off again I got a rash again. I'm glad I didn't test it on my face first. It may have been a reaction to the soap I used to wash it off but I was too afraid to use it on the kids for the party I was supposed to work so, quality wise its nice but be careful",2.0
wasn't easy to use. I wouldn't buy it again.,2.0
Not as great as the other paints we got.,2.0
"Bought these for a family reunion activity. Be sure to add water to each little paint cubby or it will not paint well. Also, my son has eczema and this paint blistered his face. It is terrible. For the kids without skin issues it was ok but my sweet little boy is in a lot of pain.",2.0
Somewhat worked. Not great quality at all.,2.0
"The colors are great, but the paint was somewhat dried out, which made application with the provided foam applicators very challenging.  I was disappointed that the paint did not apply as smoothly as I expected and made it difficult to get even coverage of the color.  Given that this is the most highly rated (non-toxic) face paint for children on Amazon, so I'm left wondering what other brand to try next time.",2.0
Very very dry!,2.0
Not what I expected. I thought it would have more paint and be able to paint a party of kids but it's not. The individual colors weren't even filled in espically white. It's in a little plastic tray which is more 3d in the back making it look like their more plant but when we used the product we found it was just a top layer of paint made to look like alot. Very disappointed. Will not be buying product again. :(,2.0
"I bought this for my daughter's birthday party. It was easy to use, not messy, and the step by step instructions were great. Kids loved it, but it caused my nephew to break out in a rash where the paint had been. He had it on about 8 hours, which doesn't seem excessive to me. The description for the face paint doesn't  specify the length of time but does reiterate it is a safe, water based, non toxic, dermatologist tested product that uses FDA approved ingredients, so beware, it may still cause irritation.",2.0
"Ordered this for a carnival night at school.  The colors are okay. They are not near as vibrant on the face as they are in the box. The glitter is very wet so it doesn't stick well to the paint and doesn't show up well on the face. The larger brush is functional but the smaller brush is not.  The protective plastic on the paint colors is very dainty so this is a one use kit as the colors will dry out quickly.  The packaging makes it appear to have lots of colors and lots of paint but that is an illusion.  I bought another face paint kit to use as well and it is much better. I would not buy this more expensive brand in the future.
The sponges do work well and apply a nice layer of paint.",2.0
I have only used this a handful of times and all the paints have gone soft and mushy. So now when I use them they go on too think. Very disappointed as I was hoping for these to last me a while.,2.0
Colors were great and worked very well but there was very little paint actually in the kit.,2.0
The colors are not saturated enough.,2.0
"I've used Snazaroo face paint for years. This is the smallest amount of paint I have ever seen in one of their kits.
Still good paint. But the cakes of paint are so thin and so tiny I ran out before I was finished. I will buy their basic set from now on.
Hopefully that one still has decent size cakes of paint in it.",2.0
"I bought this as a joint present for myself and my daughter as she loves having her face painted and I wanted to learn more about it. The package arrived on time and we tried the tiger right away. It went on well and was easy to use with the instructions provided. The reason I gave it two stars: when we washed the paint off my daughter's face an hour later, it had stained her face. Even the next morning, after using my makeup removing face wash, her face was still orange and yellow. It took two days for her face to return to normal. The packaging was different from that shown on the product page, which makes me wonder if I received an older version of the product.",2.0
Didnt really stick to the skin very well without a heavy layer being applied. All the kids ended up looking like clowns or hookers.,2.0
"Gross, poisonous ingridients",2.0
Colors were not bold,2.0
I ordered it as it offered the most variety of colors but the quantity of paint u get us very less..they used shallow inserts into the holes and filled the inserts with paints so u don't get as much quantity,2.0
"I am so disappointed.  I have bought this paint before and it was great.  It almost seems like the package I got has been around for years, even though it looks new- the paint is not at all smooth and I have to really work to even make it look presentable.  I'm so upset as I got it for Halloween use.  Really poor quality compared to what I've bought in the past (this same exact kit).",2.0
Purchased this product before and was happy with it. But this time was disappointing to say the least. 4 out of 4 of our boxes were damaged. They were missing paint and glitter. Nothing came as shown or promised. Won't order from then again.,2.0
"paint pods came destroyed, couldn't even use yellow paint because it was in a thousand pieces.",2.0
"The item that was sent was close to the item ordered, but not exactly what I was expecting. I don't believe it is the ""ultimate party pack"". Maybe it's just different packaging? Either way though I'm missing a brush and 2 sponges from my pack. It looks as if it was opened already and my black and brown paints are missing decent chunks. Definitely not impressed with that...

With that being said, the quality of the paint seems to be very good. It went on nice and smooth and washed off fairly easily. I will use this brand again but probably won't buy again online.",2.0
Not what I expected at all. The makeup was very thick and hard to use.,2.0
"I've been using these for years. These packs are  fun and convenient as anything. BUT they get super messy quick, run out quick, and tend to be blurry for line work.

NOT worth the money if you intend on face painting for any length of time. I recommend the 18ml snazaroo pots of basic colors for your bases. Brands like Mehron or Tag for anything else.
Snazaroo is good for cheap base paints [sponging], terrible for any sharp-looking line work [lining/drawing designs].",2.0
The colors were nice but the paint is so thick and chalky the brushes that come with are useless. I had to use the sponges and my fingers. It does come right off though with some warm water and soap,2.0
"The seller had this out to me right away and it arrived on time, so no complaints there.  Great service. However, both my son and daughter used this product to paint their faces and both of them broke out with a rash on their faces. Granted, it doesn't necessarily prove that this paint caused the rash - but they have a sibling who did not use the product and did not get the same rash, so you tell me?  Had to throw it out, but it was a shame because my daughter was really excited to receive it.  As a professional body artist myself, I use and prefer Mehron's Paradise cakes, but I wasn't trying to spend that kind of money to buy individual cakes for a 5 year-old girl to play with.  Obviously, you get what you pay for, so we're a bit disappointed in the product and felt this review was necessary to share in case it is the makeup causing that skin reaction.",2.0
I found cheaper liquid face paint at Michaels that was much easier to apply.,2.0
Color pastes came in dry and out off places,2.0
"Took to a Christmas party for my daughter and when opened realized kit was missing pieces. Never opened the make up to try the quality, was frustrated due to a missing applicator. Was unable to use only 1 applicator on multiple children and didn't have time to go back out to buy the lg sponges.",2.0
"It was a cheap set, not very good for my event.",2.0
Very misleading packaging!!! They show additional colors and when you receive its short!!!,2.0
product was dried up,2.0
still not what I've been looking for. dissapointed in the quality and coverage I got from the paint,2.0
Not as much paint as I thought it would be,2.0
The paint pots are so dried out it's basically impossible to use them for the smooth application of face paint. The brushes are also super cheapy.,2.0
"Works fairly well, but my product arrived without a black paint pot.  Kind of difficult to do most of the designs without a true black.  Luckily the kids were understanding, and I was able to use brown, but the product should be complete.  It was simply missing.",2.0
"The package said 21 pieces, I had 18! It was missing 3 colors. and they did not stay in their places during shipping. I would have returned them except I didn't have time as I was using them at a weekend event and had no time to get a new order in. Very disappointing!",2.0
I didn't like the way the paint went on. I had a different brand and liked it better. The brushes provided got thrown away as they were poorly made and did not work for face painting.,2.0
"Paint was very dry and difficult to get on sponges and apply to children's faces, poor coverage. Sponges supplied  are scratchy and not usable on a child's face. I had a bag of make up sponges  so I was still able to use the kit. Can't really reseal containers as they are just covered with thin plastic film not lids of any kind. I don't know if I will be able to use kit again or if they will be completely dried out later. I placed entire pkg. in zip lock bag hope it helps. Washed off easily at the end of the night.",2.0
"These face paints seem ok, but I'm annoyed the two glitter pots are completely dried out. I got this for my daughters birthday party, so the glitter was really important for the girls. I would return it, but the party is the weekend and I don't have time to find something else. We'll just have to make do without any glitter. Not sure if this is a common problem or just my pack?? There do seem to be a few comments from other people about dried out paints, so perhaps this is a reoccurring issue? Wouldn't recommend",2.0
"Some of the paints were so hard you couldn't even add water to make them usable; they were completely dried out.  Some of the kit had sealed sparkle paints that were very useful for our face painting event.  You get what you pay for, and we actually had better luck at Wal-Mart,  it was Halloween season, so they had better flat color face paints that completed our needs.",2.0
"Though it was going to be bigger, but it was not, had to order 3 more just to meet our needs.",2.0
"At first I was a little skeptical of buying Snazaroo, I had heard some good things but also some bad things. So I read all the reviews most of them say it was great and worked well. So I decided to try it out, I'm new to face painting, so I didn't know what to expect. The product comes in the black plastic holder. The book that it came with, did show ""step-by-step"" however the pictures were small and didn't show the face well enough for someone to copy. The paint was SO small that it was hard to fit anything in the hole that carries it in. There was hardly enough paint for you to do more than 20+ full faced painting, even though the description said it could do many more. It came with a medium sized brush and a small one; the medium was in shape enough that I could do some things with, but the small brush was useless, the hairs of the brush came out onto the paint and soaked up the paint that you had to continue to put paint on it. It also came with three small sponges and one large one, except for the fact that the sponges hurt to be put on anyone's skin and didn't pick up the paint well, they were also so big (even the smaller ones) that you had to struggle to cover the sponge with paint. The paint made my skin dry out,and then break out, gave me and the other people i gave a face painting to a skin rash, and it made my skin smell funny... no matter what I used to take it off (wet-wipes, tissues, wet paper towels, wash clothes). I gave a rating of three for the ""fun of the toy"" because yes it was fun to put on, however it was NOT fun to take it off. I gave a rating of one for the toys ""educational value"" because it was educational if you want to be a professional face painter. I gave a rating of two for the ""durability"" of this toy because the brushes didn't hold up well and didn't last long (but you could easily fix that by buying better brushes). I gave this toy and overall rating of two because... Well to put it simply is to say it sucked and I was extremely dissapointed with this product. The shipping was fast and arrived in good packaging. Anyhow I will NEVER but from Snazaroo again.",2.0
"I was so excited about these face paints when I ordered them for my daughter's party. When I opened them, several of the paint colors were smashed. I was also disappointed because the colors included in the kit were different from the picture on amazon. In order to execute the photos shown in the book I would have to order MANY additional colors. There was no aqua, pink, light purple, etc as the pictures require.",2.0
I ordered one before I ordered more for several dozen for gifts. The tops were flimsy and cracking and would not hold up under pressure of paint or any sort of fixture added. There were several deep cracks that I thought I could ix with gesso but thought it wouldn't fix it.,2.0
came with base panel cracked. bought wood glue vice spending shipping cost. material is very flimsy.  stained it anyway for storing keepsakes and other knicknacks.,2.0
"Great size but the stickers are very hard to get off of the box. I wanted to stain them and in doing so, they sort of bubble.  The wood is rather cheap. You are getting what you pay for.",2.0
Arrived slightly chipped. Might be fine for people planning to paint and decorate heavily.,2.0
"This is constructed with very lightweight wood.  It results in a feel like its more of a toy than something ornate.  Could give it a pretty cool personalization since it is unfinished, but even the best varnish or stain or paint would be forgotten once the box is picked up.",2.0
"Since the description said 'laquered' I was surprised to see the box was unfinished.  Very flimsy, too.  And isn't 'laquer' spelled lacquer?",2.0
"I ordered 12 of these boxes with the intent of monogramming the top with a wood burner to gift wedding presents to our bridal party. Due to the low price, I was not expecting the quality of a $30 cigar box. Most of the boxes were OK in quality, they definitely feel cheap. 3 out of the 12 had been cracked on the bottom during assembly, and then smeared with white glue to hold the cracks together. This probably would not have been noticeable, except that there is no blue fabric in the bottom as pictured. Also, the hardware is not gold/brass, but cheap, thin pieces of steel that are not even screwed in all the way (probably in fear of more cracking). The item pictured is almost certainly finished in some aspect (at least with a clear coat) because the boxes received were not nearly as shiny and polished. I expected unfinished, but the product picture should be that of an unfinished box. Depending on your intended use, you may want to find a higher quality box. Good for basic arts and crafts that the kids can do, but not recommended for something you want to last.",2.0
I was disappointed in this yarn. The colors are definitely not as vibrant as they appear in the picture. And the yarn is not soft at all. It is my fault for not reading more clearly that it was acrylic.,2.0
"I was expecting a little heavier weight yarn. This is more like thread and not good at all for a baby blanket, as I had planned.",2.0
"After ordering this I found one much cheaper at Walmart so I returned it. I will say the return process was simple, downside was having to pay return postage, which was still cheaper than keeping it",2.0
good,2.0
Bleh,2.0
"Works fine but just save your money, go to walmart, and buy the cheap adhesive spray. They work the same and you need less than the 3M takes.",2.0
"I needed to glue the rubber nosepiece of a pair of sunglasses to the plastic posts protruding from the lens surface. Surprisingly, this product does not work. Takes too long to reach a tacky state, and the adhesive does not stick to rubber or the plastic lens of the sunglasses. Looks like I will have to use SuperGlue. The rubber nosepiece has 'memory' and keeps springing back, and the tackiness of the adhesive just will not adhere to it. Really surprising for a 3M product advertised as high strength.",2.0
"I was dissapointed with this 3M product. It has not performed as well as any other 3M adhesive I have used. I was using it to make a custom padded dash on my 49 Ford F-1 , using black nylgahide as the material. It appeared to hold at first, but after several days, it began to come loose. I have since secured the material with a product called Tacky Jack, which I highly recomend. This stuff is tough, and once secured, you can forget about it coming loose.",2.0
I got this for my car's headliner. it was messy and left a lot of stains.,2.0
Doesn't adhere to wood and carpet type material. I sprayed on wood with a carpet backed foil heat pad. I had to go back and staple it. Did not adhere.,2.0
I used this to mount a poster I had to a foam core board. It ruined the poster by making bubbles underneath that no matter how much I worked it I could not get them out. Also it's not as strong as I was expecting. Would not buy again,2.0
The tools and blades are great BUT the hinge on the case was broken still np ...BUT the case was covered in blue powder which proceeded to cover anything I touched including my face and clothing. I know I should have read the reviews but still what a mess no 5 stars for this product. Scary enough then read the warning for Californians on the package warning that it may contain substances that can cause cancer or birth defects.  Amazon you need to dump this seller just for the annoyance of scrubbing everything with bleach.  Won't bother with returning it will just go buy one in person.,2.0
Broke one blade on first use while using it.,2.0
It arrived on time and sharp. The blue box was broken on arrival.,2.0
Cheap.,2.0
"You get what you pay for. Typical very cheaply made (China?) product. The collets will either not tighten enough to hold a blade, or the slot is too small to even accept the blade all the way into it. Cannot comment on the blades themselves, though the two I've used in an X-acto handle seem to keep a fair edge, and I use a small sharpening stone to get additional life from the blades.

Maybe the blades themselves are worth the $$ but the handles are terrible.",2.0
"Very cheap set of knives, they work, but two blades came cracked in the package. You get what you pay for I'd say",2.0
"You get what you pay for with this. the blades are functional, though they are a bit flimsy. Be careful when using these knives as the blades may break off if you apply too much pressure. Also, the case seems to have a great deal of difficulty when latched shut. Often it is not able to be closed fully.",2.0
I received my items ok and just opened it today. The attachment knifes are rusted and some of the tips were broken off. Not to sure if it was a return or used items,2.0
the blades are dull and cheap. this kit is ok if you need it for small tasks but nothing more.,2.0
"I bought this kit for 3D printing and post-processing. It is true, you get what you pay for.  Each blade seems to be sharp so it is possible to cut things with this kit, however, they lack precision in just about every sense of the word. They are very cheaply made and feel that way in your hand.  The threaded grip that holds the blade often comes loose so you find you blade stuck in the the thing you are trying to trim. The magnetic strip was adhered to the lid as pictured, and stayed that way for several whole minutes after opening.  Now, every time I open the case, I must move the blade and magnetic strip to reach the knives.  For the small difference in price, I would get the name brand Xacto knives.  Overall, I would not recommend these knives.",2.0
None of the blades were very sturdy all but three of them have broken and all of the handles would slowly untwist and loosen the blade making it even more prone to break,2.0
"The case is nice and it has a magnetic strip to hold your blades, but its like a cheap flexible refrigerator magnet. It doesn't hold the blades very well. Perhaps because the blades are crappy metal and that is also why they are not very magnetic. The blades come glued to the strip, so at first you think its an amazing bond. They blades are also pretty thin. I cut for PLA plastic and the blade was chewed up pretty good. I  will probably buy some quality blades and just use these handles. and the storage case.",2.0
flimsy blades that break very easily,2.0
"I expected some issues with a cheap kit but needed blades in my budget to experiment with. Upon removal from the plastic the blades fell OUT of the box into my lap, and I was cut because they were NOT secured. Additionally the red handle doesn't fit inside the case, which is strange. The blades are flimsy. The built in chucks feel unstable.

Do expect cheapness, you get what you pay for and if you are skilled you can compensate for these blades but higher quality is safer.",2.0
"Cheap quality, asymmetrical fabricstion on the fastening system on the handles. Lots of variety in blades but again... cheap.",2.0
You get what you pay for here.  The blades are dull.  The unit as a whole is not good for any more than cutting one sheet of lightweight paper.  No good for matte or medium to heavy cutting.  Literally fell apart while i was using it.,2.0
"The box breaks easily, at least 4 of the blades have snapped, and the plastic in two of the knife holders broke so now I can only use the red one.
The blades do not stay very well in place either. I have used this set for card stock stencils and cutting vinyl. Better to just buy 2 good xacto knives.",2.0
"You get what you pay for. If you are a Serious Modeler these knives simply will never do. The case is sad. It will never latch and flexes easily. The few blades that come with are very flimsy and dull fast. The blades are stuck to a lame-ass magnetic strip. A pure waste, unless you are 8 years old and on a budget. Otherwise, X-Acto is the only way to go... including blades.",2.0
I use it quite a bit but it fell apart really quickly ! the magnet fell out along with all the blades. The red one split down the middle. Wouldnt buy it again,2.0
One knife was broken when i recieved it,2.0
"Box doesn't close. Screw on clamps look like they could strip at any moment. One blade came broken.

If I could do it all again I'd spend a little more and get something else.",2.0
"I'm disappointed because the blue case arrived broken in half, making it extremely difficult to open and close the case. I have yet to actually use the knives, but for the variety and price, it's hard to beat. I'll just deal with the case - no big deal, just disappointing.",2.0
"The quality of this product is really poor. The box made my fingers blue as soon as I took it out of the package, gross. The blades and the handles of the craft knives were also incredibly dirty.
I do not recommend this product at all...",2.0
"Broke first use :/ blades are alright though, some fit in my old exacto base.",2.0
JUNK...Cheaply Made.,2.0
Set does not cut very well - and each blade was pretty useless after about 2 passes.,2.0
Blade is thin and not sharp enough as it supposed to be.,2.0
"The knives are standard but the case is terrible. It arrived cracked in half, the blue comes off on your fingers and the magnetic strip holding the blades fell out the first time I opened it.",2.0
poorer quality than I was expecting,2.0
"I like the set of blades, but the packaging was far too cheap and the case won't do. I had to throw it out because I was getting blue paint on my hands (as if it were spray-painted on the other day). Finding a case for all of the blades is going to be tough, so I'm just keeping them in a small box and am going to try being careful with them.",2.0
Rusty,2.0
The blades I tried to use broke the first time I tried to cut something.  The case hinges slipt the second time I opened the case.  I resrted to duct tape as my hinges.,2.0
Flimsy blades.  Case doesn't stay closed.  This is a great product if you don't need to make straight precise cuts or don't mind a blade or two randomly falling out of the case.,2.0
The case is absolute terrible. A weak magnet held by splotches of degraded glue hold the extra blades. I wouldn't recommend buying this set.,2.0
"I know these didn't cost much , but these are entirely too cheaply made. Blades get loose and wobble with one pass of use, and blades become dull cutting soft plastic sheeting. Maybe I can buy other blades for it.",2.0
"Very cheap. Blades don't all fit or stay in the handle. Box doesn't close all the way, so all the blades fall out. Blades and handles don't stay put and move around inside the cheap box. I would pay a bit more and get something else of a better quality,",2.0
cheap plastic box.  hinge broke just taking out of the display card.,2.0
"Case is weak and not well made.  The tools do not hold blades securely. They do cut, but they are NOT EXACTO!",2.0
"Larger handle was already cracked, case broke before I could get it out of the packaging. The only reason I didn't send it back yet, is that this is the cheapest way to get that array of blades. Got what I paid for.",2.0
"Side-by-side with an Xacto knife the blades in this set are half the thickness.  They are so thin that when you have to apply pressure, the blades bend making it impossible to cut in a straight line.",2.0
What did i expect for paying less than $3.00?? I now use the blades on different handles.  The ones it came with are made of cheapo plastic so they didn't last.,2.0
"This hobby knife kit came with a broken plastic case, dust on the inside and a few rusted blades. However, as I only paid 3 dollars the few blades I could salvage and add to my collection made it slightly worth it. (Which is why I didn't give it a lower score.)

You get what you paid for.

It did ship fast.",2.0
Plastic case is absolute garabe. Magnet doesn't hold anything and knives are cheap feeling. No weight behind them and grip is very good. Spend a couple extra bucks and get a good set.,2.0
"Cool idea but like all knock-offs, they are cheap and not even very sharp. I would spend $12 more and get the X-acto ones sorry again SE.",2.0
"I picked up several sets identical to this one from the dollar store.  The assortment of different blades and handles included is excellent.

However:
*  Blade grips are blue plastic that don't hold the blade still, and easily break off when tightened.
*  Blades are very thin metal (they bend).
*  Also the case lid hinge is just thin plastic and so the lid may break off.

I've gone through 4 sets, breaking the plastic blade grips on each of them, and now I'm looking for handle with real metal blade grips to use with all of these blades.  (Hopefully the ""real"" exacto-brand knife still has metal blade grips...)",2.0
Well it's really hard for me to write this because this never happened before... but when i took my knife set from the package the blue case it was broken!!!,2.0
"Looked like a cute kit when I ordered it.  However, the magnet strip in the box is extremely weak causing the blades to fall off constantly.  None of the handles hold the knives securely.  Finally, all of the blades are dull.  Do not buy.",2.0
"the little case thing that these knives come in, for some reason, rubs off blue onto your skin when you handle it. not to mention that the clasp doesn't actually hold the dang thing shut. the knives are okay, feel a little cheaply made, so if you need a sturdier knife that you're not just cutting paper/ribbon/etc with, you might want to look elsewhere. the case is just...augh, awful. wish I'd sprung a little more for one with a different case, but how are we supposed to know, ya know?",2.0
"Not quality by any stretch of the word. They smell funny, the handles are made of some sort of plastic, the blades are cheap metal, and the box is garage. Once open, the box will not close. But hey, what do ya want for 5 bucks?",2.0
"You get what you pay for. The blades are good, but the handles will not hold them securely in place.",2.0
"The blades and handles are decent compared to the price. The handles feel light and maybe of a cheap metal, but using these blades shouldn't require a lot of strength or your doing it wrong.

The case was very dissappointing. Very cheap plastic, was receieved with the hinges already broke and scratch marks along the sides. As others have mentioned, the magnet strip that holds the blades in is slightly weak and not flush with the case due to the adhesive being poorly placed.

If you're looking just for a blade set and not too worried about the case and not looking for a high quality set of knives then this product could work for you.
Do not buy for the case, it isn't worth the extra money if you can get is cheaper elsewhere.",2.0
"I really wouldn't recommend this to a person serious about carving and this is coming from an am-mature. The blades don't fit into the knives properly when switched and now that I think of it, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Unless you are seriously desperate.",2.0
"I thought I ordered a decent hobby knife set for 7 bucks but what I received was the cheapest Chinese-made set I have ever seen. The blades are all a little rusty and the case doesn't even latch shut without some fiddling. The blades are sharp, but for how long? A few days after I received it, I was in a local grocery store that also has a closeout section and saw the exact set for $1.49.",2.0
"Seriously I wanted a little hobby knife exacto blade kit for relatively inexpensive. You're better off spending an extra $5 or $10 to get a more decent set. When this arrived, the box it was shipped in was undamaged, and the packaging it was in was undamaged, but the blue case was already cracked in a few places. It doesn't even stay close because the hinges are the part that was broken when it arrived. The ""magnet strip"" doesn't hold but HALF of the blades on it. The handles are cheap and EASILY strip if you over tighten the blade in it even SLIGHTLY.

I needed it for one purpose and I was able to do what I needed with it, so that's why it gets 2 stars instead of 1. But seriously, if I could go back, I'd spend a few extra bucks since I doubt I'll be able to use this for anything else ever again.",2.0
"I purchased this item as a Christmas gift/stocking stuffer for a model car/plane/boat enthusiast on my gift list. I was torn between this item and the name brand Xacto knife kit, which cost more but looked very similar. Convinced that if I bought the Xacto knife kit, I'd be most likely paying more money for the name, I opted to purchase this cheaper kit instead. Well, the quality is definitely cheap! You can tell it just by looking at it! I only paid $4.95 for the kit...it will serve the purpose...however, in my opinion, it is NOT appropriate quality for gift-giving! Classic lesson...you get what you pay for.",2.0
"I knew this would be low quality given its cost, but the box hinges were broken, the plastic is brittle, and the blades lack any strength and become burr-inflicted when shaving plastic.",2.0
"I do NOT recommend buying these knives unless you want to buy some throw-away knives for one-time use.

When I received them, they were already rusted. Yes, seriously. With only slight pressure, almost all of the blades will break immediately. The handles also don't tighten enough to actually hold the blades, and so you constantly have to re-tighten them. At risk of getting sliced with a rusty blade, I recommend you look elsewhere.

The only good thing about these knives is the price. But, you really get what you pay for.",2.0
"This set of craft knives came in a useless plastic case, and they don't seem to hold the blades very well. If you are looking for any measure of quality, don't buy these.",2.0
I needed something small and varied for some side projects. this product fit the bill for blade variations quite well. the case leaves a bit to be desired. The magnet that hold the spare blades is a little weak. Two of the blades had rust on them.,2.0
"Don't order this set from ""Hobby Tool Supply"" because they will sell you a used set and broken box. I don;t want to return because I will have to pay for shipment. I don;t expect the knives are perfect, but at least they could have sent me a new one.",2.0
"The price was nice but other than that,
WHAT A PIECE OF GARBAGE!
Where to begin...

-A few of the blades had surface rust on them.
Whatever, I'll clean them up before really using them.
-The case is horrible! The thing does not stay closed at all! That little flap you see in the picture? Absolute waste of plastic! Seriously, there is no where for it to snap or slide into. I have to tape it down so the thing stays shut. When I get a few extra minutes, I'll make a new case for them (If they even last long enough) and use re-use that magnetic strip thingy holding the used blades.(That is a nice feature to have.)
-The blades are pretty thin and flimsy. I would not recommend using these on anything with substance. I haven't used them on anything thicker than single walled cardboard so far, and even then I'm a bit worried about the blade snapping.
-The blades do not sit very firmly in the handles. I HATE THAT! I have to constantly tighten the blade down while I'm using it.

I gave it 2 stars because it is dirt cheap, which is nice for the time being.
It has 13 blades. I'll have a little extra time going through these as they break, (which I KNOW they will before I even dull them at all) before I buy a better knife.
The megnetic strip holding the not in use blades.

I now know I should of just paid a few bucks more and got an X-acto knife. That is the plan in the very near future.

The old adage proves true once again. ""You get what you pay for!""",2.0
"This one is just perplexing to me. I got the knife set today and, well, it is in pretty bad condition. The box is totally non-functional -- busted. Some of the blades are dirty and rusty. It is just weird. If I didn't know better, I'd say these are definitely used and/or repackaged.

See the picture I uploaded.

But, the blades edges themselves seem sharp enough. And for less than $5.00, I suppose it'll due.",2.0
"I am very pleased with this set it comes with exactely the same things you wood get in the exacto kit minus the wooden case . Honestly I cant really tell much of a diffrence between this set and my exacto set except I saved 20 bucks.
Now you will have to order more blades since the kit only comes with one blade in each size  , but you would have had to do that regardless and the handles do accomodate exacto blades so its really a win /win.

*****UPDATE********
OK  I gotta admit I was a bit blind when I got the set , I was so pleased by how it looked and the price that I missed the old adage you get what you pay for . The blades that come with the set are extremely thin I didn't realize just how thin till i started to use them . I am only cutting through regular foam board and corrugated cardboard to make dioramas and these blades bend with the pressure you need to apply to get through the paper leaving a diagonal cut instead of the straight cut you should get . So if your just cutting paper or neeeded some extra handles ok this is it but if your doing any kind of hobby that requires precise straight cuts these are not for you .
I don't blame the seller they gave me exactley what I paid for .",2.0
"I BOUGHT THE SAME ONE AT A DOLLAR STORE FOR $1.00. THE CASE IS CHEAP MADE, IT WONT CLOSE RIGHT AND EASY BREAK THE BLADE SOME HAD RUST BUT IM HAPPY I PAY 1.00, I ALSO GOT A SINGLE HUBBY KNIFE FROM HOMEDEPOT THAT IS BTHE STORE U CAN GET 6 GOOD BRUSH WOOD NOT THAT CHEAP PLASTIC FOR 1.00 ALL DIFFERENT SIZE IN THE SAME BAG AND STORE..",2.0
"These came up when searching for X-Acto knives. In fact, you'll find that this set mimics a nearly-identical 16pc X-Acto boxed set. So close is it, in fact, that I didn't notice this wasn't X-Acto brand. When I received the item, I was disappointed. First of all, the plastic box is of TERRIBLE quality. The latch doesn't latch and in fact fell off after about 15 seconds of trying to get it to latch. The magnet in the lid is weak enough that the blades fall off if you set the box down to roughly. The knives themselves are extremely lightweight and feel cheap. They're also not quite long enough and not quite thick enough. All of this added up to me being vaguely dissatisfied with the set until someone handed me a real X-Acto brand #1 knife. Feeling the real thing, suddenly I could articulate all the things that I didn't like about this set. This set just feels cheap and isn't very comfortable to work with.

It got worse when it came time to change blades. The readily-available store-bought blades are, of course, X-Acto brand. The blades in this kit look almost exactly, but not quite, like real X-Acto blades. The shapes are all slightly different (an in my opinion not quite as useful) but the problem comes when you try to install an X-acto brand blade into one of the handles from this kit. The blade almost, but doesn't quite, fit. This results in having to stab something (like the plastic box, therapeutic by this point) to drive the blade up into the knife. I'm sure I would have had to use pliers to extract the blade, had I not consigned this entire kit to the back of the junk drawer.

I replaced this kit with an X-acto #1 and #2 and I'm MUCH happier with them even though they each cost more than this entire kit.",2.0
"I need a magnifying glass to read the angle. The plastic is too flexible, would have preferred it to be stiffer.",2.0
"This things works, but from the picture you can not tell that it is actually made from very thin plastic so that it flops around.  It should be better quality or less expensive.",2.0
Very cheap materials and low quality. Needs to be of thicker plastic. Very floppy.,2.0
"I read the reviews on this and thought ""OK it's a little flimsy"" but wow, the arms are about as thick as 4 sheets of regular paper. The protractor arms droop under their own weight. This protractor seems practical only for use on a desk and given the exceedingly light construction, hardly worth more than a couple of dollars.",2.0
"I love Tombow glues but this is the first time I used the aqua.  I added some cheap wiggle eyes to some Christmas projects which popped off!  Had to reapply with my Tombow Mono glue. Don't know how if it was because of the slickness of the eyes with the Aqua, but am a little leary about using it in the future for these type of items.",2.0
"The only problem I have with this product is color.  On the product details they show 3 different colors (I think it was yellow, green, and blue), but don't give you a choice - which was fine.  However, when I received the product the scissors were pink.  I have an 8yr old BOY.  I am not going to send him to school with pink scissors.",2.0
I feel a little deceived. I thought this was for 4 pair. I only got one.,2.0
Not too comfortable for my left handed 5 year old. She would rather use regular scissors than these.,2.0
Bought 2 pairs for my lefty daughters as stocking stuffers and they came in blue and yellow - not pink as shown :( kids are particular about color and I would have appreciated that consideration in ordering,2.0
Ordered these scissors for my son.  We received PINK ones and he's not happy about it.  It would have been nice to choose a color.  I thought I was ordering the red and blue ones.,2.0
"I guess this product is OK if you don't mind spending money and don't want to take a few minutes time to make your own templates.

Cutting crown isn't difficult with a crown jig like the one Bench Dog makes, but it's still easy to make a wrong cut because you're cutting ""upside down and backwards"". Templates definitely help prevent mistakes. I made my own templates out of scrap the first time I did crown molding.",2.0
"I WAS NOT EXACTLY PLEASED. I ASSUMED THAT EVERYTHING SHOWN IN THE PICTURES CAME WITH THE TEMPLATES. SHAME ON ME. THERE IS NO ANGLE FINDING TOOL, OR BOOKLET / ANGLE REFERENCE TABLE. THE INSTRUCTIONS EVEN REFERENCE THE BOOKLET SHOWN BUT NOT INCLUDED AND NOT STATED. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND FIND A GOOD ANGLE FINDING TOOL WITH A GOOD ANGLE TABLE REFERENCE. I WILL REMOVE MY POOR REVIEW WHEN THE SELLER REMOVES OR MAKES IT PLAIN TO SEE THAT NOT ALL PRODUCTS SHOWN ARE INCLUDED WITH PURCHASE.",2.0
"I was disappointed in this product.  I purchased the kit to repair a tear in my beloved leather couch.  The sub-patch and leather patch were barely large enough for my repair.  Would it have been that difficult to make them a decent size?  The special leather adhesive was dried out and unusable - I used wood glue.  7 of the 9 leather filler colors were also old and almost solid. Fortunately, I was able to use brown on my couch, but had no way to color match.  I rated 2 stars since I was able to make the repair, but clearly this kit had been sitting on the shelf for many years.",2.0
the package i received appeared yellowed and old; like it has been sitting on a shelf for some time.  it also provides only what appears to be the barest amount of materials to utilize.  no real margin for error. i haven't yet had opportunity to actually try fixing my problem.  but the quality of the kit is rather poor.,2.0
"Seems too ""all purpose use"" to me. Was OK but really not invisible to see the mend in terms of surface texture.",2.0
Patch peeled off in a few weeks,2.0
Ok,2.0
I need a bigger leather repair kit.,2.0
"You get what you pay for....This product is mediocre at best, for what I needed.  Basically had some cat scratches on the arms of a bicast leather couch.  SMALL amount of color compound to work with, and the shade that I ended up with was slightly off....yeah,it covered the scratches - but the process actually made the rest of the couch worse off than when it started.  I am now trying the more expensive products from leather touchup dye.com.",2.0
Didn't really help repair our leather couch. It really just made it worse.,2.0
Would be nice to have measurement guides so you could recreate the identical formula.,2.0
not good,2.0
Not as good,2.0
This kit was rubbish,2.0
"It's marginal.  If you follow the directions carefully and it's a minor fix, you will probably be OK.  But most of the time someone will want to repair a more extensively damaged article.  And it doesn't handle big rips very well.

In my own case, it was a torn leather jacket.  I followed the instructions and wound up with a fix that was functional but looked cheesy and rough.  Part of the problem is, it's nearly impossible to get the color matched seal to look good if the repair is large.

Plus, the fix is kind of flimsy.  After a couple weeks it started to fall apart.

I came away wishing I had just done a patch.",2.0
Too many steps,2.0
"It does what it says, but does not really furnish enough to fix more than one or two cracks. Would not order again",2.0
"Didn't help fix the cracking on my car seat, just made a bigger mess.",2.0
It does not have the composite. Most of the secondary colors were dried and left with very small usable quantity. This may be suitable for leather jackets but definitely not for sofas.,2.0
"I couldn't get the color to match after half a day. Since it dries differently than when wet which is understandable, it makes it even more difficult. And the repair keeps peeling",2.0
hard to use. Color match was impossible.,2.0
lasted about one month.,2.0
"I might have scored this product higher, but some of the patch materials were dried out - a condition the instuctions warn will cause failrue of the repair.  The package appeared to be sealed and tight, but the cheap plastic poys containing the colored patch material had loose-fitting lids that allowed the contents to dry. This is indeed what we have experienced - peeling of the surface.  I can't recommend this product.",2.0
This product did not work for me. First of all the glue did not stick no matter how hard I tried. I tried putting more glue but in the end I just gave up.  I would not recommend this product. My sofa still has the tear that looks so horrible and I am at a loss as to what to do to repair it.,2.0
"It looked good at first, but now after several weeks it is starting to peel up.  I don't know if it is 'operator error' or the product.",2.0
It worked good for about a month then the patch  dried/broke and the hole is back. I don't recommend buying this to use on something that gets a lot of wear and tear like a sofa or a chair like I did.,2.0
Product is too hard to use and kept rubbing off.  Color matching was impossible for me and the product did not dry well.,2.0
"didnt like it at all. just used it once on my leather couch. after using it, the leather got harder and started ripping more. I will never recommend this product.",2.0
"Better than nothing, but not much! Had about an inch and a half tear in a leather chair head rest.. Followed the instructions and it turned out very visible and more like a rubbery patch than soft leather. I think it will keep the tear from getting bigger but it looks terrible.",2.0
"I had about a 1 inch rip in the shape of a ""T"" in my leather sectional.  I got a bid of $150 to get fixed professionally, and just thought I could save some money and do it myself.

Some hints:
-Put it on in several thin coats
- I was able to get a pretty close match in color (as the directions state make it a wee bit lighter because it gets darker when it dries- don't sweat this though, if you don't have the color right, you can get it right with your second coat.)
-Be careful with the sand paper- this is really what made a smallish area into a bigger repair then it needed to be.  Directions state to sand around the area- this removes the color of the leather requiring you to creep out further then you would like to.

The rip is sealed now, and I have no doubt that it is sealed for good.  I can still see the line of the rip through the repair and kind of a clumpy hard rubbery patch sitting on top of it now.  I really am a glass half full kind of gal, but hindsight leaves me wishing that I had spent the $150 on a professional repair.  It is what it is.",2.0
Wish I could say that this product was great but when I opened the paint colors they were all rubbery and would not mix or spread easily!,2.0
"The past reviewer was correct, if you have a large rip, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT, unless you want everybody to know where the rip is as it show up even worse.
Would not recommend this product at all.",2.0
"I bought this product to try to fix and conceal several small holes in my car's leather seating. It really did a pretty poor job. The holes are still pretty noticable. I was able to get a good color match. I also tried the product on some minor scratches on a leather chair. That application worked much better. Overall, the product is probably better suited for scratches than holes or rips. And make sure to go light on your colors, because you don't have much white to play around with to lighten your mixture up. You will also need many more alcohol wipes than are provided in the kit.",2.0
"I guess I didn't realize it was just one pair of scissors. I bought them to help a student who'd been forced to switch to right hand in PreK. (a boy) and we were sent pink. sigh. Thankfully, he doesn't care but a color option would have been nice.",2.0
It is a single pair of scissors. Just one. Do not let the picture fool you.,2.0
"I bought two of these for my two lefty kids. One broke after just a few days. Same place as pictures from other reviewers. The plastic that holds the screw broke. There should really be a metal nut to accept the screw, this is a compromising design flaw.",2.0
"I didn't receive left-handed scissors; I got two pairs of ""ambidextrous"" scissors, with the blades in the usual right-handed configuration. Disappointing.",2.0
I recently purchased this product for my son and we tried using it last night to cut up printer paper for his science project.  The product was challenging to use as it is dull and required us to stop and reposition it after each use.,2.0
"Eh, it was smaller that I expected and according to my son, not very comfy.",2.0
"Ordered 2, get 2 pink, not sure what is color may vary means, rather just say you have pink one only!",2.0
"First, I will say my 3-year-old lefty loved these scissors. They fit her hand well, and they cut well. Then -- still on the first day of ownership -- her 4-year-old sister, a righty, grabbed them to try. The scissors snapped in two, unfixable pieces. Apparently, these scissors are only for lefties, or my 4-year-old daughter has unusual strengths. Either way, there are better options out there for a buck or two more. I would recommend these only if you have an only child who is a lefty and will be very, very gentle with them.",2.0
My two left-handed children find these difficult to use.  They get frustrated with them.  They prefer the regular left/right scissors that we own.,2.0
These are awkward and difficult to use compared with the friskas of same description - others are very worth the few extra dollars.,2.0
They were dropped twice and broke (what toddler doesn't drop scissors a time or two or ten?). Luckily my husband was able to fit a new screw into the area and it is holding up far better than that from the factory.,2.0
"These scissors literally fell apart within a week of receipt.  They were not very expensive, so it wasn't too big of a deal, but i would not order them again.",2.0
Very unbalanced. Falls over for anything. Bought it for an expo I was attending to showcase a lithograph (attached to foamcore) and it fell over. Tried a small book to see if my drawing may need weight to keep it up while on display...fell over. Had to rig it with tape and cardboard at the bottom just to get it to stay open. Don't waste your money.,2.0
Perhaps it's because it is so light weight but it seems to close or tip depending on the product it is holding.,2.0
kinda cheap,2.0
Quality is fine.  Other sites that sell plate stands list a 7-inch plate stand as sized to hold a 7-inch plate.  That is not the case for this item.  The 7-inch measurement is the spread between the two pegs.,2.0
"I'm having trouble with the ""studder "" and stopping of the tool while trying to work with it. I've changed pressures, made sure it was lubricated correctly and it still ""hangs up"". At this point I'm not happy and don't dare use it on something of value like my guns.",2.0
"I was hoping these were as good as their regular scissors, but they weren't.  They keep getting stuck open when I used them. I gave up and changed to the craft 2 inch circles.",2.0
"i tried using these for a class project, but they wouldn't cut through the tyvek. so i tried them on the tissue paper i was adhering to said tyvek, but that didnt'work well either, sometimes tearing the tissue paper instead of leaving the nice, scalloped edge i had desired.",2.0
"Three pairs wouldn't function correctly at all. They continue to jam (two pair won't open, the third won't close). I would NOT buy these again and would spend a couple of extra dollars for a better set.",2.0
Disappointed with these. Should be much better quality with the Fiskars brand name. Too small for a adults hand. first section of the blade is so dull it does not even cut paper.,2.0
"The cut shapes were good, unfortunately they kept getting caught on the paper and you'd have to work to release it!",2.0
There were kinda expensive. I was expecting a great deal better. They all look just about alike. Really no better than the pair I bought for one dollar.,2.0
"Cute designs, but I put too much confidence in the Fiskars name.  These scissors are all quite dull and don't easily cut paper.",2.0
Not as expected. Very difficult to cut thru the paper bags. Too late for me to return.,2.0
A little flimsy. Don't cut all the way through cleanly sometimes.,2.0
This review is for the Fiskars Scallop Paper Edger Scissors.  These scissors are very difficult to use.  They constantly get jammed open.  They work better if you only use the tip of the scissors but one should be able to use the full length of the scalloped blade.  I don't understand why these have such great reviews.  Maybe the other types besides scallop works better.,2.0
"Pretty flimsy, & not very sharp. Thought they might work on tissue paper - not a chance !!!",2.0
I bought these to use with crepe and tissue paper. These shewed and messes up the paper. These are good to cut regular paper or cardboard. I even try putting the crepe and regular paper together to see if It will cut trough with no luck.,2.0
i got these for my 6yo to cut paper with.  but the shapes they cut are too small to really see.  not impressed.  they seem like good quality,2.0
"I have several rotary cutters.  And I love my little 28mm cutter for trimming because its small and compact....and I HATE these blades.  They are NOT nearly as sharp, nor do they last as long as other comparable blades.  I have to change them twice as often as others and they aren't worth the savings.",2.0
"It  is not emerald green , it is a grass green",2.0
"As another reviewer wrote in their review of the Chestnut Tweed color, the Moss Heather product is not as pictured.

The brush part keep falling off. Wasn't glued together well. Super cheap,2.0
"Great variety, but lacking a bit in quality. Most of them broke after just a few uses.",2.0

Not really worth it. I needed brushes to finish stenciling a room in my house. These just didn't cut it. Had to buy different brushes after all.,2.0
"Sadly this is closer to an Islamic prayer cap than a beanie.  To be fair, I have a fairly large head but beanie doesn't stretch much.  My wife ended up wearing it since she has a smaller head.  TL;DR:  Don't order this if you have a big head unless you are Muslim.",2.0

Doesn't adhere to most surfaces well - it sits on top of the paint... months later it still would rub off! Only good on matte finishes... and its awkward to apply. It is literally an expensive stamp pad... OK.,2.0

Pens have a nice quality ink but have had a lot of issues with ink not flowing consistently and being splotchy. You have to shake it again then scribble on something to get it flowing again.  Ive wasted a lot of ink.  Will be trying other brands.,2.0

This stuff is super bleedy. You can be super careful and ink just spills all over whatever your using it on. Not ever using these again.,2.0
The ink comes out in a very irregular way :/,2.0
Gold marker cap is suck on and won't come off but silver works well. Although it did sort of splatter and ruin (or add character if you're being nice) my wedding signature book.,2.0
Don't shake it even though it has a ball bearing. Just press down for ink flow. Not as fine as I would have liked.,2.0
"Worked nicely until the tip dried out after not using for a couple months - after that, despite tons of paint in the pen, every attempt to rehydrate, even holding the tip down so that the paint pooled onto a scape page and soaking it in that, did jack and squat.",2.0
"tough to keep the ink flowing and then after you push down a bunch of times to get ink flowing, it blots and spills out. customer service good though.",2.0
had one dud - tip was broken for some reason on brand new package of these pens.,2.0
"What  a mess. This thing splattered all over, and it's like a stain - on my hands and my table. Not good.",2.0
"The metallic paints are vivid and produce a dazzling effect - all over your hands, clothing, etc., as well as where you intended them to go! No thanks.",2.0
"Had good hopes for this. But, metallic markers are very hard to find. Bright and sparkly seem to be promised, but are not delivered. Gold turns either watery brown or is dull to the point of looking tan when it dries. Silver is just dull grey.",2.0
"The price is lower than golden leaf pen, so want to try it on my project.
But the sresult is not good enough to me. too much gey it is.",2.0
"At first I was amazed by the silver marker: you can get a very smooth and clear line without much effort, and the distribution of metallic pigment is even. The golden one was a catastrophe: on the third shake after it stopped writing yet again, and I was trying to make it as shiny as the silver one, lots of ink came out all over the place, also on fabric. You cannot get it out with neither water nor alcohol even immediately after s spill.",2.0
"i hardly used it and ink is already running out....but lovely color
Shaking it helps, but still not good enough",2.0
I don't know if i got a lemon but the gold marker started leaking the first day and the silver stopped working the second day,2.0
"Small. Paints are too liquid (compared to similar products purchased before) and they cannot cover the numbers or the lines underneath even after 5-6 applications, esp. the lighter colors - one needs to make a spot to cover the number and then it doesn't look natural, maybe because the paint is absorbed in the board. The kid has to paint over and over again over the numbers and is getting frustrated... No separate chart included in case stops and needs to go back to check the numbers.
Purchased a number of diy pictures from Paint works in one order but this 1st is a big disappointment. Hope the rest are better.",2.0
Bought this as a gift and it could easily be something one would find at the Dollar Store for a buck.  You have to mix the paint....Not impressed.,2.0
This set of art is very hard to see and follow. Following the coloring is very hard. Its also not easy to see. I would not purchase this again.,2.0
One of things I don't like about this Pencil by Number Flower and Pets Variety Pack is that  the drawing was too light for me to make out enough to color. I could hardly see what was printed on there. It wasn't worth the money I paid for it.,2.0
"The PencilWorks flowers and pets color by number is difficult to do.  All pictures/canvases are beautiful.  However, there is no numbers on the canvas itself.  The numbers your supposed to use are on the directions making it difficult to find the flower or item you are coloring and what color to color it. Both me and my 9 year old were very frustrated with this one because the pictures are so beautiful, but in order to make them as you see on the box will be close to impossible. If you don't mind trying to figure out from the directions what color goes where then I would purchase this because it's an empty canvas with no numbers.",2.0
Pretty pictures. So hard to read the numbers need to make the picture bigger. Not for young children . Better for 13 and up.,2.0
"Non-stick, my eye. They arrived greasy and gummy, despite the tamper proof packing.  They were also difficult to open and close and had a dull, tight feel between the blades. Fiskars is not what it once was. I returned them and bought a couple of orange handle 8"" Primary scissors through Amazon at a fraction of the price.  Primary scissors are very good and resemble a pair that I bought many years ago at the 99 Cent shop.",2.0
paper is great but the end came crushed so it won't fit in the holder...,2.0
Flexible curves did not do the job I was after. The curve result is also not smooth. Sort of too stiff and not accurate enough.,2.0
"I could NOT figure out how to use this damn thing, so I cut and messed up precious flooring Material as a result. DAMMN IT !!",2.0
Needs more Precision cut,2.0
This tool is awesome if its good quality.  The one I received has an uneven blade. I can use it for some cuts where the blade meets the base.,2.0
I purhased these paints in the hope of painting my ship models. They were very watery and not thick at all. This means I would have to apply multiple coats of paint---which was cumbersome and tedious. Why did they make these so watery? I rank it a 2 overall because of the cheapness in the paint colors.,2.0
I didn't like the colors.  they weren't true to the color they were supposed to be,2.0
Thin and very runny. Melts testers white under coat. Not a good product.,2.0
"Wow opened the box and there was only 6 colors and no brush. The brush doesn't bother me but missing a color does. I hope this was just a manufacturing mistake when packaging. At least it was pink that i didn't get and not the other colors, so not all a bad day though I paid for 7 colors..",2.0
I was looking for a glow in the dark paint for sights on a handgun. Followed all the instructions. Went on ok. Put it n front of a Sunlamp for over 8 hours before testing to see if I could see the dots in the dark....absolutely useless. Can't see even when I put my hand over the sights in a pitch black room. Probably a great product if you simply want the look of fluorescent paint on something. Otherwise a useless/ waste of money and time to apply.,2.0
very watery :(,2.0
Extremely thin with little pigment in it.  Requires multiple coats for even the most basic application.  Very disappointing.,2.0
Thin runny paint. Bought for painting lower and was terrible. Also didn't come with a red as the picture shows. But came with two oranges instead.,2.0
Paint is Flouresent in color but DOES NOT GLOW IN THE DARK. IS WHAT i WAS LOOKING FOR,2.0
"This paint wasn't as thick covering as I was hoping for.  Even when you shake the paint well, it will take several coats to cover a surface.",2.0
"I bought this for use on front sights that have been damaged.  I chose a variety pack so I could pick the right color for the project.  They are way too thin.  I found multiple coats were OK on something like a Smith & Wesson blade front sight, but 5 or 6 coats were required before an acceptable opacity was reached.  This wasn't the case on Walther P38/P1 sights at all.  Walther 3 dot sights just couldn't be made right with these, the paint just isn't bright enough (it looks too watery).

I'm sure the stuff is fine for the manufacturer's intended purpose, but it isn't for gun sights.",2.0
Disappointed the wheel(s) didn't work for perforating 1 sheet of  copy paper enough to allow use of Pounce powder to make a quilting stencil - the holes were not big enough to allow the powder through very well. The tool itself is comfortable and easy to use - probably has other purposes for which it would work better.,2.0
"It's very tiny. I was expecting the spikes to be the 7/16 inch long, and not the entire wheel. The photo was too small to get a better idea.  I will be looking for a more exaggerated, spike-ier pounce wheel.",2.0
"While the knife looks fine, I ordered this because of the 5 extra blades advertised. They did not come with the package. The knife was also gray not red.",2.0
"It is not a 5 in, it is a regular 4 in end nipper. I know because I already had a 4 in.",2.0
Disappointed!  Package was not sealed properly and 3 of the 5 glue tips were missing.  Otherwise it was ok.,2.0
"Box was open, all the glue tips are missing, and the smallest paint brush's bristles seem so poorly cut that it can't be used for anything close to detail work. Drop cloth is probably the nicest thing in the package which isn't saying very much. Overall would not recommend. Buy a separate hobby knife and brushes.",2.0
The package was open and torn.,2.0
Brushes to small and bristles get really hard when paint is added - hard to work with.,2.0
Be it the way it was packaged or the shipment of these items. The brush tips were bent over and therefore they were not useable. So in short here the entire order of the model the supplies were of a great disappointment to me. I will never order from on line again. Very unhappy,2.0
"I make scratch built structures. Many times I find the need to do a cut at an angle that isn't 30, 45, 90 or 60 degrees. So when I read the reviews about the Precision Cutting tool, I was enthused  to find a precision cutting tool with so many angles to use. However when I received the cutter, I was very disappointed. The blade holder was an unimpressive cheap plastic. The part of the design that dissatisfied me the most was the angle indicator. It was a poorly applied decal that had a wrinkle across its middle -  a complete lack of quality control. I expect a lot more from a  manufacturer that calls their product ""Precision.""  I can't recommend this product.",2.0
"This product was listed under ""World Kitchen"". It is apparently not a kitchen product. The warning on the cutting board warns against using it for food. I did not see this mentioned in the product information. Disappointed. Gave it to Goodwill. Maybe someone can us it for Crafting.",2.0
I want to love this mat but I cannot get rid of the awful smell.  I've tried everything but the smell will give me a headache if in close proximity for extended periods of time.  It's a shame because this mat is a great size for smaller projects,2.0
"This probably won't last long. I used it with the Olfa deluxe rotary cutter for about 40 cuts and I can see lots of areas where it won't be ""self-healing"".  I doubt this will last very long before its covered in ridges and cracks that ruin perfect straight cuts.",2.0
These do NOT wash out.,2.0
"My original review of these markers was intended for a different product so this is a new review. I bought this brand this time because these are supposed to be the "" gold standard"" of dot markers but in the second time of using them, the nylon screen that covers the paint pad pulled away, causing a blue explosion in blue, and it's starting to happen in purple too. These are a gift to a grandchild who has only used them with clear supervision- and has not even finished a page of dots. This same thing happened to a set I was using at preschool, also on first or second use. I thought that was a fluke but now I'm
Going to pursue getting replacements.",2.0
difficult to use them- must strain wrists- very expensive,2.0
Was expecting quite a bit more shimmer to these.,2.0
Although my 6 year old loves these  there is no shimmer to them.  He was the one who commented on it first!,2.0
"Few weeks ago I bought the rainbow pack which has been a hit between my kids (3 and 5). They LOVE to paint with the do-a-dot markers. Today I saw the shimmer pack and bought it thinking would be similar to our other pack AND shimmery (when you have a little girl, shinny, glittery and shimmery things are great!). How disappointed we are! There is no shimmer at all! As other reviewers said, the silver is just gray! And so are the other colors. Not worth the money.",2.0
"My grandgals don't play with it.
There is nothing to do but dot-dot-dot.
I thought it would be a little something different but it
did not go over.",2.0
"I received the Walnut Oil Medium in a very poor package. It leaked everywhere in the box despite the cap appearing to be on tight, and affected the other products that I also purchased. Besides that, I realized after opening the cap that it had been already opened due to the aluminum protective seal being opened, so I'm not sure how authentic this walnut oil really is, and if it has been replaced by a lower quality walnut oil (which can be hard to tell..). I was expecting much better quality than what I received, which was disappointing.",2.0
"I thought I was buying left handed scissors. This is not left handed scissors. This says it works for both, but the whole reason to buy left handed scissors is where the blade is positioned. These scissors have a blade that is a right handed blade position. There can't be scissors for both!",2.0
to expensive,2.0
The picture is misleading. This is ONE pair of scissors. I thought it was a super affordable multi pack but it is not. Otherwise scissors seem fine.,2.0
Both my son and I had difficulty getting these to work.  It was a waste of money and we preferred the Faber-Castell My First Scissors MUCH better.,2.0
"Price couldn't be better, but scissor action is not smooth. Also felt flimsy. Not sure if my daughter has even used it, so can't tell you how well it cuts.",2.0
"Good color, but blunt.",2.0
I have one lefty and one righty. My left handed child told me today her scissors are broken.. lol. They don't work for her at all. I am right handed and have no issue with them. Left handers have to have the blade reversed so I would suggest a different pair of scissors for a left hander.,2.0
These are not left handed scissors in any way.  Left handed scissors require the blades to be reversed for pressure to work for a clean cut.,2.0
"Quality is good but the photo misleading. I did not even get a tray that looks like the top one pictured. Got all very dark colors on all 4 trays with the exception of one bright yellow and white.  would be better to show all color wheels that people are buying. Nice product but because there was not a single pink, purple, orange or light blue on any of my 4 wheels... I have to give the rating a hit!",2.0
"Poor quality, but for the price Im not surprised.",2.0
These watercolors are so tiny. Not what I expected. Sent back.,2.0
"I am a little disappointed by Koh-I-Noor Watercolor Wheel Stack Pack.  When mixed with water, the colors are not as vibrant as I thought they would be. I do like the fact that this product was inexpensive and that you get 24 colors.  I also like the fact that they stack and have a water well in the center.  Too bad the paint itself did not meet my expectations.",2.0
"I ordered Windsor Newton and got a Grumbacher paint instead.  I need alizarin crimson so I kept it, but it must have been mismarked in the plastic packaging,  I think I paid to much for the one I received.",2.0
"Color is garish, difficult to mute or modify by blending, and the texture of the paint is a bit chalky.",2.0
"I could buy it from store with the same price maybe bigger, did not show the size it was small",2.0
"all excited about my new cad red opened up the tube and half oozed out ,first and only time this happened not upset winsor newton still good paint ,I just caught the ooooozzzzzer..",2.0
"One of the blades had a flat area on it, forcing me to constantly go over the areas I was cutting.  Tried another blade and it was better but not what it should have been.  Too expensive for poor quality!",2.0
does not work well with ruler for cutting quilt squares and strips,2.0
"Strange all the good reviews here. I am on my 2nd replacement order. These blades are DULL right out of the package. Not sure where Olfa is having these made, but for as much as they charge they need to step up the quality assurance inspections. I have noticed in the last year even their regular blades can come dull out of the package too. I have used Olfa for many years and have not had problems with new dull blades until recently. May have to switch to Fiskars to assure I am getting quality",2.0
"Blade developed a nick almost immediately. I take very good care of blades. It might have been defective from the get-go. At any rate, I have to buy another.",2.0
The first blade I got was dull in places and did not cut well.  I returned it for another blade and the second one was better for the first few cuts but very quickly became dull making cutting difficult.,2.0
"Harder...much harder to use than regular blade,depends on how "". Important  "" pinking is...I suppose it's a tad easier than pinking shears....but does dull within a few days...so is the one project worth the cost of a blade. ??? Also have never found easy pinking shears....although ??? I saw some advertised as "" easy "" ( spring loaded ?? Perhaps ???) Anyone use those ???  I AM a huge huge huge fan of my  olfa  rotary  regular cutter ( will never go without one in the house...away from kids of course )....love love love the  regular blade Olfa deluxe w/ straight edge and mat...buy it now !!!",2.0
"I attached it to my 45mm rotary cutter and not only did it stick all the time, it did not cut very well; and with type of cut, you want it to cut right the first time, every time. I had high hopes, but was very disappointed.",2.0
Not happy with it at all...it kept snagging...did not cut clean...felt like it was not sharp at all.....very dissapointed ...could not finish my project with it..,2.0
Received an oil based paint not acrylic..unable to use.,2.0
I bought this to replace my old fisker rotory..Iused this only a couple times before it was dull..And only used it for fabrics such as fleece and cotton..and no it is not my cutting mat because it too is an olfa mat..,2.0
It didn't cut fabric at all Not even one layer,2.0
"There is no any sharpness.
The grip is not comfortable in handling.",2.0
"I am very disappointed with a change in this cutter's design. The plastic piece that opens and closes the blade is thinner and pliable, unlike older models. It is much harder to close.  I'm not sure is really that safe now.",2.0
"I thought they were going to be similar to Lakeshore scissors. Lakeshore is currently out of those and I wanted one set for my daughter.
Well, they are not even close!  The picture is misleading because actual colors are dull and ugly. They are all bland.
 I already threw the plastic cover away. I can't return these and. am stuck with them!",2.0
I bought these as a present and used them with the kids. I found them to be stiff and the cutting edge too shallow of a design. The cutting design needs to be a little wider.  Also thought there were some patterns that looked the same an weren't very useful.  I would have returned them but they opened the gift already.,2.0
"The kids loved the scissors.  Some scissors, like another reviewer said, did not cut well.  Also the stand arrived broken.",2.0
"You do not want to use this on clay or ceramics.it is much to thick on details ,ie. fur or feather detail",2.0
"This paint lacked intensity and seems rather dull for a cadmium red. For the price I expected a cleaner, more vivid red with more pigment and less binders.",2.0
Lately most of the liquitex colors I order are clumpy and gluey. Some of them I can work back together with water and a palette knife but others such as this tube of Cobalt Turquoise (the one I ordered from Amazon) I just give up on. I don't think Amazon shipping is to blame for the paint problems because I've seen similar issues in tubes I got at Michael's or Hobby Lobby. More likely they don't stand up to the heat and humidity of the southern climate. Anyway I ordered the Cobalt Turquoise Golden makes and it has given me far superior workability and results.,2.0
"Well, first of all, this is a fantastic color. Really like it for things like dogs eyes.  Problem is that the product is not creamy--has sorta grainy stuff, maybe pigment, that I have to work on with thinner etc to dissolve.  Been thinking about sending it back. I think since it is a not often used color, I may have been sent a old tube.",2.0
"...frankly, I'm not seeing much of a difference between this and the Liquitex Basics. And, it has a strong ammonia smell. I pass.",2.0
"This paint doesn't say it is translucent, but it does not have very good coverage compared to the other brand of paint that I'm using.  If you paint this over a lighter color, the other color shows through.  Not what I was expecting for professional artist grade paint.",2.0
I can't stand this tracing paper. It feels like tissue paper-- what comes in your shirts from the cleaners. It's not very transparent and doesn't erase well. The surface is fibery-toothy. I much prefer Canson tracing paper-- smooth and transparent.,2.0
Too thin,2.0
"cheap letter stickers, there are no straight lines, every letter looks like it was cut out with a guy with a serious shaking hand, they are not very sticky, and they fall off the backing easily.  don't do as they advise and pull off the unused portion so only the letters are left, because it willl pull off half the letters and periods, commas and all the small stuff.  I don't know if its because they are only 1/2 inch, aybe they would be cleaner cuts if they were biger letters, I don't know, it seems like they use a melting process to cut the letters out?  for what I need this is good enough, but if you are looking for something nice and clean, find a different brand.",2.0
"if straight clean lettering is what you need, don't buy these. poorly cut, jagged edges. Look fine from a distance of 3 feet or more.",2.0
"The delicate sheet of stickers was badly ""shoved"" into the packaging and bent the sheet in half in 2 places making many of the vial letters unusable.",2.0
"There are few letters to write part of office hours (like: wed &sun closed), it is cheaper to buy at Office Depot.
Not worth to recommend to others.",2.0
Very poor value !!!!!  Only one set of letters and numbers.  Very Poor............,2.0
"Letters & Numbers were cut  as if the blade that cut them must have been used since 1960!
Very ragged edges. Not pleased.",2.0
"looks like it was cut using a laser and ridges rasied up by this make this a product I will not reorder,",2.0
Not what I was looking for. Not amazon issue.,2.0

"Great pens but color bled through paper. If using thicker paper, this would be good.",2.0
Tops are hard to remove. Ink is very dry on most of the pens. Colors are not varied enough for what I want to use them for. Not worth the asking price.,2.0
Poor quality for an adult. I gave them to my younger son to use.,2.0
Not impressed with the quality of these markers.  The colors bleed and are darker than they would appear to be from the cap.  I wouldn't buy these again.,2.0
About a third of the markers were hard and dry.,2.0
They bleed a lot.,2.0
I wouldn't recommend these.,2.0
"These were good set of colors. I used them for like 1 month, light usage.
I am trying them now, and most are dried out! Not what I expect for the money paid!",2.0
"Terrible pens. Most of them were too rough and tore up the paper, the ink did not flow smoothly.",2.0
"I purchased these to use in Adult Coloring books, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  They tear up the paper no matter how easy you color and no matter what kind of paper you use.  They may be ok for something else, but coloring is not it.  They also bleed through to the other side.  And the colors do not match the lid, so you will need to make a color chart, if you are going to use these.  Good Luck!!",2.0
"I'm very disappointed with pens, the colors are very misleading. The color that comes out is completely different from the color of the pens. At $17.00 per set, they're actually no better than a $4.00 box of Crayola markers.",2.0
"Not really thrilled with these for coloring books. They did not lay down smooth and were scratch and uneven in color...  I was disappointed as I had really liked the color range.  Could be the paper in the books, but I have tried them on all sorts of paper, cardstock etc and just not good. If you are getting them for kids to use then I am sure they will be fine. I'll stick with my Bic and Sharpies and Steadtler pens",2.0
These are very disappointing.  Most markers skipped and clogged. Some colors came out uneven...light then very dark. Will not buy again.,2.0
These guys have a very short lifespan and are mostly variations on unattractive shades.,2.0
Not happy with the colors. For a 36 pc set the colors are actually very limited as most of the colors in each color family are all basically the same. Very disappointed.,2.0
I ended up giving them away. The tips sort of make the paper fiber stick to them.,2.0
"I was extremely disappointed with these markers. The material on the point of the markers began to come off literally the first time I used them. I wasn't applying too much pressure or anything else that would cause this. Not every marker did this immediately, but most of the ones I have used did this. It messes up the color (the colors are also much darker than the colors of the pens) and smears material as well as color. BUY SOMETHING ELSE.",2.0
"I hate to say something negative when others seem to think the world of these pens. I found them spotty and inconsistent when coloring. I liked the case they came in and how the colors were listed on the back. They aren't true to the color (pen color vs. ink color) with most of the pens, but I got used to it. I could only use these for about a month before I had to order a new set, because they ruined my experience of coloring. I've previously purchased Sharpie and Bic (both ultra fine point) and am now using Staedtler Triplus Finetip. I'd recommend any of these three before the Pentel set. I only give 2 stars because of the case and the color selection.",2.0
"I was appalled when I realized my brand new marker set had some pens with low or no ink. #105 - Lemon Yellow, #133 - Marine Blue, and #134 Emerald Green are NOT usable. Hardly any color comes out at all...in fact, where I'd planned to use those 3 colors I had to use colored pencils instead since I tried the marker 1st and, therefore, had to commit to that color.
I feel like another new set is due but I cannot afford it right now; especially since I just got this 1.",2.0
Dried out,2.0
"There are a lot of colors, but not very much variety.  I guess I expected more options then the same colors in a variety of shades.",2.0
These markers bleed when I use them in my Adult Coloring Book. Disappointed.,2.0
"I was very excited excited to receive these. That changed as soon as I used them. The colors bleed and do not color smoothly. The ink is thick so going over something twice almost rips the paper. I tried outlining with the black and it bled into the other color. My daughter loves these and they are great for her, but not for any precision coloring.",2.0
"I'm not sure if I got a bad batch, but the markers are very dry and I have to go over the same spot four or five times for a solid line of color.",2.0
"Not a fan! I am not sure if I am a one off here, but I got this to color in a adult coloring book and mine were dry and brittle. They balled up and ripped the secret garden coloring book. This was very disappointing as I had heard wonderful things about these markers.",2.0
"Pretty colors, and nice pens, but way too much bleed through on high quality coloring books.  Would never work on a back-to-back type one.  Returned.",2.0
"Like many other reviewers, I bought these markers to go along with my adult coloring books. I was really disappointed. The fine tip is great for coloring details but the colors of the markers on paper are VERY dark and do not look like the colors represented on the outside of the markers. Additionally, because the colors don't match, there are essentially 4 grey markers and 3 brown markers. Even the lighter colors (yellows, oranges, pinks) are not vibrant, especially if you are used to Crayola markers. I would not purchase these again.",2.0
"I bought these for my adult coloring book. I was pretty disappointed when i used them. The colors on the pens don't match the actual color, they come out pretty dark too. It made the coloring book paper water up and wrinkle and the ink bled through. These are not good for thin uncoated paper (what the coloring books are usually made of). I wouldnt recommend this set for coloring books.",2.0
"These pens are not super great. The tips shed, and some were dried out from the get.",2.0
Outer color of marder doesn't match actual marker color and several arrived dried out.,2.0
"Most of these pens, by far, are poor quality. They scratch the paper, even when you mark very lightly. The four markers that are worth using are quite good, though. The yellow ochre, in particular, is a great color, like a dull bronze.",2.0
"Good color selection, however the markers bleed through the  back of the paper and also blend together if you don't allow a minute for it to dry. Disappointed in that. Bought  a set for a gift, so will have to be sure to tell her to take the page out of the coloring book so the page under doesn't get ruined.",2.0
"These pens are nice enough but I won't buy them again.  In fact, I'm giving them to my daughter or grand daughter.  The colors don't even come close to the colors on the pens.  They are all very dark, and ones that look like they should be pastel, are not.  The tips are nice to work with, but colors are not.",2.0
I got these to color with and was very disappointed.  The tips were just not fine enough.  I now use the sharpie ultra fine markers.  These just didn't work for me.,2.0
"I purchased these markers to use in my adult coloring books. The markers are decent to use in larger scale projects/coloring however to use in small areas is not the greatest.
Also the package shows various shades of greens, blues, red, etc but when you have them on paper the colors all look close to being the same. Overall mediocre at best.",2.0
Tips get all hairy with loose fibers as soon as you start to use. Some of the colors are MUCH darker than indicated by the barrel.,2.0
Lousy saturation.  It just seems like there is not a lot of ink in these.  Was using them for adult coloring.  Maybe not a good use for these!,2.0
More than half of the markers are very dry and the other half do not match the color of the case they are housed in.  Very disappointed.  Have old Crayola markers that work much better.,2.0
"I figure it would be easier to write one review comparing all of them.

Triplus Fineliner(30): Out of the bunch these have the smoothest application and I enjoy using them the most. You don't have to worry about ruining the paper if you go over the same spot a couple times. You can actually fill up a decent size area without it being streaky like you'd expect with most of these products. It's unfortunate they chose so many muted/ dark colors (12/30 to be exact) and they are the most expensive. Bleed? Little to moderate

Stabilo(30): Wide range of bright colors at a decent price. I find myself reaching for these more than steadtler because of the colors although they have a harder tip and can be scratchy, it would be hard to fill a decent size area but good for precision. Bleed? Moderate

Pentel(36): Got these to fill in bigger spaces as they're cheaper than the steadtler colour pens and stabilo 68 pens. For the price they're ok. I love all the colors but really hate using them. They feather, can't be used for precision, and tear up the paper pretty fast. It's almost impossible to get even coverage as well. I'm not sure how much use I'll get out of them, pretty bummed overall. Bleed? Yes

Monami(24): I love these things. They're CHEAP!, colorful, and bright- but not good for big areas. The tip is hard to explain, think maybe like Papermate Flairs except finer, great for details that can be hard to get with the other fineliners. They're actually good for writing as well(I buy the packs of black for note taking). It's smoother than the pentel felt tip but will still tear up the paper and can give streaky coverage (some colors more than others) if you aren't careful. Note- they sometimes ""sputter"" when brand new. Not a lot though and it subsides quickly. Bleed? Little to none!",2.0
"I wanted to use these for adult coloring, but the first time I used them the felt stayed on the page. They weren't fine enough either. Maybe all felt tip pens would be this way, but I had to return these. I am going to try gel pens instead.",2.0
"I just unpacked these pens,  The folder holding the pens is taped. You must remove the tape to use the pens and when you do a VERY STICKY residue remains.  After using multiple cleaners to remove the stickiness with no luck and finally I found that alcohol will remove the adhesive is gone. .",2.0
"The colors are good, but bleeds through badly",2.0
The fine tip makes it very hard to color an area. The finished product looks as if it has lines drawn through it. Looks terrible. I wish they were chisel tip. Some of them seem to be more dried out than others.,2.0
"Markers came on time and come with all the colors, but some were fading even as I opened for the first time AND the rest are fading after only starting one adult coloring book page:(  Not worth it!",2.0
These is great pentel color pen but there is a problem with this color pen. Colors do not match the caps and some were dry out of the box. Not the best quality.,2.0
"I bought these markers to go with my adult coloring book. I found them to be particularly ill-fitting. They're not fine enough for the small details. The fiber tip would would rub off while I was coloring. I kept having to pull small parts of the fibers off even though I felt I was coloring lightly. They bleed through the paper, leaving the pictures on the other side of the paper unusable. They also bleed incredibly easily through the lines. They rub the paper, leaving little pieces of paper behind.  The color choices are okay. These markers would probably be okay for a school project or coloring bigger spaces. They just didn't meet my needs.",2.0
"The markers are not very Brite in color and make my paper peel up.

Update. Used them on a second picture that a better paper. Still not as happy as I feel I should be. I use alot of markers. These bleed thou the paper just as much as my Sharpies do. I would not recommend them for pictures that are printed on both sides. As I stated before the colors are not as Brite as I hoped for. Alot of the colors seem to be very close in color to each other. Also I will say they are not by far the worst markers on the market I will hang on to them to use to mix in in some pictures. Just don't see me reaching for them as my 1st choice.",2.0
"I actually think these are good markers, but I can't get past the difference from the color on the outside of the marker and the actual color. The light purple one is dark purple, one that appears a lighter green is one of the darkest, etc. I forget the exact shade and then I use the wrong color often. This is super frustrating.",2.0
Gels are way better.  These make pages splint like tissue,2.0
Colors don't match the color of the pens abd some arrived dried out.,2.0
"I was excited to buy these, as I had them long ago. I am disappointed at the quality. Some of the tips are harder than others right out of the pack. Worse, many of the pens are dry. Often they are dry on one side of the tip. Giving more than one star in hopes my set was a fluke.",2.0
"The lighter colored markers do NOT match their cap colors - there are NO light pink or light rose markers in this set.  All the lighter pink colors come out different shades of ORANGE on paper.  The light beige pen comes out an ugly dark tan or dark taupe.  If you need lighter colors, or a good range of pinks in your set, DON'T BUY THESE MARKERS.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED...",2.0
Disappointed. More than half the markers are dry.,2.0
Not as good as bic,2.0
There is no pink....their pink is really orange!!,2.0
"Colors are vibrant, but do not match up with the color of the lid. On some coloring books where the paper isn't extra-thick they bleed through, or the area that you're coloring becomes oversaturated and get a rough fuzzy texture. Would not purchase again, but these will keep my 4 yo happy.",2.0
Worked great for a little while then quickly dried up,2.0
"Very disappointed. I should have listened to the other reviewers. I have used at least a dozen of the colors and so far only a couple of them have had enough ink to not streak. The others are not completely dried out but have already started to, so you can feel the marker scratch along the paper and the color is splotchy and streaky. I realize that these are not expensive markers, but I had hoped at least for a decent marker with ink.  I would probably have been better off going with Crayola. Maybe they have been sitting in the warehouse too long. Will be returning but not asking for a replacement. One other negative is that there are no lighter shades. What appear to be lighter shades according to the outside of the pen are still dark. Would be nice to have some pastel shades included. They would be good markers if they were fresh. They do not bleed through and the colors are vibrant.",2.0
Ink is a bit heavy; it comes out pretty fast. There's significant bleedthrough on light cardstock (112 gsm) and very inconsistent coverage.,2.0
"Most of these markers are pretty dried out (and I just got them and tried using them immediately), many have excess bits of felt sticking out from the tips, and there are far too many where the actual color and depth doesn't match the outer casing at all. I realize they're not top of the line, but I still feel it would have been reasonable to expect a bit more for the price paid.",2.0
"They work well but the color of the pen is not the color you get. It's too dark, too light or is just far off from what you are choosing to use.",2.0
Pens were dry and I was unable to use many of them.  I will purchase pens locally next time.,2.0
"These aren't great. The bled through the pages of the high-dollar book I was coloring, and made tiny rips in the paper. The colors are good, and the tips are good for coloring, but I would look elsewhere.",2.0
Too fine tipped.  They don't have a good flow.,2.0
"I used to use these years ago, was excited to try again. The are dry feeling when you use them you have to use a lot of pressure. I don'the recommend.",2.0
"I have two main complaints about this set of pens. The main one being that the range of colors was very disappointing. Although from looking at the pens, it appears to have the spectrum of colors, the actual colors don't correlate with the pen casing. In particular, all the pens that appear to be in the red and pink family turn out to be oranges. The other thing is what I've seen in other reviews; some of the pen tips quickly shed onto the paper. I do like the feel of the pens and how nicely the lay down the color.",2.0
These dried out too fast. My son and I used them to color a Mandala and the colors didn't last.,2.0
Colors are not true to cap. In general a bit darker than I would prefer.,2.0
"These color pens seem to dry up quickly. They started to get dry the very first time I used them. I seem to remember that problem from years ago, but figured they were just old pens back then. This was a good price for a variety of colors, but I wouldn't buy these again.",2.0
"I have owned this set of markers in the past and LOVED them.  I used them for years without a problem so I was very excited to get a new set.  After not even an hour, three of the blues dried out completely, and many of the other colors arrived a little ""dry"".  I'm very disappointed and plan to send them back and order a duplicate.  I hope the new ones are better.",2.0
"I've had a set of these markers for years.  My children have been using them and slowing they were drying up so I started looking for the same set.

I purchased this set off of Amazon.  First off the case started cracking the first week!  The markers kept falling out of the bottom and I couldn't understand why.  It is flimsy
and it has all cracked.

Next my son comes to me with Orange marker all over his hands.  The top of the lid and the bottom were leaking so profusely it was everywhere.  I was so surprised
at the low quality of these markers.

The other colors are fine thus far but it has only been 2 weeks so who knows.",2.0
"I have purchased several brands of markers including Staedtler, OfficeMax metallic, TUL ultra fine, Bic Mark it fine point, and the Pentel Color Pen Set. Of all these brands I've used, & I have used them a lot, the Pentel brand is the worse one of the lot. When I contacted the Pentel company via their online web site to ask how I can return the whole set, since they are guaranteed, there was no response whatsoever. On the other hand, I returned one of the Bic Mark it pens for replacement & I not only received my new pen in short order they also threw in several $1 off coupons for future Bic purchases! Now, I ask, who would you do business with in the future? It's a no brainer.",2.0

"It was like Christmas morning when my hole punch arrived at my office. I had visions of punching through reams of paper with the greatest of ease - no more jams, no more awkward ergonomics, just pure punching delight.

My elation slowly turned to confusion when I unboxed the punch. In front of me sat what looked like a cheap Soviet-bloc era stamped metal hole punch. I quickly loaded in a sheet of paper and depressed the lever. Flip! The action of pushing down the lever flipped the unit on its side. I inspected the newly punched sheet only to discover that the piston did not cleanly separate the ""chad"" from the hole. ""Clearly, I must not have done this right."" I thought to myself. I loaded up another sheet, and then another, only to discover that each time I depressed the lever, the unit would flip on its side and would leave the ""chad"" on the sheet.

Undaunted, I will continue my search for the elusive grand daddy of hole punchers.

I believe the inherent problem with the unit is it is unbalanced  (the position of the lever in relation to the width of the base) and the piston does not depress far enough into the hole to get a clean cutting action. Fondly, I recall my father having a similar unit which was produced in the 70s that has lasted to this day. The build was wonderful and made of quality parts - it did not flip. Despite its weight and size, it feels cheap and because of its obvious design flaws was returned.

As an aside, please note that while some people were excited about the oversized holes the punch makes, I found the nearly dime sized holes are ginormous. But that is not a problem with the unit, just a potential problem not visualizing how big the oversize holes were going to be.",2.0
"The holes are huge, which is what we wanted. However, the punches are cheaply made of pot metal and one broke within the first couple of uses. The other issue is that the holes end up being very close to the edge of the page so they tear easily and require reinforcers",2.0
"It's heavy, but the fittings were loose on arrival and need to be repeatedly adjusted. Plus, I thought it came with over-sized holes. Not true in my opinion. I should have returned it. But time got away from me.",2.0
"Was eagerly looking forward to getting this hole punch because I have used this one for years mainly due to the punch size 13/32"".  It is a dream to have your pages in a binder flip over without ripping.  Initially I had called almost every business supply store in the surrounding Phoenix area.  The pricing ranged drastically (some supply stores had gouging prices) and others would have to order it in (shipping was not included).  The shipping time was longer than what AMAZON offered and AMAZON had free shipping included.

The price range through AMAZON was okay for this product, found it cheaper through another company but the shipping time was longer; needed it immediately.

When I opened the box I noticed it was used instead of being new which is what I wanted and purchased.  The product had chips of paint out of it that had been touched up with black touchup paint and was very noticeable.  If I wanted used I would have ordered used, very disappointed.

I called AMAZON immediately and they are sending me a new one immediately and I will be returning this one...This company cost me time in getting a project completed and put together due to this issue.  Not impressed!!!!",2.0

"It's a decent zipper, but it is in no way heavy duty.  Granted, my application is rather extreme(heavy bag), but zipper failed the first time used",2.0
"Buyer beware.  This zipper kit says right on the package that it's great for zippers on jackets.  However, this zipper is a continuous coil type with no metal end stops.  This means the only way to install the zipper is by permanently sealing one end.  --and THAT means the zipper will never separate, making this completely useless for jacket zippers.  What good is a jacket that can never be completely unzipped?

If you're getting the zipper for something that doesn't need to come apart, then this is a great zipper.  -but it's definitely not for jackets, which is the first thing listed on the package that it's supposed to be ideal for fixing!",2.0
"I ordered this easel to replace my older, broken metal easel. I read several reviews that espoused the greatness of this easel, but was really disappointed when I finally got it out of the box.

There are no instructions to tell you how to use the easel, so you just kind of have to figure out where everything goes and how it sits (not too difficult).

However, what really disappointed me was that this was shipped to me and when I got it, the bracket that holds your piece of work was crooked. So I attempted to make it straight (because i can't paint if the foundation is crooked as the piece will just slide off). When I did this, the wood on the backbone of the easel split!

So now the top bracket is busted. The nails that hold this piece of junk together are not very good (very akin to stapling wood). The wood itself is not all that great either if it split that easily.

Honestly, I really think that even for the 30 dollars I spent on it, I should have gotten a better product. Unfortunately, because I live overseas, I can't return it so I am stuck with a product that is sub par and useless.",2.0
The products are good qualities the case that everything is supposed to be held in the wooden case is not worth three cents wasn't even glued properly and the corners were not finished with wood hanging over,2.0
"I usually love royal langnickel  products and hav bought many of them in the past, including sets for painting and drawing. Usually I find the sets to be high quality and contain nice materials, paints, brushes, markers, etc. However, I was incredibly disappointed with this item...It is NOTworth the price that  paid for it, and that says something because I bought it while it was on lightning deal. Details:

Pros:
The box that everything comes in seems to be pf a decent quality, it is wood. It's nicely colored, and latches well.
The paints seem to be of  good quality. I haven't had any issues with them.

Cons:
The brushes it came with seem to be low quality. They don't snap back when you test them, and are rather disappointing to use. They leave fibers everywhere.
The paint tray that the item comes with is an incredibly flimsy, cheap, breakable tray. This is the most disappointing item of all as it was one of the main reasons I bought the set. The tray looked useful from the pictures.... It's not at all. It's horrible.

For the price, I would definitely NOT recommend this product. The quality is just sub par compared to other similar products of this type.",2.0
box came damaged and when trying to clean the brushes the paint chipped off.,2.0
"mixing colors does not work, like red and blue make brown instead of purple",2.0
the hinge broke after a 2 foot drop,2.0

"low quality, reaaly low. charcoals don't even smudge",2.0
I received my art set in a few days. The paints have worked well and the blonde brushes seem to paint fine. Haven't shed yet. I have not tried the black brushes yet. The box fell apart the day I got it and the inserts holding the paint fell out as well. The only thing really worth buying was the paint/brushes.,2.0
"As far as what's in it goes, great, exactly what I was promised and what I expected. However, when I got it, the case it came it had a huge, damaged hole in the lower corner of it.....definitely not what I paid for.",2.0
Arrived chipped.,2.0
Paints and brushes were all very nice - my daughter loved them. The box was very poorly made. The latch is broken and the brush holder isn't attached right. The plastic parts came loose immediately.,2.0
"The product was not of quality, the box was poorly put together. Some of the pencils were broken. There wasn't a description of what number pencils were included in the box. So I was missing a few I needed for school.
The sticks of compressed charcoal were very thin and broke easy when in use.
I got this box for a college course I am taking, so I am unable to send back since I need some of the supplies. I wouldn't recommend this to an art major. Maybe for first time artist who are exploring, not at all on a professional level.",2.0
"This was an affordable set of watercolors and brushes for a beginner. The first thing that happened is that the inside tray ( a paper thin plastic ) came loose... Where the paints are supposed to be held tight in place, they now flip out along with the entire tray. It's not a ""neat"" little kit since everything is a big mess when you've closed it up and it's a lot of trouble to get it all back where things belong. The brushes are hard to access because they have layered them with a bit of an offset. ( one part of the set is under the other part )... This is a simple kit of paints and brushes. Don't expect to be wowed or super happy - expect to get some paint and some brushed and a box. The plastic liner is what makes it cheap.",2.0
"I ordered this set to ship out to an upcoming vacation spot so I would not need to take all my supplies on the airplane.  The case is okay and the brushes seemed good enough although I did not get the chance to use them much to see how well they held up but there was a good variety to brush styles.
The disapointment came when I actually tried to paint with the paints.  They were hard to open, the piercing part in the lid did not always work so you had to fight with it to mae the hole or othes it was too easy and ended up with paint squirting out everywhere.  Most annoying was the white paint was the consitancy of elmers glue and had very little 'guts' to it. Needed almost the whole tube just trying to do an 8 x 10 painting as using it as an opaque was just about impossible.  The yellow ochre was orange.  At this point I gave up and needed a trip to the store to buy paints.",2.0
Good paint but terrible brushes. The bristles fall out while painting which is really annoying. I would not suggest this product.,2.0
"I read numerous comments on this item and minus the box, i was convinced it was a decent product. Upon receiving the item, i immediately noticed the shabby quality of the box which was to be expected. What i later found out though was that there was another problem, which has to do with the pencils  in the set, all of them including the charcoal pencils and the pastels, i have not been able to sharpen any of the pencils to this point, the more i sharpen the more the points just fall out , and the wood used on the pencils just shreds while im trying to sharpen them. I don't see the point in this sketching set if the pencils are totally useless, everything was fine though, but to me the pencils were a vitally important aspect in this sketching set and they dropped the ball there. Buy at your own risk i guess. i will not buy from this brand again.",2.0
The finish of all the products inside are rather poor. One of my majorly regrettable purchases here in Amazon. I wouldn't recommend this even if you have been painting the same thing for the last twenty years.,2.0
"...was hoping for a little better quality for the money, was a little disappointed.  These aren't the worst brushes I've ever used but they are at the tail end quality wise.  For starters the case was warped and cheap and won't latch its so warped.  The brushes aren't horrible but they do tend to shed bristles and occasionally the tops.  The were really stiff out of the box and had to soak in thinner for a couple of days just to be able to use them.  The paint was okay though there wasn't a lot of it and the pallet knife was almost useless.  Other than that I guess it's okay...",2.0
This set arrived with a warped lid (.25 inch gap at the front between latches) and the contents were spilled inside of the case with some charcoal pencils badly chipped or broken. The warped lid was no doubt to blame for the spilled contents. I would not recommend this set for a beginning artist unless your aim is to discourage them.,2.0
"Well i got this set today....opened it up to find that the other reviewers are correct. The box is cheaply made. The tray that is supposed to hold everything is worthless, made more apparently so by me opening it to find almost nothing is in the interior tray ""holders"" as it should be and most (75%) of the graphite and charcoal sticks were broken in 2 to 4 peices. Sure maybe i just got the ""bad egg"" this time, but going by what I see here I wouldnt recommend it to anyone.",2.0
"The pictures of this set made me think that at least the box was a nice wooden one with a felt interior.  However, when it arrived I learned that the box, locks, and handle are flimsy... and the black interior is a very thin plastic insert that falls out if you're not careful.  The brushes and paints are mediocre at best.  I wasn't looking for something lavish with a 39.99 price tag, but I would have thought there'd be something of a ""gift set"" appeal... I guess I was wrong.",2.0
"I purchased this paint set as a starter kit for painting, since it contains almost everything I need for painting and the price is low.

They do have a lifetime guarantee.  Not sure what that's worth since they are just cheap junk and always will be.",2.0

"Since for this item you can almost only judge it by the product photographs, buyers should be warned that the awl you will receive is probably not to the quality you expect.

The main reason I purchased this awl was because it appeared that it narrowed to a nearly needle sized point, but still had a comfortable handle. This is not true, the diameter of the point is not thinner than most awls.
Further, the awl itself appears hastily glued in, and (at least on the one I received) the awl was cocked at a slight angle, certainly not parallel with the handle.
Lastly, the wood handle itself was extremely rough - virtually unfinished.

I purchased this awl for book binding; just punching holes through a few pieces of paper at a time. While it is serviceable, I do not expect it to last very long and plan to replace it shortly.",2.0

really didn't like these at all-they can tear the paper you write or color on,2.0

This was very messy and difficult to apply. It was like trying to wipe the seams with fat free milk. It doesn't show any signs that it was absorbed into the material or actually sealed anything. It seems that something more gel-like would be easier to apply and more affective.,2.0

I satuated the leather with another chemical prior to applying the seal, so I don't know if the seal helped or not (the shoes did not get wet on subsequent use in wet show), but the film looks ugly. Don't buy it to seal fine shoes...",2.0
"Doesn't work too great, and once it dries on the glue it seems to be a different color.",2.0
Wouldn't use again.  Works as a temporary solution but I will get my seat reupholstered.  It feels like superglue and the areas I used it are hard.  Not as easy as the instructions say to make designs.,2.0
it was okay. I should have read the label. It don't do deep scratches.,2.0

"Got this to repair some burns in my car seats. Very hard to match the color. And the color seems to have some kind of sparkle tint to it. This repair kit will cover the spot in some way, but the color is very hard to match. I have a nissan altima w light grey on the inside. Didn't really come out as expected. It was 10$. Worth a try, but if I knew the result was going to be like this, wouldn't have wasted 10$.",2.0

"This kit comes with several varieties of ""fabric powders"" that you mix to obtain the desired color. You then mix in an adhesive and glue this mess into the damaged area of fabric. I was unable to really get the correct shade of brown and the stuff was too fuzzy to pass off as a repaired area of the seat anyway. If you have very fuzzy and thick upholstery in your vehicle this might work for you, but it sure didn't for me.",2.0
"Seems you need to be an expert to use this kit properly. It is almost impossible to get the right combination of color molecules (that is the only way I can describe them) to match the fabric. The glue is also very difficult to use. I will say that once the mix sat and dried overnight, it really did cover the hole in the fabric. But as i feared, it was the wrong color so had to peel it off as best as I could (it does adhere well).",2.0

"I saw this caddy at Michael's before but I decided to get it from amazon because it is cheaper here. I have to say I really like the design of the caddy. It has the perfect size and there are some holes around the edge of the caddy so u can put ur brushes. BUT, There is a hole at the bottom of the caddy, so when u put water in it later u will find ur caddy actually can pee. Well...I use my glue gun to fix the problem, but I know not everyone has glue gun, and to some ppl they will be really disappointed about this hole. I suggest if you want to get this caddy, you should go to Michael's so u can check the caddy instead of get it from amazon.",2.0
It ok,2.0
not a bad caddy but mylid was cracked within a week!,2.0

"As an artist I found this product overrated-overpriced compared to the other Sepia type inks available (Art Spectrum, Sennelier, Cornelissen ) Price wise its up there with the top brands, but its main drawback is what happens when it dries. Make it clear_it is NOT_water resistant. I have seen it reviewed on his website by another artist as waterproof_it is not.
This may not be a concern to most artists, in fact it can be a bonus when trying to lift colour etc.
However as someone who has had to conserve and restore thousands of works on paper, my first test prior to working on an artwork, is always a test for water sensitivity in the medium at hand. Works executed in Tom Nortons Walnut Drawing Ink would be excluded from treatments involving water. Use it by all means but be aware that it is NOT waterproof when dry",2.0
I have not use this product yet but I did read online that is not made from walnuts,2.0
"I bought this ink for calligraphy dip pen, but tried it both with calligraphy and with a fountain pen. The ink barely has any color at all, it is very pale. Also, it is very diluted, so it is not good for calligraphy, which needs thicker ink. I bought it because of many positive reviews, but do not use this ink at all.",2.0
"It's a big pain to have to,separate these pages from the block with a razor blade, and at least half the time they tear.  Never again! The paper itself is very smooth and sturdy once you get it torn off.",2.0
Way overpriced,2.0
"The pad is wrapped tightly with black plastic inside, with instructions to open it with a palette knife. Even if a water colorist has a palette knife, it takes real caution to extract a page without ripping it.

"I have a Brother CS6000i and wanted to make sure I got the original Brother ruffler foot so it was easier to install and worked properly. The ruffler foot I got does NOT look like the one in the picture. Instead, it looks exactly like the other generic foot you can find on here for less money!!! I have seen the original Brother ruffler foot in store and it comes in a Brother box and looks like the picture for this one, Mine does not.

It works fine, and although it was difficult to install, I figured it out. I am just extremely disappointed that I feel like I was lied to. This is not original; it is the generic.",2.0
So I bought this. It sat on my desk for like a month. Finally used it. I was extremely excited & disappointed. It works to an extent. I am not sure if I have to play around with my settings but I tried all settings possible for stretch fabrics & just gave up.,2.0
not getting the hang of this foot. seems to not adjust to the tension for the elastic and causes it to stretch or bind.,2.0
Hadn't figured this out yet but note that I am a novice (although brilliant) in the Serger world.,2.0
"This elastic application foot works well however if one is sewing in the round (waist, leg hole) it's not clear how to use the product. Obviously starting the elastic application makes sense, but what do you do when you finish the enclosed circular sewing? Youtube tutorials don't explain this type of application, they only show how to show using this foot on a straight edge. Not sure if I would buy again.",2.0
"This is a very poorly designed foot. I do not believe the person who designed it has ever pieced fabric with a 1/4"" seam, the wording on the excellent instructions would tend to confirm my theory. This foot has markings which might be useful for piecing set in or ""Y"" seams although in my experience sewers who are willing to tackle them are very well able to gauge their stopping distance. I gave the foot two stars instead of one because (a) it is well made and (b) the small needle hole is well thought out for preventing the fabric being pulled up or bunching.

If you look at my photo of the foot, you will see it is notched on the right side. The green arrow is where the edge of the fabric needs to go to achieve a 1/4"" seam, not the outer edge of the foot. Once the fabric has passed under the foot you are guessing where it is, unless you have X-ray eyes you can't see it. This results in wandering seams and frustration. Plus unpicking. The second photo shows this. Unpicking will happen.

I am not a novice quilter. I usually use a vintage Singer 15. I rarely have problems with my seam allowance. I bought the Brother CS 6000i because I needed a zig-zag stitching machine for stretchy fabric garment construction and the price was awesome. It is a wonderful little machine, came with many accessories but unless and until they produce or I find a better piecing foot I probably will not piece with it.",2.0
"I tried it for quilt piecing.  It slips all over the fabric.  Could be my machine but I just don't like the way it works.  I ended up relying on needle position to get 1/4"" seams.",2.0
Fine,2.0
"The foot does not have the guide extending out in front. My fault, the picture shows the foot as it is sold. Will buy a different one.",2.0
NOT A GREAT FOOT,2.0
Maybe I just need more practice with it.  Went through a lot of needles before remembering to move needle position.  Wish it had a wider stitch opening.,2.0
I should have saved my money.  The guide is nothing special and I could have used the mark on my regular foot to do the same job.  Not impressed.,2.0
"This is sold as an adequate 1/4 inch quilting foot for my machine - the Brother CS-6000i.

I loved this foot when I put it on my machine, and it does help create accurate 1/4 seems. Then I noticed the needle hole does not line up with the default needle placement of the machine.  (Seems odd, no?)  I said to myself, ""Self, remember to change the needle position IMMEDIATELY when you turn on your machine again.""  Of course I didn't and the second time I went to use it, I ended up with a broken needle.  To me, a foot that results in a broken needle if I don't remember to change my needle position each and every time I turn on my machine, is not a adequate foot for the machine.

Look - this needle is great for quilting even 1/4 inch seems.  But I doubt I'll use it too many more times.  I don't want to buy needles every single time I forget to change my needle position before dropping it.  I would love a foot that is made for the left-default needle position.  Sadly, I can't find one...",2.0

I've double-checked that the parts inside the chuck are installed correctly, but it's still frustrating.",2.0

"March 2011 - I'm updating this review based on the heavy use I put it through the past year (downgraded from 4 stars).  When I first bought the machine I rarely used it but when I did I completed several projects at once.  This past year I started an Etsy shop and found the need for sewing everyday.  I'm not talking about making leather bags or premium denim, just your average quilt-weight cottons, some linens, and occasionally  heavy interfacing.  The machine could not handle thick layers.  And while I understand it's not meant to sew through 10+ layers on a consistent basis all I needed was for it to sew through five layers at the handle-to-bag points.  The tension became insane, too tight/too loose on either top or bottom stitching and it would not go back, even after I had it ""fixed"" by a repair shop (for $65).  The shop managed to fix the timing however so I could start to reuse it.  A month after it's repair the timing broke again.  I refuse to pay for another visit to the shop, another$65 and that's basically the cost of this machine!!  It's true you get what you pay for.  Light projects with intermittent use is the best use for this type of machine.

--------------------

I bought this machine as a substitute to my grandmother's heirloom Singer.  I had some hesitation with a machine that was computerized because I'm very accustomed to the standard knob and dial machines.  Overall this is a great piece of equipment.

Advantages: Great manual, it will tell you how to do almost everything you'd like to do with the machine.  Numerous accessories, several feet, bobbins, and other standard sewing pieces come courtesy of Brother.  The ease of switching feet, the automatic threader (which, not to be misleading, you still have to manually wind the thread through the machine, this model comes with an arm that pulls the thread through the needle for you - hence the name).  The drop-in bobbin.  Goes through most fabrics readily, including double and triple folded materials (with exception of some sturdier fabrics - i.e. leather).  One of the quietest motors I've ever worked with.  Easy to trouble shoot.

Disadvantages: You can only use the bobbin model that comes with the machine, it won't accept any other kinds.  The dome light is very dim.  The machine also tends to be overly sensitive to you manually poking around.  When I first turned on the machine I nudged the needle, to which the LED display immediately flashed an E6 warning (that was an easy fix, I just turned it off then back on).  To get all the stitch functions it take some time getting used to the four control buttons.  Which, again, not to be misleading the ""77"" stitches are variations of 35+ standard ones.  I also didn't understand I hadn't wound the bobbin thread all the way through either, it resulted in terrible tension control during my first project.  You may be trouble shooting a lot until you get to used to the machine.  But the majority of the time the problems are simple and once fixed you'll never have that problem again.",2.0
"I am a complete beginner and have had lots of fun with my machine and am totally hooked on sewing.  However, in the 3 months I have had it it has been sent away twice with alignment and various other problems with the bobbin case and motor.  I am really disappointed.  One person who looked at it thought that I had been sewing fabrics that were took thick; I have been making bags that have two layers of fabric and a layer of interfacing, but even given the price, I feel that the machine is not value for money if it cannot cope with this.  Overall, when it works it is a great machine - maybe I have been really unlucky - but I am not sure I would buy it again.",2.0
"I don't know what my problem is, but I just can't seem to find a brayer that doesn't leave a streak from the edge of the roller. GRRR!",2.0
"This was a gift for my sister. I didn't check it when it came, just put it aside. Turns out it came with one of the bottles empty (forget which one). By the time I gave it to her, though, it was too late to return it. Fortunately, my sister needed didn't really need the stuff in the empty bottle so she was happy with it. I was still pissed and embarrassed when she opened the package and found an empty bottle though.",2.0
this kind of printing is not for the average crafter. frustrating. you must have a really dark closet with nothing in it. and a strong light.,2.0
Probably would have been great except we recieved 2 bottles of emulsion remover instead of 1 bottle of emulsion and 1 bottle of remover. Will have to return.,2.0
catalyst bottle came empty ... very disappointed,2.0
"If anyone is really serious about screen printing, stay away from Speedball. This stuff is for bathtub amateurs, and results show.
Nothing like Ulano or Holden's products made for professional results.
You are probably looking at this due to the price/or you don't want a 16oz tub~ the cheapness will only frustrate you.
Should you discuss with an actual print house or screen tech, Speedball is NEVER a recommended brand.",2.0
"This was a big, goopy mess that stained everything it touched.  However, I was trying to use it on metal, not the best choice.  I wanted something that wasn't going to crack and flake off like spray paint might, and after reading several rave reviews about how it was great for metal I fell for it.  It does not stick to metal.  I could see this being a good product for small, wood projects, like picture frames or mirror frames, wooden candlesticks, etc.  Knowing that I used it for something that probably wasn't it's intended use, I felt I should probably give it more than two stars. But, the product is hard to work with, period, so I couldn't imagine it would be any easier on any surface.  It's definitely not a wax like substance out of the tube.  It's the consistency of oil paint.  It just wasn't what I was looking for.  You will DEFINITELY need a hobby brush to apply this with.",2.0
I thought there were several pcs but only received i pc. Item showed shipping wgt of over 2 lbs but this pcs only weights a few oz. Very disappointed. Wood itself was exactly what I was wanting.,2.0
"Think carefully before using this product. This is a wax based product so if you decide you don't like the color or just don't like the way it looks, you can't paint over it because the wax prevents any paint product from sticking. I've tried 3 different colors of Rub 'n Buff and none of the colors look very good.  Very flat finish, no depth to it.",2.0
"This is not what I expected, and it didn't do what I needed.  I used to have a thick paste that you could use to gild wood and other surfaces.  I needed this for a spot on  gold colored mirror trim.  It didn't cover at all.  Maybe this is just the wrong product for my needs.",2.0
"I have three tubes of this: a two pack of gold, and a red one. I was disappointed with the red because it was so dark it hardly looked metallic; but I guess color is a matter of taste. The gold is a nice color. My two big issues are that it is hard to control... you can't apply a little bit, or a thin layer. It's there or it's not. My second is the reason I will not buy again. Out of three tubes, with only two uses, two out of three have broken caps.  They were not even in use when they broke. The stuff in the opening dried so hard that I couldn't squeeze or dig it out, and I couldn't access what's lower in the tube unless I cut it open.

This would be fine, if you could use it more than once. But the ridiculous cap spoils the whole thing.",2.0
"This product does not produce a high metallic silver sheen. It is more like a dull silver metal. It's easy to use , but will not look anything like silver leafing.
If you want a higher sheen you will have to use the lacquer based silver leafing paint.",2.0
Didn't care for this.  Came out kind of lumpy and gunky and didn't cover well.,2.0
"I was putting it over stainless steel on a ceiling fixture, and it wouldn't stick. Perhaps it would have had I used acetone on it first, but I gave up.",2.0
Didn't work,2.0
"Could just be all silver rub, but this seems to rub right off our furniture hardware. Ended up spraying with spray paint instead.",2.0
Maybe I did it wrong but I did not get the desired effect that I had hoped for.,2.0
"It's really hard to get this stuff to adhere to anything I actually WANT it on (plastic 3m hooks, light switches, doorknobs, wooden picture frames)... On the other hand, it adheres excellently to skin, hair, fabric, paper towels, shoes, and carpet. It also adheres really well to things that it wouldn't adhere to before, once you give up and change your mind and try to clean it off.",2.0
"When I tried using this for the first time to turn some sanded & cleaned gold-colored knobs into a rubbed bronze color, it didn't work at all. I tried to mix the contents of the tube by squishing it around a bit, but i didn't want it to explode out of the tube when I opened the seal either. When I did open the tube, mostly watery liquid came out, and even after trying to mix the full tube slightly by squishing it around again, I didn't really get it mixed. So I pushed out a lot of watery stuff before it seemed like I got thicker paint (which means i was missing key ingredients). Then when I started applying the Rub 'n Buff on the knobs, it would not cover the surface evenly and it left it grainy/sandy. I think this is due to the lack of mixing, and perhaps using it on a surface it isn't meant for. I ended up removing the Rub 'n Buff with acetone nailpolish remover (worked great), and used a spray instead. Maybe this stuff would work great on something else.",2.0
"It's ""gritty"" and doesn't apply well.",2.0
"I couldn't tell how dark the color was by the name ""Spanish copper."" It was almost black and not a copper color at all. If it had a clear color guide I definitely wouldn't have purchased it. I found out the hard way. Won't do that again.",2.0
It was shipped and received very quickly.  But the quality was off--the product was runny which I have never encountered before.,2.0
"This is NOT transparent. It has a white tint to it that really dulls the color under it. This would only have use if you're gluing two parts of clay that broke apart - and if you do, make sure all the extra glue spilling from the area is cleaned off or it will look terrible!",2.0
"If you could get the kink out of the plastic cable, these would be a good deal.  As it is, you have to work with the curling of the cable which can be tricky knitting in the round.  I will spend my money on more expensive needles that don't fight me like these do.  Disapointing.",2.0
Rreceived needles and was anxious to use them but they are some kind of plastic that is rather hard to get the yarn to move. Have to use my fingernails to push it around to the tips of the needle. Never had tis kind of problem with a bamboo or metal needle set and have knitted for over 40 yrs..,2.0
I was very disappointed in this item. The yarn shredded it was hard to thread them thru because the yarn shredded so easily.,2.0
"This is NOT a Singer brand foot. It is a Tai He foot that comes from Malaysia. It does not fit my low shank sewing machine because it does not have a bar to attach it to the sewing machine. I waited forever and I can't even use it (disingenuous use of the Prime logo, by the way--it takes an extra month to arrive after you order it). Very disappointed. Do not recommend.

Edit: okay, I was able to attach it to my sewing machine after I watched a tutorial on youtube (search for How to Use a Gathering Foot from  Sewing Parts Online). You have to unscrew the shank that you usually attach your presser feet to and then screw this one on in its place. I was able to gather some very lightweight lace, but even lightweight cotton does not gather very well with this foot, and it is not the brand stated in the description.",2.0
Cannot use.,2.0
Fit my Singer Quartet no problem but I can not get it to gather evenly.  No instructions so I watched the youtube tutorial.  I increased my tension and stitch length to the highest possible and could only create gathers on organza ribbon and it was not pretty.  It may work better with practice but I'm ordering a ruffle foot instead.,2.0
"This did not fit my sewing machine at all.  I thought it was a general items that fit most Singers or at least that is how I interpreted this product.  I was disappointed that there was not way to attach to my machine, especially since I purchased it for specific project I had started.  Oh well, back to gathering the old fashioned tried and true way for now.  It did ship well though and it arrived on time.",2.0
"You may get better results than I did, if you already know how to gild.  Mine came out terrible.  I tried following the directions, and I also tried without using the red basecoat (my surface was already sealed).  I got the same results both ways.  One thing that would have been helpful, and which I had to look up online elsewhere, is if the instructions stated that you're not supposed to try to burnish off the extra leaf until you let the size dry overnight.  If you're using this for something like lettering, it will smear.",2.0
"The guide refers to ""wax paper"" and there is none in the kit, if they mean the tissue paper it should say so. Instructions are very vague, it says ""non-porous surfaces MAY need sealing"" I assumed it meant to use the sealer include, which didn't work! I will keep trying, but the Starter kit is not at all helpful to a beginner.",2.0
"I bought these for a rag quilt as well.  1st quilt was great. 2nd quilt however I ran into significant issues. The blades got stuck. i would open/release the handle with my pinky and ring finger. It caused a HUGE amount of strain on my wrist and my hand. It is more difficult to open the scissors than a  normal pair of scissors.. I would guess that the blades get out of alignment, but there is no way to realign them as the whole body mechanism is plastic.",2.0
Broke after just a week of use,2.0
"not as efficient as I had hoped, would not cut enough layers of fabric for rag quilt",2.0
Not very sharp. I was surprised because I usually like this brand. I quit using & put in back of drawer. Don't waste your money.,2.0
Worked wonderful in the beginning but half way through my rag quilt and they started to get a stuck feeling!  Purchase another brand!,2.0
"The spring action, which is the primary reason anyone would buy these things, is extremely bad, lasting only a very short time.  The blades are very sharp, but they do not ""spring back"" after each cut.  As a result, I have to manually open them after each cut, not an easy task when there are not two rings into which to insert fingers.  I saw another review where the person took them apart and reassembled them, but why on earth should that be necessary with a brand new set of scissors, especially ones that are not inexpensive.

Updated 4/2/2017:  I wanted to make some ragged edge baby burp cloths and looked all over for my pair of these scissors, but gave up and bought a new pair.  They lasted through about a day's worth of cutting and then developed the same problem as my other ones.  Maybe there's a reason I can't find them...I might have gotten rid of them.  I exchanged the new pair for another one, thinking they were defective, but after using them for a day, the same problem is developing.  Could be because they are made in CHINA.  Seriously not worth the money.  I am on the lookout for some specialty scissors NOT made in China.",2.0
Didn't work too well,2.0
Color is SO NOT the color pictured. I ordered Pansy which looks like periwinkle or cornflower here but in reality it's like a dark purple grey. Way off.,2.0

Not very happy. These bent under very little pressure.,2.0
"The fan stopped working after 9 months of occasional use.  In fact for the first 3 months I had this, I didn't use it at all.  It got so hot, it lit up in my hand.  Very scary,  It's a nice item, but the warranty is over at 6 months and now I need a replacement.  My old craft heat gun is still going after 7 years.  Definitely disappointed in the quality, but while it worked, I liked it.",2.0
It puts out A LOT of heat but doesn't blow enough.,2.0
"Liked it while it worked, however that lasted maybe 3-4 uses.",2.0
"I've only used this a few times but it overheats very easily and it appears there may be a short in the cord. It heats up quickly, is incredibly quiet which I really like, but when I'm using it and my hand hits the cord near where it attaches to the handle or even if the cord just moves too much at this spot is when it starts to fade and then just stops working, and I need to let it cool down before I can use it again. Clearly not safe to use so I won't be anymore.",2.0
Very upset that this heat tool broke 40 days after arrival but very little usage. If it had broke within the 30 day time period Amazon may have helped issue a refund or replacement but because it is 10 days later they don't even give me that option(that I have found). I used this for sealing paper for jewelry making and it just quit on me right in the middle of a project. Very unhappy with this product.

"Wow - just quit on me. It won't turn on. I've used it several times since I bought it 15 months ago, but not very often. I expected it to last a lot longer!
Until now, I was quite happy with its performance. Sad to lose it. Now what do I buy to replace it? Not the same brand, that's for sure!",2.0
"It worked well for the first month. The second month, the motor would vacillate between high and low on its own (there is no switch). The third month it died completely. I don't know if I received a lemon, but it's too late to return now. I wouldn't buy this again or recommend it.",2.0
I have had this heat tool for about 3 months.  I have used it a few times...not more than 5 or 6 times and always for very short periods of time.  I liked it alot but not anymore.  I took it out to use yesterday.  It ran for about a second and quit.  I tried different outlets (though other things on the same outlet worked fine).  I tried shaking the cord some...no luck.  I have been very careful with it and have never stretched etc the power cord at all. The return policy is 30 days so I'm out of luck I guess.  It wasn't expensive but I would have thought it would work longer than a few short months.,2.0
"LOVE Ranger products and I have seen many videos of Tim Holtz using this heat tool. However, he uses it manly for drying ink. It does a good enough job for that and it IS quiet. I bought it primarily for embossing and I'm sorry to say that it falls short for that. It doesn't even melt Ranger powder let alone any other brands. It helps some to emboss from the underneath side of your paper but often distorts the paper because the gun needs to be no more than 1/2 inch from the surface. It doesn't appear to discolor or burn the paper. My old gun melts in seconds - not this one.",2.0
"I love almost every Ranger product. This heat gun is very quiet, and does not blow the powder around, BUT I cannot emboss with it. It just doesn't get hot enough for most embossing powders.. My old one would blow all the powder off, and was so loud I hoped this would be the perfect solution--but it is not. I am surprised, because so many people recommended it, and Ranger makes such awesome products.  I have to hold it about 1/4 inch from the paper, and I still end up with some powder that will not melt. It doesn't even come close for utee--the utee stays powder, even after a 5 minute warm up. I cannot recommend this for embossing.  Sorry Ranger.",2.0
I have had one of these before and this one does not work properly. When i flip it over you can feel the heat element not working as strongly as my other one would. Very disappointed.,2.0
It doesn't get hot enough to do a good job with embossing powder.  I think I wasted my money on this and went back to using the heat tool I bought at the local craft shop.,2.0
"I purchased this heat tool because I do a lot of heat embossing for my paper craft hobby. I have owned the Zap heat tool, but a friend broke it, so I thought I'd try this one instead. Big mistake: it takes FOREVER to heat even a small area, and that's holding it 1-2 inches from the paper. It never gets red hot inside like my Zap used to get. The only good thing I have to say is that it never blows embossing powder everywhere, that would be impossible. But there's a way to prevent this with more powerful heating tools: just heat it from the underside.
I will soon be getting rid of it because I'm very impatient and cannot take this long to melt powder.",2.0
"I watched videos, read some reviews and didn't think it would be bad. My backup gun burned out (it's used to many things besides papercrafts) and I wanted to make sure I had a backup.  Quiet is good right?  Well, quiet is but I have yet to get the gun to melt embossing powder!  I pull out my Milwaukee (SU) to get the job done.  I'm not kidding when I say I sat there for 2 minutes and it didn't melt any powder!  I timed it.  My other gun did it in seconds.  It works great if you just want to dry your paper but to use to emboss I haven't been able to get it to work.  A waste of money in my mind.  Did I get a bad one?  Are they supposed to be painfully slow?  I will be contacting the company about it.  My recommendation, don't buy this one.  Heck my cheap $15 backup lasted 13 years, at times running for hours to thaw out pipe!  This one, wouldn't thaw out a Margarita in Mexico.",2.0

This might be good for a children's craft but the effort required to knit or crochet this yarn is not worth it.  It took me almost an hour to crochet two rows because the needle kept going between the strands of yarn (yes it's that loose).",2.0
fair quality,2.0
Nice color. Too soft though and too slippery! Its very pretty but hard to work with. Cant wait until my boot cuffs are finished..they better look good!,2.0
"I read a recent review complaining of excessive knotting but I wrongfully assumed it was user error. I have worked with this yarn years ago and there was never a problem with it. Unfortunately this was the first experience I've had with them within the past ~5 years and my goodness. It took me hours to roll this into a ball because of how twisted it all was. Really wish the company read these reviews so they'd know something is wrong with their machine lol
On the bright side, this is a pretty, soft/pastel lavender color that is very soft to the touch.

PS: Not going to buy this brand again. Not worth the time/effort to untangle.",2.0

You cant go by the image colour because this colour yarn never seems to photograph true anyway.",2.0
"I have used this brand yarn before and was okay with it.  But this time I didn't like it.  I don't know if the manufacturer has changed something in the production of the yarn or if I have spent so much time with wool and handspun fibers that I've become a yarn snob.  Anyway, while working with this yarn to make a chemo cap I found the feel of the yarn to be too plastic-y.  It felt stiff.  I hope it will soften after washing.  The color, Neon Pink, was well named.",2.0
"I bought this along with another colour from the same line. The colours are just so pretty! I was disappointed to find lots of fraying and some knots in both skeins. Some were so bad I just had to cut it. Which is frustrating when working on a project! All in all, I'll stick with other brands of yarn.",2.0
"I have used regular Caron yarn before and been pleased, but the Simply Soft yarn plys come apart very easily when I am crocheting. I would not buy again.",2.0
Expect manufacturing defects of yarn that's spliced or frayed. It's tough when you want a perfectly gifted knitted hat and the yarn is cut through hanging on a thin thread. For those advanced beginners or beginners that have little confidence in fixes I'd recommend purchasing at a home store to avoid the unnecessary returns. Perhaps the description of yarn products can put out a disclaimer of sorts?,2.0
"Very disappointed when I received the yarn. The yarn looked old, the yarn that was exposed on the sides of the label was super fuzzy and piling, like it had been sitting on a shelf for years. The color was fine, but it is not useable because of the piling.",2.0
"The first time I bought this yarn, the color did not match the picture at all and I returned it. But this blue is much better. It's still not the same color as the picture...actual color is not quite so bright. But it made a lovely, easily washed blanket for my son. The best thing is to take a look at the yarn you like in person first before ordering it.",2.0
"I use  Caron Simply Soft yarn for its soft, silky texture,  but this skein is none of those. It is more the texture of Red Heart Super saver yarn and that is NOT what I wanted. I ordered several other colors along with this black and they were all what I have come to expect from Simply Soft. I'm very disappointed.",2.0
"PROS:
Soft
Can be affordable when on sale

CONS:
Knots up extremely easily
The yarn splits easily
It fuzzes quickly, making your project look old and worn before you have even finished it
It is thinner than a 4 should be; if you are using it in the same project as other brand 4 weights it will not match
Colors are inaccurate on Amazon",2.0
"I have been using Simply Soft Yarn for over a year now to crochet baby blankets.  I've found most of the colors I've purchased to be exactly as pictured until I purchased the Dark Country Blue.  It looks nothing like the pictured yarn.  The color is actually Navy Blue.  I checked the labels of all the packages and they are marked Dark Country Blue.  I also went to the manufactures website and the color on their website is not the color pictured here.  The color on the manufactures website is the exact color of yarn I received.  I wanted the yarn to make a soft prayer blanket as a gift.  I was very disappointed in the color.

I've purchased the yarn in several other colors that are true to the colors pictured.
Off White
Soft Pink
Soft Blue
Soft Green

I would give the yarn itself 4-Stars as it's easy to work with, soft to touch and has few to no broken/cut yarn in the skeins.  I can't find any yarn brands now that do not have cut, broken or tied yarn in many of the skeins.  I've only found one skein of the many Simply Soft Yarn skeins I've purchased to have broken strands and that was the Soft Pink.

If you have seen the yarn prior to purchase and know what to expect as far as color the 6 oz Skein is a good value.  Just know that some of the colors pictured may not be accurate.  In the future I will order only one skein of a color I've not seen in person before purchasing large quantities for a specific pattern.",2.0

"The color looks different from what's shown in the picture...I thought it's brighter like in the pic, but what I got is a very dark red:(",2.0
"I have to say I was angry when I was crocheting and all of a sudden I ran out of yarn in the middle of the skein...it was cut completely in half.  I was able to weave the other end into the project I was doing and finish the skein, but if I had been making one of the shopping bags that I crochet, I would have had to take it all out and go to another skein.  In addition, there were several spots in the skein where the yarn had ""fuzzed up"" and looked thin, like it was going to split...this occurred on two skeins.  Also, there were many spots in both skeins where the plies bunched up and/or seemed to want to unravel.  I have never had these things happen with other skeins from various other brands in the past, so it surprised me.  The color is very bright and pretty, and the yarn is very soft, but I don't think I will buy this brand again.

UPDATE 4/8/2014:  I have now started on a 3rd skein to finish my project, and *this* one has numerous places where black yarn (I'm using Autumn Red) is tightly wound around the yarn (anywhere from 1/2"" to 1"") as I'm bringing it up!  I've had to carefully cut it away where I could, but some is just too tight against the red yarn.  I tried to access the Caron website listed on the label of the yarn, but it won't come up and there is no phone number that I can find.",2.0
"I love the color of this yarn.  I was crocheting a sweater for my niece and started it with this yarn thinking I had another skein in my crochet tub upstairs ( you know what they say about assuming I assume? :).  When I went to get other skein,it was not to be found (though to this day, I will SWEAR I bought two skeins). I looked in every store around for this color and ended up having to buy online for over twice the price.  Caron Simply Soft is not my favorite yarn to begin with, it separates and I just don't like the finished goods end result.  Lesson learned!  When starting a project make sure I have enough yarn to finish it, PRIOR to starting.",2.0

"I purchased this sewing basket/box to organize and store all of my batteries in, and all the compartments are perfect for that! However, the box is very flimsy. Upon arrival some of the permanent dividers were bent, and one of clasp that holds the cover on to the container in the back of the box were broken, but I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it and having to wait for another one to arrive so I just kept it. It serves its intended purpose, but for the price of this box I suggest that others look elsewhere for something more durable. I probably could have found something that's more durable for less than or equal to the cost of this box at my local Wal-Mart.",2.0

"The paper which fills this ""sketchbook"" is not of a quality befitting the Moleskine reputation, being a plate-surfaced cardstock which looks suspiciously like cheap office-grade xerox paper, peculiarly resistant (because of sizing or some other coating) to ink washes -- not an inviting tableau upon which to work or draw. The design of the book itself, is, however, wonderful; I just wish that the Moleskine company would choose an interior paper that was actually designed for drawing and sketching; this is NOT. (Their regular blank notebook offers a better surface for drawing, though the paper is extremely lightweight.)",2.0
"Other reviewers have noted that this is NOT real India Ink. This is very true, it uses a dye rather then a pigment. Real India ink contains bits of pigment mixed it to make the colour. Why is this so important? Well, fountain pens can only take a dye based ink. Ink that flows like water, and is fluid--most importantly, not an ink in a fountain pen cannot leave residue.

What at am I getting at here? While this sudo India Ink is redesigned for fountain pens, it still leaves residue--and it is not entirely water soluble. While it's not enough to clog up quality pens it can cause damage over time. Staining plastic in converters, clogging feeds and nibs over time. True, fountain pens should be maintained and cleaned regularly, if not taken care of this ink can do some serious damage. Fixing several pins that have used this ink, it takes quite some muscle to scrub off the residue from a feed--especially since it does not clean well with water (water is the first cleaning solution of choice, due to a lot of vintage pens using celluloid plastic).

It's inexpensive, and it does have a deeper black then some other fountain pen inks. But, it's not a true quality ink that should be used. Noodler's will fill the void, or even Namiki ink.",2.0

It uses a lot of yarn so the large size for hats or booties makes the pom pom heavy. As pretty of a pom pom it makes I will not use them again but go back to the old DIY method so that I can run stitches through the center before I cut the yarn loops to have a pom pom that won't fall apart.

even though the article number from clover is the same the text info on the packaging is different, and maybe the sizes have changed and gotten smaller considering my colors are also swapped.  but since i can't use these on my 19mm/US35 needles, which is why i purchased them, they're hardly what i would consider jumbo - especially by CYC standards.",2.0

I use circular needles so perhaps the tension of the needles spurs a release from the close fit. I won't risk using them now because I've already dropped too many stitches because of them.

"I wouldn't recommend this product.  And I paid too much for it.  Not much room for additional needles (although the needles are nice quality), and the lid won't stay on.  plus the ""ring "" through which you'd thread something to tie the Chibi onto your basket/bag is on the lid, and helps the lid to pop off unexpectedly.  Look for a container in another line.  I found a bigger, tight closing/stay closed container at Walmart yesterday.  Half the price, too.",2.0
"The case is lovely, the hooks are quality crafted and comfortable....until.....you have been crocheting for 15-20 minutes or more. That's when I noticed that the hook was short enough to be poking into my hand painfully. I have smallish hands, only 5'3"" and not heavy-set through the bones, and yet, this set of hooks are all too short.  I don't understand why anyone would pay more money so you can suffer while crochet?
Clover makes another set of comfort hooks that are longer. I have two of those. But now I have wasted considerable amount of money on this set.
If you crochet fairly seriously, please buy only one of these soft touch hooks before buying the set. Your hand may be small enough to fit the hook comfortably for long periods at a time.  I wish I had done what I am suggesting.  :-(
Does anyone have any ideas on how I might extend them a bit? I may try a rubber pencil grip on the end. Hope thus review helps you. Happy crocheting!",2.0
This was a big disappointment! The directions are not very good at all. They have different languages that is nice but should be easier to read. Should have made a booklet of the different flowers one can make and how to do it.,2.0
This is too large and too stiff to use on anything but the largest needle. It has not been very helpful,2.0
Did not like the clover pom pom maker at all....the winding part is easy enough.....but its difficult to tie it off tight enough to hold it together nicely.  And its difficult to cut it thru if your scissors are not very sharp.,2.0
"I guess the item description was not clear enough for me to fully understand what these were like. They did not serve the purpose I needed. I haven't been able to use them. I wanted makers for crochet, and bought a knitting supply item that will not convert to crochet.

You can put it on the needle, but it pops right off if anything touches it. I pushed it in really tight, but it still came off when I put it in my basket and just occasionally open it to take other stuff out - it's not like I'm putting it to hard use.

Would not recommend. It's small and didn't cost that much, otherwise I would return it.",2.0
too tiny couldn't think of what you could possibly use those for so I returned them and had no problems,2.0

size 4, 1.25mm
size 2, 1.5mm

small scissors, small tape measure, 2 needles, very nice snap-closure case
The hooks all have a slender (about 3/8"") plastic handle, and a plastic tip-cover for each hook.
The hooks look nice, feel nice, and glide through thread nicely.

Here's the problem:  They are not like any other hook sizes I have.  My Boye size 5 is marked 1.9mm; Boye 7 is marked 1.65mm; Boye size 8 isn't marked with a measurement but it's a little bigger than 7 (who knows why); Boye 10 is 1.3mm; Susan Bates 11/12 is 1.0mm; Boye 13/14 is 0.9mm (I've only used it for #30 thread); Boye 3 is 2.1mm.

I use my #7 hook a lot.  The one in this Tulip set that looked and felt most like it is the #2 at 1.5mm.

I want to be able to see a pattern that says ""use size 10 thread and size 7 hook"" -- and know that when I grab the 7 hook it will be the size I want.  This Tulip Etimo set won't work for that purpose.

I'm going to return these and get the Susan Bates steelite hooks with bamboo handle, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Susan-Bates-Bamboo-Handle-Steelite-Head-Crochet-Hooks-5-50-Size-7/dp/B002XRH14Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Susan Bates Bamboo Handle / Steelite Head Crochet Hooks (5.50"") - Size 7</a>.

"I bought this flower loom yesterday with my 50% coupon at Michael's and after playing around with it for a couple of hours I promptly returned it this afternoon.  I am giving it 2 stars because the idea behind it is great and no doubt it is super-easy to shape the flowers, but beyond that I was completely at a loss. The pegs are too short and the yarn slips off very easily in the middle of your work making it very frustrating.  Also creating the center is not as easy as it seems.  The instructions are all in one color and the pics are not great so you cannot really see some of the small steps you need to really put the whole thing together.  I originally bought it thinking it would be fun for me and my 6-year old daughter to play around with, but will looking into learning how to crochet or knit flowers by hand instead.  I guess if you have alot of patience, give it a try...but make sure you use a coupon!  The loom retails for $20...seems a little much for not a whole lot.",2.0

"I really like using markers that are close to the needle size and just slide along as I knit, to mark each repeat in my pattern. These fit that bill well as they have a few different sizes that work well for different needles, and don't have anything hanging off to get in my way. However, they break FAR too easily for me. I have some other stitch markers that are a harder plastic and none of those have broken, on my current project, I've already lost 3 of these to breakage. And in case you are wondering, I am still using a size that is loose enough to easily slide along my needle, I'm not trying to force them onto a needle that is larger than the marker is, so no excuse for them breaking so frequently. Keep in mind that soft plastic like this does degrade over time so I could have gotten a package that was old, but that still is a risk in buying these again that I would not want to take.",2.0

Clapotis is my purse-project--the one I keep in my purse to do a row or two at a time while waiting for the kids or sitting in meetings. I noticed some cracks in the a few of the markers a couple of weeks ago, and tonight one of them broke. I'm sure it won't be the last. I don't think I'm particularly hard on my markers, and I'm only about halfway through the pattern!

I wouldn't recommend these.

Edit: I finished knitting Clapotis in December, and I didn't have any other stitch markers break in the meantime.",2.0

"I guess it's as good as you'll get for inkjet clear paper, but it's still not good enough.

The paper has a rough surface to get the ink to stick, which means the transparent part doesn't look very transparent.

"I've thrown pottery since the mid 80's, a three gallon jar in native clay is not a challenge.  I considered one of these wheels years ago, but poor reviews warned me off.  After my daughter asked for a wheel and realizing my wheel-building projects had stagnated, I looked again and saw few poor recent reviews.  I ordered one (not from Amazon).  I saved quite a bit there.  The wheel arrived defective and thunked and shuddered at centering speeds.  Inspection showed the wheelhead was improperly cast  and imbalanced, with one side of the underside over a sixteenth thicker than the other.  The rim of the wheelhead is machined, the bottom is not and appears die-cast.  The wheelhead was solidly attached to the shaft, but the shaft seemed undersized and either the shaft was loose in the top bearing or (more likely), the bearing mount screws were loose.  Five minutes is pretty fast for a bearing stack to work loose.

My reasoning was as the defect was obvious, it should not have shipped, and the poor construction was likely to cause issues in the future.  I declined a repair/replacement and opted for a refund.

As this thunking issue has been reported since 2007 in various pottery fora and here on Amazon, I will not buy from a manufacturer that cannot correct its poor design.",2.0

However, once my sculpture was left to dry, after about 12 hours, it was ruined with deep and wide cracks on every side. I knew that the clay was supposed to shrink a small amount but I wasn't expecting it to separate so easily. It's possible that other people with more sculpting experience may know how to prevent this problem but if you're just starting out like me then it may be worth it to consider the alternatives depending on what you are trying to make. I'll have to move on to an oil based clay for my project instead. This water based clay may serve a better purpose for smaller crafts the size of baseball or smaller, anything larger is too prone to cracks and separation.",2.0
"Why would you show a picture of the clay in a bucket then ship it in a plastic bag.. Not happy..

Used the clay for the 1st time last night. It feels very different to work with than kiln clay. Softer and stays wet for much longer. The two pieces have been drying last night and all day on the balcony in the sun and they are getting there.

I wrapped the rest up as carefully as I could so I hope it stays damp.",2.0

Picked these up at the local chain fabric store after the cheaper curved needles I had broke.  I really could only used the smallest needle for stitching the back to the chair I was recovering.  I broke after sewing about a foot of fabric.  I wasn't even using thick upholstery fabric.  Super frustrating.  Now I need another set of needles.  I'm going to look for stronger ones and hope that one day I can finish this chair without buying new needles every foot.,2.0

"I recently started a project that required an upholstery needle (12"") to attach a button for that 'tufted' pillow look. Let's just say, it didn't go well. These needles are tragically dull and unable to pass through muslin or quilting cotton (which is an impressive failure). With quite a bit of force, and bending the needle in the process, I finally got the needle through, but it just wasn't up to the job in the long run.
Maybe I just don't understand upholstery needles, but I was disappointed with these. I don't think I'll be going to these for further upholstery projects.
Needless to say, I love every other Dritz product I own.",2.0

I began the process of return for replacement, which was not offered, only a refund. Problem is the refund amount is only two thirds of the purchase price after shipping, even less with UPS pickup.  I'm keeping the item as it was intended for a gift, but I will have to try finding replacement brushes at the craft store.  So much for internet convenience.  If it was complete, it would be a nice little gift for a young person new to sumi e.",2.0
I send one back because brushes were broken. Brushes are broken on the second set also. Did not want to deal with sending it back again.,2.0

"This is a rubber ring supposedly designed to hold bobbins securely.  Well, I hate to be the one to disagree with the masses here, but this silly device just didn't do the trick for me.
First off, the flimsy rubber ring is very flexible.  In this case, flexibility is not a good thing.  The bobbins are held in very gingerly by the sides of this thin rubber ring, and if one should bend the ring either in their sewing basket or by hand, an avalanche of bobbins will spill  out all over the place and, of course, unravel.
On the other hand, getting the bobbins out of the ring on purpose - on the occasion that they do NOT come shooting out of it spontaneously - is yet another fiasco altogether.  If one should have the misfortune of having stiff fingers, good luck extracting the bobbin you wish to use from this contraption!  Oddly, the bobbins will sometimes fly out of it unbidden, yet at other times they will refuse to budge when one wishes to choose a color.  Very odd.  Troublesome, too.  Who needs the hassle of playing bobbin-roulette when they're in the middle of a sewing project?
I scrapped mine shortly after I got it and went out and bought one of those good, old-fashioned, clear plastic bobbin boxes with the little indentations to hold my bobbin collection.  So much more practical and reliable than this rubber, Frisbee-like object.
Those debating what to do with theirs might consider using it for a dog chew toy, being that it's rubber and donut-shaped.  Your doggie might find some use for it, but you deserve a better container for your bobbins.",2.0
they are dry i will not buy them again,2.0
"Such a nice case, looks-wise.  Organic, wooden, with a nice logo burned in.  But!  I need not only an assortment of pencils in my box, I also like to bring along an eraser, a sharpener, a couple of stumps, etc.  The box is a little too short and a little too shallow to be really practical, even for a brief sketching trip.  I'd love to have one like this but both longer and deeper.",2.0
"My husband mentioned that he needed a box to keep pencils in that he can carry in one of his bass cases.  He writes music and makes notations at lessons, etc. and doesn't want loose pencils rolling around next to his instrument.  I saw this case and thought it looked nice.  It does look nice in the hand but my husband could not get it open.  He had to struggle with it for about 1/2 an hour and he didn't want to force anything.  When he finally got it open, he waxed the edges of the sliding lid to make sure he can open it in the future.  We thought we were home free until he went to put some pencils in it.  It is too short to hold a standardized wood graphite pencil that has only been sharpened once.  I know we should have checked the measurements but when you see an item labelled ""pencil box"" , you sort of expect that a pencil will fit in it.",2.0
"I should not have bought this pencil box. It is very bulky and so does not fit well in my knapsack and I did not read the listed length correctly, so it is not long enough to store drinking straws in, which is what I'm really needed to do. When I run across someone who can use it, I will give it away.",2.0
The lid doesn't fit the best.  Too tight a fit in places and big gaps on other parts of the sliding lid.,2.0
These are good if you do not plan to leave them on for extended periods.  We have at least 10 of them and have had at least 4 fail recently.  They all fail the same way.  The heat travels up the gun and glue starts to come out of the window near the back of the gun... out of return window... not good.,2.0
"We have a timer on the workbench electrical plugs so that nothing can be left on for too long....

"I've had several Hot Glue Guns, and one of the biggest problems is that they break open inside, and fill with glue- which ruins them.
That can be prevented if you let them get REALLY HOT prior to using. I plug this one in, then let it sit for 20 minutes. Even waiting that long to 'Pre-Heat' , you sometimes have to probe the tip with a wire, and  g e n t l y  squeeze out the glue. Once it's working, it works normally, but I think it should be more 'user friendly'.",2.0
Bigger isn't always better I have had this sitting waiting for me to get to using it. I finally test it out just to find out it doesn't work it truly just pushed hot glue back up into itself and out all over my hand. Just a little came out the tip. Yes I left it plugged in for ten minutes so it should have worked. My 15 year old one still works. Hope this helped somebody,2.0
Not easy to use,2.0
"I picked this up after reading all of the glowing reviews,  The one I received worked great until about 1/3 of the way through a 10"" glue stick where the molten glue would start seeping from the feed side.  This make a huge mess and does it's best to fuse the glue stick in the gun for life.  I tried 3 sticks and all three did the same thing.

I really wanted to like this glue gun because when it's working it's great.  When the glue stops coming out the tip but instead comes out the feed side it just isn't worth the trouble.  It could be the glue sticks I was using but I picked up an AdTech Pro100 (60w) and it works perfect with the same glue.",2.0
"I had a Christmas puppet theatre project ready for my young grandchildren and all I needed to finish was to glue the felt puppets and theatre scene attachments together.  I always go to Amazon for product reviews, as I feel they give a more honest opinion than product hype by marketing reps.  Hands down, the reviews for this glue gun outshone every other brand and model, so I was eager to order it along with the Best Glue Sticks.  Unfortunately, the glue gun worked very well for about two hours before completely stopping to dispense glue.  Half a glue stick still remained, so that wasn't the problem, and I thought perhaps I had exceeded the time it worked effectively and only needed to cool down for a while before it would work well again.  I waited until the next morning, let it heat for five minutes, and then let it sit, plugged in, for another 15 minutes and it still didn't work.  I figured the glue was jammed inside the gun, and a neighbor who is also a crafter seconded my opinion.  Since I had procrastinated to do the finishing work until the weekend before Christmas, I rushed out to Michael's and bought their $12.99 glue gun.  It not only worked without a hitch over and over again, even for three hour stints, but it offered the dual heat of this gun at the same temps and also featured the same kind of stand.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.  The Best Glue Sticks worked in the Michael's glue gun and, as the reviews state, were strong and clear and perfect.",2.0
"The product description printed on the outside of the package does NOT agree with the diameter-size of the glue-stick listed on the Instruction Sheet.  It might not matter how ""Long"" the glue sticks are, but the diameter would surely matter? This is our first ""Glue Gun"" and we knew we wouldn't be able to figure out how to use it if we can't even understand the instructions so we sent it back. Too bad we can't find a glue gun made in the USA!?",2.0
The little metal stand was missing when I opened the sealed package. I had to try to make one up or the gun topples over and glue gets all around. The gun itself is pretty good.,2.0
"I do not use this routinely, as in crafts.  I use it only as a ""tool"" to glue stuff together, fill holes, fix loose joints, etc.
For that, it has done well, and  importantly, it is not a ""dripper"".

Recently (last several uses) it heats poorly/erratically, and glue stick doesn't feed properly.  You have to push stick in by hand.",2.0
"I had to contact Plano to get these details:
""The model 964 is only offered as follows: 2 boxes have 6 fixed compartments and 2 have 12 fixed compartments. These racks will accept any of the other 3600 series boxes.""  So the 964 Organizer Rack is only offered with the bottom-of-the-line boxes with the standard latches and fixed compartments.  Their excellent ProLatch boxes with the adjustable compartments must be purchased separately.  I wish that they would instead offer the deluxe version (or just the rack separately), and stop trying to save me a few pennies.",2.0
"The concept for these storage cabinets is very good, but they came shipped with a narrow plastic band circling them from top to bottom that was so tight that it warped the orange outer case.  The top of the case bows down and the bottom bows up.  I purchased 8 of these units and they were all warped.  In order to avoid the inconvenience of returning them,  I was hoping that in time they would straighten out.  Unfortunately after 4 weeks, they are still warped.  I'm keeping them, but the overly tight packaging left me with a damaged product.",2.0
Item was bought for my husband to use for work.  He was looking for something to store screws and small items in his work truck.  The outer red shell is a cheap flexible plastic.  It is not sturdy at all.  The interior boxes are ok.  He said he would use it until it fell apart which should not be very long.,2.0
"As in other reviews, the frame was bent due to the plastic strap being too tight. I thought once might be a fluke so I sent for a replacement. The second was just as bad.  I even tried to let it stand for a few days to see if it would regain the shape but to no avail. The drawers worked fine but the frame is obviously not high quality material. The buyer should be aware of this possibility when ordering. Maybe they'll have better luck than I did but I would not recommend this product.",2.0
Don't work as good as other offerings,2.0

I ordered each color and was very excited to get them. The problem I have is the only color that seems to wash /brush out easily is the white. I used the pink on a white sweat shirt to mark the center for monogramming and thought I was going to have to go buy a new shirt. I had an extremely difficult time getting the chalk off the shirt. I am now very hesitant to use them.,2.0
chalk line is too light. any movement of fabric and line fades even more. back to the clover pencils. they always work,2.0
"It's a wonderful fantastic concept, unfortunately it ONLY works well on heavy very tight knit fabric (where it worked pretty good for the first day), it only worked for a few minutes on fleece and t-shirt material without a ton of swearing and do overs. :( And even then, it only worked so, so. I think it's back to a chalk pencil for me.",2.0
"I have to roll it over two or three times before anything comes out, and even then it's not consistent.  Will not buy again.",2.0
"I've had a great deal of trouble finding a decent marking method for sewing. I usually use the fine-tipped purple fabric pens that fade over a few days. There are times, however, when the purple pen isn't appropriate. On formal fabrics, for example, it doesn't always fade quickly enough, and you really can't spritz silk taffeta with water to remove the marks. And for my students, those pens aren't any good, because the marks will have faded by the time they return for their next weekly class. I usually have them use the blue fabric pens instead, which must be rinsed out with water, but they tend to be rather pale, as if the pens are half dried-out. And again, sometimes you want to use fabrics that can't get wet. Chalk pencils would be great, except that these days, most have an oily base, which stains your fabric. The dry chalk pencils that easily brush off are hard to find.

I'm always on the lookout for a better marking solution, so when I saw the Chaco Liner being used in a couture sewing class I took, I ran to order one. The ""pen"" has a reservoir filled with a fine chalk-like dust (which can be ordered in several different colors) and there's a serrated wheel that distributes the chalk dust when you draw a line. I like how it draws a very thin line, without much effort on your part. It's easy to use, and if you have long sections to mark, like when you're making bias strips, or outlining a pattern, it's great. It's not so good for small things that need to be marked, however, like notches and dots. That's inconsequential, though, because the marks it does make are not easily removable.

I drew a few test lines on some unbleached muslin, then attempted to brush the lines away. It's a fine chalk dust, so it should have easily brushed off. It smudged a bit, but that's about all it did. I tried repeatedly to remove the marks from my fabric, but they wouldn't budge. This is a fail, because I need something that's easily removable, particularly for fabrics that you can't spritz with water.

The Chaco Liner might work great for some people, especially if they have different requirements for their fabric markers. But it doesn't work for me. I'll give it two stars, since I did like how easy it was to draw a straight line with it. Not recommended, unless you're marking something that can be tossed in the washing machine to rinse the marks away. Even then, I would test a scrap of your fabric first, just to be safe.",2.0
I wanted to use this to mark dark colors. But it does not roll over the fabric easily or thoroughly.,2.0
I purchased this for fleece blanket projects and it did not transfer at all. I ended up sending it back.,2.0
"For those of us not familiar with sewing/crafting terms, this liner isn't an actual pencil capable of making dots (which I needed).  A picture of this item without the cap on it would have been helpful to a novice like me.  It's like a little pizza wheel edge that disperses chalk.  I still might be able to use this, and it did work on fleece.",2.0
The pen did not work at all.  Tried it on dark fabric and could not see the line.  Would not recommend.,2.0
"OK beginner machine to learn on - but it's pretty much disposable after that point.  After 2 trips to the local repair shop in 6 months, it still makes strange banging sounds from time to time.

"When I first got this machine it worked very well. After a few projects the tension started to give out. I adjusted and adjusted and I finally got it to sort of work, sort of. Now all the machine does is eat the fabric and leave piles of thread above and or below the fabric, and is even skipping stitches. VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS MACHINE.

Also, the bottom right corner of the pad is bent so many of the pages are creased in the corner. The pad seems to be of good quality otherwise.

"It is a decent little kit, but not worth the $ you pay for it. Little disappointed, could have used more in the kit.",2.0
"I did not read the label fully, I thought I was getting 12 water pencils. Disappointing only 8. My fault for not looking in detail",2.0
"The pattern is printed backward so if you don't realize it until you've already started, it's wrong the rest of the whole sewing",2.0
"it should have been made clear that design is not stamped on the fabric.  just a picture to guess at.  also, the holes are very tiny.",2.0
Good design But poor quality threads.,2.0
Not at all what I expected. Sent it back,2.0
"Instructions are extremely hard to follow. Colors blend into each other and you have to guess where to start each color. Chart doesn't help much, since it's not clearly labeled, and just gives general idea of the colors but not where they begin and end.",2.0
Hated it - way too difficut for a beginner - ended up using the thread for other stuff :(,2.0
"Not used yet, not sure it is suited to what I needed, the length is not suitable on larger blocks",2.0
"I was not expecting a large colored mesh canvas.  I wanted the 14 count closed canvas with a nice graph to show what colors went where.  The colored mesh uses colors that are so close together in hue that it is difficult in good light and impossible in lower light, to tell what color it should be.  The picture is beautiful.  The yarn is packed very nicely and easy to get to but I won't get another kit from Dimensions.",2.0
Canvas broke in the middle after one week. Threat is cheap and hard to work with,2.0
Several thread colors run short and have to be reordered before item can be completed.  Often color changes are not visible from the canvass and have to be guessed at from the diagram.,2.0
Have had good luck with several Dimensions Kits.  This one is way short on some colors of floss.  What a pain to keep having to find color matches.  What happened to cause this ?,2.0
"Work fine, as expected but the DESCRIPTION IS WRONG! This is so infuriating, because the number of each letter listed are wrong and you end up having to buy more if you were going to spell something that had the listed three ""E""s for example. I ended up buying more, but I did so begrudgingly and after this project, I will not be again.",2.0
"Doesn't meet product description of letters in pack. No more than two of each letter. Disappointed because now I am short letters because I calculated 3 of most of the vowels per pack, and there wAs not.",2.0
"Difficult to remove the white letters from the white sheet, causing them to tear, and there were only 2 of each letter.",2.0
"I can't speak to the quality of these letters, as I have yet to use them. I wanted to warn other customers- the DESCRIPTION IS INCORRECT. I ordered these based on the number of letters that were supposed to be included; there are, at most, two of each letter, NEVER THREE. Just be aware!",2.0
Very flimsy.,2.0
"The package does not come with all the letters it says.  Very disappointed, needed those extra letters.",2.0
"If you are tired of counting stitches and using a mag-glass to see your work then a printed pattern is just for you. It is also the prefect project to take on a trip. This design is lovely and practical too. You can follow the color & design pattern or create your own. It is also a great teaching tool. I will gladly suggest the Kitty Pillowcase to anyone. It is colorful,cute and simple to do.",2.0
I bought these to use on custom kydex knife sheaths. They did not hold together very securely. They would pop open and fall out. I ended up using Chicago screws which are more expensive but much stronger. They would likely work for paper craft projects. I hope this review is helpful.,2.0
"Be careful.  These are 5/32""
I needed 1/4"" and these came up in my search.  I missed seeing the size on the pakage.  It was not in the description.",2.0
"Amazon recommend this eyelets for kydex holster with Tandy Leather 1/4"" Black Chicago Screws, but don't compatibles, eyelets are smaller ando don't work together!",2.0
"These eyelets are ok.  If your making something using a plier style hand press they would be pretty good.  If you have an arbor press or are using a hammer set, they are way to thin and soft.  These eyelets would be ok for fabric work, but not anything else.",2.0
"For very light duty applications or apparel , this product is ok.  However, about 10% were damaged and bent rendering them limited usefulness.  The useful opening is barely 5/32 of an inch and the shoulder would easily pull through most fabric with little force.  Definitely a decoration and very light duty low quality product.",2.0
"I have ordered this product before and have been very happy with it.  However, the last package came and the paper backing is horrible to get off.  I followed the directions trying the heating instructions and without.  Neither worked.  Very disappointed in this last order.",2.0
"It takes the print well, good thing it is color fast because you have to soak it and manipulate it quite a bit to get the paper off the back and it never really softened up.",2.0
"I've used this for years and never before have had so much trouble removing the backing even after heating/ironing it as recommended!
I've got about 9 sheets of this to remove and am frustrated at the extra time I'm looking at for this project.",2.0
"It took me two hours to remove the paper from the back of the printed fabric photograph. It was exasperating. I have used the product before and have not had this problem. I followed the instructions with the product, but the paper just wouldn't release.",2.0
"This is the new easy peel paper. Doesn't work....I love the product and have made many gifts with it. Last year had no trouble getting the backing off. This year it's impossible unless you put it in water and scrape it off. This actually is ok....and doesn't diminish the photo, but it was a lot easier when the backing actually peeled off as it was claimed it would. And the warm iron method was useless. Would I use it again? Of course...I'm just older and wiser now",2.0
"When you need it, you have to pay the price......",2.0
"Printed easy in my Epson printer.  Colors were fine.  Major problem was peeling off the backing....some would come off, other parts wouldn't.  You could see what didn't come off from the front not to mention the think, hard feeling of the backing remaining.  I bought several packages of this and have tried two of them.  Both the same.  I will never buy this product again.",2.0
Pages are curled up and do not want to go through printer without jamming it.,2.0
"I was so excited when tthis arrived! However, the sheets were curled up on he edges so when I put in printer it kept jamming the printer. VERY Frustrating!!! What a waste of money.",2.0
I ordered this to replace frayed cuffs on my husband's jacket.....was not the fault of the product just couldn't judge the dimensions and weight...,2.0
These boxes are made a very brittle plastic!  One arrived broken.  I would not expect very long service from these boxes.,2.0
"I did not buy this product on Amazon, but I would buy it on Amazon if it worked well. First of all, let me say that if the product is old, it will be difficult to peel the paper off the back. My experience is about getting the product to work with my printer, an Epson PhotoStylus 200. The instructions say that photo ink is not as brilliant as regular ink, but I'm just trying to use it to print labels for quilts, so I don't need really brilliant photo quality printing, however, my printer uses photo ink, so that is what my labels are printed with. The ink works fine for my purpose, but it is nearly impossible to get this paper-backed fabric to go through the printer without getting skewed or folding along the front edge. So I wasted two sheets before getting an acceptable label. Also, my advice is not to try to use the whole 8 1/2""x 11"" sheet, keep your printing away from the top edge so that if the top edge folds over, you can still have a chance of the printing coming out ok. I hope these labels last a long time without fading because they are quite expensive sheets.",2.0
My qualm with this product is that the lid doesn't stay secured. If its in place where it will just remain then it will work for you but like me i am randomly moving stuff all the time so its a hindrance.,2.0
serves the purpose but plastic cracked almost as soon as I got it,2.0
"Lid arrived cracked and return needed to be shipped UPS and I don't have a UPS DROP OFF facility close to me. Just taking the loss. Otherwise, item works fine though I would not rexommend it for skinny threads: it takes a lot of space for just 17 threads.",2.0
"it was alright and I am using it.  I love that I can see into it, to pick out the color thread that I want.  It could hold more.  The spindles are placed too far apart for the spools.  The engineering is faulty.  The person that invented this is not a sewer.  P. Teitenberg",2.0
"More fitting for a young child too tight for me. Cost me 20 bucks to get them on a fleece, can't use it.",2.0
Paper would not come off back of pictures.  So much for just print and peal.  Soaked in water and rubbed with fingers to try to get all I could off.  Left to dry on granite counter top.  Didn't dry flat.  Was wavy.  I thought I had rubbed off all the paper backing but after dry it was apparent that paper was still on the back of the pictures. Purchased it at a quilt shop and when they saw my pictures they said they had never had my experience before.,2.0
"Other people like this brand but they were awful for me. I have a Kodak Officehero 6.1 printer. As soon as the sheet started going through, and the ink was put on the sheet, it started curling from the dampness -- inside my printer. It didn't even come out. I had to reach up inside my printer to pull it out, and as it curled inside the printer, the ink marked up the photo so it was useless. I'm going back to the first brand I used. I would not recommend this brand.",2.0
I needed to make a large button for HW vanity stool I have reupholstered. Unfortunately the button need to tuft the stool and it broke from the pressure after only one day. Very disappointing.,2.0
"TOO TIGHT!!  Don't bother with the Dritz, which says adult size, but feels like little kid's size. It feels constricting to me and my wrist measures 6 inches.",2.0
Never liked these. Do not know why I ordered them.,2.0
So-So.,2.0
Too difficult to twist in to mattress & not long enough to be effective.  They pull right out.,2.0
I do not like these.,2.0
Bought these for the bed skirt I purchased.  Didn't like the way they worked on the bed skirt.  Because you have to screw them in it was hard to get them & skirt even.,2.0
"I used these to attach arm protectors to my chairs.  It was very difficult to wind them into the chairs.  After a week or so several of them had unwound and were on the floor, a danger to those in bare feet.  The plastic tops are not smooth finished.  I have the abrasions to prove it.
All-in-all a very unsuccessful product.",2.0
they would not screw into the matress. they bent in diffrent places. they would not even go into the fabric,2.0
Tried to use them to secure bed skirt to bed frame They are not substantial enough to screw into plywood backing Have bought these in the past and they worked great These are just too flimsy and light weight to get the job done,2.0
Impossible to get in before they bend.  A waste of money.  Kept because it was cheaper than sending back to Amazon.,2.0
These pins are so small to hold.  They are also very difficult to push in because of the twist.  I think they would tear material.  Would recommend straight pins with wide tops instead.,2.0
"I thought the ""heavy duty"" label would apply to how hard it is to open these snaps.  Alas, it doesn't.  These snaps open too easily.  They need to be a tighter fit.",2.0
"I am not having good luck with them.  You crimp them, they fall off.  They may be HEAVY DUTY SNAPS, to say when you snap them together.  But what HOLDS the snaps on after crimping them is NOT heavy duty and when you go to unsnap, the whole thing pulls right out of the crimp vs unsnapping.  I would give it one star, but maybe, just maybe my application is too thick, but I doubt it, as the post sticks CLEARLY through the hole I made.",2.0
Didn't get Them in black. To expensive to ship back. Figured I could use them some where else. I can get the silver color locally.,2.0
these snaps will not attach using the plier kit that I ordered. so naturally I cannot use the snaps. can't return them either as I opened a package & used one snap.,2.0
This is not Dritz!!  It's some cheap low end product.  This is a clear case of copyright infringement.  Using Dritz as the company to sell garbage is fraud.,2.0
These snaps are not any different than snaps found anywhere else other than they are black. The snap action is not any tighter than snaps I bought at WalMart. I needed black - thats what I got.,2.0
"I liked it at first, but now it's a love/hate relationship. I've had issues with it coming out, then all of a sudden it spurts out a huge glob of it. I've started using sticky circles on the back of photos and have been using this less.",2.0
"These don't seem to make it through the wash with out coming undone. I guess if you don't wash your pants these would work ok, but if you don't wash your pants you probably don't care if they are buttoned either.",2.0
Not all of the buttons worked... as in they would fall off of the piece that is supposed to hold them on,2.0
These work but frequently come apart. Order some super glue with it and it still probably hold forever.,2.0
"Since there is no seller feedback all I can do is write a review. I did these for years but ""cannot for the life of me""see what Im doing. I can't see the pattern. Can I return even though I attempted to start it?This is very unusual. I even played with the lighting to no avail. Sorry..I can't use this.",2.0
Cool design but NOT a easy one. Should be leveled up the pattern is not on the screen,2.0
Not good. Disappointed,2.0
Very pretty piece but I didn't read it well enough and I don't do cross stitch and t his one has all cross stitches...,2.0
"I am very disappointed . it is NOT counted cross - IT IS Stamped Stitch  -  picture is drawn on the fabric , and too bad that it is not in the description , even in the photo image is different from the site , this is the most terrible my purchase.",2.0
TOO HARD TO DO GAVE IT TO MY GRANDAUTHER,2.0
"Package was missing one needle. This is not an easy cross stitch design. Also, the material is very stiff and difficult to work with. The threads were separated which is nice.",2.0
I love the colors of this cross stitch but actually I hate the pattern it is really difficult to sew with this kind of material !,2.0
I liked the kit was very disappointed that there was not enough thread in a number of colors. I have been doing this type of needlework for years and have never run out of thread like this.,2.0
"I was disappointed when I saw it, it is very difficult for me because I am a beginner , not printed. Really it's poor puss.",2.0
"I'm going to keep it and try to do it, but wow I underestimated the size of the squares! Not for the faint of heart, for sure!",2.0
"I ordered this to keep busy on a trip. Although it said the needle was included, in actual fact it was not. Therefore the entire kit was a waste for that application. Still haven't started it because I've got to find a store that sells needles",2.0
"Perhaps I made a mistake by ""assuming""  that the picture would be stamped on the cross stitch fabric and it is not. It is a very intricate pattern and just over whelming to even think about.  I probably won't even do it.",2.0
"This is some of the worst embroidery floss I have ever used. I'm a fairly experienced crafter and I'm not rough with my materials, but when I tried to separate this floss into plies for a cross stitch project, the strands caught on each other, tangled, knotted, and broke. It might be okay for practice or for a project that doesn't mean a lot to you, but if you don't want the cloth peeking through your stitches, I would recommend spending the extra money to get a higher quality floss.",2.0
I've been purchasing this brand of thread for years but I'm not satisfied with this purchase. I don't know if it's a bad batch but this thread knots easier and tangles easier than before. I don't know if they've making the thread differently but these quality is not consistent to what I'm use to with this brand.,2.0
Nice colors but the floss tangles easily.,2.0
This floss is very difficult to separate.  I have never had floss like this before.  It ends up in knots.  Will not reorder,2.0
"Super thin and cheap fabric. I always purchase my string directly from Mexico. This time I tried Janlynn instead and the material is so cheap that it easily breaks, esp. if you cut long pieces at a time while embroidering. Will never by this brand again.",2.0
The thread is broken in at least one place in nearly every skein.  The thread does not separate well for cross stitch use.,2.0
I purchased the thread for a project that specified DMC thread colors.  The chart supplied by Janlynn did not have a translation to DMC for the colors in this package.  It was very disappointing as this is my first project where thread was nit included.,2.0
"I bought this for my wife for Christmas, along with a variety of other floss (DMC brand.)  While the price is right on this value pack, it is definitely lacking in quality.  She breaks the thread nearly every stitch with this floss, while having no problem with DMC.  I will say that she hasn't had as many problems with another pack of Janylnn (color variations), but this particular one is not worth it.  Spend the extra 5 bucks on DMC.",2.0
"I've purchased maternity panels at a sewing supply store in the past.  They were circular, simply sew to the top of whatever garment, no need to do any other waistband.

Looks bad.",2.0
"It's my fault for not reviewing with posting, this poster is not 36 x 24 and you will have to spend a great deal of money for a custom frame, not worth it, the appearance is okay, and I plan on buying another poster (36 x 24) and display it, upset the poster is not a true size, really wanted to display it, I'm a big fan of the Rat Pack and that period, would reconsider purchasing again in true size, would not recommend unless you plan on investing in a custom frame",2.0
Was not true to size. I had previously bought a 24 x 36 frame before this arrived and now had to spend an extra $35 for a mat to make it work.,2.0
"The picture came right away.  However, it was not a clear picture.  It was very blurry.  Looked like a bad faded cheap copy.  It looks nothing like the advertised picture.",2.0
These are not comfortable to use for long periods of time.,2.0
The tape doesn't come of with ease. - keeping using the wrong side - the correct side needs to be more defined.,2.0
Really does not work if it rains so maybe it should be called only sunny days outdoor coating.,2.0
"Not very easy to use with paint!

"They were to small for my needs, I like a longer pin.",2.0
"I didn't realize how small the heads of these pins were even though many reviews posted before mine talked about the size. I decided to post a picture so people could really see the scale. In the picture, the Wright glass head pin is on the left and a regular ball head pin is on the right.

I tried to use the Wright glass head pins for blocking knitted dish cloths; the pieces I blocked were wet and the pins rusted, staining one of my finished objects--which I had intended as a gift but had to keep instead. I would not purchase these again.",2.0
these pins are filmsy not strong enough,2.0
small and unable to return,2.0
not worth the money,2.0
I was disappointed with these pins. Several of them had no heads & they are somewhat dull.,2.0
"of the few I have used, they are not very sharp.",2.0
i wouldn't buy it again,2.0
Pins are only marginally sharp,2.0
"These things bend as soon as you try to push them into a wall. Also, the round tips break off so easily.",2.0
"Right length for my needs, but glass heads are way too small for easy grasping.  Threw them away.",2.0
Very cheesy and flimsy. Even in the cheapest of pins you don't see pins bending. Would not recommend. Also very small,2.0
"The heads on these pins come off very easily. They're also very tiny. Too tiny for my old, arthritic hands.",2.0
These are not very sharp and difficult to place in delicate fabric.,2.0
Pins have very very small heads......,2.0
write number,2.0
"These pins aren't nearly as sturdy as they need to be. Several have bent when asked to pin heavier material such as fleece and terry. They now have their own pin cushion so I don't accidentally use them. They do, however, distract my daughter when I'm sewing. She arranges and rearranges them in the pin cushion, and many of the patterns she creates are quite stunning (the glass heads are quite pretty)- not functional, but they do serve a purpose in our home.",2.0
The pins are fine but how to get into the package?  I tried everything to try to keep the package as there isn't any box included to hold them.  It took me numerous attempts to get to the point of literally scissor cutting the top just to get them out! Good grief make them user friendly for arthritic hands! Nuff said!!,2.0
"I also found that once you've attached the foot, and put the shaft down on the fabric, it is crooked.  Same problem as mentioned before with the foot being too narrow and does not feed straight on the fabric... It kinda pulls sideways.  Its such a pity that the design does not work at all, because having a narrow foot like this is perfect for zippers and piping in theory.  But in reality it does not work well at all",2.0
"Zipper foot works, but when I got it it was completely lopsided and it still is. It doesn't sew completed straight and it's off-center.",2.0
It's a great foot but sadly didn't fit my sewing machine. :(,2.0
IT WAS TO LARGE A PROJECT AND I LOST A LOT OF MONEY BY RETUNING IT,2.0

"Cracks badly, not sure, but I must have bad brick of this clay.",2.0
hard to work with,2.0
"Pros:
1) fast shipping
2) dried over night
3) easy to work with

Cons:
1) shrunk, more than I expected
2) so many cracks- unbelievable
3) it's not white- not even off white- it's creamish gray

You can't get elegant results w this clay!",2.0
This is advertised as white clay and when it arrived it is actually a brownish grey color.  Not what we thought we were getting and we cannot use this now.,2.0
not pleasant to work with.  Tendency to crack and break when drying.,2.0
"I was extremely disappointed because the clay was so nice when I started, I loved the color and it was easy to shape, but once it dried- it shrank significantly and cracked apart.",2.0
This clay was not white as shown which males it hard to color and it cracked when dried.,2.0
"Did not like this clay. Bought it for my son's footprints. Says white (I wanted white, and first footprints I made was very nice white clay), but in reality it is pretty much gray. It took forever to dry. And it shrinked, which made it it look ugly and not flat. I don't know maybe it is good for something else, but I will not buy it again.",2.0
"Bought it in a physical store near me. The clay starts to harden too fast to make fine moulding, and the clay seems to srink quite a bit when used, and since I used it on a project with other materials, I had to use something else to fill out the gaps and cracks it kept creating.",2.0
"Read the reviews and wasn't so convinced with some of them. I still decided to buy the clay because I needed it asap for my son's school project. Shipping was fast ordered on a Wednesday and received it by Friday, the quality was ok. We made a model of a great white shark and left it out to dry staring Friday. The next day we woke up to find cracks and like the clay had shrunk. I had left over clay and repaired the cracks. Saturday afternoon we had the same issue again. I repaired it and left it over night to dry so we could begin painting the next day. Woke up Sunday morning to find even more cracks and huge gaps in between. My 6 year-old was so bummed and thought that he wasn't going to be able to turn in a project. I used gorilla glue and added a bit more clay and prayed that it wouldn't crack anymore. We painted the shark and let it dry over night. the next day we found minor cracks and just had to use that. I wouldn't buy this type of clay anymore.",2.0
Way harder to work with than I expected.,2.0
"For years I have used Crayola's air dry clay to make children's handprints, but it seems that they have discontinued their product. Instead, I gave this brand a shot and was very disappointed. The consistency of the clay is much more sticky and difficuly to work with. It doesnt come in a resealable container to store any leftover clay. It also dries a gross grey color, rather than white, as the crayola clay did and we had several projects crack while drying.",2.0
"Bought for my 4 year old to craft with, to switch things up Play doh - unfortunately it is far far far too messy and stains your hands like crazy. Maybe for outdoor play.",2.0
"It was easy to use and fairly inexpensive, but when it dried there were tons of cracks.  I let it air dry overnight in 70 degrees, so no excessive heat that should have caused this many cracks. As you can see in the picture it's not 100% dry yet and there are still tons of cracks - there will probably be more as it continues to dry.

Other reviews mentioned how gray it was.  It is gray, but dries fairly white. So no issues there.",2.0
"Wouldn' recommend if you're trying to do anything worthwhile.  The clay cracks and then cracks some more.  When you try to fix it, it cracks some more.

Maybe a non-air dry clay would be better, but trying for days on end to work with this stuff tells me I don't want to even try.

I tried light applications; heavier ones and got pretty much the same result.  Ended up tossing about half the package.  Just not very good.",2.0
Doesn't dry white!,2.0
Shrinks a lot. Really sticky when using it.,2.0
"The clay was not white actually, it was tan.  I was using it for a project with my students and by the time I got it, it was too late to do anything. I ended up having to buy white spray paint in addition.",2.0
"Advertised as white and is light gray. I had no use for the gray one, other than that you can work with it but remember it's paper base and the end result will be flimsy.",2.0
"Worked fine for kids project, but i would not use it for my jewelry (which I thoiught I might).  I thought it would be more white in color like the picture, but it's brown.",2.0

The tape is not adhering like it should. I've used fusible web many times so iron settings are correct.  Won't buy again.,2.0
"Never used it, still sitting in my sewing room.",2.0
"I was using this to make some replacement quilting squares; to fold over the edges and secure them to make stitching easier. Well, this fusible didn't ""fuse"" very well to the fabrics (100% cotton) after ironing. It would stick on one side, but not the other. I ended up having to do needle turn technique to add my patches, since this ""fusible"" didn't work well. I guess I should have only purchase one instead of 6!! Hopefully, it will work better for your projects than it did for mine.",2.0
"I do a lot of quilting and wanted to do a celtic design which called for bias stripping.  I needed the 1/4"" webbing to adhere it to the blocks till they could be sewn down.  IT DID NOT WORK!  The adhesive did not stick to the bias tape and therefore was useless to my project.",2.0
"The mat and guide are great. Nice big surface area. However, the rotary is terrible. It worked the first few passes and then was so dull it wouldnt even cut through a single layer. The rotary itself seems very cheap. I had to use so much pressure that the blade would start to bend. Very disappointed in that. On my way to the craft store to buy a better quality rotary.",2.0
The blade does not cut,2.0
"The mat and the ruler are just fine and work as intended and have held up very well to the use and abuse of cutting.
The rotary cutter on the other hand has started to fall apart, the blade is sharp but it doesn't stay in place any more and shifts around all over causing inconsistent cuts and sometimes doesn't even cut or it rips the fabric due to binding. The little measly screw that sets the blade in place has lost its ability to both hold the blade in place or stay tightened in general. No loctite would not help and should not be needed! So I would highly recommend the mat and the ruler but save up some money and buy a real rotary cutter that can take the abuse of everyday cutting simple fabrics. (A quick note this rotary cutter was not used in any improper ways or even on thick or tough fabric, it is just plain Chinese made garbage.)",2.0
"Spring broke after cutting only about 20 small pieces. This means the safety remains engages and the blade won't lower. There are no screws to fix myself and take apart which is what I would like to do. Up until it broke it's the best I've ever used! Super sharp, precise and liked the safety guard.",2.0
"This review is on the product only!  Right out of the package, it did not cut any kind of materiel.  The blade is not sharp.  I wish I did not purchase!",2.0
"this rotary blade was purchased to use on fabric as you would any pinking shears but it is not the same cut as scissors and not as sharp as I hoped. When I was cutting the fabric it was necessary to press down very hard in order to get a complete cut across and still each time there was a small area not cut. I will try another brand next time.  I have cut with this blade but not washed the fabric so I'm not sure if the fabric will fray or not.
Changing the blades was very easy, no problems with that.",2.0
"In an effort to save money, I opted to order this set instead of the individual pieces of another brand that were reccommended by my fave quilting blogger, thinking ""how much difference could there be?"" While the mat is fine, the ruler is NOT intended for quitling (perhaps its for paper cutting) and is a pain to read. And you would be better of using a steak knife to cut your fabric than this thing. In the end, I bought an Olfa cutter and ruler, which I should have done from the get go. Spend a little extra and make the investment in a good cutter and ruler, you will not regret it. Two stars because the mat is okay.",2.0
"Dosen't fit my Fiskar Rotary cutter very well, but is usable.  Would not purchase again.",2.0
Don't get me wrong! I like it but it's a little too small not wide enough and when you start to cut on it it slides around need some kind of rubbery something on the bottom so it prevents it from sliding around makes it very hard for me.,2.0
"This worked just okay during the first use, then I noticed the blade felt very dull right after, even though it was only used to cut medium weight cotton.  After I went to try to switch the blade, the bolt inside was cracked and could not be placed.  Unfortunately since this happened after the return period, I'll just have to throw it out and purchase a new one.  This time I will try a different brand since the quality really disappointed with this one.",2.0
"Mat and rotary cuter work great.  Don't buy this set if you need a ruler that is 6 inches wide.  The acrylic ruler I received is 6.5X24, not the 6x24 described.",2.0
I am wondering what the size of this blade is. I have bought a 65mm before and it wasn't big enough. My current blade measures 2.5 inches across..,2.0
"It's supposed to be self healing, it's not healing itself at all",2.0
It is a wavy cut and not like when I use pinking shears.  It was also difficult to put it onto my fiskars rotary cutter.,2.0

"I thought this was a blade for a rotary cutter, but it is for scrapbooking.",2.0
"Edit: contacted amazon and looks like they updated the images.

Wrong pictures! If you're looking for the one pictured above search for the titanium softgrip rotary cutter! This isn't the cutter you're looking for! Moderately disappointed, and you don't seem to be able to return the item.",2.0
Does not cut through 2 layers of fabric.  Not what I'd hoped for.,2.0
"This blade works great, however, when I ordered it as the description states, they are ' 45mm Pinking Rotary BLADES', not a single blade. I was quite upset to pay as much as I did for a single blade. Don't be fooled by the description, as it is not plural, you are paying for ONE blade!

The quality is no better than any others out there as far as rotary blades go, and certainly not worth the extra cost. I would recommend one shop around for a better price and certainly ASK about how many you are buying before you order them!",2.0
once again I learn the hard lesson- You get what you pay for.  This set was inexpensive but it is of poor quality.  The rotary cutter will only cut thin fabric,2.0
"The blade is not sharp enough to consistently cut even 1 layer of cotton fabric without multiple rolls.  I ordered this blade,. which fits the rotary cutter from Fiskars, to help keep my cut fabric from fraying out.  Even as a decorative cutter, it is a disappointing tool, since multiple cuts make the cut unattractive.  I love the idea of a pinking rotary blade, but need the reality of a tool that cuts consistently and cleanly.",2.0
"I usually use Fiskars blades, so I was excited to try a new project with this decorative blade. But it did not last long at all. I only cut about 2 yards of fabric and it was not working well.",2.0
got dull very quickly.,2.0
I returned it because I found one much cheaper at Walmart. Downside was paying return postage which still resulted in a savings from the original purchase price.,2.0
My board is not flat,2.0
"I firmly agree with others that FISKARS makes the best products available since I own many of their products and have found them to be superior to all others. However my experience has been with this particular series of scissors is that they do not meet the standards that I typically expect of their products. I purchase this in 2013 and it has been being used on and off during that time in the kitchen.  However I found that the spring that opens the wings of the scissors and the pivotscrew are of made of a material that rust.  This version doesn't have the titanium coated blades. The phillips pivot screw is basically not adjustable any longer due to erosion of the screw. The tip of one of the blades has broken off by unknown means, I am not the only user.  I  do plan on replacing them since I see they have had design changes.  I will let you know what I find.",2.0
Love the scissors.  Mine came with a dead area in the blades when cutting.,2.0
No better than the regular fiskars for the price,2.0
"Its ok, not very sturdy and comes apart when i'm doing big jobs. Doesn't really cut the fabric on the first pass. i have to go through it multiple times and end up going off. Looking for a better alternative to use with my new cutting mat.",2.0
Worked great the first couple times I cut fabric. The blade is very sharp which makes cutting a breeze. After my first 2 cuts the whole thing came apart. The blade fell off and needed to be all out back together.,2.0
I assumed this Cutter would work on outdoor material since the description says it will cut through vinyl.  I had to roll the Cutter back and forth to get it to cut any of the material and then I had to use scissors to finish the job.  Maybe I was expecting too much but my material was nowhere near as thick and stiff as vinyl.  It did cut thin material easily.,2.0
"Because of the hub in the middle, the mat is slightly bowed and can cause an inaccurate cut. It would be a better product if the mat had a firmer construction.",2.0
"the lock to keep the metal cutter down, does not stay",2.0
Went dull within two months and I only used it a handful of times on cotton material,2.0
I really loved the bundle a lot and it was like magic to me but I gave it 2 stars as I am not a professional user and I used the rotary cutter few times and when I left it a month not using it and tried to use it again I found it not cutting any fabric at all. the blade is not working anymore! :(,2.0
"The blade is nice for reducing burrs for paper cutting, and the retracting button is nice to have to keep the blade encased and safe. The blade gets a little dull for cutting paper after a few uses and requires a little more pressure and extra passes to complete the cut. Although it's still sharp enough to slice a piece of my thumb off after it jumped off the straightedge. Overall I give this cutter a 3/4 thumbs up.",2.0
Worked well until I had to replace the blade.,2.0
"I have some osteoarthritis in both hands and was hoping these would help with various cutting tasks.  They do work well, however, the orange clip that holds the scissors together broke in half after a few weeks of very light use.  Disappointing really.  The scissors still function, but I have to use a rubber band to hold them closed now, which sort of defeats the whole purpose of making cutting easier.  Fiskars usually has quality products, and I own a few.  This one is just okay.",2.0
"As a sewer and crafter, I generally love the Fiskars brand. Thinking these scissors would be comfortable, durable, and easy to use, I happily purchased a pair. However, I have found they're blade isn't as sharp as I'd like and the orange latch broke on my first pair. The store kindly exchanged the scissors for a second set; however, the second pair didn't cut any better than the first! I also had issues with the spring and latch on the second pair. These were dedicated to my sewing and storing scissors that won't close in my sewing box is like reaching in and stumbling across a katana. They were mediocre at their best and quickly transformed to inconvenient and retired. Will still try other Fiskars products, but likely won't have another pair of these.",2.0
"doesn't work as described can not returnable.
too much effort to contact customer service to return this item.",2.0
Item was broken when arrived,2.0
it said it came with 5 blades and it didn't,2.0
"Rotary cutters are great, but got mine today and there are no extra blades.  Description of product says comes with 5 blades.",2.0
the rotary cutter did not cut at all............,2.0
"I have had a Fiskars rotary cutter before.  This one I received today is very dull...I tried to cut through one thin sock and iy took multiple rolls to cut iy.  No sure what is going on.  Going to have to go get a different blade.  And yes, it's in the cut position.",2.0
Didn't work for my purposes. I had a hard time keeping the blade straight while cutting paper. Reverted back to my exacto knife and metal ruler.,2.0
Doesn't seem to cut well at all...Perhaps I'm using it wrong. Went back to using scissors instead.,2.0
"This worked really well when it was working, but within 6 months of occasional use every piece has fallen off. Will not be buying again!",2.0
These work great and they come in a nice case. But my beef is they are oiled so when you take one out you might actually be getting more than one. They stick together and they're very difficult to get apart.  I couldn't figure out why I was getting double threads after cutting my paper and it was because I had three blades on at once. You cannot easily tell that you selected more than one blade. I they need some sort of paper in between them so you can pick them apart.,2.0
"The blade constantly pops back into the retracted setting while in use, whenever heavier pressure is applied. Super annoying.",2.0
"Unforunately, I bought a cutting tool, and will be returning, I need perforating tool.",2.0
"The first inch of the measure, the portion covered by metal, is short by a quarter-inch and is therefore not fit for purpose.  Yes, it is still usable; it is just annoying to work around this fact.",2.0
Chinese cheap measuring tape... the ink runs when i touch it but i only need it for my arms so i don't mind.,2.0
It took several weeks to arrive... close to 2 months. Not a bright pink as pictured. More a dusty worn out pink. Otherwise it measures fine.,2.0
"I was hopeful after the first 3 cuts but after that the cutter didn't cut thru the fabric, not even with a lot of back and forth or harder pressure. I wouldn't recommend this product unless 3 cuts is all you're after (sarcasm).",2.0
poor quality and stiff scissors.,2.0
Cut okay but  the outside of blade was ground off on both sides. Poor quality,2.0
"I am giving this product 2 stars only because it was neatly and promptly shipped and well designed for a comfortable grip. However, the blade only stayed sharp long enough to cut 3 cotton t-shirts into strips. After that, even ""sawing"" with it does not result in a cut. I will be returning this product tomorrow.",2.0
"overall length may be almost 28"" but zipper length is only 26"" - I could have bought this at my local fabric store and saved shipping charges.  Now to figure out how to handle the 2"" shortage from the zipper I am replacing...",2.0
"The zipper I received was not a separating zipper.  As it turnedout, I was able to cut off both ends and use it in another garment.",2.0
"Liked it pretty well at first, and ergonomically, it's better than their basic one. I don't notice my hand hurting any more since I upgraded from the basic... BUT then it broke after 5 months of use. With any pressure applied to the blade on my cutting mat, it pops back into the safety position. Can't figure out how to contact the seller through Amazon, so I guess I'm stuck with a broken cutter. Switching to OLFA to see if theirs are better.",2.0
More attention to the color I ordered wouldve been nice.,2.0
Smells really bad.,2.0
I bought this for cutting fleece for a no-sew blanket.  Didn't do the job.,2.0
Blade got dull very fast,2.0
Needed blades. They work ok,2.0
"Disappointed in this Fiskar product. Bought it to cut cleanly through fairly thin cotton flannel fabric. Unfortunately one part of the blade is dull, so as I roll it one area is always not cutting properly. This area is repeated as I roll down lengths of fabric. Doesn't make for clean cuts, and I have to go over the same place more than a time or two to actually get the fabric to part. I'd return it but it's not worth the effort, and I threw away the package. I've always been happy with Fiskar products, but this one was cheap and dull. Not happy.",2.0
"Very flimsy, fiskars do not cut material unless I'm not using them properly.",2.0
"Ok, I am a new quilter, first time user of a rotary cutter so maybe I am doing something wrong.  After reading reviews, plus the price was right I purchase the Fiskars 45 cutter.  I am disappointed: 1. the release button is easy to hit while pressing down cutting, very frustrating. 2. I could not get a good cut through more then 1 layer of material. I ended up using scissors.

Sorry Fiskars, I know the products you make normally are quality, this one was not.",2.0
"made stuff grey n smelly, not black. probably made of yucky chemicals-- check out this link:[..]

Cuts really well. .. however I didn't  even finish one blanket before it completely fell apart... extremely dissapointed. It appears fixable but looks like a piece must have fell off while working and I cannot find it... what a bust. Just hope that my toddler doesn't find it first.,2.0
It went dull really fast and would pop apart when pressing hard.,2.0
It wasn't what I expected.,2.0

Doesn't really work washes out very fast. Just want your money.,2.0

This product unfortunately would not even cut through the thin printer paper the packing slip was printed on. Jammed half the time and it didn't even cut all the way through the paper the other half. Cheap product.,2.0
More pinkish purple than straight up purple.  I will probably get it from a fabric store in the future..,2.0
"I was a bit disappointed in that it didn't cut the knit tshirts thru. It was as though part of the wheel was dull. I used a fiskar large cutting board and as I pushed across the t shirts I was cutting thru, there would be 2 -6 spots that were not cut cojmpletedly thru. I had to cut those parts with scissors, which took more time.  I was cutting through each tshirt to get a section of the design and wording.  It may have been that this works great on woven cotting, but not a cotton knit t-shirt, which is what I needed to cut.",2.0
"I got this to round the corners after I trimmed my Crystal Visions Tarot deck.  It's pretty simple and easy to use.  Some of the corners didn't turn out as nice as others but the scissors took care of that.  I love my deck so much better now that I have gotten rid of the borders.  I think that although the medium rounder worked fine the smaller one might have worked a little better because a little bit of the wording was trimmed off on the High Priestess card.  No matter I still am happy with the results.

Update:  While trimming my 4th deck the corner puncher has started to jam so badly I'm afraid I will not be able to finish my deck.  Once I get through it I will toss this in the trash where it belongs.",2.0
I'm actually really disappointed. It's not the same rotary cutter in the picture and the blade went dull on the first use. Fiskars you're better than that :(,2.0
"Attempted to dye my preschooler's tightie whities since blue is his favorite color and it is next to impossible to find a pack of solid colored undies. The dyeing process wasn't too bad, except that it took forever to rinse the dye out. Before washing they were a dark blue, not royal blue but acceptable. After washing they turned periwinkle. Luckily my kiddo still likes the color.",2.0
"I tried to dye a pair of denim jeans that were just too faded, more gray than blue.  Left them in longer than suggested but they are still not a denim color, more of a grey/blue color.

Smaller in width and thin material. Would not buy again.,2.0
"Tried to dye a faded black hoodie I had back to its original black color. Followed the instructions to the T. Literally no change in color whatsoever.

"Flimsy, fell apart quickly.",2.0
"I bought this because it was well-reviewed and a best seller.  I'm quite disappointed in it.  The whole cutter felt flimsy in my hands.  I used it to trim paper overhang when I made a notebook.  It would not cut the papers and just made a huge mess with lots of bits of shredded papers everywhere.  I rolled it up and down the paper against a metal ruler, as I've seen this done in various Youtube videos with great success.  Alas, this cutter was not successful for me.",2.0
I used this to cut a single and  a double layer of thin cotton fabric and it just didn't work well for me.  I was disappointed with this product.  It seems that the blades dull very quickly.,2.0
Too lightweight.,2.0
"There are no dimensions listed for the cutting mat however, based on the grid of the mat pictured, I expected a 12x18"" mat.  What I got is a 8x8"" square.  The larger mat pictured is sold by itself for about a $1.50 less than the price of this set. I'll probably keep this, I'm sure I'll get some use out of it but I still have to buy another mat.  I shouldn't have to ""research"" a product  before purchasing on Amazon.  I count on you for that...that's why I have Amazon Prime!

"I received my Fiskars cutter a few days ago and I have been having trouble cutting fabric with it. Apparently the blade is not sharp enough in some parts so it doesn't cut properly. When I cut several strips of the same length they don't get cut in the same part. I have to press very hard to get it to work well. Besides that, it is comfortable for my hand, I like that.",2.0
"I use a Clover pressure-sensitive rotary cutter.  Fiskars blades do not work well in the Clover cutter, though they appear identical to the ones from Clover.  Perhaps the difference is that the Fiskars blades are made in China and the other blades are made in Japan.  Despite the high price of rotary blades, I simply gave these away and got the good ones (which do work well in the Fiskars cutters!)",2.0
"I followed the directions perfectly, and it turned out purple. Maybe because the material I was dying was a blend?",2.0
Not very strong.,2.0
"I followed the instructions very closely.  I even tried the vinegar solution after to ""seal"" the color.  The product seemed to work very well at first but after a couple of hand washes (cold water, no drier), my shirt looked exactly as it did before.  The exact same faded black old fabric look came back.  This does not last at all.",2.0
"I liked this cutter at first, but after a few uses the blade seemed to be kind of dull, as stated in other reviews.

I planned to use this cutter to cut drawing paper into smaller sizes, since the paper trimmers on amazon were expensive and did no have consistent positive reviews, but the cutter could not even cut through a few stacked pieces of printer paper unless it is rolled over several times like a pizza cutter.

I have not used it for fabric (I assumed this was the intended use) so I do not know how well it performs since the paper may have dulled the blade.",2.0
The blade skips while cutting. Waste of money.,2.0
"The blade assembly frequently falls apart during use. It's serviceable, but I consider this a safety issue, and wouldn't buy again.",2.0
"I tried this on a small piece of nylon I wanted to dye black, and it tinted it purple...
This was just a removable strap, so I could get an idea of how it would work.
I heated the water up, but it just didn't take well.

There is still enough left to attempt the item I want to do (LBV vest), but I'm not sure if I should bother. I'd rather have an ugly CP pattern, than a tinted purple CP pattern :3

I may try again with hotter water, and with a bunch of vinegar to help it bite into the fabric.

It was 3 bucks, so it's not a total loss.. But i'm still frustrated. It's drying now and I made a bit of a mess.",2.0
"Really liked this fabric cutter at first, but before I finished cutting fabric for a quilt, it fell apart.",2.0
"I replaced a Clover rotary cutter with this one and it is just okay.  The button to open the blade works well.  The problem is the button to close the blade is right where my thumb is when I am using the cutter (I am right handed).  When cutting, it is very easy to push the button to close the blade.  This is very frustrating and may be a fatal flaw for this cutter.",2.0
Does not work for tie dye.,2.0
"the blade is sharp, but construction very flimsy, constantly have to tighten blade apparatus, actually will fall apart if you forget to tighten every 3 / 4 uses.  Push button to retrieve the blade will stick, stop working if blade is not tightened.",2.0
"I bought my original Fiskars 45mm in 2001, when I took up quilting.  It served me faithfully for many years until last month when I accidentally lost one of the pieces while replacing the blade.  I purchased this replacement right away and have grown to hate it.
I have two major complaints.  One is that the screw that holds the blade in place comes loose as you cut.  I have to straighten it about every 10 cuts, which is very frustrating.  The second is that any time you use a little pressure to make a cut (like when cutting multiple layers of fabric, or using a blade that isn't brand new), the blade suddenly retracts mid-cut.  This is not only startling, but forces you to make a second pass resulting in an imperfect cut.  This never happened with my old cutter.  I'm tired of dealing with this and will be upgrading to another brand.",2.0
Maybe my fault but the dye didn't work. At first looked ok but after the first wash it washed away and stained rest of my clothes in that wash.,2.0
This doesn't really die on polyester or sweaters very well. So if you're planning to use it on that the best you can expect is a light taupe. On my already flesh-colored tank top I dyed it and the only thing that died was the armpits. So now I have a shirt I can't even wear cuz it has taupe armpits and flesh-colored body kicker is that the armpits are also the same material as the rest of the shirt,2.0
This dye bleeds like hell in the wash and will stain your other clothes. The dyed items lose their color intensity.,2.0
flimsy tool,2.0
Never found too many applications where it outperformed scissors or a utility knife.,2.0
"I added this brand to my Olfa rotary tools because the price was right and I love my multiple pairs orange handled Fiskars scissors. I recently donated this cutter.... It didn't do ""anything wrong"" perse,  but I had an uncomfortable feeling. It felt too light, as if the materials were inferior. It did not feel solid, so I got rid of it",2.0
Apparently I need to not rely on pictures.  I was expecting a rectangular matt (picture 1) and a trim set (picture 2)..  The second picture is what you get.  It's not what I wanted.  The matt is small and square.,2.0
"I tried cutting through 2 layers of fabric and a part of the blade seems to be blunt, so that I did not get a continuous cut. I had to use scissors to complete the cut. I am very disappointed. I eventually decided not to use the cutter, since I had to do double work.",2.0
"This thing was terrible. I ended up buying a different cutter because this one is borked. Anytime I apply any pressure to the material I'm cutting the blade retracts back into the safe position. At first I thought it was because I was hitting my quilting square or something, but doing a few cuts without the square I quickly realized it just was not going to stay out.",2.0
After washing my newly dyed items they turned purple :(,2.0
"First off, I purchased my bottle at a local store but it is the same product. I have dyed things before with better results. I would recommend having lower expectations (maybe dying a white garment another color). In my case, I tried to dye a white sequin shirt, a red shirt, and a leopard print skirt all black in the same batch. Each garment was a different blend of natural fibers with a small percent of elastic. I used the suggested cup of salt in very hot water stirring constantly. I also used a vinegar soak afterwards for 1 hour as suggested by a top review. The results were disappointing as you can see in the photos. The white tank top is a chocolate brown, the red shirt is maroon, and the cheetah print is visible as grey rather than tan before.",2.0
The handle is comfortable but that doesn't matter if it doesn't cut all the time.  I had to go over the same area more often than not.,2.0
I was expecting a dark green like a hunter or forest green when I dyed 1000+ wood beads but the color turned out to be a peacock blue. This has never happened to me.  I followed the instructions: shook the bottle vigorously and used hot water.  I even double dyed the beads hoping the color would go green but the peacock blue only got darker.  I am disappointed.  I am thinking they did not add enough yellow to this batch.,2.0
It retracts itself sometimes while in use and it likes to let the blade come loose....defeats the purpose of trying to keep crisp clean edges on fabric. Will keep searching for a better version.,2.0
"This dye looked purple ( it was denim blue). I tried to darken jeans that had too much of a faded look in some parts. It darkened them a little bit, but it left a pink tint. Now they look worse than before.",2.0

"Every time I try to use this dye, the end result is purple fabric. I've used this on Cotton and Polyester blended fabric previously.",2.0
"If you're looking for something to gnaw through material, you've come to the right place.  I've never tried to cut with anything so dull.  I'm extremely disappointed.  Fiskars used to make good products....not so anymore.  Time to go with made in the USA only.",2.0
The price is too expensive but i need this thing atm.,2.0
Not what I was looking for. The color is way different the beige color I needed to dye my bleached carpet. Maybe I need to mix colors to get the right color or close enough.,2.0
"Bought this while working out of town this summer, primarily because it was less expensive than the cutters I'd left back home.  Wish I had spent a bit more.  It seems cheap in quality, using it as I would normally, the blade would retract while I was cutting.  Also, had to finish cutting thru the fabric along the cut edge with scissors, as the blade seemed to have a skip in it.

Perhaps I just got a bad one, but I wouldn't buy another like it.",2.0
"Overall, this set is functional. I'm a beginning quilter, and I was really hoping I wouldn't need anything more than this set of rotary cutter, mat and ruler. That is not the case. I cut my fabrics on a finished wood table. This mat moves. I have to set it against the wall so that it won't move while I'm cutting. And unfortunately the rotary cutter is not as sharp as I would like. I'm only cutting 2 layers of cotten quilting fabric and I need to press a lot harder with this rotary cutter than I expected. I'm going to try a 60mm rotary cutter and see if it is just me or if I just happened to get a blade that wasn't as sharp as needed.

I like the ruler. I like that it has the half inch around the perimeter shaded in pink. That is very helpful. I had hoped for more, and I'm afraid I will probably be re-selling the mat and rotary cutter for a very low price or giving them away because I will now be buying better tools.

Overall, this set is usable, but not ideal. I recommend spending a bit more and getting individual ruler, mat that doesn't slide, and cutter that is sharper.",2.0
"I purchased this particular rotary cutter because I beginning a new hobby and did not want to spend much on ""just a rotary cutter"" .. BIG MISTAKE
The fiskars blade was blunt and I had to go two - three times just to get 2 layers of fabric cut which ended up being uneven cuts with a lot of waste. I was so frustrated at the end of day 3 and decided to ask a friend who lent me her Gingher and needless to say it worked way better! As much as I would have like this quilting set to work for me I decided to return it and buy a Gingher instead. I went beyond making the 3 initial quilts I had planned and enjoy quilting :)
My advice would be to test out a variety of rotary cutters if you can before you buy one. If you are serious about your hobby I would suggest you invest in something more worthwhile.",2.0
it works good but the blade goes dull very fast i believe i only used it 3 times and it doesn't cut anymore,2.0
"I like the form factor, I like how eazy the blade comes is unprotected, protected. But I'm not sure it really does that great of a job, I bought it for the wife to cut down boxes  (we buy way too much through Amazon),and she really doesn't like it.

It is probably a great hobby blade, scrapbooking etc, but for heavier around the house tasks, eh..",2.0
"I am very unhappy with this product, I finally got the material and started to cut the squares for a quilt and the advertisement and packaging stated it can cut through ""multiple layers of fabric, paper, felt and vinyl"". Well I tried 3 pieces of thin cotton and it would not cut period, checked blade it is in correct, went to one layer and still have to run blade over the cut several times and it still would not cut through the material, had to finish some cuts with scissors. Not impressed with this expensive piece of junk",2.0
"This product I wasn't satisfied with it broke the first month in owning it, it's too flimsy and I was disapointed in this one.",2.0
"I am not happy with this product.  It does not seem sharp enough.  When I cut with it, it hardly cuts through one piece of fabric and not very good at that. Some pieces cut and some do not.  I bought this because some of my friends had this type of cutter and it worked great.  I had to end up using my sicssors.",2.0
Fhe color is just awful. Not what I would call apple green. It was muddy green not crisp and spring like I imagined. Made for a barely passable Katerina Kittycat costume,2.0
I bought this cutter because of the reviews it got here on Amazon.  Unfortunately I cannot say I like it much at all and I'm hoping Santa brings me a new one this year.  It barely cuts through 1 layer cleanly and if you put even the slightest pressure on it the blade pops back up under the safety guard.  Really not a great pair of these- maybe if you're a beginner go for it but its been nothing but frustrating for me.,2.0
They are very hard to manuver around corners and you have to push very hard to get them to cut.,2.0
"I bought this to cut fabric for quilting but it didn't work out so well.  I bought a cutting mat and everything, but I still had to press really hard to cut the fabric and it made it hard to cut accurately.  I went back to scissors for cutting fabric.  I started using it for cutting paper for scrapbooking and stuff and it works well for that!  I guess I'll try a better brand like Olfa or a higher end Fiskars for fabric.",2.0
"I bought this to cut paper and lightweight cardstock. The blade isn't sharp enough to cut either of those. The construction of the product itself is good but the blade is dull and useless. Maybe I got a refurbished item and they didn't tell me or something? Not sure. Disappointed, though.",2.0
"Don't know if Olfa's are any better, but I can tell you that unless you buy a blade sharpener, plan on spending boo-coo bucks on blades just to finish your quilt.  And don't drop your rotary cutter on a hard floor, the blades will be totally messed up after that.  I'm sure that's true with any rotary cutter, so be careful.",2.0
well the reason i ordered online was because in the store they were 36 dollars and i paid just 11 dollars for these and as soon as i tried them took me awhile to figure how hard i need to press for them to cut maybe they cut paper well but i need them to cut fabric better maybe i should get new different brand cutter but they still are very sharp so i guess i will just have to use what i have now the constuction seems weak hope they do not break on me while i am using them i wish they were made of harder plastic and metal but i guess you get what you pay for next time i will spend more money for a better product holding them leaves a sour taste in my mouth they just feel cheap here is to hoping they hold out after my project i have a lot of fabric to cut,2.0
"I would have loved this product if I were right handed. Maybe once I get the hang of it, it will work better with my left hand. But currently when I use my lefthand I can't see what I'm cutting very well, so it works better in my right. I'm not coordinated enough to trust myself on tricky projects with my right hand, so time will tell if this was a waste of my money or not.",2.0
"I've had tons of luck with RIT dyes in the past, but this one didn't work for me at all. I attempted to dye some white fabric navy blue (using a plastic tub), and it instead came out as a light lilac, as many other comments have noted.",2.0
"this product was almost identical to what i have, but it did not blend the lighter part fabric to the dye color",2.0
The die didn't stick. Will have to try again someday,2.0
"I've dyed with RIT for many years, but for some reason this did not turn out as planned. The dye is more pink than tangerine which is frustrating because I was dying curtains to match the previously dyed curtains using this same color. I've probably dyed over 300 things with rit dye over the years and never has a color not turned out until now.",2.0
"I used to have a rotary cutter that had a guard that was spring-loaded so the blade only came out when I pressed down to cut. That way I could slide the cutter sideways up to the ruler edge and cut. The blade on this one is always exposed and I have to carefully position it. It takes more time and I nick it on the ruler edge frequently. It has a comfortable handle, but that doesn't outweigh the drawbacks for me.",2.0
"This is cheaply made and has the problem of not staying together well. The plastic nut that holds the blade on keeps falling off. Cuts well, but I wouldn't buy it again.",2.0
More purple than blue,2.0
"perhaps I used it wrong, but it washed out all over the place..thank God I didn't add other clothes to the washing machine.",2.0
not as strong as I expected,2.0
"I have four concrete reasons for not liking this particular tape measure. One's more subjective than the others, so let's get that one out of the way first.  This tape is 9/16"" wide (aka one notch less than 5/8""). My previous tape, made by Dritz, is 5/8"" wide, which makes subtracting/adding seam allowances a snap, and I'm sad to lose this handy little reference.

Less subjectively:  the metal end of this tape is lose, and it slides around on its rivet quite a bit. So for nice and accurate measurements, I use the 1"" mark as the start and subtract an inch from number that I read on the tape. Super annoying. It's an indicator of low quality, and it's frustrating to use.

Next, the tape has inches on one side, centimeters on the other. The numbers on each side of my old Dritz tape start from opposite ends of the tape, so no matter which end I pick up first, it's the ""beginning"" of the tape, and I can start measuring. But with this Singer tape, the numbers on each side start on the same end -- so I have a 50/50 chance of grabbing the ""end"" of the tape (noting that there's some blank space at the end of the tape, so I can't even just use that and do the math), and then needing to find the other one to actually start measuring. Which is extra annoying when I'm holding a seam closed with one hand, or when I have it draped around my neck and the ""end"" of the tape is handy, so I have to pull the other end across my body uncomfortably. If that makes sense.

And finally -- the marks on each face don't match up precisely. Since the numbers start counting from the same end of the tape, when you look at the tape from the side, you'd expect to see inch markings coming from exactly the same spot on the tape. But on this, they're noticeably off -- roughly 1/32"". Not a huge deal, as this isn't the tool you'll want for precision but, c'mon! Again, it's just low quality.

I can't believe I care enough to write such a thorough review of such a simple tool, but apparently I do! I'm going to go order another tape from Dritz, and I'll throw this one in the household toolbox.",2.0
"it dyed my fabric perfectly, until i washed the fabric...then it wasn't dyed anymore.",2.0
"i had about 3 pairs of navy blue work pants that were faded so much that they were a shade of brown. used the dye according to instruction, but after the first wash, the pants were still brown.",2.0
It just didn't dye very well. Uneven coloring. Maybe I was asking too much from this bottle of Rit.,2.0
followed the instructions to a T and my cotton garments came out a VERY pale grey. not impressed.,2.0
More like purple than Navy blue. Tried dying Navy blue 5.11 pants. They came out purple. Not even close to Navy blue. Pro tip wash separate for the first few times or they'll bleed everywhere.,2.0
"I would never ever use this again! The color fades very quickly and discolored all of my other clothes. Super disappointed and the damage goes into the hundreds.
Please note picture where the middle prefold is supposed to be purple, the one to the left and right are supposed to be hot pink",2.0
This works very well at first. But it gets dull very quickly and bends the corner back instead of trimming it. I would not purchase this product again.,2.0
while the clothes come out hot pink after dying they then keep slowly discoloring and ruining all of your other clothes! Never ever again. The colors used in the pictures were hot pink and deep purple! Please don't buy this if you love your other clothes.,2.0
"Amazing job dying my bathtub and my hands ( yes i wore gloves), pretty mediocre job at dyeing the fabric, though. Followed the instructions exactly even the ""for brighter/darker colors double the amount of dye"" and my blue clothing went from blue...to a darker blue, not the black I was looking for :/ pretty disappointed as I'll have to redo the whole thing. Huge waste of my time and a huge mess....",2.0
"I bought this thinking I could use it for my design work, presentations, etc.  I'm lucky if I get a perfect corner 1  out of 4 tries.  There's almost always a rough spot or something that is unrepairable unless you recut it.  It cuts fine, just tough to get it aligned perfectly in the 90 so you don't end up with odd little edges.  Maybe had it been larger so you could really wedge the corner up in there, it would be more accurate.  I'll keep messing with it, but until now, not a fan...",2.0
"I concur with other reviewers that it's just ""ok"" because it's not anything special, really. It's only as precise as the person using it because if you're not holding it just right and don't push down on it correctly, it won't necessarily cut the way you'd like it to. It is not meant for thick paper and for multiple sheets of thin paper, for that matter. I think it's really only good for random small things that you don't need to cut often.",2.0
Did not work. I used it on a burgundy skirt; followed the directions. It immediately washed out. I'm confident that it's just the brand,2.0
worked better than the royal blue but still didn't come out very strong and rinsed out first wash.,2.0
followed the directions and ended upwith coral pink napkins,2.0
"A bit disappointed in this dye.  I have a medieval-style Renn Faire cloak that I bought around 20 years ago.  It was originally black, but over time had faded to a mottled shade of gray.  I bought two bottles of Rit purple dye, put the cloak in a bucket with the dye and steaming hot water off the stove, left it in for 24 hours stirring regularly, and after all that the cloak had only the lightest tinge of purple to it.  It's not a terrible result, at least it's all even and not faded gray again, but it just looks dark.  Almost back to it's original black.  I guess I was just expecting a better result... more purplish... after two bottles of dye and 24 hours of soaking.",2.0
"These were bought with the Fiskars 98887097 No. 5 Softgrip Micro-Tip Craft Scissors for use in embroidery, with the intent to use it in situations where it was necessary to snip floss as close to the fabric as possible.

This has been the only disappointment thus far with the Fiskars brand.",2.0

"I had been looking for a pair of scissors with curved blades for trimming threads on quilts without risking cutting into the fabric.  I'd seen someone online using a pair of scissors that looked just like the photo on Amazon's webpage.  Unfortunately, Amazon's photo doesn't do a good job of showing the size of the scissors in comparison to someone's hand.  My hands are not abnormally large (wear a men's M or L glove) but the finger holes in the scissors were too small to get my thumb into.

The scissors may be OK for someone with small hands but I didn't bother to open them, I just returned them and will resume my search.",2.0
They were too large for our taste,2.0
It looks to be hot glue fibers in tape form and it is to thin to hold anything thicker than a thin shirt hem together.,2.0

"I have some very similar scissors that I bought years ago in Europe and they are marked in the metal (like a knife would be) as Fiskars, Made in Finland.  I bought these new as a replacement for the Finnish ones but they were very quickly in a much worse state than the pair I was replacing.  They are of poorer quality and not manufactured to the same standard as the original.  For example they slip rather than cut on some thicker craft projects where the originals do not.  I actually wonder if these are some kind of knock-off or counterfeit.  They are only marked as Fiskars in the plastic rather than on the metal.  I would not buy these again.",2.0
This does not hold up to the first wash!!,2.0

"I will love this when I finally receive it.  However, it missed the delivery date and is taking about 2 weeks to be received.  The up side is that this is an odd size zipper and worth the wait.

"This is really great marking chalk, but the last one I ordered from amazon arrived in several pieces. therefore, I'd recommend looking for it locally instead of at amazon. also, Jo-Ann has comparable chalk for a few bucks cheaper (don't remember the brand. it's not quite as nice, as it's square, but a square is better than a broken chunk of a triangle).

I guess, if you're buying a bunch of chalk, it might be alright. amazon shipped mine in a flat cardboard envelope. I doubt their standard airbag in a box would've kept it safe, either, though.",2.0

"I didn't order from Amazon, I just bought this along with the black dye from a local Joann's and I thought I would give my two cents and a fair warning.
1) I was lucky to have done countless research on dyeing methods before purchasing so if you want a true navy color I would suggest using a 2:1 ratio of navy to black.

2) The price here is ridiculous. $7.98 for an all purpose dye (not including shipping if you don't have Prime) with dubious results depending on your fabric is NOT worth it. I used this to dye a wonderful cotton twill using the immersion method. After a few tests while following instructions to a T the dye really wasn't as vibrant as I wanted it to be, even with the added salt. I would highly suggest going to Dharma Trading and buying procion dyes for your cotton or plant fiber-based projects which is about $3 cheaper and CONSIDERABLY better. The dye job is much more even, vibrant, and permanent; the latter being an issue even when the fabric was properly rinsed.

3. My biggest issue with RIT dyes is that purple tinted ones (black and navy fall under this), will drastically change color when ironed. My cotton twill which was dyed to the perfect color of blue/black suddenly became ashen (almost a greyed out black w/ minimal hints of blue) after being ironed, even after several hours of cooling.

Honestly, don't bother buying your RIT dyes here. Amazon makes them all more expensive in general and Dharma Trading, a site dedicated to dyes, will sell better quality products for cheaper, even cheaper than finding the same items in your local store.",2.0

My sweater came out better but is still a bit faded due to all the rinsing. I had hoped to give new life to the pants but they came out like a mutant.

"I need pencils that will mark clearly and easily on clothing, and will last until the clothing is washed.
These pencils do not mark clearly, they just put a smudgy mark, and you have to go over and over several times for the mark to be visible. The mark will rub off with normal wear. It does wash out too, but typically is not even visible by the time the clothes are in the wash. Very disappointing!",2.0
"I'm very skeptical of all the 5-star reviews. These are really, really difficult to sharpen (and I'm a decent sharpener of pencils using a good sharpener). Each time I had to sharpen these pencils (no difference between colors), the lead broke 1 - 2 times before I got enough lead from the pencil to be able to write with it. Never got a point because that was impossible--the lead fell out immediately if I even got close to a point. Instead, I sharpened just a little bit, often on only one side, to ensure I'd be able to mark without a sharpening interruption for a few minutes. Sharpen, mark, mark, lead breaks. Sharpen, lead break. Sharpen, lead break. Sharpen, mark, mark, mark, lead break. This is what using these pencils is like.",2.0

"I had high hopes for these based on reviews. The color variety is convenient and the caps are nice. However, I find that the ""lead"" part easily breaks under the necessary pressure to make marks. It will break off about 1/2 inch of the lead, so it takes forever to sharpen back down to where it's usable. I'm losing so much of it from breaking. Very disappointed. I'm switching over to water soluble markers now, because I'm having such a hard time finding decent chalk or pencils.",2.0

"In general, I think Rit liquid dyes are great but this particular color did not take well in my project.  I had a set of twin size cotton sheets that I've had for a long time and got bored of the dull blue.  I've dyed sheets before and had great luck with it so I bought color remover and the Aquamarine dye.  The color remover got the medium blue sheets to a light grey and the Aquamarine dye brought them over to... a slightly bluer shade of light grey.  If you are DEAD SET on this color, you may want to buy extra.  Otherwise I'd suggest the same brand but a different color altogether.",2.0
"My review is based on the color of the Tan bottle I ordered. To be fair it dyed my pants (50% cotton, 47% poly, 3% elastic) evenly so the quality is good. You do have to follow the directions and constantly churn and not overfill the solution with too much garment.

I expected the Tan color to be a natural looking khaki color that I could wear in the summer but it is more of dark yellowy mustard color with a dingy tint. I hope Rit will come up with more khaki color that looks lighter and more natural looking.",2.0

"I have used these pens for a year now, and frankly, they are quite worthless. Here's a quick sum up:

Pros

- work relatively well on regular cotton fabric

Cons

- break easily when sharpened
- they wear very quickly when marking fabric; expect to sharpen them every few pattern pieces that you trace/mark
- because of the softness of the tip, they don't stay sharp for long, thus making VERY broad lines
- they are not ideal to use with a ruler, see previous point
- do not work on stretch fabric as you have to push down fairly hard to mark the fabric, which in turn stretches/distorts the fabric

While the idea is great, I get much better results using a regular pencil on non-stretch fabric and a pencil costs 1/10 of these.",2.0

Despite using a big pot, keeping the water warm, and stirring all the time (!) the pants look horrible as certain areas are darker or lighter than others. Dying them a second time in the washing machine was too late, and the pants are ruined. They should be a lot more specific in their instructions for how to use this product. I'm sure the dye could have worked perfectly if I had put them in the washing machine the first time around, but since we have to use a shared washing machine in the basement of our building, where one cannot extend the wash cycle, we through it would work better to do it in a pot.",2.0

"I opened the bottle.  The liquid was green.  I called RIT and the phone rep insisted that was normal and that my garment would, indeed, come out tan.

I cannot use it. Not Expected.,2.0
"I tried to dye a duvet cover brown ombr style with this ""cocoa brown"" dye. Part of the cover I only used a very small amount of the dye expecting it to be a lighter shade of brown but it is literally pink. Not like a little pink but straight up light pink. The other part of the duvet cover I used the amount recommended on the back of the bottle and it is fairly brown but it is still much more red/pink than the color on the bottle. I have a picture if you want to see the truth. The carpet is a normal tan color so you can see how much red/pink the dye made the fabric.",2.0
Bought it for some faded pieces of black clothing and it really didn't make a difference.,2.0
I was disappointed when I tried using these as they are too large for both my thread spools and bobbins.,2.0

"SUPER PINK.. Wanted a coral color, so I only put 1/4 in the washer.. It still came out hot pink!!",2.0
"It say they fit ""most"" size bobbins. I have a Singer machine, not some off-brand, and they do not fit my bobbins. Very disappointed.",2.0
"I was pretty excited to be able to keep spools and bobbins together instead of hunting them down. Unfortunately, I did not try to put them together until a few months after receiving, and I am now stuck with useless parts. They fit great into spools' holes, but one prong would have to be removed to allow them to fit into a bobbin hole. Lesson learned: always check for appropriate fit within a week to ensure items are as you expect. Fortunately I am not out a lot of cash. Great idea, poor execution for my sewing machine, and I would guess, that since bobbins are a pretty standard item with minor differences, not a good choice for yours. Gave 2 stars for a good idea.",2.0
"I really wanted to like these as they were the closest thing I could find to what I wanted. My mom had a few packages of vintage thread spool toppers. They were tiny caps that fit onto the top of the thread spool- you would put the end of the thread over the top of the spool and then the caps would keep the end of the thread from unwinding from the spool.

Fast forward to my being in school for accessories design and we use spools of bonded nylon thread. I was worried these wouldn't fit the larger spools as the hole on top is too big- and they don't- but the real issue is that they do not hold the thread underneath them like I had hoped. Also they make the spool so tall that they now do not fit into my thread case, which only makes the problem worse. The thread does not keep from unraveling from the spool and now it doesn't fit in my box. Also trying to keep the bobbin with the spool doesn't work well for me either because we use a variety of industrial machines that of course all take different sized bobbins... they didn't work for my intended purpose and honestly I don't see an advantage to keeping the bobbin with the spool unless you have colors that are so similar in color that they are hard to tell apart when put into a large bobbin case. I have gone back to taping my thread to the spool and am still searching for a better option.",2.0
I think this is a great idea but I did not have any threads that these fit on so I couldn't use.,2.0
"I don't know how I missed that it doesn't fit Singer.  Doesn't seem to fit standard bobbins either.
its just irritating that I now have this open package of little plastic junk that is useless.
I guess I'll pass it on to the thrift store.",2.0
"While a good idea, I had to whittle them down so the bobbin would fit, so hence the two stars.",2.0
"After reading a few other reviews about how it came out purple, I tried 2 bottles instead of just 1 to get the navy blue color.  I followed all of the directions on the bottle for machine dying and even used the Rit Color Remover prior to dying the fabrics.  The white hand towels turned out a very weird shade of purple.  It's not even a nice shade of purple, just sort of a washed out used-to-be-purple purple.  At the very least, I expected the white fabric to turn out blue!  The towels turned out a horrible purple brown color.

The washing machine was an AWFUL MESS.  I've used the aquamarine dye before w/ great results and no mess in the machine afterwards, but this dark purple/blue ring remained in the washer and on the agitator.  After a few empty bleach runs and some scrubbing w/ the now ruined towels, the machine is now clean again save for a purple ring right at the top.  Would have been much easier to just go buy some new towels!!

I was trying to save some money by dying old white dingy towels a new blue color, but instead I've wasted money on 2 bottles of dye and 2 bottles of color remover, plus a bunch of purple or ruined towels.",2.0
This didn't dye like I thought it would.,2.0
"I tried dyeing a cotton dress with this, and a pair of jeans. I basically boiled some water, poured it in a bucket, added salt, and put the clothes in there for a couple of hours. And when I took them out, the jeans had dyed very nicely and evenly, but the dress was splotchy and unwearable.

I also think this entire process is just unbelievably messy. Obviously it's fabric dye, but I had to use my bathtub to rise it. And now my bathtub is black, my sink is black, my hands are black, my bucket is black and my roommates are upset.",2.0

"I'm on my 2nd order of these because the first time failed! I don't know if its me or the product. I followed the instructions but 90 seconds MELTED my range bag compartments together, then two days later the Velcro patches fell off.

"I've used Rit powder dye for years, and my mother did too. I've dyed T-shirts, curtains, towels, and jeans with great success. This is my first time trying the liquid dye, because I could get it in a maroon color I needed. I dyed one cotton hand-towel, and the color came out great. I simmered it in a big pot, added salt as directed, and soaked it for an hour. The problem was when I rinsed the item after dying. I've changed the water probably a dozen times, squeezing and soaking, and still the color is bleeding out. I tried salt in one rinse, and vinegar in another one - I saw a tip on the Internet about that helping set dye. I'll keep rinsing because I have nothing to lose, but I don't have much hope.

Edited 10/7/14:  I'm taking away another star because the first time I washed it in the regular washing machine, it bled so much that it's now a pink color instead of maroon.  I've never had such trouble with powder dye!",2.0

"I put three pair of pants in to be dyed at the same time.  One turned out OK, another the cuffs were reddish, and the third was definitely a reddish color more than anything.

Uneven when used on a quilt even with two bottles. Instructions are somewhat vague.,2.0
"Thanks for refunding my money. The velcro buckled and detached from the ribbon on which it was shipped. It did not stick to the fabric. Ironing did not help. The concept is great, and the seller timely - but the product was faulty.",2.0

This dye did not change my pants one iota. They were of varying fabrics so it wasn't just one pair that the dye did not set.,2.0
Followed the instructions exactly.  Cotton came out a very dark grey/purple.  Not even close to Black.  Would not recommend - unless you want a dark grey/purple!,2.0
"Don't be fooled - this might say black on the bottle, but it comes out a purplish-grey color. Apparently it's a well-known problem with this dye.",2.0
Should have listened to other reviews. Didn't dye the blouse black and was messy to use. Had to rinse off the dye too many times so we ended up throwing out the blouse.,2.0
This color looks great on wet - but once dried it was basically non existent.  I've used rit on other fabrics and it was fine - however canvas doesn't hold this color (and it did with the other brand).,2.0
This dye is horrible it messes up the fabric. and it is hard to use. i don't recommend this at all.,2.0
"I used 5 inches of this on a diaper strap I made. Its soft, sews great and stays in plays but is easily ripped open with a light tug. I needed something that my 17 year old can't get to easily. Might be better used on stiffer, flat areas like a notepad cover - something that doesn't hold weight or doesn't need to be secured tightly.",2.0
"I've tried four times using different suggested methods and every single onesie I've dyed has come out with uneven coverage.  Makes it look like I had a bleach accident in the wash.  Very frustrating.  I had hoped to get some more mileage out of plain white onesies, but this just isn't getting it done.  That's too bad since the color is really very nice.",2.0
"I have used Rit liquid dyes for a long time.  The color you get is going to vary widely depending on the fabric you are dyeing.  Often the material will hold the dye but the stitching won't.  You MAY get more reliable results by bleaching the item first (even whites!) to get rid of any coloring or treatment.  But this is still a guess.  The black dye will come out anything from charcoal to gray to a sort of blueish purple tint.  Other dark colors get the same odd results.  I personally don't care because I'm dying old white and gray T-shirts that I wear around the house, so whatever color I end up with is an improvement. Every once in a while I get a color (always different from the stated dye color) that I really like, but then of course it's impossible to duplicate.  But I would NOT recommend using this dye on anything you care about.",2.0
"I ordered it because I wanted to close the back pocket of my running pants. The pants are made of nylon/spandex and I tried hard to sew a velcro piece but hand sewing is nearly impossible. Even though I managed to do that eventually, it was not strong and the sewing came off easily. So I gave up. If you have a sewing machine, i think this may work; if not, do not bother with this stuff.",2.0
This was very easy to sew but I was disappointed with its holding power. I ended up buying stronger velcro and cut it down to narrow strips.,2.0
"I agree with all over reviews...this is a great blue-purple but definitely not navy. Even if you concentrate it and add very little water, you are looking at a purple color.

I don't love it on it's own but it is good to mix with other colors.",2.0
"I bought two bottles of this navy blue fabric dye for a twin sized pink comforter that I have been using for my male puppy to sleep on in his crate. Despite my efforts to give him a blue blanket, it came out purple.

"I bought this initially for some costuming needs.  After initially testing how strongly it would hold, I threw the whole package in the garbage.  This is pretty wimpy velcro and is not to be trusted if you need something that will take even a moderate amount of stress.",2.0
"They work and they look great initially but all of my shirts faded drastically after first wash even after following the instructions.  Reds looked yellow and blacks looked gray.  My firetruck looked horrible.  I used HP ink in an HP photosmart inkjet printer.  The up-side is the transfer did stay on well - I have had no peeling or anything thus far - but the colors faded so drastically that I would only recommend for a single use event - for example a birthday party.  If you don't wash before the party, it will look amazing. Once you wash, the shirt will probably need to just become a back-up shirt or undershirt.  It did work well for this.",3.0

"The transfering process is nice and easy. Great color transfer and washes well in cold water. But with a little bit of tugging or stretching of the garment, then the whole tranfer got ribbed and peeled.",3.0
"It helps to read the directions. Had problems with this, but discovered that I didn't have my iron set on steam. Work really well after getting the setting right. Did have some problems with the edges sticking and tearing. Be careful",3.0
Took a few tries to get this right. Over ironed a couple of shirts which left yellow burn marks. Overall it leaves a rough waxy feel which is not that comfortable to wear. Ended up throwing the shirts out after use.,3.0
Pretty much as expected.,3.0
"The colors come across well. I had to push down with my entire body weight for 15 minutes for it to transfer. When I washed it, according to the directions, it pulled up on 2 shirts I had done.",3.0
For those wondering what it looks like on colors and darks here are some pictures on white to show the true design and differnt colors even dark red and black. This is the first time I used light transfer paper I usually use dark transfer paper I get joanns because it is thicker and the whites look whiter and the colors look truer. Honestly if you use anything other than dark colors in your design do not use this onany colored shirt use dark transfer paper the colors don't change as much and whites are not the color of the shirt under it.,3.0
Very easy to do but after the first wash it started to come apart,3.0
"These are just OK. My logo is black and white, so in the blank space, it left a white-ish film (which the instructions warned of). When I washed, the film turned even whiter, so it was a bit distracting. I would probably just go with ordering screenprinted t-shirts next time, but good if you have a small, solid, and colorful pattern. I wouldn't recommend for a design with a lot of blank space.",3.0
"It is okay, but after few washes, it fades... It is very easy to transfer to clothes",3.0
"This kind of sucks. You have to print the picture backwards, and the pictures come out blurred.",3.0
"Arrived on time but didn't work very well the shirts,sweater, and jacket. And the one i put on the shirt pretty much dissolved after my daughter put it on. It just separated into pieces. Maybe the dark fabric transfer paper would work better.",3.0
"It is very hard to iron on. I would be careful with this one, because, most came out great, but one time the picture was horribly peeled and I did iron for more than the time stated.",3.0
image washed off after 3 washes. was good for temp use like the bday party,3.0
"Did work for me. The design just melted onto my shirt, BUT that doesn't mean it does not work for everyone. I tried this as a small project and am no means a professional at it. All I do know is that I did as the directions asked and I melted my shirt and design in the process.",3.0
"It prints out pretty great, but the cracking and peeling once you wash it is inevitable. I have a shirt that I printed something on and I've been wearing it regularly for a couple years. As long as you use gentle cycle with cold water, it should last quite a while if you don't mind the image being a bit wrinkled or cracked.",3.0
"Sufficient for a few wearings, but will show wear quickly. Transfers went on easily and were so seamless that most people who saw the aprons didn't even realize we'd ironed on the logos. However, after the first washing, we started to see tears in the edges of the transfers. For us, not a big deal, since we only expect to wear these a few times as Halloween costumes, but anyone planning a more permanent usage might want to look elsewhere, or at least plan to treat the garments carefully.",3.0
this is an Ok product...,3.0
"Here's the thing - This is probably great for a plain tee-shirt or something else.  It's a clear backing - so whatever shirt color is under there, is what you'll see in the white areas of your print-out and the instructions tell you that pressure and heat are your friend.  They are, but these sheets aren't.  Sometimes they'd stick sometimes not.  The ink got smeary - they are okay.  Don't use them on anything overly valuable or anything you really need to look precise.",3.0
"Light colored one works pretty good, dark colored one had problems sticking to fabric",3.0
"I got these T-Shirt transfers for use on a white cotton t-shirt. The transfers are clear, so trying to use them on a colored t-shirt - even a light colored t-shirt as the description says, can lead to the image being blocked or distorted by the t-shirt color itself. The best way to go with a t-shirt of any color are the dark t-shirt transfers which are white. However, for use on white shirts these do the job just fine. It is always recommended that you wash the shirt before using the transfers so that if the shirt is going to shrink it's before you've added the transfer. The results I got were fine - the transfer ironed on and applied evenly to the shirt. The colors transferred well with very little fading. The only reason this gets 3 stars though is how well the transfers have held up in the wash. Once washed a couple of times the image faded and it became really obvious that it was an iron-on transfer. Worse, over time the image started to get cracks in it. So, if you're buying these to make t-shirts for a one-time special event then they work fine. However, if you want to continue to wear the shirt afterwards you may want to go for a higher quality transfer.",3.0
It worked so-so.  I don't know if it was a problem on our part but I didn't like when it didn't peel off completely.  Directions were followed.  When it peeled completely off without stretching it was great.,3.0
I really liked how it iron on the T-Shirts but the only thing that is bugging me is that in one day one of the shirts wrinkled a bit and the transfer started to peel off!,3.0
"It works okay, I couldn't get these to work very well with an iron.  But they work good with a heat press.  The quality is just not as good as some of the other papers I have used.",3.0
These are just okay. They worked for what I was using them for but don't expect the color to be exact OR for them to last through a couple of washes.,3.0
"These transfers go on great, but after a wash and a wear, you are left with a shirt with a cracked design on it.  These transfers crack and they crack quickly on a t shirt.  I would not recommend them unless you are going for a distressed look.",3.0
"It is probably just me... but I followed the directions so careful and after two t-shirts, I still didn't like how it turned out. At first it looked great! But as soon as I washed it (per the directions), the transfer paper looked very wrinkled. The first transfer peeled off! The second transfer is holding tight but it just doesn't look good. :/ Maybe someone else will have more luck...",3.0
"This transfer sheet is an ok item - the fabric will feel plastic-y after application of the transfer, so if that will bother you, or if it will be worn by someone with sensitivities, look for something else. Otherwise, this transfer sheet will enable you to create unique apparel. It's also useful for art applications, such as quilting or wearable art (think purses, accessories). There are ways around the plastic-ness, you just have to use some creativity. But then,that's what this kind of product is all about!",3.0
"This is a great idea for a gift or for fun, but it really doesn't last long. After a few washes, my test was cracked and visibly showed wear. My son LOVED his personalized t-shirt, though, so I would buy it again for special things, but I would definitely use it for something that has no white space on it - the whole iron-on should have color or graphics on it to disguise the discoloration of the iron-on parts. 3 stars because it's an awesome idea that could have better quality.",3.0
"I picked up this to create some fun homemade t-shirts with my 3 year old.  Working with her on the computer to pick out pictures and clipart then print out and iron them on a fun t-shirt was very engaging for her and utimately worth the money tenfold in the experience.  I had little hope for commerical grade results, and my expectations were mildly exceeded.

We discovered that using a full sheet, much like other reviewers, made a less flexible shirt and the material has less longevity.  Instead of using a full sheet picture,  we printed out many small items and ironed them on individually...  the resulting iron-ons lasted longer through the wash and maintained color for at least 8 washes with a mild dreft detergent and cool cycles.

We used a HP C5550 inkjet and HP vivera inks, so YMMV using reloads or offbrand inks.  It would be useful to find someone who would make a more colorfast ink for washing machine abuse :)",3.0
"I was pretty skeptical about how this would work.  I thought it would come off right away, but I was wrong.  It has gone through the washer a time or two and it is still there.  I'm just not sure how many washes these can handle.

Anyway, you will want to make sure you have something good and hard to press the image onto your shirts.  I used a large cutting board.  Make sure you have the iron on the hottest setting and use even motion.

Even though this works, it makes the t-shirt uncomfortable because it is pretty stiff.  I have a couple of sheets left and I think I'll try them on something other than a t-shirt and see how that works.

Overall, it is OK, but don't expect it to be perfect and I doubt it will last a long time.",3.0
"I've used Xerox brand iron on transfers for white shirts before and have had good success.  I tried these Averys because it seemed they would be more suitable for non-white backgrounds.  So far, I've used the Avery transfers on two 100 percent cotton t-shirts, one light gray and one fairly dark tan.  The images were block color pieces of artwork, very bright.

I followed the instructions carefully and did one shirt right after the other.  In one case, the paper just didn't pick up all the ink from the printer in one small sliver (about 1/8"" by 1/2"").  When I applied the transfer to the gray t-shirt, two other areas showed small color drop outs.  It's not bad, but the end result certainly doesn't look professional.

With the other transfer everything worked well from start to finish.  The image came out clean and even though the t-shirt was rather dark, the colors were still vibrant.

In both cases, the border of the image was clear right after I pulled the transfer off, but turned creamy white after a first washing.  As a result, I would not recommend using these iron ons with free floating letters on anything but a creamy white background.  The same could be said for the Xerox iron on transfers.

I don't understand the difference between the two results for the Averys since everything was done during the same time period and the same method was used.  Perhaps one of the pieces of iron on paper was simply not up to snuff.  I haven't had this problem with Xerox brand iron ons.  Overall, I'd say the Averys produce more vibrant colors, but perhaps provide less consistent results.  Also the brighter colors of the Averys come with the downside that the iron on seems a bit thicker and makes the shirt drape less naturally.",3.0
"The product was a bit pricey for what it is, and it was a bit of a chore to get all the little self-release tabs in the right place and the whole thing lined up right. But it was no more expensive here than at the brick and stick stores, and once installed over my desk does a lovely job. So all in all worth money, time, and effort.",3.0
It's a good piece but they don't tell you that its very thin.  I thought it would be a bit thicker.  Also it's very sticky.  Other than that it's just a little over priced.,3.0
"This product could be so much better. It is only paper thin and is NOT adhesive. You stick it down with the tabs they give you in only a few spots, this does not work out when you ""tack"" things to the board, and then remove them the Post-it board comes forward also. I do not think it will last long. Pretty flimsy for the cost.",3.0
"This ""sticky paper"" solution is the kind of high quality product you'd expect from 3M, and comes with thoughtful provisions for trimming and mounting the material to fit whatever space you have. It works well for papers, cards (e.g. Christmas cards) & etc, as long as the material lays flat, but the adhesive is just not strong enough by itself hold pictures or materials that want to roll up or curl at the edges.

To complete my ""side of the fridge"" application, I (therefore) needed to purchase a few packages of tiny strong magnets I also found on Amazon(2x Three By Three Seattle Slim Mighties Square and Circle Magnets, 1/4 Inch Length, 1/32 Inch Thickness, Chrome, 12 Pack, 20400) which aren't cheap, but do the trick for supplementing the hold of the 3M material for those items that want to make trouble.",3.0
"These are colorful and hold a lot, but the paper is very thin. As long as you don't have much weight, they work fine and can be written on easily. In this batch, about ten of the bags were stapled together, and I couldn't use them as gift bags because of the small holes left by the staple, but I had enough and didn't bother to return them.  I would have bought a better quality, but I only needed 14, and the nicer ones came in packs of 12 and were too expensive for me to purchase two packs and only use two from a second pack.",3.0
It's okay. A bit flimsy. I found better at Target in their grocery section.,3.0
"Three stars is enough.

The Good - On first inspection, these easels look good, not great simply good. They are light weight, I'm hoping the claim to support 25# of weight is true (which is why I chose this easel over others). The 2 slides that support the weight are 2.5in so your frame can be about 2.25"" wide.  They snap down and stay put with tension, which I expect will loosen in time--hope it withstand at lease a year of readjustment, but by the looks of things, I doubt they will . They are light weight which is real nice.

The Bad - the tightening mechanism that holds the height of the 3 telescoping legs is cheap. I couldn't tell if I was tightening or loosening or anything for that matter, there is very little movement that can be felt. When I looked closely I noticed a double sided arrow indicating it's what tightens/loosens and holds the legs in place. Again, it looks real cheap and I know that in time I'll need to find a way to keep the legs from sliding (I don't trust they'll support the 25lbs so I'm packing a roll of electrical tape just in case).

I chose this easel over the others because of the claim to support 25lbs and the price.  The $46 price is a bit much, I would have liked a carrying case. In a couple of months I'll update my review.

The best part of ordering these easels is that I placed the order on Saturday, they were to be delivered via Amazon Prime by Wednesday, I received them today Monday around 4pm. AWESOME!",3.0
"Considering that these are sold at Walmart for $80 each, I took a chance and ordered two. They arrived intact, and are VERY easy to use. While they are not the sturdiest, they do support a large dry erase board, and allow you to write and erase with out too much difficulties...",3.0

It certainly can hold the whiteboard yet far from being a sturdy support. To look at it, you'd think it shouldn't cost more than $15. Such item finds its use mostly for business, which is probably why it can be priced so high.

Though not sturdy. It is extremely light, look very cheap, but it does work.",3.0
"I bought three easels to replace several we have at my workplace that are broken.  Two of the three easels I received from Amazon were not property assebled as the rivets that hold the back leg to the top piece were not attached to the back leg, rendering the tripod easel worthless.  The two replacements I received did not have this problem but I would warn customers that Quartet's quality control is lacking.  For such expensive easels this was a disappointment.",3.0
Lightweight may be a little generous. Not enough substance to it. One broken already but possibly by the person operating it not following directions. Will not buy again for the same purpose but works great for light use.,3.0
"One leg of the easel was totally stuck and would not telescope out.  My boss pulled so hard it broke the inside mechanism that tightens the leg once extended.  We have ""rigged"" it with good old duck tape for the time being so we could use it for the function we had going.  I had to order another as it really was a good product; just be careful with the extending the first time.  If it does not extend, send it back.",3.0
Not the sturdiest but gets the job done. It feels like it's always about to fall over with my white board on it.,3.0
"It sets up easily, but isn't 'heavy-duty' by any means.",3.0
"It's a good product in general, but be careful to check it for defects immediately upon arrival. I have bought many of these and about 25 percent have a defective connector for the center spokes, which causes the whole easel to be unstable.",3.0
"Easels are so expensive these days and so often flimsy and cheap due to a high number of crucial parts being made of plastic. This isn't much of an exception. It definitely works better than other ""heavyweight"" easels at lower price points.",3.0
"I wanted a sturdy easel for my 4'x6' whiteboard but really couldn't find anything that was the quality I wanted... so I went with this.  It's pretty flimsy and the legs are awkward to extend.  That said, it held the whiteboard and didn't fall over...  I would also use a sandbag or the like to brace a leg or two.

If you need an easel, this works, I just don't think you get what you pay for.",3.0
"I've tried several stands of this type; none of them are fully satisfactory.  None are not stable enough to firmly hold a whiteboard when used for taking notes  This stand is the most stable I've found but the manufacturer could still do a much better job on the basic design, and use heavier duty components, to make it more stable.",3.0
I'm using the Easel to hold a 3' x 4' white board it works the description makes it sound like a much sturdier product than what was shipped. It works but could be knocked over with little effort.,3.0
"It is not a bad product and the price was good. Having said that, the clips that adjust to hold item do not lock very securely & can slip. Measurement numbers or notches would help guarantee both adjustable legs the same height.",3.0
"There are two very similar versions of this punch.  Be careful... (I suspect some reviewers have confused the two).

- The 20-sheet version has a lock for the handle, so it doesn't take up as much room.  The 12-sheet doesn't.

- The 20-sheet version has a lifetime warranty---which includes performance.  If it stops working as well as it did when brand new; 20 years from now, they will replace it.  The 12-sheet version has a 90 day warranty.

- The 20-sheet version is more robustly built and has a window at the bottom to see the collected ""confetti"".  The 20-sheet version also has each hole labeled should you want to reconfigure where the punches are.  (For example to turn it in to a 2 hole punch).  The 12-sheet lacks all these features.

Speaking of which, both these models are only semi-adjustable.  I.e. you'll need a screwdriver to rearrange the punches should you want to punch anything other than standard 8.5x11 paper with three holes.

Should you really want to do this---buy a different punch.

But if you are only punching 8.5x11 sheets with the standard three holes, the 20-sheet version is nice and deserves 5 stars....if you can get it for a decent price.

The 12-sheet version is not nearly as nice.  I give it only three stars.",3.0
The Swingline 12 hole does a good job but the number of sheets is too low and is a bit awkward to use.  The next higher model does 20 sheets and can be stored more compactly.,3.0
"Three very, very similar shades of orange.  Two very similar shades of purple.  I thought they'd be more distinctly different colors.  With all the colors available, I would think a wider variety could be offered.",3.0
"After counting all the colors I do not have 50 of each. 43 yellow, 52 black 46 purple and so on.",3.0
Once my order arrived it was as described.  Though it was at a higher price than originally ordered.  So buyer beware.,3.0
"Pros:
Packaging was great.
Price was great (assuming that you are able to make 50 packs of 16 crayons).
No broken crayons. (Until the kids started to help sort and pack.)

Cons:
There were not 50 sets of 16 crayons. In total we had 810 crayons, but we were hoping to be able to make 50 identical sets. I was quite disappointed with that. I'd be tempted not to complain about the 10 extra crayons, if they were in commonly used colors - but, really, who needs so much extra white?
Seven colors had less than 50, so we were only able to make 44 sets of all 16 crayons. We used the surplus to even out the packs.
We had:
44 Brown
44 Black
45 Yellow Green
48 Blue Green
48 Yellow
49 Carnation Pink
49 Red
50 Yellow Orange
51 Blue
52 Red Violet
52 Green
53 Violet
55 Red Orange
55 White
57 Blue Violet
58 Orange

I wasn't willing to send them back or try to get my missing crayons. The arrived on Friday, I needed them for Sunday...

That being said, I'm likely to order again - perhaps, with a little more time between delivery and use. :-D",3.0
Not all colors had the correct amount of crayons.,3.0
Not all colors had 50 crayons.  Some did have more than 50. Several broken crayons in the package.,3.0
There is not 50 of every color. For example I only received 44 blue. 3/5 stars.,3.0
"the crayons look fine, and the big box is convenient, but there are not 50 of each color. Some colors had 30 something or 40 something and a few had over 50.  I see others have had this same problem. This seems like a basic thing...making sure there are the correct number. If someone wanted to divide these up for 50 kids, they would be out of luck. Photo shows box just after I opened it and had taken out one blue, one purple, on brown, and one orange. Then I realized how uneven things looked.",3.0
"As others have stated, there are not 50 of each of the 16 colors as advertised.  Some colors had only 38 while others had 60.  Also a few crayons  were broken.",3.0
Ordered these buttons to have on hand for projects.  They are okay but not ornate enough for special projects.  I didn't use them as much as I thought I would.  But okay for certain  projects. Price okay.,3.0
"These buttons were cute, but are better suited for kids projects rather than grown up crafts.",3.0
Not sticky enough..:( didn't work for what I wanted it for.. not sticking,3.0
"My husbands idea to use as child proofing.
 This is not strong enough to keep the toddler out the fridge or anywhere else.",3.0
Good,3.0
Okay but hoping it would be more strength.,3.0
"The adhesive side isn't sticky enough, but the velcro sticks together just fine.  Not really functional when the velcro just peels off the wall.",3.0
"Works well, but needs a starter tab to help peel the hook section up out of the loop (fabric) - tired of digging at it with my fingernail to get it started.  I will look for similar product, 2"" wide this time but it MUST have a tab.  No way that a fingernail could start a wider strap.  I'll keep these, glad I only bought one package to start with.",3.0
ok,3.0
"This Velcro strap is well made, but the manufacturer missed one detail. It will work fine if you are wrapping it around something between 18"" and 36"" in circumference, but if what you are wrapping it around (in my case hoses and cables) is less than 18"" in circumference, the hook part is attached to the wrong side, and you'll have to twist the product to make it work. In my case, I wound up cutting the hooks off, and sewing it back onto the tape with the loops flipped over, so that it now works on anything smaller than 18"".",3.0
"These straps are so incredibly flimsy, I was certain they were knock-offs. Also, just barely 18"" from end of the buckle to the narrow end of the strap. Only purchase this if you have a light-duty intended purpose, they should be ok for that type of application.",3.0
"Velcro is Velcro, i guess. Cheap but wish the hooks and loops were evenly distributed, to many loops. When you secure something, you have to keep
wrapping it around to reach the hook part of the strap:(",3.0
"I don't think ""18 inches"" is the best way to describe the length. Once you substantially lock it into a loop, the maximum circumference is about 16"", 15"" for full engagement of the hook-and-loop. In other words, yes the stretched out strap is 18"" long, but the biggest thing you can tie is a 16"" circumference. Otherwise, its fine.",3.0
"On my set, the strap is 18"" long, stem to stern. There is 15"" of black 'loop' material and 2.5"" of red 'hook' stuff (a half inch of buckle). But this isn't like the usual Velcro strap that has the hooks on one side and loops on the other. This strap has the hooks and loops facing the same direction. It has to reverse direction through the buckle for the hooks to face the loops.

This is fine unless the circumference of your stuff is less than 7 inches,.'cause if the strap doubles back on itself till it meets the buckle coming 'round the other way, it runs out of hook stuff.

It's complicated...",3.0
worked great until it broke.  Used as a leg strap for a pilot knee board.  It broke after about 6 months.  I'd check in stores for better selection and sizes.,3.0
"I found it kind of weak, the contact parts are too small, or at least the side that grips,  is overpriced as compared, but mostly it didn't work as i intended, but it may be be perfect for you.",3.0
"When stretched tightly, the hard plastic thread end turns which makes it difficult to thread the end of the strap.  The velcro material closest to the plastic threads needs to be strengthened so that the plastic cannot turn at all.",3.0
"The strap was adequate for what I needed it for. The Velcro itself is very strong. My one nitpick is that the strap material seems cheap, plasticky and rough. I was expecting more of a strong cloth material but it seems to be a polyester.
Also, I do not know what they are calling a handle because this strap simply has the coarse hook portion if the Velcro for about 4 inches on one end, then the remainder of that side of the strap is the soft portion of the Velcro and has a ring on the other end for the strap to feed through and double back. The back side is just the poly strapping material.",3.0
"I would have like to see more adjustment to the hook and bond of the strap itself, ended up taking it to have it altered.",3.0
"This is the only stretch strap Velcro sells.  Not sure what make them decide the 27 inch is the right length.
On one end that has the ring is stitched.  Instead of stitching the ring, I think Velcro shall make it like the other end (with the velcro male button) so the total length can be adjust.",3.0
"I had something quite different when I ordered this strap. However, I was able to adapt it to the job I wanted it to perform therefore the medium rating.",3.0
"It's velcro, what more can you say.
It does what it is supposed to do and works.
more words required.",3.0
I wanted to use the straps for my knife but they are to long and don't attach. im sure I can find a use for them,3.0
I have not used this yet.  I need straps to replace the one on my hurricane shutters.  My present straps are looking like they are going bad.,3.0
"A useful item in every camera bag. I use it to keep things together in my bag, or for attaching modifiers to my strobes.",3.0
"They worked perfectly for what i wanted.  (holding my laptop on my cooling pad at home) but after just a few weeks, one broke and I had to try to figure out something else.  not long lasting in my book.",3.0
Not much to say about the product really. just a velcro strap. I wish the sticky part of the velcro was little longer though. would give better performance when strapped to something narrower in diameter.,3.0
"These 2 velcro straps are smaller than I expected. It says 18 x 1 inches but it barely fits around my knee which measures 16"". To solve the problem I attached them together to make 1 long velcro strap. The stick is pretty good so they do serve their purpose. However, they are very thin (about an inch in width) so their sturdiness is limited. They may be good for holding light items together but not for anything heavy. I would have preferred them to be a bit longer and a bit thicker. Next time I'll try to pay careful attention to the dimensions.",3.0
"I guess it may have just been the velcro that i got, but the adhesive on the back was absolutely terrible. You may want to get some superglue ro make sure it sticks! The front side is great. It's not prickly like most and is very strong, but pulls the actual velcro right off whatever it is on.",3.0
not strong enought to hold up a can crusher. on a wall. it fell off. so disapointed. thought it would be stronger then it was.,3.0
"For some reason this isn't as strong as I was expecting. I don't know if it's my application or the actual product. I am trying to attach my cable box, my modem, my router, etc. to the underside of my credenza. I cut up pieces for each piece of electronics and attached them to the electronics themselves, and the underside of the credenza as needed. I may not be able to apply enough pressure to get the pieces of velcro to get a good enough grasp. The two smaller electronics did stay up. I ultimately had to use more velcro than I wanted to but it did work.",3.0
"The velcro part: A+ great hold 5 stars very strong would highly suggest

The sticky part: F all day long. It stuck for a total of 15 min on a cleaned surface. You will need some kind of double sided tape or glue to get this to stick to anything. It is not very strong.

I bought this accompanied with heavy duty double sided tape to attach a small fire extinguisher to the storage area in my vehicle. The sticky side of the velcro stuck for about a week before it came undone. The double sided tape worked better at holding it in place than this did.",3.0
"The adhesive doesn't work that great in hot temperatures, I live in Florida, I have to use Gorilla glue to get a strong bond, the Velcro part works great",3.0
"I used this to hold my small and almost weightless USB hub in place. I wanted velcro so I could remove it if I had to transport it, but once you remove the velcro, it becomes loose and not as sturdy to hold back in place again! Useless for velcro!",3.0
"This product sticks really well to itself, not as great to other things. Especially if you are trying to make it stick to fabric.  Depends on what you want to use it for.....",3.0
"The Velcro aspect is very strong but the adhesive backing doesn't stick,, it just pulls off",3.0
"The grip of this velcro is much weaker than I expected.  I had hoped to use it to secure guitar effects pedals to my pedalboard, but I don't trust it to do the job.",3.0
"So I bought these to attach my screwdriver bits to my electric screwdriver because my electric screwdriver is not compatable with double sided Phillips/flathead bits. I had to cut Velcro into thin, short strips about 1/8 th wide. Because of the small area on the Velcro after cutting it, the hold was very weak and basically it did not work.

I have used the product in a more normal matter for other applications and the adhesive and Velcro seems to work well. Five stars if you are gonna cut into ""normal"" size strips but I give it 3 due to the lack of versatility.",3.0
"It works, not the best, make a bit of debris when cut, the hold is pretty strong but it doesn't hold the items as tight or flush with the surface as I would like, the give allows the item to move a few cm around. For general use though it is sufficient but for more specific use that need the item to stick and not move, should try other solutions.",3.0
It's okay but not exactly what I needed,3.0
"While the velcro is strong enough, it's actually too strong for the sticky side.  I'm sure if I used it on a completely flat surface, I would have had better luck, but I used it to put a small GPS unit on a laptop.  The GPS unit has a small indent in the bottom and is s smooth rubberized surface inside this slight indention. It looked like it was adhered really well, but when I put it on the other piece of velcro and went to take the two apart again, the sticky side on the uneven surface came right off.",3.0
"Well, I bought this Velcro to hold my Wheelchair cushion in place.
I cleaned the area with rubbing alcohol to get rid of any old adhesive and or dirt.
I cut the Velcro into the size strips that I needed and peeled back the paper to stick them onto my Wheelchair. So far so good.",3.0
It is OK if you do not use it where it gets hot.  Adhesive releases in a hot car or where sun hits it in the summer.,3.0
Nice but not as sticky on the backside as I'd hoped for.,3.0
"I agree with other reviewers who say the adhesive is not strong enough. Everything that I have used this on it has pulled off of,  I have cleaned surfaces with alcohol before applying the adhesive side.  I have even added superglue to it, and it still pulls off.",3.0
"Has multi uses, good product to have around.",3.0
Doesn't stick too well sometimes but it's not the worst velcro I've ever used.,3.0
"Hey, it's Velcro. Great for many things",3.0
"Worked fine the first month I was using it however a few months later, the adhesive backing is slowly peeling/curling on it's own.

This was installed on my orbital buffer and was stored in the garage with the velcro side pointed up vs. underneath the weight of the buffer itself.",3.0
"I found them to be cheap, with substandard glue backing.",3.0
very strong,3.0
Average quality. The soft side of the Velcro doesn't last. If you plan on using this for objects you will remove often get something else.,3.0
The tape does not stick very well to my car's plastic surface.,3.0
I was expecting industrial strength glue.  Wouldn't hold very well on smooth frp.  Disappointing.,3.0
I was expecting a stronger grip between the velcro halves but it gets the job done. I used these to anchor a couple speakers to speaker stands so they don't get knocked off easily.,3.0
"Velcro side works great, but the adhesive is pretty mediocre.",3.0
Strong product. Did what I need it to.,3.0
Does the job it's meant to do. Not great for outdoor uses; after a few weeks with light rain the adhesive backing began to fall apart.,3.0

"FWIW: Have bought lots of this brand over the last two years+ (2011-2014). Hoping to find a better product on Amazon. THIS PRODUCT HAS DEFECTIVE ADHESIVE. Do not buy, its adhesive has pulled away from every application. Kept hoping it would work better...buy something else. Check the one stars for verification. The only thing that has kept it in place is super glue which is not a solution for all applications.",3.0
"The velcro portion is very good but the adhesive on the back is terrible. It doesn't really stick to anything. I bought to for some couch cushions that keep slipping and constantly need readjustment. Since the velcro didn't stick very well to the fabric of the couch, the product wasn't much help. If you do choose to buy this product, I would recommend purchasing a strong adhesive or sewing it directly onto fabric.",3.0
"Nothing wrong with this product, but the exact same item is sold at Walmart for 6.97.

I had a notion that online is always cheaper... no longer true.",3.0
"I'm a musician. One thing musicians like me need alot is velcro, for their pedalboards.

I have a pedaltrain pro board that came with velcro. The velcro the board came with is very nice, solid and holds well. I ran out of velcro and needed an alternative so I purchased this industrial strength velcro.

One thing I'm really not happy about is the funky smell it puts off. I'm certainly not going to use this on my pedals and pedal board. God help me when I zip the pedal board bag shut and come back a day or two after.

If you are going to use this in the open then it's fine. I won't recommend it if you are gonna say place it in your car or pedalboard for example.",3.0
This velcro works very well on my painted walls. However it does not stick well to my ceramic tiles wall.,3.0
I bought this industrial version to replace the standard one in certain locations where it was falling off and I just don't see where is the increased value in paying more money. At best it is 10%-15% stronger but I don't feel it should be called industrial unless they use mastic to adhere it. lol.,3.0
"I went crazy and ordered a bunch of these and used it all over our building and even in my home. Works great on some surfaces but the adhesive is definatley flawed and needs to be fixed in manufacturing. 2 problems: if under pressure, it WILL most certainly eventually come off. Secondly the adhesive, if heated or cooled will adhere to the plastic backing and come off on it instead of the velcro when you go to use it. This happened in my home, not in a furnace so there's clearly some serious quality control issue here.",3.0
"I didn't find any ""Industrial strength"" capabilities of this velcro. Just works as any other velcro. Price may seem a bit high, but included amount is large, will last you for years.",3.0

"The shipping of this product was extremely fast and the fact there was no shipping cost was one of the reasons for my purchase. However, the description of the product is misleading. It is described as a ""heavy"" paper, as opposed to some of the medium weights that are available. It is actually a thin, flimsy paper, not even close to durable or heavy. The quality of the paper did not meet my expectation of what I thought I was ordering based on the product description. Also, there was no invoice printout included in the shipment.",3.0

It did cut easily off the roll for me which was nice. It also came wrapped in two different boxes. I think it would have been fine just to be in the one box but it was nice to have it protected.",3.0

"This paper was ""ok"". It reflected a lot more light than I had wanted, and I should have gone with dedicated photographic paper, instead of this. However, it was less expensive. If you plan to flash colors onto the black for changing background colors, I'd look for  less reflective paper. However, as background paper, it works just fine and is easy to use.",3.0
"Much thinner than I was expecting, couldn't handle the paint I planned to use. Wide enough to fit school classroom doors though, so I will get good use out of it.",3.0
"Dark blue paper was not as dark as the image.  Minimal difference between sides and it isn't really ""heavyweight"" as other reviewers mentioned.",3.0
Getting even a small portion of this on the wall without bubbles or wrinkles is a real challenge and it is difficult to fully erase what you write on it once it is up. However this roll of contact paper is huge for the money and a great value. Once the section we're currently using wears out we'll just replace it with another section from the roll.,3.0

"We bought this to use as a backdrop for a photo shoot. Once you get near the center of the roll, you start to see waves from where it was rolled. You can do things to get rid of that (rolling the opposite direction, ironing on low temp, etc) but they're a pain. For our intents, it didn't work out very well.",3.0
It worked for what we had in mind we covered tables and let children draw on it so it worked for that.,3.0
"I used this paper to make silhouettes for the windows around Halloween. I was disappointed to find that the color was only on one side -- the photo doesn't show both sides of the paper, though now that I look closer at the other colors I guess I could have guessed. The paper was pretty easy to cut, and it held up reasonably well, though I found I had to be more careful than I would have liked, as it was thin enough to tear easily. If I had to do it over again, I'd go for solid black craft paper, which is likely hardier and black through and through.",3.0
Not heavyweight at all. It is just a bit thicker than regular printer paper. It does have dual textures. One side is pretty smooth and the other has a slightly pebbly texture. Decent for entertaining a toddler but does not stand up to getting wet from paint.,3.0
Do not purchase for sewing!! The paper was too thick to see your pattern underneath. Good thick paper but not what I needed.,3.0
"I bought this for covering the tables at my sons western Party and I planned to use the remainder of the roll for my kids to paint and color on. I gave it 3 stars because like another reviewer said, the paper is not true to the color of the picture. The paper is MUCH darker of a brown. If you were planning on getting this for your kids to draw or paint on, don't...its too dark. Its more of a chocolate brown as opposed to the kraft cardboard looking color in the picture. A little disappointing, but it will still work for covering the tables at least.",3.0
"The paper arrived as it should, on time, in a box. The problem was that there was no protection for the bottom ends of the paper, and therefore the edges are crinkled. The paper itself is ""chalky"" meaning it is not very maleable and it scratches or rips easy. There is white on the underside of the green.",3.0
"I bought these to use for photography, it will work fine for what I want, and I'll likely purchase at least one more to make sure because of the good price, but the edges of the paper were damaged from how it was packaged.  It was shipped in a small box just big enough.  I'll update after purchasing the second roll.",3.0
as expected,3.0
It is too thin to be considered heavyweight. The blue seems a bit thicker but the white is almost transparent.,3.0
It is not heavyweight paper....I was very disappointed by the weight of this paper.  I probably won't buy it again.,3.0
"I recently learned to make paper stars at my sons school and the paper I worked with there was vastly superior. I was informed that I needed to simply use something called kite paper which is what this is. And I distinctly remember kites from my childhood made with exactly this paper. However it was more challenging working with this paper while making window stars. I had to be extra careful while holding and folding and it crumpled more easily. The paper I used at my sons school was more forgiving of being handled so much.
I don't know what brand they used. I should ask.

Also, this paper comes in fairly large sheets, so for the purposes of making a window Star you will have to cut it. Which means more handling. So more creases.

It will be excellent use for kites, packing tissue, and I intend using it To wrap gifts as well. Ill just use a few sheets at a time. The size does help in that regard.",3.0
"If I were using these as gift wrap I may have been upset with the state of the packaging. All sheets lay flat (no folds) in the plastic with a piece of card paper to keep them rigid. However the bag is too big and all the sheets were wadded up at one end of the packaging. My OCD would have prevented me from using these for a gift bag.  I got them to use as drawer liners in an old dresser so they will lay flat under all my clothes. Good price for this much tissue paper tho, cant argue with that. They are smaller than your standard size for gift wrapping.",3.0

Well the bleeding tissue does what it says. I tried it on regular paper and canvas it stained the material but didn't dye them as well or as dark as i hoped. Some colors were stained more dominantly than others. When the tissue dried it lightly stained the canvas but was a little brighter on paper. So I decided to leave the tissue on the canvas even though it was a little faded. Here are some pics of what i was trying to do and the tissue is wet on the canvas that's why it looks darker than it really was. I have plenty left so I will try a few different techniques to see what works best,3.0

Theyre good for children but more crayons than oil pastels. They REALLY don't blend well at all. Colors don't mix or melt into one another and wax (WAX) balls and flakes off when you try (blending). Officially disliked. However my young daughter is learning to color and unlike MY better oil pastels... these do not leave color on her face if she sneakily tries tasting as kids are won't to do. For ages 5-6 and under they're good.,3.0

We both are into bible journaling and they work great for my daughter but I didn't care for them as an adult.,3.0

They have a strong smell I associate with petroleum products.  The colors are vibrant and lovely though.,3.0
Nice but a little messy for a young person. Also stains clothing.,3.0
These are OK. I don't have any other oil pastels to compare them to but they don't seem that much better than regular crayons to me.,3.0
not good for younger kids.,3.0
I think my product score is low because I don't have a lot of experience using any oil pastels and have nothing to compare these to. I'll bet the more expensive ones are easier to blend and provide more opaque coverage. These are really tough to blend. I need products that are much easier to work with because of carpal tunnel and weakness in both wrists. Maybe they will work better for most people but they are not my cup of tea.,3.0
"I anticipated for these pastels to go on the paper a little more smoothly. They are still ok, but I would have liked them to be made a little more easy to work with.  (I used them first, before my Grand-kids tried them)",3.0
"Perhaps I'm using them incorrectly, but these oil pastels look and feel like regular crayons to me, except that the colors are applied more easily (with less pressure), and are richer than in regular crayons. I like the silver and gold metalic colors. These are nice quality, but too thick for me, and there aren't enough different colors. The results appear like regular crayons to me, although richer in color. I'd expected the results to resemble paints.",3.0
"Crayola crayons are always amazing quality but I gave this purchase 3 stars because no where in the product description does it mention that these are the large size crayons. I was expecting/thought I was buying regular crayons. I wish I had been informed that these were large ones as I would have preferred the usual size. Heads up to future buyers, make sure you want large crayons before you buy!",3.0
"Prismacolors are nice markers. They aren't the BEST, but they certainly are good for beginners and novices. They are nicely blendable, come in an array of colors, and are double-tipped. They are shaped nicely too, so they are easy to control.

The downsides are as followed:

1. They tend to bleed a little.

2. This set comes with an unbalanced array of colors. There is 1 red, 5 shades of pink, 3 oranges, about 14 skin tones, 3 yellow, 7 shades of green, 2 very distinctly different purples, and 8 blues. It also comes with 2 metallic and 1 black. The others are colors inbetween. This set is best for drawing human figures. The first two rows of the tray are various skin tones. There are no grays nor whites.

3. The tray isn't all that great. Assembly is a bit confusing, and it doesn't stay together as well as it could.

In conclusion, these markers are very nice, although this set should be used soley for drawing bodies or even fashion design. The tray is not worth much more than $5, so if you aren't pressed for space and absolutely need it, buy the set without the tray. It's much cheaper and still worth it.",3.0

"I must say that my rating comes from different places. I give the crayons themselves a 5 star, they are fantastic quality, and I've never had an issue with the labels coming off. I however continue to be extremely disappointed that I've never gotten a box with 100 full sets of crayons. I think the closest I've come is 91 sets. There is always one color of crayon (normally black) that has significantly fewer crayons than the rest.",3.0
"I also was making bundles of 100, and only got about 93. There were, however 800 crayons total but the item descriptions says 100 of each color, which is false. Great buy but if you are trying to make bundles, plan on getting less than expected.",3.0
"Box was not filled as described.  While the full 800 crayons were included (plus 2 extras for a total of 802 crayons), there were not 100 of each color as described which is quite disappointing for our intentions in purchasing this item.  Our exact color breakdown received is as follows:

"As a Kindergarten Teacher this is exactly what I needed for my students.  I do have one complaint, the wrappers have become unglued  from several of the crayons.

Finally, her boyfriend got the caps off so she can use them.  Problem is that she can only use them when he's home because of this problem!  As far as the product is concerned, my niece loves the effect this product brings to her art.  It's just frustrating that the caps are on so tight for her to use all the time.",3.0

"I was a bit dissapointed on the markers as I had high hopes because they are prismacolors. The pigmentation and color is lovely but the blendabilty isn't the best. The butterfly in my photo was just with the prismacolor markers but the ear on my stitch was with the markers after I blended more with my prismacolor colored pencils. I will probably never use the markers on their own and will only use these as an underlying layer of color before applying my colored pencils. They blend in beautiful together, but would not recommend alone.",3.0
"First the PROs:
- The price is great
- The color selection is nice for a 12 pack
- The ink is really great in the sense that it doesn't look stripey and you can go over the same spot a bit without it leaving steaks / darker areas.

The CONS (bought these for use in adult coloring books so these may not be cons for everyone):
- The chisel side tends to be dry/ uneven. It is difficult to get a clean line without gaps even when applying substantial pressure
- Some of the chisels tip sides are very dry
- The fine tips are a bit too big for fine lines
- Some of the fine tips are VERY inky making it impossible to stay in the lines. You may stay in the lines, but a few seconds later - it will seep and bleed around it.
- The fine tips are inconsistent in inkyness, so even if you could learn to stay a bit away from the line to avoid the bleed - when you switch colors, the amount of bleed changes.
-They bleed through even thick high quality paper. If you are using this in an adult coloring book, the image on the back will be unusable and if you don't put an extra page in between - it will likely bleed across not only to the back, but the next page.

If you want to use these in an adult coloring book, I do not recommend them. I may try an EXTRA fine point version in the future because I did like the way the overlap of ink didn't create streaks.
If you want to count on the chisel tip, YMMV. I would not recommend
If you want to use the fine tip for sketching things that don't require the lines to stay thin and not bleed, these are great.",3.0

"I LOVE prismacolor colored pencils. They're noticeably better when it comes to performance versus basic colored pencils. That said, I wasn't impressed at all with these markers. Let me explain...

I was looking for a higher end marker that was comparable to Copics. Copics are amazing--but also incredibly expensive and I absolutely cannot afford them (although if I could, I would have bought those instead.) As I said, I love prismacolor colored pencils and so I figured the markers would be just as good as those in comparison and a good alternative to Copics. They were not.

Pros: vibrant color, minimal streaking. I also really like the fine tip.

Cons: otherwise no different than any other marker, they bleed through the thickest of paper, still on the pricey side for the quality, and they're very, very wet.

I did buy the chisel tips (at the request of my son as they're something we share) and I think the brush tips would probably be a better option for me, personally. I will most likely buy for myself, the brush tip markers and see if I have a better experience.",3.0
I've been using prismacolor markers for years - price was great - what's not to love.  I'll tell you - THE CAPS!  Guys really?  they are slick and have no grip.  I find them very difficult to remove.  kind of a let down given the company.,3.0

Don't know if the box has been sitting in a hot warehouse or what. Contacted the manufacturer who subsequently sent two replacement sets but neither of them would open either. I will get my handyman to try to pry them off with pliers, then maybe lube the inside of the caps and hope the ink does not become contaminated. I am very disappointed and cannot recommend these in good faith unless you buy them in person at a store and try to uncap them first.. Once we got the caps off with pliers, they are still not too easy to uncap but usable. The color quality is fantastic. However, they are very expensive IMHO so I only buy a few now and then locally when they are on sale. I've switched to another brand that is much ore reasonable.",3.0
"I like the set a lot, I've produced a lot of fun artwork with it. You can really do a lot with them to get all kinds of shades that you wouldn't as easily with other sets. I found that about 8 of the markers were either dried out completely or one side was dried out so buyer beware I guess.",3.0
"I really feel to get the best use of these markers you really have to be trained. I had to get them as part of a class I was taking.

I really had difficulty using these. I purchased the blending marker with it. But it seemed like the ink went on heavy and dried way too fast making it hard to blend.

But it may have been my lack of training. I wish I had gone with cheaper markers like the the majority  of my class did.

I really want to learn to use these because they are supposed to be among the rest.",3.0

"Prismacolor markers in general are lovely, exceptional markers. However, the set I received had two issues. I received two PM 6 (red) markers rather than one PM 6 and one PM 4, as was listed on the back of the box. Also, the black marker chisel tip has a chunk out of it, so that it doesn't put down a clean stroke. It's annoying to receive a flawed product when I'm paying this much for markers.",3.0
"First, the markers...I was excited to order these. Unfortunately, a few were dry, and a few more were absolutely un-cappable. As in, the cap would NOT come off.  I tried and tried, and I had very strong man also try, to no avail. I did not test all of the markers, but of the 20 or so that I did test, 2 were very dry and 4 had fine tips that I could not test because the caps would not come off. I quickly got frustrated and decided that for the price I had paid, this was unacceptable and I had to return them. I am considering ordering another set, because the ones that worked were nice. I liked that they colored evenly with great saturation, though I recognize from other reviews that some people prefer less saturation. I tried 4 purples and noticed that two of them were barely discernible from each other, but overall the colors I tried were beautiful.

Now for Amazon's customer service.  What is going on lately?? The last few weeks I have had multiple issues with incorret delivery charges and late arrivals. In this particular case, I got my order in and received my confirmation prior to the Free Same Day Delivery deadline - only to notice when reviewing my order that they would not arrive for 3 days. I called customer service and spent an hour and a half trying to get this straightened out, but I was told it must be my fault, I must not have selected that option (but I KNOW I did because I double-checked prior to submitting my order), and that at this point there was nothing they could do to get them to me on time. Eventually we decided I should cancel the entire order and reorder the markers to get them to me by the NEXT day - still later than I needed them, but that was my only option. I was told that because I had paid for the markers with a gift card, my credit would show up on my gift card balance within an hour, allowing me to apply te credit to the reorder.  However, hours later, it had still not shown up, and at that time I realized I had never received an email confirmation that the credit was coming. I had to call back twice to get it to show up. Ultimately, I WAS given a $10 credit for all of my trouble, which I applied to my reorder.  But a week later when I decided I needed to return them due to defect, I was told that I had to forfeit that credit because ""promotional credits are not refundable"". I could have accepted that, except that they also tried to tell me that SALES TAX is not refundable. I'm sorry, WHAT?? After two phone calls, during which I wasted over two hours of my time talking to two representatives and a supervisor, I was FINALLY able to get the full refund I was entitled to BY LAW - but it should not have taken that much effort on my part. Amazon's customer service has always been better than this. I don't know what's happening, but I'm sad about it.",3.0
"these markers have really solid color on 100lb bristol smooth. The only down side is that the colors are not good for shading. only the red, blue and orange color ranges in this set have good combinations for doing a piece with a base color, highlight and shade. i have tried ordering more markers for doing hair with shading and highlighting but after purchasing ten more markers, i couldn't find a combination that looked right. I would say prisma color markers are so-so. good if you only need to use one color but if you need to do highlighting and shading, then you may be better off with colored pencils.",3.0

"I love the Prismacolor Premier Illustration Markers, Brush Tip, Set of 8 Assorted Colors (1736674) ones by Prismacolor, but they didn't have the expanded color palette I needed. So I branched out and got these double-ended ones. I did NOT like them at all.

For clarification, I am NOT an artist - this review is solely based on my use of them for Adult Coloring Books. Specifically, the Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt and Coloring Book.

BUT, I do NOT like the Double Tipped Markers. I DID like that these markers come in TONS of colors. I even went and bought some that were the single markers just to get some extra colors - like the light blue in the photo. Unfortunately, they don't write/draw/color at all like the 'brush tips;' which are awesome. These are firm and clumsy for fine detail coloring. Additionally, I didn't like the thickness of these in my hand - they're really wide.

Most importantly, I was SO DISAPPOINTED to realize these big fat markers by Prismacolor BLEED. On one page, I used all brush tip markers EXCEPT for some spots of light blue. It was a lighter color than all the others, and made by the same company, so surely (I thought) it wouldn't bleed. It did - see photos. The first photos are a page colored with the standard brush tips by Prismacolor. They didn't bleed. I used ONE of the Double-Ended Brush Tips (THIS type of marker), the light blue, and it DID bleed. The owl image is the backside of that same page. So sad. I hope this review is helpful to others considering these markers for the same purpose. Now, if you're an artist or designer, you may have a completely different experience. I found these inferior to the single-ended brush tip markers by Prismacolor... (The brush tips I DID like are shown in the last two photos - the ones I  DID like colored MOST of this page - the LIGHT blue was this marker, which bled.)

Net, Prismacolor markers are great. Just know they have a wide variety of markers, for different uses. Just know your best use for each set and you'll be happy.",3.0

Love my prisma colors but the metallic silver seems to have dried out. Even the gold was not working well despite shaking it up a billion times to get it to work...no luck.

"These markers are high quality and this set has a great range of colors to choose from. This is great for someone beginning to use such markers to practice with.

These are the downsides in my opinion:

Having 2 tips are nice and it's creative how they designed the tips, but these tip's are still very limited in what they can do compared to their competition in Copic markers. A brush tip is just more flexible in what is possible.

Not being refillable makes these markers more expensive over the long haul if you need to buy them again.

These limitations relative to the equivalent Copic markers makes these markers feel more like they're for beginners who want a cheaper way to experiment with this medium.

I don't think I would recommend this to someone who uses this medium a lot unless expense isn't a big deal.

As for the tip/nib design, I believe that's personal opinion. I see it as a downside, but others may like that you get a choice of very defined and controlled lines. You get a total of 4 line thickness levels, 3 on the big side and 1 on the small side. I would probably like a brush with variable line thickness levels more, but that's my personal choice.",3.0
"I thought Prismacolor could do no wrong.  As I love their colored pencils I ordered the colored markers. Good variety of colors, but they saturate the paper and bleed through, something that Sakura products do not do.  I have to use heavier paper, though it still bleeds and put scrap piece of paper behind what I am working on regardless if it is in a tablet or on a drawing board.  Because of this I tend to use the product less which is a waste.",3.0
"I have not enjoyed these much mostly because I use the prismacolor pencils. I will have to practice more. However my initial reaction was ""what makes these markers so different from other markers?'
If you use markers as your medium, you may enjoy them more than I have.",3.0
"These markers didn't do the job for me. This set of markers had the right exact colors to begin with but the quality felt like if I was painting with a sharpie. The ink is really strong which won't make it blend well. One of my biggest concerns was that you had to fill the space in a fast manner because if it dried up and u went back with the marker, it would create a very darker shade and that pissed me off and ruined my drawing. Overall, if you're not willing to spend almost another $100 bucks for a good 36 set of Copic Markers then you might want to try these. But for me, these markers didn't really cut it.",3.0
"I received my box, and it only included 199 markers. One marker was doubled, so I am missing two markers. PM-101 and PM-105. I believe this was in it's original box with the shrink wrap, so mistake from the manufacturer??? The markers that I do have seem solid.

EDIT: We contacted the seller and they sent us the missing markers.",3.0
these markers are good for the price but I don't know if I am using them wrong or the markers just have issues but they dry out fast. Not permenantly but if Im drawing or coloring a picture and I don't lay off the ink it will dry out. I have to wait a few min in order for the marker to get its ink supply back in. The color consistancy is good and I cant complain based on the price. I would like to try copics or specturm noir next time when these run out.,3.0
"The color palette is great, however the fine tip is not quite as fine as I was expecting and the ink tends to bleed out of the paper -- this was a bummer as I purchased these to make signs, and it is difficult to do intricate lettering and styling with the smaller point",3.0
"As I noted in my other reviews, Prismas are considered one of the top professional markers (the others being Copic and Chartpak).

Prismacolor PROs:
- professional grade markers
- two nibs allowing various line quality
- most economical/cheap of the major professional marker brands, especially when bought in a set (around $2 per marker)

Prismacolor CONs:
- in my opinion, dries too quickly and too much color saturation

Prismacolor markers seem to be the most color-centrated. Prismacolor markers dry much quicker and are much darker initially, and I find it a little harder to control the saturation of these markers and also the ability to blend these markers easily. I feel like these would be a good choice for comic book illustrators who are looking for strong bold colors, but for people who like to render in more subtle color, you should choose Copic or Chartpak.

I feel that in sets like this, it's actually a better choice to buy markers individually. Local art stores often have better deals than on Amazon, and being able to choose the colors you want is priceless. Some of the colors in this set are sometimes not right for what I want to render (and some of the browns are too dry looking), so I prefer to buy my markers individually (and with store coupons/membership cards, they can be under $2 a marker). For the price of this set, you could get an equal set of individual markers with colors of your own choosing. Remember to bring/buy marker paper to test the color of the markers, because the colors on the packages are often misleading.",3.0
"There are three major professional markers that everyone recommends: Copic ($5 per marker), Chartpak ($3 per marker), and Prismacolor ($2 per marker). (I've also heard recommendations for Shinhan Touch, but I haven't tried those.) And, if you live in the NYC metro area, art stores such as Utrecht and Blick have their own generic brands.

Prismacolor PROs:
- professional grade markers
- two nibs allowing various line quality
- most economical/cheap of the major professional marker brands, especially when bought in a set (around $2 per marker)

Prismacolor CONs:
- in my opinion, dries too quickly and too much color saturation

In my experience:
Of the three brands, Prismacolor markers seem to be the most color-centrated. (By that, I mean that it takes fewer strokes of this marker to get to a saturation of color that may take another marker several strokes.) Because of this, Prismacolor markers dry much quicker and are much darker initially, and I find it a little harder to control the saturation of these markers and also the ability to blend these markers easily. Also, when using with marker paper (Borden & Riley Visual Layout Bond #37 or Bienfang Graphics 360), I find that Prismacolors soak thru several sheets more quickly than other marker brands, which becomes expensive for students or professionals who have to buy their own supplies. I feel like these would be a good choice for comic book illustrators who are looking for strong bold colors, but for people who like to render in more subtle color, you should choose Copic or Chartpak.

My favorite is Chartpak because I like to layer on my markers in a more impressionistic style and I find them easier to blend and right for the price. Copics are the most expensive, but many argue the best quality (especially with it's brush tip that allows beautiful effects that aren't as easily achieved with a regular marker nib). I would also recommend going to your local art store to try out the store brands, because they are often cheaper and the quality is okay for students and beginning professionals.",3.0
"I'm not an artist, I just love to colour. I have a lot of different kinds of coloring media and I use Dover, Pomegranate, and Mindware coloring books. I'm not so much concerned with the blending capabilities of these markers as I am with their abilty to lay down smoothly on the paper without leaving streaks and ink pools. For me, these markers have not performed as well as the Sharpie Brush Tip markers when it came to just coloring. I have not used them for artistic projects because as I mentioned before, I'm not an artist, so I can't judge them in that respect, but I do appreciate a good marker. The ink flow is very good, almost too good, sometimes too much ink flows out and you get those dark ink dots on your page. What I have noticed with this set is that the chisel end is large and a little awkward to use, like you don't have as much control over your strokes. Also, the tip of the chisel gets dull/soft easily, so you have a squished point like you get when you press too hard on your marker. The other end of the marker is much better for detail work, but you do get more ink pool dots and streaks. I've posted a page from Mindware Classic Mosaics in my account so you can see how the ink lays down. I probably won't spend the money again to get these markers, I'm much happier with my Sharpies for what I do.",3.0
"I was hoping for the best as there are so many good reviews but these pens were DRY. I one starred and it was never posted! So--here is a three star for their quick refund of my money after I sent it back. But every pen I opened was dry at a ratio of about 1 working to -7dry. I return mailed tham back. I do not know why these were dry as no one else seems to have had this problem---or the one star reviews are never posted?  So be aware of the fact that you might get a lemon batch too. At least they refunded money quickly to my credit card.
Reordered one year later and SAME! got refunded at least.",3.0
"Prismacolor art markers are supposed to be high end professional markers, not great like Copic markers but can pass as good if you are in a hurry. If you really want more subtle blending and control of colors/hues it will be expensive to purchase the entire 156 color set. But Copic is a way better product and has more options of application. Do some research and find which art marker works for you-and your wallet.",3.0
"The reason I gave a lower rating was NOT because of the marker quality. I love prismacolor markers, they're not copics, but they do justice with a great color variety, blending, and more importantly, price.

But when buying this product, I would tell people to make sure they count them to make sure they're all there! I thought maybe it was just me, but after putting them all in order I noticed I was missing PM-25, Spring green. I asked Amazon's service if they could just send me the missing marker, but apparently all they could do was give me a refund. I decided against the refund because I still got 71 out of the 72 and I only paid half the price due to Christmas (thank you gift cards).

Eitherway, great product, fast shipping, just make sure you count them accordingly, because you might miss one without noticing it (72 markers are quite a handful afterall).",3.0

They look nothing like the colors that are on the labels themselves, its like whoever filled my set filled the ink with a different color than what was on the label. I will now have to buy an additional set of skin tone markers for my characters. I wish I would have just saved myself the money and would have kept doing my drawings on the computer like I have done in the past. I bought these because it was a good deal and I thought it would be nice if I turned in some hand colored items instead of just computer generated items. I think I will stick to the computer generated items, at least I know what color the color on the computer will turn out. Highly disappointed with this purchase.",3.0

"I am an artist and art teacher and I have used the Prismacolor markers for 6 years now at the art school where I work with children. We go through a lot of markers. Some of the colors dry out faster than others, such as the light blue and the light green. These markers do go on well, give a concise line and look wet and bold at first. I have also found that the colors will fade as other reviewers mentioned.
I am thinking of purchasing a set of 48 for my personal use, but am concerned the colors will dry out over time. I have had a set of Design 2 markers (96 count which I paid $100 for in 1994) and LOVE these markers. Finally after 15 years my Design 2 Markers are drying out! I got 15 years out of the Design 2 markers! I only wish they were still on the market,as they were also double ended and had a beautiful array of colors, and also a nice chisel tip. Prismacolor is the closest I can find so far for the price. I read Chartpak and Copic are other markers to consider, but their price is double that of Prismacolor. These markers get the job done, are better than Crayola for sure, but in the long run I wish there was another option on the market that matched my Design2 brand!",3.0
"I was completely blown away by these pens when I first found them...the colours are vibrant and they blend beautifully - and they're just so pleasurable to use! BUT they fade really badly in sunlight.  When I noticed that the lilac in one of my pictures was fading and turning pink I made a test sheet of all the colours I owned and left it in the sun, covering half of each colour with card so I would be able to see the difference.  I was shocked by how much some of the colours faded in just a couple of weeks.  By the time two or three months had passed all the colours except black had faded very obviously. I now feel I have no choice but to keep my prismacolor marker artwork in the dark, even though it's some of my best work!",3.0
"As far as the markers go I give those five stars, wide color range, the double end allows one to draw 4 different lines & Prisma uses a low odor alcohol as solvent, so they don't have the harmful stink of old type markers.

These markers claim to be washable... unless your kiddo is anything like mine and colors all over themselves with marker every time they get their hands on one.

"I did not realize that these are not the classic colors, they are completely different, and there is no black marker, so with teaching line drawings we ended up purchasing another box only this time with the classic colors.

"I have found most Fiskar shears to be of good quality over the years... and I loved this specific model for quite a while.

"I really like these scissors, they're easy to use, cut well and most importantly: are easy on the hands. I got these because my mother purchased a pair for herself due to her arthritis and I really liked them. I would recommend them to anyone with arthritis or anyone who has to use scissors quite a bit. It takes a lot less force to make a cut so they don't fatigue the hand the way regular scissors do, and are particular easy on the thumbs since most of the cutting action is done by the fingers and the thumb is not surrounded by the handle creating painful pressure points.

The big caveat: the locking mechanism is weak. The first pair I ordered would not lock right out of the package. It actually sprung open as I got them out. I had to return it for a replacement. Just now as I was sitting at my desk they sprung open and startled me. I think that the orange plastic of the lock has worn down the ridges on the handle that locks it in place. I'm very disappointed and will probably contact the company so they can do something about it. After two failed locks, one from light use and another from no use at all, I won't be purchasing another pair until changes are made.",3.0

This has turned what would have been a five-star review into a three-star, as it happens a lot and is very annoying.

I bought them to repaint the debossed letters in my old car's switches, which were faded or yellowish after so many years and these did the trick. However, since they are not very precise, I had to clean up a lot of paint after each application. A rag with just a few drops of WD-40 works.",3.0

It comes off even after baking but the colors look great!,3.0
"Some colors turn different shades after oven drying.  Red is dark hot pink, orange is pinkish... However, I experienced this with the Sharpie ones also. Now, these are cheaper but they are also much thinner so I guess they have less paint than the Sharpies. They also tend to run when using so you have to be careful or you will get a blob of paint.  It didn't happen all the time and I just learned to blot before using. Overall, it was nice to have the range of colors for what I needed it for without the price tag.",3.0

"I bought these for making simple little signs.  Though they seem to work alright, when I used them for an outdoor sign they faded quickly and look terrible.  Hopefully the signs that are indoors will hold up.",3.0
"I'm a little disappointed in these after having seen great reviews. They are very waxy with lots of bit of the crayons flaking off when you are drawing. When you draw with them and then go over the color with a water brush, only a little of the pigment is released, leaving distinct lines on the paper.  When smudging with my finger, the colors blended, but only where the paper did not yet have color. The original blocks of color remained distinct. Fine for children as it's quite inexpensive and it's just another medium to expand their creativity.

"I chose these water soluable oil pastels for a student I mentor one day per week.  They are not as water soluable as Caran D'Ache watercolor crayons, but the color choice is good and the crayons add some umph! in our mixed media work.  The price is great for such a variety of colors.",3.0
"I was sooo looking forward to using these.  I opened them today and a brown was broken at the tip, the black is split at the tip, and the rest are breaking at the perforations further down the stick that are there for when you use the rest of the coloring stick.  I started a coloring page with them and having a good time, but I think I will purchase a better quality and I can see this is going to get annoying.",3.0
"I purchased these after reading a few blogs and watching a few instructional videos. The price was nice and I was curious to know how these compare to water soluble pencils and other water soluble crayons I own. These were only so-so. Specifically, only two of the 24 seem to blend nicely when water is applied. Keep in mind, I have only done one test page, but I wanted to share my first impressions. I am going to keep using these crayons to see if I can improve my results.",3.0
"The quality of the pencils is acceptable, but when water is added the color is not as smooth as I would like it to be.",3.0
"These water-soluble pastels are okay, but truthfully, I would rather have spent my money on a set of regular oil pastels, had I known they were just average. I hope I am not rushing to judgment, as I have not worked extensively with these yet, but so far they don't seem to be a stand alone product. They will, however, work well with watercolor pencils or with combinations of other materials I think. Having said that, for the twelve bucks I spent, this was not a bad investment. I will probably buy them again, but this time I will know what I am getting. I wouldn't recommend paying much more than that though.",3.0

"These colors are not really special colors for skin tone.  They are just part of the original 64 color set (or whatever is the highest number)with 8 colors similar to skin tone (like peach and terra cotta- have you EVER seen a peach person?) pulled out.  There is another brand that amazon sells that does, indeed, sell 8 special realistic flesh colors.  They come in crayons, markers and color pencils as crayolas do.  Just look up ""multicultural crayons"" to find them.",3.0

I LOVE this idea.  Sad to me that they include white and black crayons since those aren't really the colors of anyone's skin.  Seems like Crayola could have used this opp to help kids see the art of real variation in skin tones. Better to leave the 'white'  and 'black' crayons in the regular box for coloring in ghosts and black cats.,3.0
"These are ok but I thought they used to be different. This is just a package with like the colors, apricot, white (now really...who is white white???), black (again, who is black black????), sepia, mahogany, peach, burnt sienna and tan. I mean, they are ok but they are in other packs so this was kind of worthless to have in a separate pack, at least imho.",3.0
"When they say large, they mean regular crayons size. When they say skin tones, they mean the ones you probably already had access to in the big box. As a teacher of young students I will use them but was disappointed that they weren't closer to skin tones in my class. Not really worth the expense.",3.0
"The colors are fine, but the crayons are very thin and the tips break off easily.  Next time, I'll try thicker crayons.",3.0
"I just got this little machine home. It was $20 at Target and I had a $5.00 coupon.  I have been reading about using mini machines for crafting and paper stitching, so that's what I intend to do with this one and why I bought it (and because it's very lightweight and battery powered, but comes with an adapter.)  I have an older Pfaff electronic sewing machine, which I love and use for regular sewing.  I've only tried this one out on the little piece of cotton it came with so far.  I'm actually amazed it sews at all.  The uppper thread has snapped a couple of times, but it's cheap thread (the thread it came with.) And the light dims when I begin to sew, but it actually does stitch OK so far.

If it doesn't work well on paper, which I'll try next, I'll probably return it, but so far I'm not that disappointed for a $20 machine.

My advice:  If you are serious about sewing and looking for your first machine, spend about $30 to $50 more and get a real machine (or for $100 you can get any number of great machines, and it will be worth the investment.)  The reviews I've read for mini-machines recommend the Janome Sew Mini.  It gets very good reviews and sells for about $60 or sometimes less.  This one's just for fun or crafts. I would NOT depend on this one for important sewing, but OK otherwise.  Do your research before you buy.",3.0
"i would avoid the non photo blue pencil for sketching, it doesnt erase well and if you press too hard the color comes out a bit too strong for my liking.",3.0
"Not a huge fan of Prisma's non-photo blue, but it was partly my error as I didn't realize it was a soft lead. The lead was so soft that even a light sketch would come out dark and heavy, and the lead broke so often that I blew through 2/3 of the pencil sketching one comic. The point of non-photo blue is to not show up in a scanned copy, allowing outlines to be isolated easily. The dark marks left by this pencil actually showed up as a light gray after scanning, requiring extra clean up with my art software.

Overall, not my fave. It would probably work fine as color in a traditional piece, but it's not great for scanning.",3.0

"I ordered these scissors at the end of December and according to the shipping details, I should have received them by the first few days of Jan. Then I noticed a sale in a local fabric store so I decided to purchase a second pair. Thank goodness I bought that second pair! I used these scissors to snip a rag quilt and as all the blogs have suggested, these scissors were a hand saver! They have also become my favorite pair to keep next to my machine to snip threads as I go.

Every few days I would check on the shipping to see the status of my original pair I ordered. According to the USPS website, my scissors stayed in the middle of the country for over three weeks. I should have received them by Jan 3rd. On Jan 14th, they made it to the state I live in, and almost two weeks later, they finally arrived the last week of Jan, almost five weeks after I ordered them.

By the time they arrived, I had long finished the quilt I originally purchased them for. And there were no snow storms across my state throughout the month to delay the delivery. Before I order without Amazon Prime in the future, I will think twice if I am willing to wait so long for USPS. That was very, very frustrating to track my package for five weeks, and to find that the USPS website was not accurate, per my calls to my local town office, who could find out better info than I could on the public website.",3.0

Tried calling the toll-free support number, but could only leave messages. (I hope someone will call back.) Finally (so far) it seems that we might have been trying to feed the material under the needle too quickly. Once we learned to guide it very gently without rushing it, the machine seems to be working fine.",3.0

I have been sewing since I was a little girl - probably 10 or so and I am now 60!!!  This machine reminded me of my first machine as a child......it stitches a nice stitch and is easy to thread and wind the bobbin.

Possible issues: (1) material may have been too thick, and I was trying to stitch 3 layers together (2) you have to go fairly slow or it won't put down a stitch, (3) tension issues? So it's not perfect, but given that having pants hemmed in my town costs $15+, this is what I needed.

These paint brushes are fine for small jobs and craft projects. If you use the brush a few times for different projects it starts to fall apart.

I bought these thinking they will last as long as the more expensive foam brushes I bought at hardware stores such as Lowes or Home Depot. They do the job but only half the quality time. The tabs that are built in the middle of the foam tend to wear through the foam quickly and I use foam brushes all the time. They are great for a quick application where you do not use them for very long like over an hour as the tabs will work their way through the foam. You get a whole load of brushes but you will use them quickly. I used them for staining my cabinets and they were not worth another buy as they broke down faster than normal.,3.0
"Bought these because they were at a great price.  For foam brushes, they are acceptable at best.  I have used three out of my set and each of them seem to start coming apart in the middle of finishing my project.  I started noticing little pieces of foam stuck to the finish I was applying.  Like I said, acceptable...if you want something to apply a fine finish, better look for something else.",3.0
"The very first time I picked up this knife, already I was finding the cap wouldn't stay on after using it. And it keeps getting worse.

X-Acto blades (if replaced frequently, as they should be) are dangerously sharp. Yet this pen doesn't come in a case; it has a cap. Only a cap.

You'd think they would have designed its cap to fit snugly, right?

No. Not this one.

Yet another excellent knife from X-Acto: but packaged in a way which makes no sense.

Don't put it in your pocket.",3.0
"The lid comes off this constantly. Doesn't snap on. Given how sharp it is, that's kind of annoying.",3.0
"This is the first X-Acto knife I've had, and I'm not all that impressed, frankly.  The blade has come loose twice with enough pressure, so I don't really trust it.  I twist the handle tight, but maybe they're made for lighter work, or I don't know how to use it right.  I don't even try to keep the cap on the back, so it'll go missing soon and once the cap is gone I'll have to store it in a safer place.",3.0
"I love the weight and feel of it, but the blade comes out really easily. It gets a little frustrating.",3.0
"Got this for my husband's model car kit I ordered him. He says the X-Acto knife itself works great, but the cap was already broken in the package (though not shattered) so it doesn't stay over the blade to protect it. So, product works good, just can't cover the blade for safety.",3.0
Was super excited to get this item and a bit disappointed to receive it.  I tried to replace the blade with the #11 that I had on hand and it wouldn't allow the cap to fit back on.  Turns out that it only accepts one blade size - anything else renders the cap useless.  Had to order special blades for this item.,3.0
"junk cap, knife was dull in a few mins of cutting threads",3.0
"Fairly comfortable, but the blade continuously loosens.",3.0
"I've used Xacto knives (and their off brand cousins) for years now, mostly #1 and #2 knife handles.  Solid, dependable, but also kinda hard on your hands after a few hours of use. So when I saw a rubber sleeved version, even for a few dollars more, I figured it was worth a try. And its not too bad, but it suffers from a few design flaws that had me reaching for the old faithfuls after a while.

1. The cap - yeah it isn't very secure on the knife.  If you're used to the clear plastic caps of old that slide down over the knurled grip about an inch, this will seem very poorly secured by comparison. It looks like it will stay, but a bit of sideways force applied to the top of the cap and off it comes. The cap does fit onto the back end (I guess so you don't lose it), but it's even less secure there and will fall off with the slightest touch. No good.

2. Collet design - the biggest downfall of the design for me is the new version of the usual collet-and-sleeve blade clamp.  In theory its the same as the old handles, but the increased sleeve length and the radial space between the collet and sleeve means that if you apply much force to the blade to cut something, the whole clamp assembly moves sideways. With the old handles, once the blade is clamped in place, the clamping end and main shaft are like one solid piece of metal. With the new design, the gap between collet and sleeve means too much force ends up being applied to the thread of the collet and it can't resist it.  The sleeve pushes the collet until the threaded end of the collect moves in the main shaft.  Its hard to describe well, but once you've had it happen to you a few times, you'll understand.

Increasing the tension on the clamp (ie. tighten the clamp as much as possible) during blade installation helps to overcome this somewhat, but the rubber sleeve is not well bonded to the metal sleeve inside it and will soon be spinning around it, rather than moving as one unit.  Squeeze that rubber hard (or maybe re-glue it to it's metal sleeve), it's the only way you get the clamp tight enough.

The rubber sleeve on main shaft is nice, and comfortable and stops the handle from rolling away on the table.

This knife is fine for light duty cutting where the usual Xacto precision is needed, but not too much force is applied (stencil cutting, paper and construction paper work). The rubber gives pretty good grip and added comfort.  But since the rubber comes loose from the metal support fairly quickly after some use, it sometimes wants to rotate slightly in my hand, which I don't care for.

Overall, not made to the usual bullet-proof standards I expect from Xacto, so I was a bit disappointed.  I'll probably either hack the handle so its more durable/rigid under my kind of use or add some kind of rubber grip to my trusty #1 (maybe Plasti-Dip?)",3.0
Two of the brushes snapped and they cannot handle even moderate pressure or grit. But a fair product for the price.,3.0
"These are okay, not great.  The equivalent foam brushes I get at Home Depot hold up a lot longer, but for quick little things, these are fine.  I may buy them them again, I may not.  I really don't feel strongly either way.  I probably will buy again.",3.0
"Works as advertised -- can hold two sweaters, but forget about ever getting it back into the compact shape it arrived in. The folding instructions are vague and ultimately useless as there are no pictures to accompany the text.

"I had hoped to hang it from the bar of a rolling coat hanger/dress hanger thingy. Boy, was I wrong! Yes, it hangs only a short way from the hanging device and can't be fitted on the rolling thing. I am trying to figure out where I could find something, a pole or a rope?, to put it. I am definitely disappointed in the huge size of it. I wanted it narrower and with longer  hanging ""ropes."" I should have sent it back.
  The thing is of good quality and I am sure it will work well if I can find a place to hang it. Maybe I could hang it in the bathroom from the shower curtain pole.  Hmmm.",3.0
"While this has enough room for a sweater, the whole thing is actually a bit too wide for a standard size tup rod to hang on. I don't have anything else in my home to hang it on.",3.0
"This turned out to be bigger than my shower because the rim you see in the picture with socks hanging from it is not really hanging down, it sits level with the mesh bar making the circumference of the whole thing bigger.  Also, in the picture it looks like it hangs down from the bar well.  In reality, the cords are shorter and so it's much higher and closer to the bar, I could not reach up there to lay the clothes on even if it had fit my shower.  I gave it three stars because I like that the mesh part is long enough to put a dress or a maxi skirt on it.  I will keep it.  I plan to do ""surgery"" on it.  I will cut off the bottom ring and I will make the hanging cords longer and then I believe I'll be happy with it.",3.0
"For some purposes, it might be fine, but I have a heavy cotton shirt that is too heavy, and the netting just sags in the middle, so when the shirt drains, it drains to the center of the garment - not an efficient way to dry.  I think I will build a rack made with PVC pipe and perhaps put some rebar or light angle iron inside the pipe for extra strength.  I can make it to the exact size of my tub, make the legs detachable, etc...",3.0
"It's really large...it goes from wall to wall in my standard-sized tub/shower, hanging on the curtain rod. Only half of it is over the tub, so the wet clothes drip onto the floor. Not a huge deal since I get as much excess water out before arranging on the dryer. Also, the bathroom sink is right next to the tub, so it's kind of in the way. Luckily it folds up small.

It is hard to see what the dryer is like in the photo, so I'll try to describe. The main mesh is similar to the kind on those cheap laundry bags for dorm rooms. I had though the mesh was more fine. The hanging rod around the mesh is pretty much thin wire encased in a loose white vinyl....this part, to me looks kind of chintzy. The straps are unremarkable nylon straps. It's not as attractive as I hoped, but I appreciate all the surface area.

One of the biggest issues is that it hangs high. Shorter people would need a stool to arrange the clothes. Also, you have to make sure the clothes are evenly placed otherwise it will tip.

This is my first hanging dryer. It works, but it's not exactly what I hoped for.",3.0
"While I'm sure this works just fine, it's not large enough for plus sized clothes (2X or 22-24). It was too large for my tiny bathroom's shower curtain rod.",3.0
"It's a tight fit in our shower space, but it works as expected and allows me to air-dry several articles of clothing at one time. My main issue is that only 2-3 sweaters will fit across the top at one time (we have *many* lay-flat-to-dry items), and based on the design of this product, I cannot use other hanging dryers at the same time (I wish there was an option to go vertical with this!). In addition, I've noticed the mesh is starting to sag a bit in the middle; but it's still usable.

As other reviews warn, be careful when opening this from its collapsed storage position. It springs open rather quickly and can hit someone (say, a little kid, a pet or spouse) who is standing too close (yourself included). I usually toss the product away from me to open it. :)",3.0

I've often encountered difficulty in installing Xyron refill cartridge refills.  But this one was by far the most difficult.  I wasted much of the actual magnet refill trying to install it.

"I have been thinking about decorating my car with different Cricut-produced themes just for the fun of it.  (""Cricuts"" are home/office die-cutting systems, many of which are available here on Amazon.) Since there is an entire car to work with, I started looking at magnets as a way to stick things temporarily to the car's body without doing any damage.  I've had Xyron machines for a long time, so I decided to try this laminate/magnet cartridge first.  Since this cartridge probably wasn't intended to be use this way, I also decided to work with inkjet printed items because they were (1) easier to produce, (2) would be lighter/thinner than die-cuts, and (3) are a lot cheaper if they drop off the car or have to be pitched.

The first experiment was a ""Happy Holidays"" banner, which worked very well on the vertical part of the trunk until it rained.  The magnet stayed stuck to the metal perfectly; it was the rain getting between the laminate and the magnet material that was the problem.  I had left about a 1/8"" margin around the edges and, even though I burnished it like crazy, the rain thoroughly soaked the paper, though the ink never ran.  I thought about letting it stay on the car to see if it would dry, but knew that that probably wouldn't work on any die-cut items.  It is possible that a wider laminate/magnet border would work fine all by itself, but I decided to try experiment #2 before going that route.

For the second experiment, I used a somewhat smaller item (a clip-art poinsettia) and applied cold, self-laminating sheets to both sides of the printout.  I knew it would be waterproof because I had done the same thing with a water-aerobics exercise list that stayed completely dry.  I cut a small border around the edges of the poinsettia then put it in the Xyron machine.

One of the things I noticed after covering the laminated item was how the magnet's laminate sheet would not stick to the magnet by almost a quarter of an inch.  The gap stayed no matter how hard or how often I burnished it.  It is possible that the adhesive isn't strong enough and the top laminate sheet isn't flexible enough to stick.  I suspect that the thicker the item, the bigger this gap will become.

In addition to getting wet, I was also concerned that the item would now be too heavy to stick to the car due to the inclusion of the self-laminating sheets. However, so far, so good.  It has rained and snowed and the image has remained dry and clear.  It has also stuck to the trunk for several days; I even drove on the interstate at a little below the speed limit for about 10 minutes and the image is still there.

I may go back to trying a bigger border without the self-laminating sheets to see if the seal would work that way, but at least I've got something I can continue to experiment with if the seal still fails.  However, I think the next experiment is to put the current poinsettia item on the driver's side door to see if it can stand the drag of the wind moving around the side of the car.  (If you would like an update on further experiments, please leave a comment.  I think this review has turned into a tutorial as well as a review.)

Update 1/11/13:  I tried making the border wider AND sticking things on the side of the car - both worked just fine.  The borders were about 1/4""-1/2"" wide, depending on the item, so they all had a big, black band around them.  They may not have been the most artistically attractive, but, hey, they were car magnets!

"I have had issues with this product in the past.  It's a manufacturing defect - nothing to do with Amazon.  Got a good price, so am not totally dissatisfied, but it is likely that you will lose at least a foot of the laminate/magnet (along with the photos or items you are running through it) because the laminate gets askew at the beginning of the roll which leaves several large crinkles across your photos.  I have been making photo magnets for several years and it's just been within this past year that this problem has arisen. Too bad... it's a really great product.  Too costly to afford wasting a foot or more with every cartridge. Don't begin your cartridge with precious items!",3.0

"I really really wanted this stuff to work but it didn't for me not quite. I bought this invisible grip for one of my larger rulers (6 x 24) as I was pressing along the ruler with my entire forearm and spending a huge amount of extra time trying to prevent slippage. After looking around online for tips I came across a video of a quilter applying this omnigrid invisible grip roll to one of her rulers. The process looked really easy and it seemed to help so I went ahead and purchased some. Unfortunately I couldn't even get it to stick to my ruler (and this was after reading the directions and watching a few videos to make sure I was applying it right).

After the first failed attempt I washed my ruler and waited for it to air dry and scanned the now exposed vinyl cling for any dust or stray threads that could be impeding the adhesion but couldn't find anything. I tried to reapply the vinyl piece but it wouldn't stick, I tried using gentle pressure then very very firm pressure and could only get it to stick in small spots here and there along the ruler (I even tried a small cutting from what remained from the roll and tried applying it backwards in case I had mixed up which way the vinyl was supposed to adhere) . I ended up taping the vinyl to the ruler to get it to stay on which isn't the outcome I was hoping for but now at least the money hasn't been wasted.

Now that I do have the vinyl applied to the ruler it does seem to help with the slippage it was just a huge pain and disappointment to apply. I'm wondering now if the larger than average size of the ruler is what caused the film to not stick. The ruler also has a slightly frosted look but when I run my fingers along it and look closely I can't feel or see anything (unlike some brands of rulers which feel like they have bits of sandpaper in spots along the bottom); the ruler wasn't marketed as being non slip when I purchased it as well just more suitable for dark colors.

I think from now on I will just save up for the more expensive non slip rulers. I wish I had smaller more normal quilting rulers to test how this applies to them. I only have the large rulers for my bow tie business and sewing my own clothes and haven't needed anything smaller.

My final thoughts on this are that it probably doesn't work on any matte finish, frosted, and maybe even colored rulers. It also may not work well on larger rulers were the static cling effect may be disrupted at several points along the greater distance. I wish that on their website or somewhere, anywhere that is was stated that it has limitations instead of their makes any ruler nonstick claim.",3.0

"After reading about this product and hearing about it from my quilting friends I expected this to cling to the fabric better than it does.

I guess I should have read the description more clearly, but it didn't occur to me that ColorBox would sell the multi-color pad other than as a paintbox.  I mean, there is pretty limited utility for a rainbow pad.  It's still a quality ink pad, just one that I will probably only use once or twice at most.",3.0

"This punch only works 'pretty well'.  It is brand new and it already sticks a bit on just one piece of card stock.

Also, it IS 'backwards"" or rather upside down.  I didn't understand what other reviewers meant when they posted this but the problem is that the heart comes out upside down....so if you want to punch something round for a paper rosette for example, the heart is upside down.  It doesn't 'reach' to the other side so it is useless for what I wanted it for.

This wouldn't be a problem for the star or circle punches.

Works good but the heart can only be used if you're punching from the bottom. If you punch from the top it's upside down. With the way it's designed you can't get the thing you're cutting in far enough to punch the top for a right side up heart.,3.0
Only punches through thinner paper.,3.0
Though I am very happy with the design and I have finished the first half. The second half is posing a bit of a problem. The legend of what colors and what stitches to be used is printed on the back of the picture you are to follow for stitching. To change colors you have to keep flipping the page back and forth. I am sure it would have cost of few cents to ad the color/stitch list on a separate sheet. I know have been happy to pay a little more for the kit to save myself the aggravation.,3.0

"This is a Fiskars product so it works well for how it was designed. The problem is it is a stupid design. The rectangular cutout is in-line with the handle. A better idea would have been to turn it horizontal so that you could actually use it in a useful way. As it is the punch only lets you slide into the side of what you are punching by maybe an inch or so. This is useless for ID's, even more so since the width of the rectangle is much smaller than most ID holes. I used it for craft foam and had to bunch and fold the foam to be able get the hole where I needed it and that was on a piece that was 2 1/2inches wide and 1 1/2 inches long. I needed to punch the center and it was a pain. It would be impossible for an ID. If the design errors still would allow you to use this product, then it is worth getting, since it does punch cleanly and consistently.

"My old, basic, school supply-style hole punch recently stopped working correctly and was unfixable, so I ordered this new Fiskars one, and was excited to receive it, as I figured that after all these years (actually decades) of time, the technology would've been improved to make these hole punches so much easier and more comfortable to use -- and much to my surprise, I was wrong.  The only thing about this that makes it more comfortable than my old metal one, is the handles, and even then, they're not what I'd call comfortable, but they feel better than the solid metal ones.  That doesn't matter to me as much as the smoothness of how this punches -- it certainly works and does the job to punch holes, but it's hard and choppy and not ""smooth as buttah"" as I thought the newest modern punches would be by now, especially from a company as respected for high-quality craft items as Fiskars.  So, a bit of a disappointment there, but this punch will certainly serve my purposes, and I just hope I don't ever need to punch a whole LOT of holes at once, because this would make my hand very sore!",3.0

I wouldn't recommend using this product for long term solutions (e.g. hemming your pants) because the substance is tricky to use and can lead to semi-permanent creases.

"I purchased this paint for a small project, but I should have been more careful when I noticed that there was no information about the level of gloss anywhere on the page. I specifically ordered the Emerald Green color, but unlike most of the other colors, the image on the product page doesn't specify its glossiness. It's not in the description or anywhere else on the page. I needed this paint to be flat. I know it sounds like a nit pick, and perhaps I shouldn't have made the assumption, but regardless of that gamble, I highly recommend that Krylon updates their product page to specify the gloss level. Some of the titles on the other colors are specific, but the majority of them are not, and in this case, the image is of an old can design that says nothing about gloss on the label.
I was considering only knocking off one point for the confusing product page, but then I discovered a few problems with the spray nozzle itself. I might have gotten a dud though because only one of the three cans is having trouble.
Regardless I've learned my lesson and will stick with buying paint in person, from a store.",3.0

"A fast, affordable and convenient way to paint anything! Very easy to use and dries up in 10 minutes. I used it outside the house and the blonde in me left the door open so the whole house smelled of aerosol or gas paint (or whatever you call it......I told you I was blonde :0 ) and it took a long time before it cleared off.

Tips when spraying:
1. close the door
2. wear a mask
3. do not smoke while doing this
4. do not spray beside a black dog :)
5. use in a large box to contain the sprayed paint
6. do not attempt on a windy day....learned this the hard way :)
7. pregnant women should NOT use this

3 stars because the spray does give a wide coverage, BUT I am painting a small item- so most of the paint was kinda wasted. I also need to spray 2x (or even 3x) as the color is not that solid on the first spray. I do hate the smell of aerosol but it's convenient than using a paint brush.

"Amazon, as usual, was great and replaced the damaged yarn I received.  The last four Red Heart yarn skeins I have purchased have had issues.  One went from three strand down to two then finally down to only one strand that was tied to the remaining yarn.  The damaged part was at about 3/4s of the way in so when I got to it I had to unravel the rest of the skein to finish my project.  The shocking pink in this order had a huge tangle deep inside due to a part that looked like it had been over-wound.  It was tied off to the rest of the skein like the other.  In fact, I have found two more that had tie offs in the middle of the skeins.

I still gave three stars because the quality of the yarn itself, and the spacing of the color changes, is high up there with all of Red Hearts' acryllic yarn that I've ever used.",3.0
"Had issues of the fabric not staying even. Might try cutting slightly larger than 1"". Also had issues with the fusible tape not adhering smoothly and at times not at all.  Ended up making the bias tape first and then ironing on the fusible tape after without using the maker.  I'm not a total newbie when it comes to using fusible web nor bias tape makers so not sure why this particular size I found difficult.",3.0
The floss was exactly as advertised.  Should have paid attention to the shipping because it isn't free with orders over $25. Very expensive for one dmc floss.,3.0
I never spend my money on something that doesnt work. I still buy this.,3.0
Rich beautiful color...ideal for making your stitching projects pop! I gave it three stars because the cloth was folded instead of rolled and the deep creases were impossible to iron out. I used the cloth to do smaller projects and cut around the creases.,3.0
"This does what it's supposed to, but I was disappointed that the parts were rather sloppily attached. Where there is a gap on one side, it's tight on the other. In most of the other sizes I have, there is an evenly sized gap. It's not a matter of function, it's a matter of craftsmanship, and it's not exactly a complex build.",3.0

"I was hoping this product would allow me to make lots of bias tape without spending the money to purchase the prepared tape, but it is too inconsistent to be used in sewing projects one would sell.  I was able to make it work, but it took way more time than I was expecting to make the lines straight and even.  It was not the fix I am looking for, but if you just want a little bias tape for occasional use, and you have the patience to be very careful, it's not a bad little gadget to have in your sewing room.",3.0

"I ordered this yarn because I wanted to start learning to crochet.  I cannot compare it to any other kind, but using it while watching beginner tutorials, I don't like that it seems to unwind and a strand of the line catches often.  Maybe there is something better to use for a crochet learner.  Maybe this works better if you are familiar with the material and technique while using.",3.0
"Top falls off it as do tops on other seam rippers, so not better in that way. Doesn't seem as sharp as the best seam ripper I've had, and the under-blade area seems a little thicker than some others, so harder to get under tight stitches. Still looking to replace the oldest sharpest, thinnest one with the tight top that doesn't come off in handbags or travel pouches ready to prick the unsuspecting finger.",3.0

The thread was fine. I think it is a little pricey.  I am going to see if I can get this on bigger spools.,3.0
"but when it came in the mail it arrived with another spool of a different brand that i ordered. This spool which is white was rolling around in the box, the other spool which was black was in its own little plastic bag. the white spool was all dirty on the outside, i tried to ""dust"" it off but it didn't work. the black spool was very clean and what i expected (being in a bag and all). I was disappointed in the white spool because i intended to use it with my new machine and i wasn't sure how the little bit of dirt would effect it. not to mention i don't know what kind of dirt it is and i wanted to make kids clothes with it. I just made a bobbin and tossed it out, but with expensive thread that is not ideal. I just didn't have time to send it back and see what happened. i probably could have made my project then washed it, but i would have been taking a chance that the thread was stained and didn't want to take the chance of having to start over.",3.0
Not what I expect to get,3.0
"It's great that it has a cap -- but I agree with the other reviewer:  why can't the cap slip on the end (like a pen cap)? Seems like it would have been an easy enough design spec.

The length of the shaft is a plus, especially when you're taking out a long hem (those bitty-handled  rippers are hard to hold on to). The no-snag ball could be slightly larger and smoother, though.

I wouldn't pay five buck for this, but if you can get it for around two bucks its a good enough deal.",3.0

"Th quality of the yaarn is exactly what you'd expect, however the color was not true to the picture. I expected the Baby Pink to be a normal soft pastel pink, but it is actually a bit bright and bordering on neon. The photo is a bit exaggerated, but you can see the slight orange undertones in it, which I did not want. It's good enough for what I had in mind, though.",3.0

"It's Red Heart Super Saver, it's ok yarn.",3.0
"super scratchy. the most so of any in the super saver line I've tried so far. Couldn't stand to crochet with it as it was so just finished soaking it in water, vinegar and hair conditioner to soften. Waiting for it to dry now and hoping it worked. The color is much darker than it appears in the photo as well. It's not going to work for the project I intended it for so I'll find something else to do with it.
I really wish that Red Heart would offer the same quality throughout this line. It's such a great price but you never know what you're going to get from one color to the next. Same are awesome (white), others are soft and pretty but split badly (Icelandic) and then there's the sandpaper rough ones like this lavender color. The thickness and thinness of the strands are all over the place too. They're all supposed to be a category 4 but it's not really much of a guide when one color seems twice as thick as another. I guess I just don't understand the fiber production process. Shouldn't it all be the same exact yarn just dyed different colors?",3.0
"I've always been happy with Red Heart Super Saver solids. I like the wool texture, great price and easy care. This color Light Gray was more like the Red Heart ombres I've been disappointed with lately because they were thinner and stringier, and felt much more synthetic. This gray is also a lifeless color and had knots and some very thin sections. It will do for the project, but I will not buy this color again.",3.0

ok,3.0
ok,3.0
"The quality and color are wonderful. I gave this product three stars because it claims ""super saver"" as the size, yet there are only 236 yards of yarn. After doing the math, I would have to buy three to have an average skein marked ""super saver"".",3.0
Insanily overpriced. I was able to get other shades in stores for $2.75 each but this color is almost $8 here,3.0

"I have to agree with the other negatives here. I doubt this is Lion Brand, as it only comes in a plastic baggy with no wrapper or labeling. The strand is extremely thin, and just doesn't feel like others I have bought in a retail store.

"This yarn replaces the Eskimo eyelash yarn very well and works up nicely in knitting.

"I think this might be one of those ""You get what you pay for"" kinda things.  It looks fine, but is a lot bulkier than I'm used to.  Can't comment on the quality as I'm yet to use it but I am concerned it's a little bulky on the business end to get into the smaller areas.",3.0
"I purchased this yarn and a 'pound of love' in a navy blue for a shawl project. I will attach pictures. While this yarn is certainly true to a rich dark navy blue, it is not as soft as I expected it to be. Additionally, the thread is not very smooth, and began fraying and fuzzing right as I tried to cast on. The smoothness makes it slide over needles well, but it is just too fuzzy for the project I am working on. I will likely keep searching.
In the pictures you can also see the color comparison to the pound of love in both natural light and fluorescent.",3.0
Nice yarn-easy to work-very soft when worked up. But.....full of knots. 18 in one skein and 22 in the other.,3.0
"The color is a little darker than I was hoping for, but still very nice. It is not as soft as my other Pound of Love colors and feels a little scratchy. The thickness is also not quite the same, it feels thinner in certain spots. All of that I can deal with and is not a big problem for me. What I do not like is that it says J-10 (6mm) for the crochet hook - this yarn is definitely not for a 6mm crochet hook. It constantly gets caught and splits up while crocheting. I have been crocheting for 45 years and this yarn is driving me crazy. There is no smoothness to it and it is a struggle to crochet. It definitely should be for a 5mm to maximum 5.5mm crochet hook. But as I need to finish my poncho and don't have another yarn, I will deal with it. Will I order again? Yes, but not this color, I stay with the ones that are softer.",3.0

"Beginner crochet person here. Knew nothing at all about yarn when I bought this - chose it because I didn't know there were any differences and the colors are gorgeous and the price is right. However, it is very difficult to work with. The threads come apart constantly. Not easy to use with smaller hooks. Not soft at all, gives my index finger some sort of yarn burn, like a rug burn. Used it for practice but then had to toss it.",3.0
"It was ok, not as soft as I was hoping for though.",3.0
"It's inexpensive but a little rough to the touch. Color is consistent from skein to skein. Does the job, but nothing special.",3.0
"Well there are pros and cons to this yarn and consodering them all I decided to give it 3 stars- middle of the road. The pros are the price and the color choices. I think it was a nice cheep price for a nice big ball of yarn. The thickness is nice, I usually use an H crochet hook or similar size. It works well with knitting too. My hooks and needles could work it well, it was easy to pick up and stitch with. I also love that this yarn is available in so many different colors. I made a few items and was happy with how they looked. Nice and thick and kept its shape. I hand washed it and had good results as well- no shrinkage. It was able to be hand washed in the sink and laid flat to dry.
Now for the cons: I really have only one complaint, however that complaint can be a deal breaker for me if I'm considering repurchasing. After I worked hard on a scarf and excitedly finished it and put it around my neck... I realized it was scratchy!! So although the piece looks like I wanted it to, the fact that it's scratchy means that I won't be able to wear it or give it as a gift! Since this is the whole reason why I do crafts I'm going to have to say I will not purchase this brand again unless the piece I'm making isn't for an item of clothing that touched the neck or face (like a scarf). It takes me a lot of time and energy to knit and crotchet so I'll make sure next time BEFORE I START THE PROJECT that I take the ball of yarn and hold it up to my face and see if it's scratchy first. I actually should have done that anyway so it's my fault for not making sure. So if your looking to craft (non scarf crafts) this is the yarn for you! I will find different yarn for my scarves- unfortunately it will have to be a more expensive ball of yarn I'm sure, which is why I tried this one first, to save money. But not every corner is worth cutting, especially if you put a lot of work in, because it's a waste of time in the end if you can't even use the product you made.",3.0
"this color arrived with other colors and the yarn is ok, nothing to write home about. One of the skeins was unbundled and tangled up and put in a clear plastic bag like it was used and returned - I had to untangle it before I could use it.

"Kinda disappointed in this yarn.  I've been crocheting for about 30 years and this is the first Red Heart that I've had separate like this.

Worse than giving an electronic gift with no batteries...",3.0
"I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas.  She wanted one of these so badly and this one looked cute so I bought it.  I'll be honest she has not finished it yet but she is well on her way.  The part that is troubling is the way the yarn comes.  In the box you will receive 4 plastic bound clumps of yarn.  The yarn is all mixed together.  Notice this kit is mostly browns and yellows.  None of the colors are labeled what they are so I think we were supposed to guess.  There is supposed to be Dark Gold, Medium Gold, Light Gold, Medium Yellow, Light Yellow, Cream, White, Black and Brown.  The difference between dark gold and medium gold is so slight that you have to hold them next to each other against a white paper to tell them apart.  It is like that for all the colors.  And not all of the same colors are together so you have to sort through HUNDREDS of yarn strands trying to figure out what pile to put them it.  It would have been so much easier if they just put the like colors all together and labeled them.",3.0
"Love latch hook and this design ""would"" have been great ""IF"" they would have given my daughter enough yarn. Ran out of a couple colors before it was done. Very disappointed. :(",3.0
"When I did latch hooks as a kid they were simple designs in primary colors.  The ones I've done from Caron are much nicer, but they involve so many different shades of yarn that it actually becomes a headache trying to make the picture come out as described.  You can't choose the shade of yarn based on the design printed on the mat because the colors on the mat bleed from one square to the next.  Your best bet is to follow the pattern which comes with the printed instructions- ""five of green, then 3 of white, then one of light yellow""- and even that can get confusing.  Also I could do with some more yarn.  Overall, I'm happy with how my rugs came out, but the process was more stressful than I had expected.",3.0

"I've sewed for most of my life but started quilting 3 years ago. Over the past year, I started having problems getting straight cuts on some of my strips. They weren't off much, but enough to make the finished quilt top a bit wonky and hard to square up. I saw that this ruler was highly reviewed and recommended, so I bought it with high expectations. So far, I haven't had the positive results everyone else raves about. I still get cuts that are slightly bowed or curved. Actually more of the cuts are off now than when I used the regular ruler & rotary cutter. I pre-wash my fabric, press it and do the hanging and straightening the grain lines thing then fold it so the grain lines are as true as I can get them. And then fold it again so it fits under the ruler. And the cuts are still off. I've watched Youtube videos and followed the directions and still get wonky strips. It's possible that it's user error, but I haven't been able to figure what I'm doing wrong. Would prefer that they make this ruler wider so you don't have to fold the fabric twice. Maybe that would help. I gave this 3 stars because it's a great concept, the ruler is sturdy and heavy enough to hold the fabric down so it doesn't shift, and because it's easy to make that first cut and then just zip, zip, zip, cut a bunch of strips. Bummer that the strips are not straight.",3.0

Well I had to weave in the ends in anyway, lol.  I was also disappointed that the threads were unravelled at certain points, making the thickness uneven in places.

"I consider this a ""craft yarn"";
not the best for next-to-the-skin garments.
Its a good economical yarn for beginners.
Toys, rugs or couch throws.
RHSS yarns can vary in size even though they are labeled
with the same specifications.
Example: if you are knitting/crocheting a variety of color squares for
a scrap afghan, you may find that one color will knit/crochet
considerably smaller or larger than another color. Then your squares will
not join well because they are different sizes.
The yarn is acrylic (pretty much plastic)
It is not going to soften up with washing or using fabric softener.
The stitches may relax, but the fiber itself is not capable
of becoming softer with laundry aides.
It will pill (fuzz on the surface) quickly with use and from
laundering.
There is a nice variety of colors, its readily available in most
stores with a craft dept. and it is a good size yarn for working up fast.

As a lot of others have said, it is sort of a rough textured yarn and slightly more bulky than your typical medium weight yarn,  It does stitch up nice though and having bought this multi colored yarn it makes it much easier to see the stitches as you're working.  The colors are super cute. When I finish with the blanket,  I will wash it up and add some fabric softener.  I'm sure it will be super soft after that.",3.0
"Good product, but too expensive.",3.0
"Hi, I just bought the zebra coloured yarn.  Can someone please tell me if the skein is made up of sections where the black looks very faded and the white sections look like the black bled unto it.  When I bought it I was under the impression that it was just black and white alternating sections.  Did I get faulty skeins?  I have bought this type of yarn before in different colours and I am always pleased.",3.0
I was expecting something else,3.0
"Normally a skeen has enough yarn to make what I need, this only did half.",3.0
I ought this yarn because of the beautiful color but it was way overpriced. at JoAnn Fabric and Michaels it is $2.99 and I paid $4.99,3.0
"Ah, Red Heart yarn. Perfect for penny-pinchers to practice purls...not so much for making anything you intend to wear, unless you wash your project or luck out and get a soft color. Knitting with this stuff isn't awful by any means, it doesn't split or fray very easily and even if it does you have a lot of it!
...At least you do some of the time. The gold that I ordered was 364, but the fleck I got with it wasn't. Only solids come in this amount with flecks at 260 yds and multis at about 230 yds.
Red Heart's colors also pose a bit of an issue when buying this yarn. Earlier I mentioned lucking out and buying a soft color. Well, some colors definitely are softer than others. Light colors like Gold, Aran, and Buff can be worn right off the needle. Darker colors like Coffee, Charcoal and Black really need a wash and conditioner soak before being worn, or else you'll feel like you're wearing steel wool.

Good for first time projects, good for wallets, itchy for skin",3.0
"I'm just learning to crochet, so I don't want to practice on expensive yarn.  This yarn is a little scratchy, I don't know if it will soften up in the wash, all I've managed to make is cat toys and I don't imagine I'll be washing any of those.

Also, the threads seems to separate into three strands instead of staying together while you're using, I don't know if this is normal or not, but it is kind of annoying.  I did find one large knot or tangle in the center of the skein, I couldn't untangle it and being inexperienced I wasn't sure how to work around it.

Since, I really don't know how to crochet, and I'm just learning the stitches, I think the yarn is fine, but once I graduate to actually completing a project, I'll look for something of better quality.",3.0

"This is a really cute design, but not one I'd recommend to a beginner. The stamped ""X's"" are faint, and (for me) extremely difficult to line up in straight lines, and the smooth cotton fabric seems to add to the confusion. If you're an experienced cross stitcher, I think you'll have no trouble with this adorable kit but beginners would be better off working one which is stamped - or even a very simple counted cross stitch - on Aida weave fabric.",3.0

"Good item, shipping was fast",3.0
"Not very large, and thin metal. It is functional, but not my favorite.",3.0
"The yarn is inexpensive and that's good for beginners. My biggest complaint is the yarn knots easily. I try to roll the yarn in a ball before I start using it, yet it still knots and after an hour yes sometimes even longer...I end up cutting the yarn and end up with pieces. I find it does not matter if it pulls out the end or start on the outside, it will knot and both ends are on the outside of the skein. If anyone can make suggestions how to avoid the cluster of yarn please post how to end up with a nice roll of yarn. After I roll the yarn into a ball I place and use it out of a ziplock bag to keep it from tangling in my yarn bag and it helps to allow it to unwind while I crochet.",3.0
"No problem with price or quality, but no 2 skeins are the same dye lot.  There is a definite shading difference.  I can use it up on smaller projects, so I lost nothing on the deal.  The product, however, was delivered by the Post Office.  The carton was left out in the rain all day because the carrier put it outside my screen room instead of my wide open carport.  When I complained to the post office, I mentioned that there was a large note outside to not leave deliveries on that side of the house.  Sometimes I wish Amazon wouldn't use them.  The yarn dried out okay, but I am worried that the odor from the wet cardboard will not fade.  Obviously not a product flaw.",3.0
"Nothing special, but for the price does a good job.",3.0
You will still need a common small gauge needle threader for your smaller eyed needles. This is for your large-eye yarn needles. One needs to attach a cord through the hole in it. It'll be easy to lose.,3.0

"I thought I found a bargain, but I didn't. I was shopping for other yarns when I saw thisyarn. I thought the colors were nice, so I ordered some. Turns out I didn't pay attention to the net weight of the balls of yarn and they were tiny! And, the price was ok until I saw the same yarn later on in a craft store for a LOT less. I learned that 1) watch the weight of the yarn balls, snd 2) shop around so you have something to compare when it comes to the price.",3.0

The yarn is a wonderful country color that blends well with the yarns I'm using in my afghan project. I've made 2 afghans using this yarn and plan to make a third. I'm a fan of red heart yarns. I don't think I've ever been disappointed with their yarns.,3.0

I knew it wasn't going to feel as nice as other yarns I've worked with, but I was being experimental in this project.

"This yarn has hot pink tones through maroon tones. It is darker than what is pictured, in general. The picture shows some pale pink areas, but none of the yarn has any pale tones. And the picture depicts more dusty rose tones, and the actual colors are mostly very deep or vibrant, with no dusty rose shades at all in it. There is more maroon than pink. I would say that it is misnamed, and would be closer to red tones, rather than pink tones. It's not a bad combination, it's just not what I expected, given the picture and the name.",3.0
"The price on this yarn is great, but it is not great quality by any means.  It's very scratchy.  Also, the color is more bubble-gum pink soft petal pink like it is in the picture.  But, you can't beat the price.  It's a good yarn to practice knitting on.",3.0
"This yarn isn't as nice looking at the picture, but it's good enough for the price.  I am familiar with the brand so I knew what to expect.  On the other hand, it's a nice color and it's easy to wash and care for.",3.0
"I buy Red Heart Super Saver yarn because I can get a lot for a little, but it's honestly not my favorite yarn.  It's rough, although it softens up a bit in the wash.  I prefer yarn that is soft to the touch right out of the skein.  I also don't think it wears well.  After a few washes, it begins to look a little ragged.

Super Saver does have some redeeming qualities.  It is cheap, and easier for a beginner to work with than some of the specialty yarns that sometimes require us to work by feel.  The colors are consistent from skein to skein.  When they say no dye lot, they mean it.  I have never had trouble mixing old and new yarns.  The colors always match.

PROS:
+ inexpensive
+ no dye lot
+ easy for beginners to work with

CONS:
- feels rough but will soften up a little in the wash
- doesn't wear well over time

I personally wouldn't choose this yarn to make a gift.  I sometimes buy it for whatever reason and always regret it, because then I'll have a stash I need to use up.  They're okay for adult blankets or stuffed animals.

____________________

UPDATE:  Try as I might to get away from it, I still use a lot of Super Saver and the pile grows.  I make the most of it by combining the colors.  I'm horrible at that, so I use the colors on other patterns and make my own pattern with those colors.  Try mixing this grey heather with burgundy, aran and black.  In the right combination, the burgundy will pop from the background, softened by the aran and grey.",3.0

"Found this item at local hobby store. Was going to be married in a few months and caterer didn't offer beer and wine glasses so we figured this would make them nice table gifts if we etched them (cause we didn't need 150 beer and wine glasses back lol)

Tried it out on an old glass at home and it seemed to work just fine. Well fast forward to 2 weeks before wedding when we were trying to etch our initials (using the armor etch reusable stencils) on 150 beer and 150 wine glasses. We found this stuff is hit or miss. I  would apply to one glass that would turn out perfect, then did the EXACT same procedure for the next glass, and there would be spots missing, or part of the letter wouldn't turn out. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason to why it would work on one and then not the other.

So if you are working on just a few items this would work, especially if it is something you can buy 10 of to get the 5-6 that you needed to look just right.

If it wasn't for this fact I probably would have given this item a 5 star as the ones that did turn out great have been through the dishwasher without coming off etc so they seem like they will stand the test of time.",3.0

The kit is a neat design.  The quality of the canvas and threads are not top quality. The thread colors could be more vibrant. The instructions are clear.  I purchased two of these kits and the packaging was different for each of them.,3.0
"This is nifty little kit.  Picture on the package matches the canvas.  Comes with floss; needle, canvas; instructions.  Good project for beginner (with some supervision) or the experienced needlepointer.  You will need a hoop or stretcher for this (not included).

I wish I'd read the contents on the outside more thoroughly as the only thing disappointing is that it's floss (cotton embroidery thread) and not wool.

Other than that, it's a snap and fits easily into a handbag.  I purchased the coordinating moon for my daughter as a starter project :D",3.0

This was meant to be a learning how to sew project that I do with my daughter who is 7.  She is able to do it but it's taking a very long time and I am needing to be very involved in the process.  Maybe not the best beginner level kit unless it is for an adult or child that is older.,3.0

"I actually have done several of these kits, and I have various opinions about each one.
-The first one I did is Zinnias. There is enough yarn to complete this project, though just barely. I'd give it four stars. I would love it if they'd charge a few extra bucks and actually put enough yarn to have spare amounts, but this is not the case. The instructions are ok, the chart is hard to follow due to the complexity of the design. I referred to the picture more than I did the chart. The yarn is vibrant and the finished result is pure art.
-The second one I did was Gentle Strength. I give it three stars. This one was more tricky. There are areas where you are expected to combine yarn, but you have to read the instructions carefully to know that. Due to the subtle shading, the picture was useless on this one, I had to use the chart. There was barely enough yarn to finish this one, also. The finished result is OK, it would of been better had I combined the yarn colors as directed, but as it is I went over it again with the second color.
-The third one I did was Butterfly Impression. First of all, there is not enough yarn to finish this project, so I give it two stars. I had to improvise. The design is tricky because what you do to one side, you can't do to the other according to how the canvas is printed. You have to do a lot of counting to get the butterfly part to look even. The canvas warped badly and I won't be able to use this one at all. The lines are supposed to be straight, but they point every which way, even after blocking.
-The fourth one I did was Moon Dreamer. I give it four stars. I would of given this one five stars based on the fact that there is actually plenty of yarn with much to spare, but the colors of the finished project don't blend as well as they do in the picture. Also, the instructions, as far as I can tell, are not very accurate. You have to use your artistic interpretation and figure it out on your own, which is easy to do based on the simplicity of the design. I enjoyed this kit the most because of the plentiful amount of thread. It made it stress-free.
- The fifth one I did was A Bowl of Apples. I give it 4 stars, because there wasn't enough thread to do the outlining. But there was enough yarn to complete the canvas overall. This is probably the best of the projects, the finished result is dramatic. It isn't even my style (I made it for a gift), but I think its the most attractive. The instructions are accurate and easy to read. I used the chart a lot.
- The sixth one I did was Butterfly Duo. There is plenty of yarn to finish this design, but the finishing work of outlining is so complicated that I doubt I'll ever finish it. Nevertheless, I give it four stars based on the fact of the thread being plentiful, and the instructions are easy enough.
- The seventh time I did Zinnias again.

"This was my first needlepoint and I think a lot of people would choose this small kit (5""X5"") as an entry level project. The design is gorgeous and the floss colors are vibrant. I can confirm that Dimensions shorted the kit on both the turquoise and light blue floss colors. I ran out of both and had to alter the design substituting another color to finish these background areas. Dimensions uses a proprietary embroidery floss- you can't run out to the craft store and buy some more if you run out.. I generally love Dimensions kits (have more experience with their cross stitching ones) but the skimpy allotment of floss is a disappointment. Design gets five stars but only two/five stars for this manufacturing oversight. 3/5 overall.",3.0

I had already pre washed the top and bottom fabrics for my quilt. The top is 100% organic cotton in a woven jacquard design. Heavy ! The bottom is German made double napped 100$ cotton flannel in a loom woven buffalo plaid.

Now I have got to put this twin size batting in my kitchen sink (I have a front loading washing machine so I can't just put it in a top loader to soak as instructed) and Lord only knows how much this will weigh when fully wet....and find some way to get the water out without spinning it out.....They suggest laying it between a ""washable blanket"" and pressing the excess water out.....Not gonna happen !

IF I had read the package BEFORE I opened it, this would go back and I would just use a poly light weight filling....As it is now, this will sit on my sewing closet shelf until I make a quilt and I do not pre shrink the top and bottom first.

So I call this a ""failure to fully disclose"". They need to tell you it will shrink 3% if not washed first !!!",3.0

"Researched this machine for awhile--you can get it for less other places sometimes, but you just really need to shop around for good deals and offers included.

I love this machine. Sews great and the embroidery is great but make sure you follow directions and read the instruction booklet well. I keep mine right next to it. The thing is constanly beeping at me for not puting the presser foot down or this that or the other which would be a nice little feature but the beeping is really loud and annoying.",3.0
"What makes this product so attractive is that by connecting it to a computer you can get an endless amount of embroidery designs. It is also a full feature sewing machine.
I bought this item for my wife's birthday. It does everything that is advertised. The sewing functions are straight forward, and everything worked as it should.
The embroidery isn't as staight forward. The instructions are very poor, and limited. Although I have to admit, that I figured most of it out fairly quickly. The embroidery is slow, and of course you have to change thread for every color change in your pattern. The designs came out looking good. I also downloaded some free designs from other sites, and they worked just as well.
My problem with this machine is two fold. The one we bought broke after only a few hours of use. It was a minor problem. The bobbin holder had a crack where the tension screw goes in. At first everything was fine, but within a few hours the thread started catching in the crack until it was unusable. I'm sure that this won't be a problem for most customers.
The second problem is much more severe in my opinion. No one has parts for the machine, and it's near impossible to even get a parts list. One item that doesn't come with the machine that my wife wanted was a zipper foot. The part number for that item was listed in the book, but when I went to find it, absolutely no one had it. I even wrote Singer's part's department, and they wrote back telling me to call.
It's a neat machine. As long as you get one that works, and aren't concerned about parts availability, I don't think you can find a better ebroidery machine for less money.",3.0
"I really like the machine but, it has caused nothing but trouble for me in the computer world. You must, and I say Must have windows XP for this machine to run. They do not tell you that, please, please, please, unless you have Windows XP, Do Not Buy!!! I have Windows 7 and it states it works for that--No it doesn't. So I went on a blog and that showed I needed Windows 7 Professional and it would work.. I ended up loosing everything on my computer and it went into hibernation and wouldn't come out. I ended up taking it to a computer shop and the gentleman there said they had quite a few clients who were having the same problem. He told me I have to have Windows XP. I had to buy a new computer just for the sewing machine that runs Windows XP and it cost me $160.00 to get my other computer fixed after trying to download Widows 7 Professional. I contacted Singer support and this will only run on 34 bit. Do not believe anyone else, Windows XP and 34 bit- that is what the Singer rep emailed me. I would have been better off to have spent that money on a newer and updated version of an single-needle/embroidery machine. I regret this purchase and I feel as if it was false representation of the machine. Please do not buy unless you have XP--you will have nothing but trouble, frustration, and end up putting more money in a brand new machine that only works as a single=needle. Now that it is running though, I really like it. I've had it for over a month and was unable to use it except as single-needle which worked fine; I have embroidered one thing and it did a wonderful job on it. We shall see. I don't think you can return them either because Singer is no longer in business. This machine is an older model; I believe 2009 or before. I'm not sure.",3.0
"I bought this years ago for full retail price.  I was excited to get an embroidery machine and sewing combination.  The plan was to use only one machine but it turned out not to be a good idea as the feed dogs kept popping up during embroidery. I finally permanently removed them as it kept destroying my projects.  Since then very little issues with embroidery but disappointed that I couldn't get it to work for both.  The E setting for tension is usually too loose so be prepared to turn up that tension.

Something I wish I would have known, the hand dial for the needle has a serious design flaw.  It is gapped just enough that you can get your fingers and palm pinched and cause blood blisters or even draw blood.  So painful!  This would have been enough for me to buy another machine.

Also, the software was a pain to install years ago and I have worked as an IT tech writing programs and setting up networks, replacing computer parts, installing software for several years.  They did fix this when I upgraded my home computer but unfortunately, this was an additional expense for me as I had to buy an upgrade software for $100!  I was not happy and felt Singer should have made this update available for free considering how much this machine cost when it first came out.

The embroidery is painfully slow, takes about two hours for anything with intricate details and the centering isn't always accurate.  I recommend saving up and buying something else.  I was a diehard Singer fan, have had one for nearly 25 years, but they are not the workhorses they once were.  Now they are cheap, poorly designed and don't perform consistently.",3.0
"I really like this sewing machine. Is perfect to for me because it will help me to create many things for my home. I thing that the machine is complete, because I can to add some of feet for sewing, quilting, etc. besides I can create many embroideries, I can't spend a lot of money, then the singer CE-100 Futura sewing and embroidery is perfect for me.
I really appreciate if you sending me as soon as possible. Thank you.",3.0
"I like the machine but it did not come with any of the Cd's or Dvd it should have for the embrodery. So I had to have them send another one out, get what's missing from mine and then send an entire machine back. :( I was in a pretty crafty mood this weekend and had plans for stuff but it will have to wait.",3.0
"I have owned my Futura for a little over a year.  I was interested in an embroidery machine with a larger field-- I own a brother PE-400D, which I love, but the embroidery field is small.

I am the type who likes to monogram towels, burp cloths, etc-- just for fun and as gifts.

I loved the idea of the Futura being powered by the computer rather than those expensive embroidery cards.  I had bought several of them for my Brother, and they seemed way over-priced for what you get.

I also purchased the Hyperfont software so I can now use ANY true-type font on this machine. That is so fun!  I can also download ANY embroidery design onto my machine.  The Futura reads ALL formats.  They have a ton of free designs out on their site, too.

As far as the machine operation itself-- I would agree that it can be a little tempermental at times. The tension has never seemed to register correctly and you have to experiment with it at times to find the right balance.  The proper stablizers and thread are critical.

If you are computer savvy at all, I would say you can figure out just about anything on this machine yourself-- without the help of customer support.  The DVD/CDs they include are really helpful.

For the price you just can't beat this machine-- I researched and researched before I bought.  You will pay at least $1000 for the next step up for a machine with comparable sewing field and you won't be able to use your computer.  Brother does have a step up machine for about $700 but you will still be tied to those cards.

This machine is DEFINITELY NOT for everyone.  It takes patience and can make you mad at times.  You need a good deal of common sense to be able to operate it.  The high-end machines definitely work without the hassle, but you are also paying the price for them.

If you are like me, and just want to have the ability to embroider here and there for family and friends, then this might be a good buy for you.",3.0
"I was very excited about getting this machine...thought Singer was a good name.  I have had good things and bad things come from this machine.  One major problem was that my bobbin thread was showing on the TOP of the item being embroidered.  I adjusted the tension of the bobbin thread to 0, but the back of my item looked nicer than the front.  My dealer replaced my machine.  My new machine did the same thing only when I used a certain type of thread ""THE BOTTOM LINE"" bobbin thread.  I quit using that and so far so good.  (I think it likes thicker thread in the bobbon, so now I just use the same thread in the bobbin as I do in the top).  Now I am having a HORRIBLE problem...the machine is sewing the design in the wrong place in the hoop.  For example, the software says that the first letter would be 20 cm from the edge of the hoop...but the machine sews the first letter more like 50-60 cm from the edge.  This causes the last letters of the design to be OFF THE HOOP.  Things are left off center and I have to restabilize and rehoop to try to get something out of it (then it is NOT centered).  I have read many reviews and none seem to recommend Singer from embroidery.  I hear that Janome makes a good machine, but it costs more.  Some of my embroidery has came out nice..but I have ruined MANY nice items from using this machine.  It seems as though Singer should have some reserve fund to replace costs of all the things the machine has ruined.  I am very frustrated and disappointed.  For what it costs, this machine is ok.  But if you have the extra money to spend, or would be doing this for payment (like you would be putting someone else's items into the machine) you may want to consider buying a better machine!",3.0
"I like the machine itself, but be aware that your purchase will not include the photo stitch CD and if you are planning on creating your ouwn designs you will be looking at spending more money on a design program. Don't let this discuourage you tough, I bought the photo stitch program and it definately is NOT worth the money I have not even been able to get one stitchable design from it. I recomend buying this macine and getting the embird software which is also available in a free trial version, so you can try it before you buy it. Despite it not meeting my enitial expectations, this machine has been doing very well for me, but you should also be aware tat it has a small flaw that causes it to set off a ssafety alarm saying the thread is broken even if it is not, so you can't exactly just leavve te room and let it run.",3.0
"I bought this as a Christmas gift and was a bit disappointed with it.  There is only thread from the top so if you even lightly tug the end of the thread on the finished item it pulls right out.  Also, the foot partially blocks the needle eye making threading quite complicated.

My sister (niece's mother) said there is no room in the box for a basket that it is just the box. My niece was not expecting a basket so she was perfectly happy with the gift. But I feel mislead as the product name has the word basket in it and the pictures clearly show a basket as well as several reviews. The basket was the reason I choose this knitting kit over others as my grandmother (niece's great-grandmother) always knit from a basket like the one pictured and I thought that would be a neat connection for my niece who shares her middle name with myself and her great-grandmother in addition to a love of knitting.

Amazon did issue me a small partial refund for the misunderstanding since I did not want to return the item.",3.0

Like the size of the ring.  I have small hands but like good size rings.
This one is visually noticeable and is quite pretty so I am keeping it.

However, this ring is rather cheaply made.
The ring is a simple thin silver circle with the amber teardrops set on top.
No design or heft to the band itself.
The teardrops are attractive in shape and size.
But like other reviewers, I wish the teardrops hugged the shap of the finger.
The three teardrops are connected in a flat manner and would not allow adjustment to curve downward.
Ring would be great if it had slight curved shape.

I ordered this with matching teardrop shaped tri-color earrings from same company

"I finally used up my first roll of this same stabilizer.  What I first bought seemed to be more of a paper-type product and worked well for what I was using it for.  By the time I needed more - some 4 years later - I discovered that they had changed the formula for this.  It is now a *very* lightweight fibrous stabilizer.  It works for what I am using it on, but tears very easily now compared to the old.  When this is gone, I will be looking for something a bit more sturdy.",3.0
I like the stabilizer but I will say that when working with the tear away types you may find that with light weight fabrics it's not ideal. The stitches can loop on the bottom of the piece because it's better to use a medium cut away for denser stitch designs. For a light stitch design it works fine. If you are new to machine embroidery and you get familiar with your designs and your fabrics it's better to stick with a cut away.,3.0

"My error.  It is already chunky and then two strands are sort of wrapped around each other.  But not all the way. Sometimes they just parallel each other, so does not make for uniform knitting.

While wrapping the ball, I accidentally tore a strand apart.  The good news is that it can easily be spliced.  The three stars are because I love the colors.  Very Vibrant.",3.0

I used this just as a little face paint for Halloween.  I'm no pro and didn't put anything on top of the paint to keep it from smearing.  They do smear even after drying if you touch or rub the paint.  Colors are nice and bright.  Have not used the glitter paint yet.,3.0

Pros:
- The palette contains a good range of colors
- The included booklet has some nice designs and instructions for each one
- The sponges included are a good nice for small faces
- The glitter gel is great for giving your designs an extra sparkle

Cons:
- Several of the colors are very translucent, especially the pinks and the purple. This made it hard to paint designs in those colors.
- The circles of color are quite small, which made it difficult to use sponges or larger brushes.
- The included paintbrushes aren't very good for detail work.
- The paints sit in a plastic palette which is much larger than necessary. If you have other supplies you're using, things can get a bit crowded.

Overall, I'm not sure this was a great purchase due to the translucency of the pink and purple paints.",3.0

"3.5 stars ... it's good and useful, but the quality of the paint is not that great.  If you want the color to pop out, you have to keep adding the colors until you get the color brightness you want.  It's good though for the price.",3.0
"The colors are vibrant and go on quite smoothly. I do agree with most other reviewers that a separate brush set will help tremendously. The brushes included are short and not very precise. My three star rating is because the kit unfortunately arrived with several colors missing, the most important being the black. After reading more reviews (after already purchasing) I see this was a common occurrence. As the kit is a decent price and I didn't have time to exchange it, I made do.",3.0
Good paint for the price.  Not much in each well although,3.0
missing some stuff when i got it,3.0
The paints don't go on as smoothy as other brands that I have used.,3.0
"The paint is dry and you need to dip your brushes in water to use the paint.

Purchase separate brushes and sponges because the ones provided are not enough.

I like the coverage and intensity and variety of the colors. As opposed to other kits ive seen, this kit includes large trays of the black and white.

My paints did not dry back up and they kind of got absorbed overnight so yes this kit is a one-time use kind of deal.",3.0
"I bought this for Halloween costumes. I like the variety of colors and tools that comes with this kit. However, once applied, the light colors are more translucent than I was expecting. If you want good coverage for white, go with actual clown makeup.",3.0
got this for my daughter.  the cost could be cheaper,3.0
This paint is ok for sponging on but was much more satisfied with the wolfe paint for the details.,3.0
"While you get a lot of paints in this set they are quite small (about the size of a dime). It is very difficult to layer paints onto the foam pads. If you just want it for a small party and are only planning to dip a brush in it than this should be fine. It comes with a book with a short tutorial on a few different designs, which was nice.",3.0
The paint pallets are quite small.  The back states that the will do around 160 face designs so hopefully they will last.  (I brought it for children to use and I am worried they will use the paint quite quickly). Tip: Buy the extra set of paintbrushes to give more flexibility in designs.,3.0
"My only complaints so far with this set is that it was missing the larger brush and the instructions are very poor.  It does not explain that you need to use water to make the paints usable.  It does not give useful directions on how to best use the paints nor does the design booklet give a good guide on how to do the designs.

Luckily, we know someone who is very experienced with face painting and gave us a lesson.  I would suggest this set for those already familiar with face painting than a true beginner.  However, outside of the missing brush and poor instructions, the paints and glitter pots seem of good quality.",3.0
"Look on youtube, find your favorite designs and you can do it to! The paint itself is easy to use and the paint does last all day. My kids even slept in it. Then the next morning it wiped off easily. AMAZING! The sponges are helpful in covering a large area or using to do a multi colored mask. I did use my own assortment of paint brushes I had on hand so I cannot review the included brushes honestly. I say go for it. Super product!
Update: I've been using the same kit since for 18 months! Sleepovers, performances, birthday party, or just for fun. I just now started running low on white.  When I use this it is always for a mask or whole face design and it has still lasted a long time.  People are always impressed and compliment on the face paint.  I love this product and recommend it all the time.
Update 9/22/16
I just ordered a new kit and I do not like it at all.  I'm not sure what changed but the paint in the new kit smears very easily.:( so sad, I loved the old set.",3.0
"I needed face-paints for a church activity and this was the set I purchased. The paintbrushes it came with were cheap, hard, and un-usable. Luckily I had purchased some better brushes as extras. The paint was very hard and I had to apply some water and let them sit to soften them up (sort of like you do with children's watercolors). But they worked okay and the price was pretty good for what I got. I suppose if you want a high-quality kit, you have to pay a lot more",3.0
its ok-- found the others for a cheaper price at walmart and got more paints-- it was a hot day and some melted and didn't stay on that well.,3.0
"Quality is just not great. It's fine for playing around but doesn't last and smears easily. Still fun to play with though, and for the price it's not bad.",3.0
I was thinking there would be more product of each color but over all it is a pretty good product,3.0
"This was purchased for a dress up party at which my brother did face painting, he said the quality of the paint was ok",3.0
I ordered this face paint to use with my 4 yr old grand daughter.  She came to stay all night today and her paint arrived today in the mail. We were excited until I read that it is NOT FDA approved for around the eyes or lips.  She wanted a butterfly design around her eyes and we cant do that.  Cant do a full face either as it will be around the eyes and lips! ...so how can you say this is face paint? No where in the description of the product did it say it was not safe to use around the eyes and lips.  I want something that I know is going to be safe to use on my grand daughters.  I have yet to use it as I want to ask her parents before doing so.,3.0
"The item shipped quickly and in great condition, but the product could have been better. The sponges are horrible and not meant for facepainting as well as the brushes. I bought this just to have a small variety of colors without having to spend much money...",3.0
My daughter really loved this but I was a bit disappointed in the cost.  The quality seems middle of the road for the products but the package is nice and the selection of styles to reference are a nice touch.  Bring the cost inline with the contents and it is a winner.,3.0
My complaint was that a lot of the colors where all dried out. Book had lots of cute ideas. My daughter enjoyed it,3.0
"OK for kids if you only want to keep the artwork for one day, but washes off and rubs off way too easy.  The stuff put on my kids' faces at carnivals held up much better.",3.0
It was sufficient for a birthday party. The brushes were not great so I got better brushes to use but it was enough paint to do all the children (10) and still have some left over.,3.0
"""I received this item in a timely manner and used it this Sunday. I was not impressed with the quality of this make up because it runs very easily. The face paint does not stand out as much as I thought it would.""",3.0
"I was very surprised when this package arrived in the mail. I couldn't believe how small the containers of each color of paint were. Its says they are highly concentrated, so we shall see! Disappointed in the amount I spent for the amount of product, but hopefully it will be a case of quality over quantity.",3.0
"I was a bit dissapointed with the product.  When it arrived in only a few days after ordering it, most of the paint was cracked and lying all over the case.  The silver glitter is dried up.  Other than that, it's fun and easy and it is easy to clean off.  I wish the paint was a bit ""fresher"".  It's dry and cracked.  Maybe I'll have better luck with my next purchase? I do use it a lot and plan to buy more.",3.0
"I ordered this for my granddaughters, age 5 and 9. It certainly was expensive for the amount of product provided. However, they had a grand old time with it for as long as it lasted which was just about through the weekend visit. (Good luck it getting out of your washclothes and towels.) On the whole, I think buying them the real thing would have worked out better as that is washable.",3.0
Absolutely unfinished.  And the wood is as one Should expect - Cigar Box quality.  It isn't something other than just a very simple box with very simple and cheap hinges and clasp.  So don't expect something in the Big-Dollar range.  You get what you paid for.  It was also shipping free via Amazon.com - which is always nice.  Of course the prices are a tiny bit higher - but I would have to drive 50+ miles to buy these boxes for only pennies cheaper.  Through Amazon - my Postal Carrier brings it to my door.,3.0
this box was exactly what it showed.  a basic wooden box. it worked for what I needed it for,3.0
The item was exactly as described. The quality wasn't too shabby. The box seemed a little shallow.,3.0
"Kinda cheap made, but what do you expect for the price?  Had to glue together as some wood was ""peeling"".",3.0
Always need to check fit of lid and the hinges and locks to make sure they are not crooked.,3.0
Pretty thin box. but not bad for the price.,3.0
"The box itself is nice, thin and light as expected, but sturdy enough for what it is. It had no cracks or defects in the wood. Nice corner joints, rounded edges, sanded and ready to stain. The hardware is cheap but functional. The hinges are fine, although I do wish they'd invested a few more cents into the clasp, as it doesn't feel super secure. The knob part on the bottom is just a little too small, letting the top part pop off too easily. That may not matter for your purposes, and I'll probably just end up replacing the clasp for less than a dollar, but that somewhat defeats the purpose of buying a cheap/ ready-made box. Otherwise, it's pretty good quality for the price as a starting point for your project.",3.0
A little out of alignment and rough corners,3.0
"I know this is an unfinished box and is meant as a project piece but mine arrived with the latch crooked. Other than that it's a nice product, and a great starting point for a casual craft project. Personally I'm making mine into a Dice Box/Dice Tray.",3.0
Not the best quality as one of the hinges broke,3.0
Okay.,3.0
"Rough wood, very thin and light, some clasps did not line up on the front of the box very well.",3.0
"Yup, it's a box alright. It's great for putting stuff in. I've put all kinds of stuff in mine, but not weed. Definitely not weed.... Or nudie pics..... Or weapons..... Or ancient demonic rune stones. It fits my Bible, prayer book and pictures of my family perfectly.",3.0
"I rate these 3 stars simply because they are terribly thin/light. I knew they were cheap going in, but understand if you are going to purchase these that they are exactly that, cheap. These are not a good value. They are just a wood box comparable to something that you would expect to pay this amount of money for. I am not disappointed, but I am trying to warn others.",3.0
Took a little long to arrive and the wood had a few blemishes in it.,3.0
"as expected, it's pretty basic, but certainly nice enough for the price. going use it as a wood burning project.",3.0
"I ordered a few of these and for what I needed them for, I couldn't use these items.  However, it would work if you wanted to create an inexpensive jewelry box for your daughter.",3.0
"I should have read the other reviews, there is no blue velvet inlay...And the box is not as smooth/sanded as the photo looks. Otherwise, unfinished cigar box as said in description. I was able to paint it and add some wooden embellishments to outside and inside to make a cute gift as intended.",3.0
I order these and didn't realize they were Lacquered (my mistake) so it was hard to customize them as a gift.,3.0
For the price the box is great. The lid seems very thin and you can tell it's not meant for anything too rugged.  For the price it's a great little box,3.0
"Box is fine, but there is no blue bottom as pictured which would have been nice for my project",3.0
"Its ok, Out of the box, clasp was broken.  Pay for what you get.  No fancy blue felt inside, or chain.  After a trip to Home Depot for some new hardware, not bad. It served its purpose, as a custom made cigar box for a friend.  C+",3.0
"The box is fine, none of the other issues from previous reviews. However, what was sent was a semi gloss finished black box.",3.0
The wood is pretty soft so if you sand be careful.  I spayed with wood sealer about 5 times on the inside and 5 times outside and I'm not sure that is will work.,3.0
"This is not velvet lined, as the image indicates. Its simple, unfinished, and plain. It worked for what I needed it for, but is not as pretty as I would have liked.",3.0
It's was ok.. It was a lot smaller than I was looking for.. My wife uses it for makeup now,3.0
"I bought this hoping for the best, but was not surprised when it arrived warped. I know it is pine and warps easily, however, the corners are also sanded oddly. As in, they do not match one another. The lid does not close tightly all around, but that's what happens when Amazon gets the business of people who aren't near craft stores to pick their own one out, lol. For the record, it is not terrible, just not one I would have chosen myself. I should be able to fix it with my Dremmel. :)",3.0
I actually bought this for my little sister to use her woodburner on. I haven't given it to her yet.  The quality is a little lower than it looks in the photo.,3.0
I buy this box to put it in my harmonicas. Its a cigar box but in the picture the size looks perfect to fit my harps but when I receive it it was smaller. The price is good and right now I'm using the box to storage other little things.,3.0
This is a very lightweight box with cheap but functional hardware. The lid had a dark patch -- maybe mildew at one point? could just be the wood. It seems like a good starting point for a craft project. Note that the lid will open to a full 180+ degrees and does not have enough friction in the hinge to stand open at 90 degrees.,3.0
"I received the package on time, it was OK. I did expect something unfinished and so was content with the box overall. However,there are a few things that made this just terrible.

First: the clasp is not in the middle! what the heck. Why. It's an inch off the middle to the right.

Second: upon 'closing' the box, the top does not lie flat with the bottom, causing a small gap on either the left or the right side, depending on which side you press more firmly.

It didn't matter to me that the edges and such were quite rough (I recommend using a bit of sandpaper), since i was going to paint over them anyway.

All in all, this was mostly what i expected, and I can use it anyway for my project so it's fine.

----update edit ----
After sandpapering it, the lid now closes properly! :D
I might just buy another one of these.",3.0
"The box itself is great, but the picture is deceiving .. it shows a 'lined' box, and it is not.  I had ordered 'choc wafer' cigars, and the box wasn't really the right size, so I ended up ordering real cigar boxes on-line (empty of course), and out of 10 I found 4 that the wafer cigars actually fit in, so I guess I learned that cigars come in all different sizes .. however .. the beauty of this box is that I can still decorate it, line it myself with a color of my choice and use it for something else .. the box itself is still a great box",3.0
Not satisfied with the ounces of the yarn. Seller needs to be more specific about information in the ounces .  It's not enough to even start a baby afghan. It's only a 3 or 4 oz. Skein.,3.0
"The yarn itself is fine however, the price was about $3.00 higher than AC Moore for the same brand.
I actually thought that at the price it sold for I would be getting a bigger skein.",3.0
"I ordered Bernat Softee Baby yarn in pink.  When I selected the color pink and the screen indicated that it was in a 3-pack.  I purchased this because I needed three skeins for the baby blanket I am making.  My order arrived on time, however, I only received one skein of yarn. This in inconvenient since a new order of yarn will different dye lot and the color will not match.  The price was a good deal for three skeins. I guess I should have heeded the old adage, ""If is sounds too good to be true, it is.""  But I trusted what I saw on the screen and didn't want to order three three-packs.",3.0
This WAS NOT A 3 PACK!!!!!!!  Great yarn though.,3.0
Love the yarn but hate the search for the beginning string.life shouldn't be so hard! This brand is the worst for digging out that starting string,3.0
Good but not great for my quilting project. I thought this would work perfectly for my project but for some of my squares it was too narrow and for the others the yellow markings obscured the edge of the fabric so I couldn't use it for that either. The ones  that seems to be better for me are Fiscars and Easy Square Jr. Easy square Jr has just thin black lines every 1/2 inch with small indication of 1/4 inches. Fiskars has all the markings that Omnigrid uses but without the yellow strip they are easier to see precisely where you are. Quilting is a very precise work so I need to be able to see the edges very clearly.,3.0
"Why oh why aren't there seam allowances on this ruler? I have several Omnigrid rulers and all have the seam allowances.  That is why I love them.  I can of course use this, and I will, but I wish the extra half in was just a standard on all Omnigrid products.",3.0
"Like the 8.5"" size but do NOT like the wide yellow colored divisions between the inches. I can't see to line up my fabric. Won't buy this brand again.",3.0
"I haven't used ruler yet, but it looks fine to me.  No info on web page that there were three rulers in the package.  I only needed one.",3.0
"I started out with this yarn making a baby receiving blanket for my niece. It is going slowly because the yarn kinda splits apart now and then. It also is very fiber-y.. If I wear a black shirt while knitting--the fibers will be ALL OVER my shirt. It also flies all over the air. I LIKE THE COLOR VERY MUCH, but I wish this yarn was a bit cheaper due to all the problems. I will have to buy MORE of this yarn in order to finish this project.... which has became kind of a job instead of the relaxing hobby that knitting was..I suppose when I get some nice yarn to work another project, I will re-enjoy knitting again :)",3.0
"3M makes the best spray glue but this one is limited because of the spray form. It's not so much of a spray as it is a ""goop"" that shoots out. Nothing but a gooey mess this leaves you with. I guess I'm trying to say that it's not the best user friendly spray glue but it's strong. I can imagine this being fine for some type of lumberjack but not for my dainty little arts and crafts I do. I tried most other spray glues but 3M is usually the way to go.",3.0
"This stuff is okay. It's not as nice as the bonding agent that comes with the Auralex tiles. Also, the delivery took almost a week which seems to be starting to become the norm for amazon prime shipping.",3.0
"Bought this to adhere new ""hook"" pieces to my hook & loop sanding disc holders. I was attracted to this product because of the high temperature claim. The hook pad did not stay attached - loosened after about 10 minutes of sanding. This product is hard to apply to small surfaces and does bubble up and out, making it difficult to handle without making a sticky mess.",3.0
works ok,3.0
it is a strong adhesive. I used to put up topsy in my van. make sure you cover area where you will spray and not to spray too close. it will spray too much and make the fabric wet and dry as it is wet. so the surface won't be even. Price can be cheaper.,3.0
Cheap little set that is not too bad.  Good selection of blades for a variety of uses.  Blades are a bit flimsy though so be careful about them snapping and flying.,3.0
"The price was good on this set.  I used it for one project and it worked well.  I would not recommend it for a serious crafter.  However, it met my needs.",3.0
"This is a good kit, and has more blades than one might ever need. However, upon opening the package the entire case fell apart. As one reviewer stated, super glue is a good thing.",3.0
"The case isn't great, (the blades don't fit exactly) but it's good for the money!!",3.0
Seemed knife gets dull after a couple of uses to cut masking tapes.,3.0
"Bought to see if these were garbage, and they are.  Read the reviews, the handle is garbage, the case is garbage, the blades are 'OK' but not good.  Think about getting an EXACTO or better quality (surgical) blade system and use them accordingly safely.",3.0
"Cheap but serves it's purpose. Handles are rather light weight, but again, did it's job. I'd have paid a dollar more for a better box if anyone from the company is reading this.",3.0
The blades are pretty thin and break easily.,3.0
Nice little set to have in its own carrying case for crafty stuff,3.0
"Like one person said already, don't buy this for the box.the hinge broke as I was unwrapping it.other than that the knives seem to be ok.im a bit annoyed about the box though.",3.0
Came coated in oil,3.0
"I guess the price should have told me a few things. Wanted to use it for models, but Testors ended up being way better.",3.0
They are pretty dull blades for precision knife kit.,3.0
Knives do look used and the packaging is cheap as if one picked it up from a dollar tree or 99ct store. You ultimately get what you pay for and that's it. No bells and whistles. Just a faux exacto-knife set.,3.0
"Quality is in line with price; It's not a great product, but works for my intended purpose.

My main complaint is that the item packaging looked terrible; Faded, torn, creased, and dusty. It looked like something from a secondhand store that had been abused and then left on a shelf for twenty years. That doesn't affect function in any way, but it's something to be aware of, in case you were planning on giving it as a gift.",3.0
"Case is not very sturdy, blades are not very sharp, blades are not fully interchangeable with all handles.",3.0
Good value.,3.0
But I don't think it's suitable for heavy use.,3.0
They are cheap. But functional.,3.0
Flimsy. I worry about the knifes breaking as I use it. I'd suggest spending the money on a real exacto knife with a couple spare blades instead.,3.0
"It's ok, I find the blades to be a bit loose on the handle but for the price they are decent. The latch on the box doesn't hook well",3.0
"The blades are thin & a little flimsy but are really sharp and work well. The most disappointing thing however is that the blue case is really hard to click closed.
They are a nice choice for an inexpensive set.",3.0
I ordered this product again because the blades are amazing and I love the case they came in.  This time they came and the blade were dirty and almost looked rusty and it had random particles inside. Once I cleaned the blades and cleaned out the case everything looks fine.  The blades are shape and ready to be used.,3.0
"This is a decent hobby knife set. The knife handles are of good quality, however, some of the blades flex way too much. When I find one that does, I replace it with an Exacto brand blade-problem solved.",3.0
These are decent blades and knife handles.,3.0
OK for what it cost.,3.0
cheaply made,3.0
It has all the blades and handles you need but the case is very flimsy and weak. One of the hinge pins broke off the second time I opened it.,3.0
Cheap quality as expected,3.0
All the blades are really thin so they bend.,3.0
The knives are basic quality and the case is of light material but they do there job and are a value for the price.,3.0
"It seems like a lot of people who buy this set haven't heard the adage ""you get what you pay for,"" before. This set is great for the 4 bucks I paid for it. It's a lightweight craft knight set suitable for gentle projects, and for those on a budget. If you're cutting cardstock, paper, or cloth this is a great set. If you're like me and trying to remove mold lines from models, or trimming plastic or metal pieces, you would be better off getting a more expensive set with more heavy duty blades. All in all this set is well worth the price as long as you know what you're going to use it for, and stick to light duty work.",3.0
good product. the case is cheap.,3.0
"Serves its purpose as a hobby knife, but the holders are cheaply made and do not hold the blades well. For the price I can't complain and use it none-the-less.",3.0
"Poor quality blades, but nice quality shafts.......go figure!",3.0
The blades are poor quality.  The first blade I tried broke instantly with low pressure on blade.,3.0
"Not like the old exacto kniife set, the plastic takes away from the strength of the product but at $4 it will have to do!",3.0
Lowes has an excellent deal on xacto sets that are much better quality But this will get you by,3.0
"Okay for the price, not what I would call high quality hobby knife, blades not really very sharp.",3.0
"The set was great and every but the case is poorly built but for it price its ok, if you want some for quick easy project or so this would do the job just fine although the blades are very sharp either but good enough.",3.0
"Meh.  Nice selection of blades, but the case doesn't close.",3.0
A bit cheap/flimsy,3.0
About what you would expect for the price. The box is very poorly made.,3.0
While the blades are nice the case broke right away otherwise I would have given two more stars.,3.0
Good experience.,3.0
"It's okay.  It does the job, though the case doesn't really close and it takes a bit of finangling to keep the blades in the handles.  But I like the variety with the three diameter handles and all the different blades.  Pretty good buy for the price.",3.0
"Very cheaply put together, probably should stick to the exacto brand, but did the job",3.0
"The knife set is fine, came on time, but the container was broken.  Otherwise fine.",3.0
"The knife set with blades is great, but the container is cheap, and was already broke when I got it. It was packaged well for shipping so it is highly doubtful that it was broke on shipping.",3.0
Dull fast,3.0
The blades and handles were covered in some sort of blue ink or paint..other than that they work.,3.0
"Nice knives, case was broke when I got it",3.0
After a few cuts the blades began to get a bit dull. This is good for a few projects but if you plan to use it more than twice I would recommend something more profesional,3.0
Case is flimsy and poorly made. Blades work fine but the handles don't stay put when in the case and the case is difficult to keep shut.,3.0
"I appreciate the variety of blades, but the set seems a little flimsy. it does cut though, gets the job done I guess.",3.0
"I have yet to use this product. It seem allittle flimsly but I cannot tell at this moment, I will add more as time goes on.",3.0
"It works just fine, but the blades and other metal pieces had rust on them when they arrived, which tells me it had been exposed to significant moisture before transit.",3.0
"The product, itself was excellent, but the casing was broken (the lid is broken off) and cracked. Duct tape, here I come.",3.0
it's not a bad hobby knife and does that I need it to but its jsut  alittle disappointing that the blades aren't SUPER durable but considering the amount of items and the price I'd say go fer it,3.0
"I'm giving this product 3 stars... which is generous.  But, since the blades do their job, I can't justify a lower rating.

Most of my issues are with the storage case.  When I opened the case, I inspected everything.  It was difficult to get the blades off of the magnet... I wondered if this would be problem in the future.  After putting everything back, I noticed that my hands were blue!  This case is made of plastic and I can only assume that the colorant in the plastic is what rubbed off onto my hands.  I had to scrub the case with soap and a rag to get as much of the blue colorant off.  It appears that washing the case did the trick... though that should NOT be necessary.

My second (or third if you include the magnetic strip) issue with the case was the latch.  I tried to latch it ONE TIME.  The latch broke at the living hinge.

On to the blades:  I don't think I can complain about them being covered in oil.  I'd imagine that this may be typical with cheaper blade kits.  They probably don't take the time to clean them in order to save money.  However, I did have one complaint -- the blades stamped with ""11"" (the narrow-pointed blades) were both dinged in the center of the blade.  They aren't unusable, but they came damaged.

All in all... if you are looking for a really cheap set and don't mind getting blue hands and having to clean both the case and the blades off... this is an okay purchase.  I'm not sending back simply because the price isn't worth the trouble.",3.0
Don't expect a premium product at this price. It is a serviceable set and worth the money spent. I will replace the blades when needed with better quality ones. The handles are OK.,3.0
"the blades keep falling out of the holders. I have tried turning the handle part that turns, and still nothing. it's good though, for the price. I use it often, just know that the blades fall out from time to time.",3.0
"Blades bend and snap easily - don't really stand up to any pressure, but they were cheap and you get a bunch.
Some problems with the blade holder unscrewing.",3.0
Really cheap blades and cheap knives. I was using one the cut some construction paper and it actually broke. No lie it broke I was so irritated and realized that it comes with three for a reason. (heads up the one with the red grip handle was the one that broke in my hand),3.0
"Its gets the job done, its not high quality so please use caution, also a good starting kit for new hobbies, engineers.",3.0
"The blades are cheaply made and thin, but what do you expect for $6? I mostly bought the set for the handles anyway.",3.0
They work but they aren't well made.  May opt for brand name next time - they seemed to dull quickly.  They don't stay in the case well either...nor does the case fasten properly...,3.0
"The case broke immediately after getting it, which is annoying.  Not worth the hassle to return.  The knife works fine.",3.0
I was looking for an Exact Kit for Model making. Turns out that they are all laser cut today making all the old skills obsolete. This kit is not well made and although it contains all the blade styles you could do better. To be fair for the price they will do what you expect they just don't have the finish and precision.,3.0
You get what you pay for.  Lightweight blades.  Bend easy.  Good enough with what I'm going to use it for.  Came within three days.  I like the magnet bar.,3.0
"I liked the price, and I can't complain about the knives. But the case is a problem: the latch doesn't latch. So have to use tape or rubber band, etc. to keep it closed.",3.0
I wanted an inexpensive set of hobby knives. My only issue is the blades aren't held tightly in place and can slip out of the handles.,3.0
The blades are not very sharp. But worth the money for the 3 blade holders. I ended up buying the  X-acto blades for them.,3.0

"I have not used the knife yet, so I may lower my rating if the blades are not held tightly, but right out of the shipping box, I tried to close the product box. 1) could not get the latch to work, 2) the hinge broke on the back.

The case won't close. When it got here the blades were everywhere. I was disappointed because this can chip or dull the blades. Kind of a waist.,3.0

"Got this set for a plastic model ship I'm building. I really needed the flat ended blade in this set and the others seemed like a bonus. When I got it, it had rust on a couple of the blades. Rust doesn't usually seem to be a big deal and it didn't cover the whole blade so I shrugged it off. I got the flat end out and went to work on the ship. They bend really easily so going at a 45 degree angle trying to shave off some plastic proved to be difficult. The end of the flat edged blade also had some dings in it. I don't know if this set had been used before or just came like that but either way it wasn't very impressive. I've managed to finish what I needed the flat edge blade for but it took a lot longer than it should have. I have an X-Acto knife and the blade is at least twice as thick as these. It works much better than these ones do but cost about the same as this whole set did.

The only plus to getting this is the case and the magnet in the case that holds the blades. The blades are thin and flimsy, the case needs a bit of a tweak to close it, the handles don't seem to hold the blades firmly, and there was rust on some of them. I didn't expect much for $5 and I didn't get much (quality) for $5. Still, it did do the job I needed it to but I don't know if I'll be using it anymore.",3.0
"just got my product in the mail yesterday (free 2-day shipping with amazon prime trial? can't beat it). basically, what everyone says about the case is true. MY case was broken before i even got to open the package. the top piece was clearly separated from the bottom IN THE PACKAGE, but oh well. i didn't buy the product for the case so c'est la vie. it's being held together with a rubber band so i really don't care about it not being attached. it holds it just the same.

i'm giving this product a 3 based on 3 factors:
1) i haven't even used the knives yet (but i AM quite excited for it).
2) there was a small amount of rust on one of the blades. but i mean, you get what you pay for.
3) the case broke before i even touched it.

overall, not a bad product.",3.0
"I will post 2 different scenarios that I was in with these knives. I bought them from a hobby store a few years ago. I used them for wood carving

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario #1: I needed to properly shape a block of BALSA WOOD (One of the lightest and softest pieces of wood available) with my knifes into a small ship. Because there were no knives included that had ""teeth"" on them, I needed a small saw to cut through large chunks. That gave it a smoother feel. I used the exacto knives for detail. They aren't to good for cutting against the grain of the wood because none of the attachments have teeth (as I said earlier). The largest knife (the red one) was the easiest to hold. The smallest and medium sized ones were good for putting on detail.

Cons:
As I worked on the ship for multiple days, the knives became dirty. I found rust on them as well. As you can expect, washing it only made it worse.

I must stress that these knives and other such knives are only for detail, not for main, basic tasks like cutting through a lot of wood.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario #2: I was carving a ship from BASE WOOD (A harder, heavier wood, almost like pine wood except not known for its spots/marks). I broke many knifes during this. You absolutely need a saw for cuts through the wood as short as 1 cm. Detail carving is tough on such thick wood. I injured myself a few times and was more worried about getting an infection from the rust than the actual wound.

Cons:

These knives can't handle such thick wood. Even balsa wood might be too thick for them. They are only for detail or cutting through paper--which is very easy to accurately cut through with these knifes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The knives are sharp; I never found need to sharpen them. They may snap if you put too much pressure on them (like if you use them on base wood).

I would definitely recommend them for the price that they are listed for on amazon.com",3.0
"The Good:

Item is as described and for the price the blades are ok. There are plenty of replacement blades in the box.

The Bad:

The handles feel cheap and are very light, they don't have a good ""feel"" in the hand. The blades are not very strong and bend when cutting plastic sprue.

Overall:
You get what you pay for and these are worth every penny, but not a penny more.",3.0
"The Good:

* the price (you get three cutting handles, several blades, and a magnetic holder for five bucks)

  Keep in mind that not all the blades pictured fit the larger cutter. It will not grip the narrow base, so those blades are for the smaller handles.

* the magnetic strip works and makes it easy to put away/take out new blades

* the blades are sharp, but haven't tested how long they hold an edge.

Otherwise, this has the feel of a cheap product:

* the tabs on the case hinge crumbled as it was taken out of the packaging

  (maybe these have been sitting in the sun a long time)

* the case won't stay shut (the latch was improperly manufactured)

* the largest cutting handle is a bit shorter/lighter than higher-quality models (this could be considered a benefit for those with small hands)",3.0
"Junk - Package was stapled shut when I recieved it. Blue case hinge was broken and the latch looked like it had been chewed on by a small dog. Wouldnt close at all leaving blades exposed. Blades are not secure in the handles, they shift if any pressure is applied. If you plan to use these on the regular; save yourself the headache and spend $20.00 on the brand name set.",3.0
"These are awesome of the price. Let's face it my local hobby shop sells one identical knife that is included in this set for the price of the entire set! But when in use they have showed signs of problems. I have noticed the screw blade secure feature found on all x acto knifes is weak and can slip if your pressing a bit to hard, making the blade slide around and then mess up the cut. Another thing is the blades I don't use, they sit in a little drawer with all of my x acto stuff a d they have started to rust! It's not a lot of rust but it's there. The drawer is in a dry place and the blades if ever gotten wet were dried properly. A little dremal work got rid of the rust but I mean c'mon, it wasn't even 3 months. Very sharp thought, easily cuts through plastic molds used to hold model kit parts in place and similar stuff, trying anything bigger than that is risking injury or broken pieces(I'm referring to model plane parts or more minute detailing) I would say that I'm happy because I use them with my models and they do the job just fine, the blade variety helps aswell. If your going to use them with bigger projects or lots of hard use I would invest in more quality.",3.0
"Nothing special, but gets the job done.  I could see where a better set may be nicer, but the chucks hold the blades firm.  Provide a non-slip grip, and come with a good variety of blades.  It'll get the job done and without the associated cost of the x-acto brand.",3.0
This product is just what I was looking for.  If you want perfect pay the bigger bucks.  For the money this is a great deal even if the case doesn't shut.,3.0
"The case is super cheap and actually broke the first time I tried to open it, but the overall quaLity is ok.",3.0
"This set is not too bad but the blades are not the same as shown. Its a pretty cheep set but nice for the price, good for beginers.",3.0
"Gunna lay it out simple.
ITS NOT X-ACTO  ITS CHEAP QUALITY!
The metal was all stained and the box is stupid.

Overall the knifes were sharp and did do the cutting.
I have found no problems besides the quality and for the price its almost worth it.

I give this a 3 stars only for the cheap quality of the set....

**JUST WANT TO CUT? THEN GO AHEAD THIS IS IT",3.0
"Upon opening the package, I attempted to close the case but the hinges broke right off. The case is made of extremely cheap plastic and there are clearly deformities along the edges. Whatever, I'm just kinda disappointed that it broke within 1 minute of trying to close the case. The blades are what you expect, just OK quality.",3.0
I used this for about a dozen corners and it does the job and the price is right.  I think one with longer legs would be better.,3.0
Worked well.  It is a little long which can be cumbersome for some angles.  But overall it works well.,3.0

"I like this glue, it's a great product, but I fell for another one of these misleading ads. Says 10, but only one. I guess I'll have to go by ""If it sounds too good to be true, it probably isn't"". The store has refunded 50%. I'll lick my wounds and accept that.",3.0

It did the job.,3.0
not really magic,3.0
"Not over the moon with the looks of the result, but it got the job done.",3.0
The directions were not very clear.  I had to buy additional product to try to bring the luster back to the leather.  Very time consuming as a result of the poor directions.  Lots of redoing.,3.0
Could have been better...I don't feel like on my smooth black leather it really made too much of a difference. It left smear marks and I could see exactly where it was applied. The only thing it did really well was color the white stuffing so the holes weren't as noticeable.,3.0
Works well.,3.0
"It worked fine. However, you have to keep on re-applying the paint since it keeps chipping. Matching the color was tough. I don't think this is for everyone.",3.0
"I bought a car with 2 small burn holes in the black leather seats. This product had some good reviews, so I tried it.  It does a decent job of filling the holes (go very slow, building up gradually), and there was no problem matching the black color, but you end up with a very smooth fill that doesn't match the grain of the surrounding leather.  I note that other kits include grain texture sheets.",3.0
"First it does repair tears in leather.  But filling in the tear required about eight(8) layers of Navy blue to be mixed, a trial & error process and spread, then dried, then sanded.  You can definetely see where the repair was made as the scratches left from sanding, alcohol did not smooth the rough edges as directed. Not very satisfied.
The tear opened up again after about one year, it is now covered with black duck tape.",3.0
Process not difficult to follow - difficult to match color(s),3.0
its ok  it is not as easy as the directions say. Maybe for a very small repair.  i used it for a large repair.,3.0
"Colors are easy to mix, but repair kit does not work very well.",3.0
"Directions were easy to follow however, the last step - applying the color (filler) was difficult, not enough color to complete entire repairs.",3.0
"I bought this to repair some severe rips on our leather headboard.  The directions are easy but the technique for application affects the final look of your job.  While I am not completely done with this project, the product has covered the rips.  It isn't pretty--It still looks like I tried to cover a rip but at least it's not that big of an eyesore anymore.",3.0
Could not be happier with the results I got from your product!  No one would ever know that a repair took place.  It made my leather look new again.,3.0
"It works, but does peal off and getting a good looking finish takes a lot of work and repetitive applications. The plus side is that the prep agent supplied removes the filler if you over apply and also aids in getting a smooth finish.",3.0
"didn,t give  hardly any white to make adjustment to lighten colour-for price could have given bigger patch material and enough white to fill the small container!",3.0
"Got decent results - looks like a patch job, but at least it's serviceable.  The mixing instructions were very confusing.",3.0
"I would rate this as ok. It was not easy to match the colors and get it looking right. That could be me or it could be the product. It is hard to say which one it is but I am leaning towards the product though. It did repair the rip, which is a good thing. I just wish that I could have figured out how to color match better.",3.0
Needed to repair the golf cart seat. Works good but I was unable to match the color. Not a lot of product is included so it is hard to mix the correct color.,3.0
"it is not as great as the reviews, it does cover the tears, but it does not make them disappear. don't know if it will take the abuse of everyday use yet...The picture is not what you get....",3.0
It works well for smaller tares but you can tell where the paint dried as it has no gloss/sheen like leather has,3.0
Does not have an awful lot of product to it but it will be plenty to cover a 1ftx1ft area. If you need more than this I suggest something else.,3.0
"I purchase this with the intention of repairing a 3 inch tear on a leather couch.  I worked but certainly wasn't a ""professional"" finish.  For the price, my expectations were met.  Plus, I'm no expert in leather work.",3.0
"Tried this product to repair a restaurant booth that got several very small tears from a broken window.  Matching the exact ""red"" of the booth seemed easy enough, however, when I came back to work on it again, the color didn't match as well as it seemed originally.  Also, use the sandpaper very sparingly.  I think the repair would have looked more inconspicuous had I not used the sandpaper at all.  In Leather Magic's defense....I have little patience for this kind of thing and it probably takes more time to really get it right.",3.0
"Just too messy for anything over 1"". Very binding, but very messy - not an even finish for anything over 1"" in size. Also, not for smooth leather.",3.0

"I have started to be a little disappointed in the Fiskars quality. These scissors feel cheaply made. The teeth don't fit very well, and unless you cut one piece of cardstock very slowly, it locks up on you. It just isn't very smooth to handle. It also feels cheaply made, so if you cut anything a little thicker the plastic handles feel like they are going to break off. The scissors were also taped shut with actual very sticky tape that left a huge residue on the blades. Even with rubbing alcohol it didn't come off completely and still makes a smooth cut hard to accomplish.",3.0
love the finish but after cutting half a dozen sheets or so the product began to give resistence and had to be forced to scissor even halfway properly. needed to work better for longer... disappointed in the quality of the scissors for fiskars!,3.0
"I use nothing but Fiskars in our shops but these design edge sheers didn't live up to the Fiskar name in my opinion.  I didn't get a clean cut to the tip and ended up tearing some of the cards.  I chose, what I believed, to be a 'simple' design to eliminate matching cuts.  But I wasn't thrilled with the sticky label on the blades.  I think this is what caused a lot of the problem with not having a clean cut.  I used them and won't send them back just because they did serve the purpose but I probably wouldn't opt for this type of scissors again.",3.0
These don't cut well,3.0
Pretty cheap on quality.,3.0
"I needed these for a project to make ""frames"" two of them cut without a problem but the rest kept on ""choking"" making it hard to cut. This caused some of the project pieces to end up mangled like. Would not buy again.",3.0

"I am a beginner paper crafter mostly interested in embellishing the edges of cards/gift tags that I write brush calligraphy on.  I purchased the Fiskars contemporary paper edgers scissors set in hopes of adding slight interesting details to the edges of watercolor paper and cardstock.  I was enticed by the contemporary set mostly due to the scalloped scissors and upon receiving the scissor set I was expecting the cuts to be more obvious but nonetheless they did do the designs per the description.  I included photos of the scissor set as well as the cuts they made just on printer paper.  I thought the color scheme of the scissors were nice as they were distinguishable from each other and easily spotted on a table filled with crafting embellishments.

The negative I soon realized was that when fully opened the scissors often caught on themselves- basically the beginning of the each side of the scissors collide with one another (I included a photo of where the scissors when fully opened stops itself at the very beginning preventing it to close).  When this occurs I have to manipulate the scissors by opening and closing the scissors slightly in a pulsating persistent motion until it adjusts.  Moreover regarding this problem with the very start or beginning of the scissor, as you can see from the photo with the cuts, at the very beginning it is rather sloppy or disfigured due to the jamming of this area.  Basically the start of each length of design is a little sloppy.  I found the overall length of the scissors to be quite short so I could not imagine or recommend doing any large length of paper with this particular set.

Overall I would recommend this set due to the various designs you receive as it provides a good variety.  If you are doing small projects like gifts tags, such as in my case, they are adequate.  Be advised that the width or resulting design is quite small so if you are expecting an impactful design this is not for you but for subtle details this will be fine.  I consistently had the problem with jamming of the scissors when opened which was incredibly frustrating but to remedy this I only use these scissors for small projects where I only need to do one length of design (meaning I don't have to do more than one cut).",3.0
"Do not cut as well as a previous pair I had for several years, in fact the old pair cuts just as good.",3.0

"The brushes are kind of hard. For the projects I used it for I really needed a softer brush. I can probably use most of these for something, if not I will let my daughter paint with them. Next time I will just go pick some out at the store to make sure they're the quality I need.",3.0
"OK, so I knew what I was getting was going to be small since I regularly use this type of yarn (bought at craft stores and Wal-Mart.  But I had an order come in and Wal-Mart stopped carrying this because I think the color's been discontinued.  This is the ONLY place online I could find it.  That being said, I was pissed as soon as I saw the price, knowing it's sold retail for $1.77, but again, I HAD to get it, because I had an order I had to get to a customer.  It's BS that they sell this for more than $4 apiece.  I understand a small markup for a discontinued item.  But this huge of a markup is criminal.  The yarn itself is fine.  For those wondering, I use it for floppy summer lacy knitted hats, and it's also good for things like washcloths and knitted bikinis.  It's 4 ply, and it's ONLY 2 OZ, so don't think you're getting a red-heart sized skein of this.  It's 95 yards.",3.0

I played with it for a couple of days and now it sits here. It's probably good for someone else but for some reason it just didn't thrill me. Oh, and it has a really lousy brush. The ends don't come to a point, but go in 2 separate directions, so I get a double line. Maybe I don't use it because it's frustrating. Being disabled, I haven't been easily able to get out to buy another brush for it... maybe someday I can do that and try it again.  I'd recommend it for someone more dedicated than I am.",3.0

"Good product. Worked well until it was dropped and then it didn't fit the cans very well. I bought it for my cans of fly spray used in the horse. These cans will often leak as no allow oily, smelly liquid get all over your hands, which I don't think is a very good idea. So the can gun worked to keep this from happening. I was using it when another horse person saw me and demanded to know where I got it. She ordered one from her phone in the spot. I liked it, I just wish it lasted longer.",3.0
does not work on all spray cans,3.0
"If you can get it onto the can, it works pretty well.  The problem is that getting it onto the can takes quite a bit of force, to the point where you think you're going to break the handle.  I am a relatively strong guy and had trouble with mounting it onto a spray can (Rustoleum and Krylon paint cans).  A weaker person will not likely be able to do it.  In that case, go with the Rustoleum handle (which I also have); it is much easier to clamp onto the spray can.

For those who say this doesn't fit on the ""larger"" spray cans, it actually does.  You're just not providing enough force (not your fault, it can be quite difficult for many people to mount this handle properly).

For what it's worth, I like the trigger on this 7091 (Can 1) handle better than the Rustoleum (this version is also cheaper).  It may actually make for a tighter fit as well.  But, mounting and un-mounting on to spray cans is difficult until you break the plastic handle in a bit (and it does feel to me that it is a matter of time before it breaks).

Excellent concept that can use a better mounting method tweak to achieve a 5-Star rating.",3.0
"Mistakenly bought this thinking it was for the larger spray caps (such as plasti-dip, rust-o-leum cans), it is NOT for the large caps, these were usually for paint spray cans with the small (1 1/2cm) caps.

"This product does the job, though not as I really had hoped. The bit is a little larger than I'd expected and requires more pressure to keep the bit from skipping on glass. It is also a bit bulkier for small hands and does overheat. Otherwise it works fine.

"I bought this as a gift for my mother who wants to learn how to sew. I opened it and was a little disappointed at the quality of the plastic tray inside. I have several sewing baskets and all of mine have the thicker, acrylic like plastic trays, so that was what I expected. For the price range I actually expected the other things in there to be cheap, so I wasn't surprised by that. In my experience I have noticed there are certain things you need to spend the extra money on, and some things you can skimp a little. So I made sure to buy my mom a really nice pair of scissors, rotary cutter, cutting mat, ruler, and thread. I will keep this basket for her because she may not even like sewing and give up on it, but if she loves it then I plan on getting her a much better one! Its a good thing to get people started. But please don't trust that thread in there to make a good product if you ever plan on washing it.",3.0
"I bought this as a replacement for the one that I lost in a fire.  The exterior was the same so I thought I was the same one my mom bought me several years ago.  Some of the embroidered top was already pulling when it arrived but I could deal with that.  The container for the needles would not twist in a way that would allow me access to the needles and separated in my hands. The scissors and the little serrated thing on a stick look used and scratched up.  Also the picture makes it look like there's a tray, there is not.  Maybe I should have read the description more carefully, maybe it was a returned item that was shipped back out, maybe I had false expectations based off what I previously had.  It's just a lower quality than I was hoping for.",3.0
But it does hold the bare essentials for keeping up with small repairs and putting buttons back on clothing.  It's good for the small 'kit sized' spool of thread and a few little sewing tools.  Good to have for minor sewing tasks.,3.0
The basket is a nice size and high quality construction.  I was disappointed that the tray inside was of such poor material that it wasn't made to last.,3.0

Much better than the battery operated kind. But you do have to take off the retractable guide to get any results.  It then does a good job of shaving off the sweater fuzz.,3.0
"Not to shabby of a fabric shaver. As one other reviewer noted you need to slip off the cover and depth adjustable cap...it simply does not work with it in place.

You also need to give the batteries a good 6 hours to charge. The shaver doesn't work with the power cord attached...that's only for charging the batteries.",3.0

Fourth one again worked like a charm. And so the story goes. You have a 50/50 chance of these working the way you hope them to. I will not buy them again.",3.0

"These are called markers but look like ballpoint pens.  To me, it really paint in a pen.  You have to shake it like paint and then it tends to flow too much fluid out at a time.  It's hard to control the flow so you won't get a precision line but more of a large drop of ink.  What's good about it is it adheres like paint.  I needed to write onto plastic and a gold/silver colored ballpoint pen would just wipe off.  This sticks well after it dries.",3.0

"These produce some nice opaque silver and gold. My only issue is often times you will have to 'restart' them on a piece of scrap paper by pumping the tip a few times.

However it looks very good on paper, plastic, metal though i haven't tested the durability of it on any of those surfaces.  Not a disappointing purchase, I'm sure I'll find a use for it- just not for my immediate artistic needs.",3.0
"The pens work well on dark surfaces, because they are basically metallic paint pens.

The extra fine markers still seem to be too wide of a marking when signing your name to a photo. I thought they would be much more sharp and fine.,3.0
"I got two of the silver EXTRA FINE POINT because I had an art project that required VERY fine lines.  I read reviews here about how to first push the tip against a disposable piece of paper or styrofoam cup to start the ink going and so it wouldn't pool.  Well, didn't work.  Either NOTHING came out or after I did push it against a piece of paper to get the ink started, all the time the ink ran, it pooled.  NO WAY I could do a fine line.  BUT with that said, this is a good marker, just not for really fine lines or staying within lines.  I could see it could be of use decorating a wooden or faux wood mirror for a bit of bling, maybe decorating a mug, something like that.  Just don't expect to get a truly fine line or not have it pool if using for an art project.  I was dissatisfied with it as an extra fine point and amazon made good on my purchase, but as something to add a bit of silver where you don't need a really fine line, I think it would be fine.",3.0

"Have used these for quite some time. Problem is you end up throwing them out long before the ink paint is used up because the push-to-get-it-started tip mechanism breaks. Sometimes the ink spatters all over the place. However, when they work properly, they are really fine marker.",3.0
"I'm a photographer, and I use this pen for signing prints.  Occasionally I also use it for putting an identifying dot of silver on items that I don't want to mix up with someone else's.

The pen is the type that holds a cylinder of oil-based liquid silver paint with a metal mixer-bead inside.  Shake it, then use it.  Holding the barrel and pressing down on the writing surface depresses the tip into the pen, and causes the ink to flow fast.  Way too fast, in fact.

Once the pen has been started the first time after unpackaging it, it becomes a leaky fountain of smearing, hand staining, floor dripping liquid silver.  The instructions say to return it to the original package and store it with the tip up.  Don't ignore that advise.  If you use it very slowly and deliberately, it will get the job done.  Rush through a job at your peril.

After storing it (in the package, tip up of course) for a few days, I find that sometimes it has a lot of clear oil at the tip, but not much silver.  The best way to write perfectly right away, is to fetch a bit of paper towel, turn the pen right-side-up (tip down as if you were writing) and VERY GENTLY dab it on the towel.  Don't depress the tip again - it probably doesn't need it.  You'll see clear oil spots soak into the towel for the first few dabs, then it will start putting silver down.  Now it's ready to write.

I like how writing from this pen looks, and I continue to buy them because they do what I need.  I really wish they weren't so finicky, but I haven't found a better solution.",3.0
These pens are probably as good as it's going to get in the paint pen category.  Be careful when using them because they are sloppy and might gloop out.  You know what I mean. Just be careful and you'll do fine.,3.0

It also doesn't always have number for details like that the petals and inside of the flower are a different color. I find that I have to use both the number guiding sheet and the box to figure out the colors, details, and shading.

"Yes indeed this paint is ""not thick enough"" as the other reviewer said.

In more precise terms, the paint does not contain enough pigment and blocking agents to completely cover up any underlying surface color (especially black) in one coat.  At the same time the paint has a very low viscosity, i.e., it runs like water if you are impatient and try to pile on a thick coat to overcome its semi-translucent quality.

Thus, to get the desired result requires patience and multiple thin coats over time.

Most Testors paints are not like this - they usually work very well - but it has been a long time since I last bought any Testors paints.

On the other hand, if you are looking for a small and inexpensive quantity of fluorescent enamel, this is about the only product available on the market (feel free to post in if you found an alternative!).  That's the only reason for giving it three stars.

It aint no kinda flourescent that I seen,3.0
"Bought this to use for gun sight touch-up paint. But despite what others may claim, it doesn't work very well at all. Much better to use Birchwood-Casey branded products if you ask me. They work much, much better than this does. I'll keep the Testor's paints for painting car models. I guess.",3.0
Takes many coats on a gun sight.  Watery.,3.0
"You never stop learning.  Today I learned that fluorescence does not mean ""glow in the dark""",3.0
"Hoping for the best. Colors are bright enough for daytime use, but glow too dimly to be much use in the dark.",3.0
"Ok, requires many coats",3.0
Fast shipping but one of the bottles opened up slightly causing a small mess in the box. Russ,3.0
"Colors are good, but paint is a bit thin. Used it to highlight my gun sights. Works better if you put a white background on the sight first, then color it in.  Need to add alot of coats. Been on my carry gun for a few months though and haven't faded much. Course I sealed it with clear coat too, so...",3.0
Takes a lot of coats to cover,3.0
Could have more pigment.,3.0
"I thougt luminecsant meant glow in the dark,  but these paints do not.",3.0
"I bought this set to paint my gun sights. It worked Okey, but it is not glowing at all. 3 stars.",3.0
Bought this to paint the rear sites on one of my pistols.  Worked great.  The only complaint that I have is the one of the lids was cross threaded and the paint leaked out into the tray.,3.0
"the paints are nice, but the red is not really red, it's a darker orange. I had to add pink to the darker orate to get something that kind of looked like red. The yellow is very thin as well and will require several coats.",3.0
"all as advertised; I'd buy again if the need came up, even though this paint seems to contain less pigment than the paint I used years ago.",3.0
The green and yellow were the only colors here that stood out as fluorescent. Red and orange are almost the same color.,3.0
The paints are okay. But they didn't work for what I wanted. It would have been nice to have white.,3.0
"I do like what I purchased, but, in the past the enamel I have used, sold by Testors, was more opaque and had more body. The colors are very nice.",3.0
"The paint is a lot less fluorescent then I had thought. I applied 5 coats to ensure adequate coverage as the paint is very thin. The result is a very hard shell, but it seems to lack the fluorescence.",3.0
"Shipped and received quickly, but the paint fluorescence is quite limited. I don't know if it's because it's very old or if that's just a characteristic of the paint itself. I have other white kind that fluoresce much more highly.",3.0
"I bought this paint to paint/highlite gun sights.  If you properly prep and clean the metal to be painted, these florsent colors will do the job with little future touchup.  This truely is the poor man's gun sight highliter until you can afford fiber optic and or ""glow"" type sights.",3.0
"I use this paint to touch up old gun sights, like those found on handguns, to make relatively boring white dot sights pop with color. It works better than those paints on the market intended for painting sights.",3.0
Works great.,3.0
"The wheel is a bit too wobbly, but I couldn't find it at store (Michael's etc) so this was my last resort",3.0
This item did not come with any instructions.  So how do I use them?,3.0
"Ok..,does wat its ment to do",3.0
"Smaller than I though they would be, the spring could be heavier.",3.0
Okay.  Ended up getting a better pair from Michaels/AC Moore.,3.0
"Was using the exacto-knife for taking excess plastic off of model pieces and the tip already broke.  Wasn't even using a lot of force to clean off excess plastic so I was shocked it broke off.  If the knife gets dull, I'd have to buy another one instead of just changing the blade itself.  Everything else was great for putting together my models.",3.0
It's cost effective but the brushes can be bought at Walmart for way less and you get way more. I wouldn't buy it again because you can piece together these tools at Walmart.,3.0
nice starter unit,3.0
I bought this as a gift and did not use it myself. Can't really rate it.,3.0
"The knife is a nice size and shape, HOWEVER it's cheaply made. The back of the package says ""very sharp""....yeah, it's not. Although of course you can still cut yourself with it. I've touched, held and used many sharp things in my time...the sharpest ever was a scalpel.....I consider those VERY SHARP.....stupid sharp in fact.
I effortlessly broke the tip off and a small chunk out of the blade. Disappointing.

The sand paper is very useful though and the glue tips are mediocre. I use the finer pointed Testors glue anyway.

In my opinion Testors brushes are a joke in general. They are no where near small or fine enough to paint much of anything and they flex WAY too much. Do yourself a favor and get some smaller, nicer brushes. I picked up 3 from my local art supply store for about $3.25/each. One was a ""0"", ""10/0"" and a ""5/0"". The company is ""Simply Simmons"". Nice brushes for the price. I mostly used the ""0"" for bulk/bigger things and the ""5/0"" for the tiny stuff. I'm planning on getting something even smaller than the ""5/0"" in the future.
I hardly used the ""10/0"". (""10/0"" is in between the ""0"" and 5/0"")",3.0
Came with missing pieces. Very disappointed as it was a gift.,3.0
Okay starter kit. Useful for throwaway jobs.,3.0
Good product. Overall the knife works well but isn't made with the same quality as say an exacto. I bought this more so for the sand paper patches.,3.0
"Sort of crude, matching its low price",3.0
this is for my husband and as of yet has not been removed from the package.,3.0
its good for starters,3.0
it's ok. comes with the necessary tools for beginner...was hoping for more. tool seems a bit cheap.,3.0
allright,3.0
Not the best but they work until the bristles fall off onto what your painting just not to great .,3.0
Got this a surprise for my husband who got back into the hobby recently. Turns out he had everything in it already. Had that not been the case would have be a great starter kit.,3.0
I would not buy if you seriously planning to go into the hobby of modelling.. it is okay but are better ones,3.0
"The image<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Testors-Hobby-Supplies-Paint-Kit/dp/B0006O5F3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Testors Hobby Supplies Paint Kit</a>&nbsp;does not match the product. It shows you will receive paint, but you do not. You receive model building supplies.",3.0
This item is about what you would expect for the price you pay. The knife gets dull pretty fast and the brushes were almost worthless on any detail job. the only thing i can use them for is the under coat on large surfaces.,3.0
Just be good as is.,3.0
Many of the car wedges were not cut properly or the wheel slots were bowed,3.0
"It's really more ""fairly accurate"" than ""precise"", but it more than meets my needs. I bought this to replace the one supplied with the Matchitecture kit I'm doing and it's making the build much easier so I'm very satisfied with it. On the negative side, it's overpriced. $26 for a block of wood, a sticker and some plastic seems a bit much. Also, mine wobbled so I had to shim one of the feet with three thicknesses of masking tape. You can't call it a precision tool when it's unstable on a flat surface.",3.0
this is really not a self healing mat. not like any I ever had in the past anyway. this is more like tough plastic like a very thin cutting board. it gets score lines from the x-acto blades. also the label printed on the mat covers a large section that gets in the way. big distraction.,3.0
"Although a little thin,the cutting mat is a convenient size. Great for university and feels solid; you get what you paid for. Beware of the smell...you might need to air it out for a few days. Not too bad.",3.0
"I bought this mat to work on miniature models for gaming.  I thought I was just looking for any ""self-healing"" mat.  Unfortunately I needed to pay more attention, as this is a self-healing rotary mat.  This is apparently a small but important difference in what I was actually looking for.  The mat is nice and big, which I really like, but the warning label on the mat states, DO NOT USE WITH FIXED BLADES.  IE: I shouldn't use my X-acto knife on the mat, as it won't ""heal"" from those type of cuts.  I do like the mat and I am keeping it, but it's about half the thickness and toughness I was expecting it to be, having seen actual self healing knife mats in the past.

I would recommend the mat, as it is very nice, but as a consumer, be aware of subtle nuances in mat styles.",3.0
I went to arts and crafts stores but they were small and expensive. this is larger and at a great price. it does have a smell but it goes away.,3.0
This board is so much thinner than the original board that I bought. I was a little disappointed and should have spent more money on a better quality board. I would not recommend it for heavy cutting or for heavy duty work areas. I think it is more suitable for children in my opinion.,3.0
I was very disappointed in the product as I do like the dot painters.  There is really very little shimmer.  The silver is just grey and the gold is just yellow.,3.0
"It came off on my 3 yr old granddaughter's arm and was very difficult to clean. I threw them away, but she did have fun. Would be perfect for an older child who understood to hold their arm off the coloring area.",3.0
"My daughter loves these and I loved the idea of painting without the mess.  Everything was working out great until I tried to clean up after her first session with them.  She accidentally dabbed the table in a few places and the stains won't budge. I tried everything, but no luck.  They are fun,  for sure,  but NOT worth the clean up.  It's a shame because I really wanted these to work out.",3.0
"My son loves them, but they barely shimmer.",3.0
Not much shimmer to these markers.,3.0
"It was nice to have some slightly different colors than the original but believe me, they don't shimmer, so don't get your hopes up about that.",3.0
"We love the dots, we color with them quite a bit.  No problem with staining.  In fact the puppy got a tube and made a big mess and it didn't stain.  But there isn't much shimmer, glitter, or sparkle.  Disappointing about that part.  Just get the regular colors.",3.0
its smaller than it looks,3.0
"Beware, this is a walnut oil ""medium"", not walnut oil.  I bought it thinking it was walnut oil.",3.0
"Received a pink color scissors instead of green.  Order did state random assorted colors, would have preferred to pick a color as opposed getting a random color.  Now we just have a extra scissor around the house.",3.0
I thought they were a little pricey for a standard pair of kids scissors.,3.0
I ended up with pink handled ones for my son.  I realize it says assorted colors but it doesn't show pink in the product photo.  I don't think pink or purple should be used because there is roughly a 50% chance it will be wrong.  Any other color would work for a boy or girl.,3.0
"These are small.  I use them in an 8th grade classroom.  Many of my male students complain about how difficult it is to use such little scissors with larger hands. They are smaller than I expected, but they serve their purpose.  Just keep in mind these really are for small hands - like 5th grade and below probably.",3.0
Product is good. But too bad can't pick a color while placing order. Now got a pink sissor for a crying boy who wants a green.,3.0
"The product itself is perfectly fine. A new pair of blunt tip scissor in package as expected. But I'm disappointed you're at the mercy of the packer for the color. Of the 4 pair I ordered for my son, 3 are pink. We will be donating these to the classroom and buying another pair at the store in more neutral colors :-/",3.0
Ordered red and got neon pink! My SON was not all too happy lol,3.0
"Picture kind of misleading.  Appears to show 3, but description and pkg say one.  Not something I paid much attention to for the price.  Scissors worked.",3.0
These are not left-handed scissors. They are fair-quality right-handed scissors.,3.0
"Smaller than expected, somewhat flimsy, but they will work.",3.0
"Not too impressed with these scissors. They cut, but are not any easier for my child to cut with than the cheaper scissors we already had.",3.0
"Meant for smaller hands, which I couldn't really gauge online.  I have my 4-year-old using them rather than my 9-year-old. It worked out.",3.0
our youngest is left handed. At 3 his main goal is to create (read this as cut things up). we looked for a pair of left handed scissors and bought these. If they are left handed - news to us.....,3.0
I wanted all four colors they sent 7 pink and 1 blue.  I wanted at least one of each please.,3.0
"You were supposed to send a ""variety"" of colors, which I thought was okay....but you sent all pink and they are for my 9 year old left handed ""grandson"".",3.0
"Too many browns, some of the blues and reds seem to be just about the same color, and no purple or pink paints! sad.
 More bright colors would be better. Good quality paint, though. And I like the stackable,  screwable cylinders. Good amount of paint, also.",3.0
"I bought these because of a demo by a professor i T.A.ed for. He used them to mix up egg tempra paints for hand coloring relief prints. I want to try them for that but in the meantime thought they might do for travel.

I tested them on canson 90lb mixed media sketchbook paper. Most of the colors are pretty pigmented though some are not too bright. They do dry chalky though and the more pigmented colors rub off. The fourth row down, second and third from the right are gold and silver; they do have a nice metallic sheen to them.

Overall I think these will work well for mixed media works, coloring and field sketches but finish them with a spraying of fixative to prevent rub off. I already know they mix well for egg tempra and that is permanent.",3.0
I was motivated by the ratings to try these. I didn't find they're as creamy as I'd like. For the money they were worth trying out and I do use them.,3.0
"Haven't tried it out yet, but opening it, it fell apart and broke, and it's quite tiny, not at all what I expected.",3.0
"I love the packaging: the discs are fun, functional, and easy to use; the lid makes a great palette and each disc has a center well you can also use; and the color selection is great (I bought the 24 color pack); it's compact size makes it great for an on-the-go art box. What I don't like is the chalky, gritty residue from the paint once the picture dries. If you have artist grade watercolor tubes, this would make a great container to refill the paint-wells (pans) with your own paints.",3.0
"I ordered 2 sets.  One was perfect - came as ordered, full set.  A+ on this one.
The second one I ordered came separately the next day - packaging different, had the paint trays but no mixing lid.  The mixing lid also protects the paints - that means the paints were scratched up and had streaks of other paints (green/red) on top of the lighter colors (white and yellow).  Not an expensive product but I still have a basic expectation to receive the full set and in good condition.  C- on the 2nd one.",3.0
Good for the kids and their painting activity,3.0
"Unique, but not too practical.  They stack nicely but when using the colors they bleed into each other if too wet.  You can use the clear top as a small palate.",3.0
"I was expecting more vivid color but the results one can get from this set is only limited by the talent (or lack thereof in my case) of the user!  The quantity/size of the paints is smaller than I expected but there was no deceception on this issue.  Just be aware it is a small set.  On the other hand, it is highly portable and that is a plus in my book.",3.0
"This iridescent white oil paint isn't one that I use frequently; but it does come in handy for those times when you want add a bit of a pearlescent sheen to other oil colors.  It is a white iridescent, and not a transparent one, so of course it also changes the color to a lighter tint and with more opacity.",3.0
Color was night quite what we wanted. Other wise fine,3.0
Flake white was gummy.  Utrecht makes a better flake.,3.0
I like the color and quality of the paint.  When it arrived I felt like the paint had been opened before and possibly used because it doesn't seem like the tube was full.,3.0
"Good deal, find it hard to get Windsor and Newton where I live but postage was a tad high I thought",3.0
"Can't review this because I did not get it.  I got waterbased oil, same color and have not used it yet.  Should be fine though as W&N colours are usually very good.",3.0
Ok,3.0
"Was great, sharp at the beginning of my projects but before long got dull in a spot which, of course, left an uncut string which when moving the excess fabric away from the pattern is quite annoying!",3.0
"The blade works great. However, from the ad, which says ""Blade for Pik 2 2 Pack"", I thought there would be 2 blades, and there's only 1. I was disappointed....",3.0
They work ok. I have to go over and over the fabric to cut it all the way through. I don' use it much.,3.0
I don't find this blade as sharp as the straight blade.  I have all Olfa brand rotary cutters and blades but I guess the design of these pinking and wave blades does not allow it for the blade to be sharp enough.,3.0
works great,3.0
Bought this blade specifically for cutting my flannel quilting project pieces.  It does help cut down on fraying and works just fine.,3.0
My husband had to use it. It took so much muscle to get it to cut through the flannel material. The material was not thick.,3.0
"dont use yet but i hope at works for me later, is was different what i expected for my use",3.0
"I have used these blades for years, however the last two that I bought get a rough spot in just a few months of use.  They don't make a clean cut and 'skip' so that I have to go over the same spot more that once to get a clean cut.  If this continues I'll be shopping for a different brand.",3.0
"It's ok, but very thin. I plan to use it up.",3.0
"It's clear, not very opaque. Liquitex is better. You can blend with other paints though. I don't recommend this. You get more for your money with Liquitex Basic paints and those are more opaque then this.",3.0
fine. was hoping it would feel heavier in my hand.  blade is sharp but could be better. ok as a short term solution but I'm.going to keep looking for something better.,3.0
"Sharp,will be reorderjng again soon",3.0
Not extremely shiny. Think well-used aluminum rather than chrome.,3.0
"the blade not very sharp, i have to runs it few times to cut my fabric.",3.0
it is just okay,3.0
This item took nearly two weeks to be delivered. Otherwise as expected.,3.0
it's okay......,3.0
"Nice as a backup cutter, but feels flimsy compared to my fiskars rotary cutter. The blade retractor is clumsier to operate than the one on the fiskars where I just have to push a button.",3.0
"I got these for my daughter as a Christmas present. She seems to like them, but some of the scissors have a hard time opening and closing and seem to catch on the other side of the design. They don't cut very well, either, but well enough to be used.",3.0
"The concept and look are great, but the ease of use, especially for younger kids (mine are 3 and 5) are not so great.  The scissors are stiff and hard for even me to open and they aren't fluid when cutting so you have to cut and then use two hands to open and reposition and then cut again.  My kids got frustrated and don't use them at all now.  I'd just stick to the standard straight scissors as they are much easier on little hands or buy a single pair of design scissors of higher quality.  A lot of the designs don't turn out that great either.",3.0
Too difficult to mix and blend.  Not a good choice for dirty pours at least not for me.,3.0
"I was hoping ""heavy body"" wouldn't require so many layers of paint to become opaque. Still, a nice metallic finish that I wanted so not all bad.",3.0
Lots of clumps in there.  Like the product is old or has been opened and not taken care of.,3.0
"I was disappointed with the color of this paper, as it is rather pale.  Depending on what you need it for, that may not be a problem, but for my purposes (collage), I wanted a paper with a richer canary color.  That notwithstanding, I think it's perfectly satisfactory as a tracing or sketching paper. Having purchased 3 different brands, I have determined that I prefer one of the other ones for collaging.",3.0
"This is good paper, but very thin. I wanted to use it with my students so they could write a time line of their lives. It works, but they have to be very careful not to tear it. That's the thing to keep in mind. It's on the thin side if you're wanting to use it for more than tracing.",3.0
was wayyyyy to small for me,3.0
"Good quality letters, however, there weren't enough letters in this set.  Other sets had 4 of each letters.  This set gave you two of each letters.....not enough.",3.0
Dont really know why I bought this lol but I used it one time for a project I was doing and it came out pretty good,3.0
Not what I was looking for,3.0
These were not exactly as I expected they appeared to be kind of flimsy but I did make Use of them.,3.0
"Used these for my graduation cap. While they were easy to use, they were not sticky enough to stay securely on my hat. Everytime someone touched or hit my hat, they moved. I tried applying pressure to them to get them to stick better and it worked okay. They all stayed on for the ceremony, albeit moved slightly. Wish they had more stickiness to them but they were fine overall.",3.0
"I give this grade only because the letters have not been put to use yet, so, cannot say anything about how well they stick to objects.  They are just the right size for what my husband is wanting.  He uses them for letter on the yard tractors he refurbishes.",3.0
"OK, I was really looking for numbers..",3.0
for the price not enough letters.,3.0
"I made an art piece over an old photograph that said simply, ""This day will never happen again"". Easy enough, right? Count the letters and order the appropriate number of vinyl letters. NOPE. I counted them, ordered what I thought would be enough and still had to jimmyrig the letters for ""AGAIN"".",3.0
"If you are used to buying lettering from office supply stores, please note that this sheet is roughly 5x9"" rather than the 9x11"" you might expect to find in a store rack.  I only had to spell out one word but if you need a sentence, you'll need more sheets.",3.0
Vinyl was thinner than other brands we have used.,3.0
I used these vinyl letters on some buckets that I store wood pallets in for smoking. I applied the letters on the buckets  and sprayed over the letters and remove the letters.,3.0
"I don't think there is anything ""wrong"" with this product; I just didn't read the description very well and the letters are much, much smaller than I anticipated.",3.0
Go through the coloring book paper and it is pretty thick. I like the colors nice little variety.,3.0
"I love these for the most part, I color a lot of stuff that I needed super fine point marker for. However, a couple of the markers were already dry before I even started using them. Ill probably still reorder in the future though.",3.0
"These markers are not ideal for coloring as they do not give smooth coverage. However, they are good for writing. Keep that in mind.",3.0
This is a nice assortment or colors and they arrived quickly. You can use them for writing. I tried to use them for adult coloring the they tear the pigment on the paper. I tried thick card stock and they still tear any areas of overlap.  So I now have nice assortment of colors to write with.,3.0
"Was disappointed in the pens because, although the colors are great and I love the felt tip of the marker, they don't cover well and are streaky and pull up the paper and it ""pil"".",3.0
"Some markers would have bold, highly-pigmented colors that bled, while some others would be weak, thin, and pill up the paper I was using.",3.0
"Really wanted to like these more, but they just aren't that great for coloring books. I wanted something affordable with more colors and this fits the bill in that area, and the case it comes in is really great. However, the colors are a bit off to me and you can't go over the same area on a page without it pulling up the paper a little each time.",3.0
Dry out fast. But good color.,3.0
"This set has a nice array of colors but sometimes they do not color as smoothly as I would like.  They are better for coloring small, but not tiny, spaces, and not good for very large or very tiny spaces..still a nice set to round out pen sets you might like better that do not have as large a color array..",3.0
good colors but not ideal for coloring books which is what I got it for. (I'm no artist and I know it) if thats what your looking at this for- look elsewhere. If you're looking for doing actual writing or art of some kind? perfect.,3.0
"I bought these for coloring in adult coloring books. They were okay for coloring. They need a ""break"" often when coloring large spaces though.",3.0
"An ok set, not the greated coverage though",3.0
"These markers are ok , you get a large variety of color. I bought these after using them in an art class they are really vivid and sharp. What is didn't like was after coloring in a picture the marker was shed a lot of felt. Defiantly good for small coloring pieces",3.0
"Some beautiful colors that are unavailable in other pens. However, many of the pens are dry and most of them tear up the paper when using.",3.0
The colors are great but the tips peel off a bit when coloring and that is annoying.,3.0
"I received these about a month ago. The case it comes in is pretty & convenient. However, the colors were darker than I expected. They are ok... they have a good amount of bleeding when I color. Other than that they are fine; I put them to good use when I pair them with other markers. I just wouldn't buy them again.",3.0
Use them for adult coloring. They're ok.,3.0
"I purchased these ""pens"" (read: markers) for coloring in adult coloring books and doodling. I suppose they are okay for that purpose but don't purchase these for artwork any fancier than that.
Pros: This set does have a nice color selection.
Cons: The tips of these pens are rough, not smooth, making simple ""coloring"" not that pleasant. The lines they create are not smooth either. Also the ink of these pens has bled through everything I've used them on.
Stabilo has a pen set similar to this one and the tips on them are far superior to this brand.",3.0
"Good for writing in a journal, calendars, posterboards, etc but NOT for adult coloring in books! Once u start coloring back and forth these markers will start tearing thru your coloring book paper even if it's thicker paper. i bought them to add accents to my coloring books, backgrounds etc, but any back and forth coloring absolutely started to peel the paper away. I now use them for writing purpose only. Nice colors but not for adult coloring.",3.0
"these dry out quickly.  the color is bright and flows nicely but not for long.  I couldn't make them last through a one evening project.  I was not coloring in large areas, just outlining.",3.0
"These pens are well-packaged and in a nice variety of colors, but they bleed through thin paper and are not for coloring books. Where the color overlaps you'll get darker colors, which means all you can do is write normal-sized handwritten words on thick paper or poster board. I'm not sure where I'll be able to use these, to be honest.",3.0
"I like these for my adult coloring books. The coloring books I have are very detailed and have very small areas to color which these are nice for. However, a few of the markers don't work. They are not dried out or anything, it just looks like their colors have faded. Its hard to explain but its a bummer that some of these do not work.",3.0
not alot of ink in them after the cap is off onceor twice they are died up even after you add water like they say to do,3.0
"Pencils feel dry, do not roll smoothly. And they fray the paper.",3.0
Not as smooth for coloring in Adult Coloring books as I thought they would be,3.0
They weren't great for coloring in adult coloring books.,3.0
"Good for small areas, but very streaky otherwise.  Great for outlining but not actual coloring.  Though I've yet to find good markers for coloring so if anyone has any suggestions....",3.0
Great assortment of colors but a lot of them were dried out,3.0
Markers are dry and I just started using them. I always keep the caps on.,3.0
These pens are disappointing. They do bleed through and the tips become thick after a few usages. These do not work well for coloring books but perhaps they are aimed at a different usage.,3.0
The color variety is a little poor. Lots and lots of neutrals and not enough variety in the greens and blues. The ink and pen tip quality is very good.,3.0
These dry out as I'm coloring with them. I switched to using gel pens for my adult coloring books,3.0
"These are nice markers, but I don't like how they look when I use them on my adult coloring book, the colors bleed a little. I prefer something not as heavy. They are nice colors though.",3.0
"I'm using these for an adult coloring book. The colors aren't a perfect match to the marker cases. And they fray when you use them so you get little pieces of marker on the sheet. They are just ok for me. I'm not a serious color-er, so I'll make due with them.",3.0
"colors are good, but don't match marker color well, tips are very scratchy - they tear paper a lot, will not buy again.",3.0
great colors but i cant really use them on my books...they tear the paper after a couple of repeat strokes.,3.0
"These are just okay.

Positives:  handy storage case, plenty of ink

These color pens to me are more of the old school style thin markers.  They're just fine to use as pens for writing colorful notes, lists or doodles, but unfortunately not the right marker for adult coloring books or art.  Caps don't match colors at all, all of the colors are medium to dark/intense with no pastels for contrast and all bleed through paper.

I will stick with sharpee pastel permanent markers, these will be given to kids.",3.0
colors are not as they appear on the outside,3.0
"They are ok, price was ok. We were looking for a finer tip marker, but they get the job done.",3.0
I bought these with the adult coloring books in mind. The colors are great but the pens bleed a lot. Perhaps with thicker paper they would be great.,3.0
They are ok. Much better pens available.,3.0
"Most of the marker colors are very dark, and opaque.  When using them for coloring books, it's a little challenging to select the lighter, more transparent markers.",3.0

"Good markers, but the shade of the plastic outside doesn't really match (or seem related) the shade of the marker ink. For example, the ink color in a light colored plastic is usually as dark as the ink in a darker colored marker--they're different colors. They're easy to use, but if you're an artist (not a hobbyist like me), you might want to look elsewhere.",3.0
OK,3.0
Don't purchase to use with coloring books. Markers bleed through.,3.0
"I've been using these for adult coloring books. Okay for the price. Plenty of ink, but no fabulous flesh tones & the fine tips start to break down after a time providing a less fine line. Ink doesn't perfectly match exterior of the pen.",3.0
Nice bright colors but bleed through paper a bit. Been using on the adult coloring books.,3.0
"I had high hopes for these markers based on the reviews. I should have paid more attention to the low star reviews, because they are very accurate. I purchased them to use on adult coloring books. Not great for that. I considered returning them but did find a purpose for them in coloring tight spaces.

Pros:  Nice case, decent price, good ink supply, decent color choices, good for tiny coloring spaces, would probably be good for posters etc.

Cons:  1: colors are way off from the cap/marker color. I have to look at the chart on the back to figure out what color I need for a lot of them.
2:  tip of marker too hard. Might be good for writing but not coloring, it also tears the paper if you aren't careful.
3. Some of the markers create ""fuzz"" on the paper
4. Not good for coloring large areas
5. If you go over a previous colored area the marker bleeds and messes up the paper.
6: some colors are very ""streaky""
7: not smooth at all, I actually felt stressed using them because I had to be so careful
8. They will bleed through thin paper/pages

For the price, I will keep them. My opinion is if you want them for coloring, these are not a good choice.",3.0
"Nice pens, but limited color palette and the ink colors are not the same as you would think based on the pen color.  Also, they tend to bleed through the pages, requiring another sheet to be placed behind the page.",3.0
Got these for my wife to do adult coloring for relaxation. I give these 3 stars as the ink seeps thru the paper. In some of the coloring books there are images on both sides of the paper an with the bleed thru you ruin one of the pictures. However the colors are great. This is not the best pens to used for coloring books but I'm sure they are great for other purposes,3.0
"This product is a top seller and has pretty awesome reviews but I did NOT like them.  Crayola markers (yuck) work better than these!  I wanted markers for adult coloring books but these markers did not fill in the area without a lot of effort and they left streaks.  It was super difficult to stay in the lines even on BIGGER pictures b/c of the thick tip.  Fine (not extra fine) tipped Sharpies were much easier to keep within the lines and they are larger than these markers plus Sharpies don't leave streaks or tear up the paper from ""scrubbing"" to get color on.  Sharpies work very well except they bleed through).  I LOVE the Straedtler markers (although the tips are MUCH smaller they go extra smooth and fill in larger areas without difficulty and it is very easy to stay within the lines in any space) AND Straedtler colored pencils (the colors/coloring is like a great marker--goes on so easily and the colors are bright.  I'll be switching fully to the colored pencils; they are that great).  The Pentel Color Pens/markers are fine for kids or doddleling but I'd never suggest them for adult color books.  I highly doubt anyone that tried Straedtler would recommend Pentel except for kids or a temp option until one can save up for Straedtler...I'll try to add pics at a future date of pictures colored with both brands.",3.0
some are very hard to open,3.0
"My daughter (she's 9) wanted markers to draw pictures when she's following tutorials on YouTube. They were a great price and have great color selections.

They are definitely more suited to intricate coloring books than filling in large areas. They are rather stiff and tend to be tough on the paper. In hindsight, I suppose the fact that they are called ""Color Pens"" should have tipped me off. Don't make the same mistake I did in assuming these are markers suitable for children under the age of 13 or 14.",3.0
just average,3.0
"The color that appears on paper is not the same as the color of the marker (the light pink is actually orange), so I would test them out on a separate sheet of paper before actually using them. I am disappointed by the lack of lighter shades in this set because most of the colors turn out very dark when used. These markers also do bleed so watch for that if you are using it in a coloring book.",3.0
"These would be perfect except there are several mislabeled colors. I bought them because they are Pentel.  At least 1/4 are mislabeled...the color name, the case that indicates the color, and the number chart.  These look like they were labeled by non-English speakers.",3.0
"The makers themselves were nice, but the colors on the pens are a little misleading with the ink that's in them. There's not a whole range of colors like it seems, just different shades of the same few colors. Some are also the same color just glittery. Also a couple of the colors don't have just a regular shade of the color. Maybe if you buy just a regular pack of crayola markers with it, it would feel more of a ""complete"" set. But they are vivid.",3.0
"I receive these as a Christmas gift along with an adult coloring book. I had both on my wish list as bees were advertised as a suggested item or frequently purchased with...while I love the colors...they aren't really a good long term bet  for my coloring book. Well each marker starts out with a fine tip, it wears down very quickly which means I cannot use it on subsequent pictures that have smaller detail. Also the pens will bleed through the pages on my book, which is of decent quality. This is easily solved by putting a piece of paper in between the pages...but overall the set is best used for larger less detailed drawings.",3.0
"I think the quality is great for the price but the ink not matching the marker drives me crazy! If you are slightest bit OCD I would not get these. I had quickly glanced over reviews and saw colors could be off but I didn't think it would be this bad. I went to color a flower with this pretty pink and it turns out its neon orange! Not even close...also green ended up being dark gray. I am still giving it 3 stars because of the value and because I can write on a piece of scrap paper first before using it on my actual coloring book. The tip is very sharp but can also be wider if used at an angle, although I'm curious as to how long the fine tip will last. Another thing that bothers me about these is that they are very streaky....again not a huge deal but still something to note. If they could just change the color of the pens to match the ink (or make the ink actually match the marker exterior lol) that would be great :)",3.0
"I have a love hate relationship with these pens. I bought them for adult coloring books. The colors are vibrant. The tips are firm and work best in small spaces. But you really need to use a very light hand when shading or coloring in a space. These tear up the paper too easily. The color range is also limited and dark (no light blue or pink for example). When the ink ""dries"" you can also see your strokes and it's not consistent.  Luckily I only paid 15$ as Amazon had a coupon for these. I will keep to add to my marker collection.",3.0
"I liked the pens overall but some of them are almost dried out from the get-go and the caps don't really match the colors at all. For one thing, there really aren't any pastels.",3.0
I bought these for adult coloring books but I am going to give these to my daughter instead.  They bleed through the page ALOT.  They are scratchy and mess up the paper when coloring larger areas. On smaller areas they are not fine enough.,3.0
Not as pleased with these as expected. I've had good experience with Pentel markers but found these colors on the muddy side and the tips tend to flake and shed bits with use. Not a terrible pen for light use and simple line drawings but I'd be cautious of these for color fill purposes.,3.0
"Well.... the colors are nice to look at in they're casings .......but they are misleading.... They do bleed..... and some seem to frey a little, you know the tips loosen a bit...so they are just  ok  ..... I will Not order this product again...sorry",3.0
"They are decent quality colored pens, I use them for my adult coloring books, but nothing fancy or to brag about. The color on paper doesn't match the color you see on the actual marker which I found was pretty misleading. Not bad, but could be better.",3.0
"The colors are not true to the pen color at all...., but I like the tips how they are nice and thin and stay that way...",3.0
"Good colors, but nothing like the pens. These are very slim markers, which is perfect if that's what you want. Nothing really outstanding for me.",3.0
"On some paper, they tear the paper.  If your coloring book is double sided DON'T USE THESE.",3.0
"colors are good, but they tear, rough-up paper easily.... won't buy again.",3.0
"I used these for my Enchanted Forest coloring book and was a little disappointed at the color options and appearance.
There are no lime green or bubblegum pink colors. Only 2 oranges which look practically the same and 2 yellows which look the same as well.
The caps don't match the markers and there are a lot of ""ugly"" colors tbh.
I'm looking for something else.",3.0
Knowing that Pentel is a great brand I ordered these pens to use for my coloring.  The colors are bright and true to what they should be BUT they heavily saturate the  paper and I can't use them at all on the coloring books that I have. My books have fairly heavy paper but these pens would work best on poster  board or something much thicker than paper.  I am saving this set to give to my grandchildren - I'm sure they will have fun with them.,3.0
They tend to bleed a little.,3.0
"Has a nice selection of pretty colors, but the tip is not exactly what I would call fine point. They are pointy, but not fine pointy, which makes it difficult to fill in the fine details of the patterns that I am coloring. That is the only drawback to these, but for me it is a big drawback.",3.0
"I wanted to like these pens and use them for adult coloring books but despite trying repeated times, I just don't find them useful enough. As others noticed, they leave a definite start/stop blob that is darker, and filling in areas larger than the width of the pen leave overlap marks, not to mention easily saturate the paper and a *lot* of bleed through. Also, going over tends to darken the color even more, and that is my greatest complaint. The colors do not match the caps and are no where near as light in tone as the caps would suggest. The lightest pink still looks almost like fuscia, and there is nothing lighter. Sam with light tan/beige and peach tones. There is almost no range of greens, and purple options are very slim since the tones are so dark. I will not purchase again, I find that I use my daughter's Crayola PipSqueak markers more frequently because they have a wider range of tones!",3.0
Good quality,3.0
"These didn't fit my need. I bought them to use with my adult coloring books, but they were super stiff, and they seemed to really bleed on the more porous papers. Some were more stiff than others, and some were just dry. They weren't my favorite marker. I do like the case they came in, so I can keep them together easier.",3.0
They work. i'm not impressed and i wouldn't order them again. You can't over color what you've already colored because it like gathers up the paper and you have this moist paper ball... lol i don't know how to describe it.,3.0
I like to color for relaxation.  I have yet to find a coloring book that I like using these on.  The nibs are so hard that they tend to roughen the paper I'm coloring...leaving little patches of pulled paper tufted on the page.  Not a smooth coloring option in my mind.  So might save for incredibly small color fills.,3.0
"I was disappointed that there were not many pastel colors in the set. Also found I had to constantly refer to the chart to see what the color was supposed to be as most of the colors of the pen were not even close to what the color was when applied. #135 Rose de Corail I expected to be a pale pink looked closer to orange, #124 beige had enough green to look closer to olive, # 116 & 130 orange pale plastic case looked pink and orange sombre might have been better named flesh color.",3.0
"Pens tend to rub paper and create little wads of paper, unless used with a super-light touch.  Using on a Dover coloring book and I had no trouble with Sharpie or Sakuro pens, they did not rub like these.  Colors are nice, good range, would like to try them on other books to see if they also rub up paper on them.  The colors on the pens do NOT match the color inside, make your own chart to avoid frustration.",3.0
"These markers come in a great variety and many colors. I got the 36 pack, which comes in a neat case, that keeps everything organized and easily accessible. There's so many colors and shades to choose from. Pe tell usually makes good products, but these weren't all that great. Even though there's many colors, the shades don't really match the color of the marker itself. For example, the marker body could be green, but when you use it it's either too light or too dark. Doesn't exactly match the shade too well. Even though these are felt tip markers, when you color with these, and color a spot repeatedly, these tend to creating little fuzz balls and rough up the surface of the paper. If you color a spot over and over, the paper tends to get too wet and rip. So I advise you to color gently, or get thicker, higher quality paper. I got the fine tips, which leaves streaks when I color, but I think it's probably the way I'm coloring. Other than that, these are great for children, but definitely not for adults. For adults I highly suggest, prismacolors, copics, or promarkers.",3.0
"At first I was pleased and excited, cause colors nice and vibrant. Then I found that some of the pens are dried out and worthless. Left me feeling pretty disappointed. :(",3.0
"These are good! They're very fine tip markers and I use them for the stress relieving coloring books so I think they work perfectly! From marker to marker however they do tend to go onto the paper differently. Some are smooth coloring while others are a little harder to get to glide across the paper! And small but important to me, the tape that is on the plastic packaging was so sticky that I couldn't get it off with rubbing alcohol and had to put the markers in a different container and just throw away the packaging!",3.0
"The colors are vibrant, but they release a lot of ink. Only for use on high quality paper.",3.0

They're good but not worth the price in my opinion! Your better off getting cheaper ones,3.0
great colors but bleed through paper easily. I wouldn't recomended for double sided adult coloring books.,3.0
"I bought these when I first jumped on the adult coloring book fad. My issue with these markers is that some far too dry, some are too wet, and many of the colors are so dark and ugly that I never used them, which left me with very few colors to work with. I switched to gel pens and am much happier with the results and ease of use.",3.0
"I've used these pens before & I like them for the less finely-detailed work in my coloring / art projects. This is the first time I've purchased them thru Amazon, however, & it was clear to me that they were already old. I'm very experienced with colored ""felt"" pens ~ including this particular brand ~ & these colors were already drying out, already streaky & leaving lumpy residue. Unfortunately, they sat for about a month while I finished my previous set (which I'd had for a couple years) & it was too late to return them. So I feel ripped off & won't buy them via Amazon again.",3.0
"These markers come in a nice carrying case to keep them organized and they color well. Colors are vibrant. However, the color of the caps are a bit misleading, for example, the pale pink one isn't pink at all- it's orange. There is no soft blue either. You should definitely scribble on a separate piece of paper before committing to your design just to make sure it's what you want. The tip of the markers are nice and can fill intricate patterns and most (but not all) don't leave stroke marks. There is more bleeding if you color over an existing colored area- at least in my experience using my coloring book. So be careful. Overall, good markers, but I need to get another set with more color range. Maybe a pastel set or something since most of these turn out dark.",3.0
"Meh.  Not the best markers ever, not the worst.  Good color selection, though!",3.0
Pentel pens are wonderful but not for the coloring books.  They bleed through and the color is uneven.  I should have ordered the colored pencils.,3.0
"Very disappointed. While the plastic pens look like there are 36 colors, there are probably only no more than 18. When you draw, the colors look identical. The light pink and dark pink come out the same, and that is true of many colors. With so many repeats, there are colors missing. I would not buy again.",3.0
"I was hopeful that these would work great.  But they tend to grab fibers of the paper as you color (using normal white copy/printer paper).  When coloring intricate designs, it can be an issue.",3.0
SO-SO...Some of the markers are dry.  Expected the product to have moisture and produce color.  Disappointed for price.,3.0
"I recently started getting into adult coloring. It's extremely relaxing and I enjoy trying to find fun color patterns. I bought ultra fine sharpies and they were perfect for my small coloring. I bought these because they had more colors. I don't like them at all. I have pretty thick paper and it starts to shred the paper when I color if I go over the same spot a second time, even on accident. I tried to color one page with them and I couldn't do it. They bleed terribly and just don't feel nice on the paper. The final colored page even has a nasty texture to it now.

I'm at least giving three stars because of the selection of colors, though they don't quite match the cap as others have posted. I also like that they are smooth if you only make one straight line. They just are absolutely wrong for coloring in my opinion.",3.0
"I like the color selection of this marker set, but several of the markers leaked ruining my notes (I am a medical student who rewrites and draws to study).  I was unhappy that at least 3 of the markers were unusable the same day that I opened the package.  Many of them work just fine, however.  I think I will return to my PaperMate Flair pens next time.",3.0
Ok.  Colors are a bit darker than the pen color. Colors bleed through paper in adult coloring book.,3.0
Purchased a set years ago and lasted a long time. I didn't give it more than 3 stars because the colors are much darker than I remember.,3.0
these pens are very good. My mistake was that the tips were too sharp for what I needed. The product is very good again but for small intricate stuff. Not big projects.,3.0
A gift for my daughter.  A very impressive spectrum of colors held in a quality case.  The daughter is very pleased with their performance.  I knocked a star off because the were shipped late and I was forced to postpone a trip waiting for them to arrive.,3.0
Fine.,3.0
"first a disclaimer: I'm no artist. I'm new to coloring mandalas for relaxation and was very excited when these markers arrived. I've now used them approximately 15 hours. The viscosity of the ink varies. Some seemed almost dry from the beginning, while others are too juicy for me to use in very small places. None of the yellow toned hues works for me, they are all to dry. Like other reviewers have said, the ink color may not be the color of the marker plastic, so I've learned to test each one before using it to avoid ruining my...ahem...""art."" I will try another brand of markers when these wear out.",3.0
"I would not suggest using this color set for adult coloring books for a lot of reasons. First of all, the color differentiation is not adequate for the tiny spaces in an adult color book. the colors of the Pens are actually very very different from what they appear to be. While I agree that this is an inexpensive set, I do not recommend them for adult coloring books or extensive Use..",3.0
"A little scratchy feeling, but has a great diversity of colors. I would recommend papermate felt tip pens instead, they're a little pricey, but they write smoothly.",3.0
"These are nice markers and do what they described.  I didn't give a full 5 stars because I did not care for the fluidity and movement of the marker on the paper.  I had been using gel pens and those are much easier to use for coloring.  If you are only looking for writing with these markers, then they'll work great.  There are a lot of color choices.",3.0
Nice tool for the price.,4.0
Nice look and feel. Point seems unlikely to bend anytime soon.,4.0
Works nicely but would have preferred a shorter needle portion as I'm not going through more than 5-8 sheets at a time.  The bulbous handle makes for easy griping that is comfortable and allows for greater control.  I use this for piercing my signatures for book binding and have gone though several books now and it still works great.  I have used this to pierce through my book covers as well and it works just great.  Would buy again even with longer needle.,4.0
"Exactly as described. I use it for book binding (punching holes in paper signatures) and for that it works very well. Don't know whether it would be as effective in other applications, but it seems a good quality tool.",4.0
"Lost my old scratch awl which was this exact model.  Couldn't find one like it in the stores.  A scratch awl is just the ticket for marking screw holes and even making a pilot hole for small screws.  Also, the awl can be used to hold a piece you are attaching while you put in the first screw.  Indispensable piece of kit for the home handy person.",4.0
Seems to do the job as expected.  No problems with the vendor. May give more feed back once I have used it more.,4.0
"I bought this as a marking tool in the shop, for precise marking of holes and drawing scribe lines.  It is solid and durable in its construction.  In particular, the steel blade runs all the way through the solid hardwood handle; you can see its top end, a cap about a half inch in diameter.  The tool has just a bit of heft to it.

I actually already have a small awl in the shop to compare this one to.  The one I have is about a third as long, has a much finer and sharper blade, and a smaller handle.  The small one I have is quite likely for some other purpose than heavy shop work - perhaps it is for working with leather or fabric.  But because of its very fine point, it may be possible to get a bit more accuracy than the General Tools Awl, which is sharp, but not as sharp, and does not have as fine a point.

Aside from perhaps not being as accurate, I am certain that the General Tools Awl will hold up better over the long run.  I want to be able to mark holes not only for wood, but also aluminum, and I think the General Tools Awl will work better with light metals (I doubt either would be good for marking any but fairly thin steel plates).

4 stars means I like it.  It is well made and suits its purpose well.  There's nothing wrong with it that keeps me from giving it 5 stars, rather, my own rating  system reserves 5 stars for products that go above and beyond what is expected.  This one is well made and simply does its job well, hence 4 stars.",4.0
"I bought this tool thinking it was made in the U.S.A.,........wrong,....you guessed it ""China"". Reguardless of that fact, it compares in quality to the old Stanley awls which have the metal cap on the top of the handle so you can tap it with a hammer if the need arises. I'm a woodworker so I look for a sturdy shaft, hardwood handle, good taper, steel ferrule, metal cap on top,....this one has all that, just like the old Stanleys did. I happy with this purchase, would have been 5 stars if made in the U.S.",4.0
"I need something a little thinner and without so much of a taper for working w/ paracord, but overall this is good quality and has helped.",4.0

"After extensive research, I recently picked up this new hobby of oil painting and using WMOs (Water Miscible Oils).  I've heard about the fumes and vapors while using mediums with regular oils.  I came across the WMOs and knew it was worth a try.  I purchased a set of the Artisans just like the one here on Amazon.  It's a great beginner set to start with and get your feet wet with oil painting.  I've used all the colors except for the green.  I've spent time mixing colors when I was a water color artist and so far, I've only used the yellows/reds/blues to mix my secondary colors.  I've also used the included white titanium color.

My only issue with the Artisans is the lemon yellow color paint.  Compared to the other colors, this yellow comes out of the tube rather hard.  On it's own, I end up using a drop or two of the Artisan Thinner to make it more pliable on the canvas.  When I mix other colors with the lemon yellow,  I do notice the resulting color becomes very smooth like butter.

Clean up is easy.  I use Dawn or Palmolive clear dishwashing detergent and warm water to wash my brushes (Robert Simmons Titanium) and my clear acrylic palette.

While my W&N Artisan paints are being used up, I've added other WMO manufacturers to my paint stash (to try out) which include Lukas Berlin, Cobra, and some Holbien Duo Aqua Water Miscible.  The Holbiens are expensive, but I've heard their paints are consistent out the tubes and they have a higher pigment level.

I highly recommend this Artisan set for beginners who want to start out in oil painting.  The included colors are more than enough to start with as long as you are willing to learn about mixing colors like I have.",4.0
"Very select colors for travels. Non-granulated, dries slower, very pigmented. Buy your own brush set. The brush that comes with it isn't suitable for a wash or painting long spaces. I recommend buying a larger set.",4.0

"I recently had bought the Winsor & Newton Cotman Brush Pen Set for my birthday last month and so far I had encounter some problems but overall I really liked this paint set.
PROS:
Color Selection are great for mixing! I tend to mix pastel, bright or warm colors for my drawings and there wasn't any color which I felt was either unnecesarry or bad.
Good for Traveling, The size of this set easily fits into the small compartment infront of my bag! With a water brush and tissue paper you can easily paint your sketch and clean the paint on the mixing well with the tissue paper.
The Design of the set makes it so that the mixing wells stays flat while the paint is tilted forward to face you which makes it easier to see the paint when your using the paint set.
Removable Pans the pans are removable so if you dislike some colors or want to refill the empty pan you can easily switch it out.
CONS:
The Brush Pen broke after I had only use it for a while. The stuff that was holding the brush in place broke off while I painting which ended up pushing the brush tip inside and I couldn't fix due to the brush pen's design.
The Pans easily falls out of the palette but this is easily fixable with some blue tack.

Overall, I really like the design and quality of the paint set but I do think that you should switch out the brush pen with a better quality brush pen or a travel brush, which is saddening to hear as the paint set is called the ""brush pen set"" I would recommend this set to students and beginners who want to paint while traveling.",4.0
Works amazingly for a beginner like me!,4.0
"Pigments not as saturated as I would have hoped, but not bad.",4.0
"Artisan are the thickest water-soluble oil paints I've owned so far. If you like to paint thickly or impasto, you will like these. If you prefer a softer or more 'buttery' or 'juicy' feel that doesn't require as much thinning-down, you won't.

The color intensity is very good...you won't be missing much in this regard versus top-end oils that cost 2x or 3x as much. Artisan has a slightly stronger and more artificial smell than others...a bit more than just the usual natural linseed oil. Like other water-miscible oils, you can thin with water if necessary - but only a little bit - too much water will result in a weak, matte paint film. Using oil or medium is better.

Most colors will be dry to the touch in several days (more or less depending on several factors) ...similar to regular oils. However my Artisan Titanium White is unusually slow-drying. I don't know if this is how it's supposed to be; my other Artisan colors dry at the expected rates. My Artisan Prussian Blue (not in this set) dries incredibly fast as it should...dry to the touch in about 1 day.",4.0

"these are nice, i bought them for traveling but i now use them all the time.  the set has no black which is annoying.  the smell is different than regular oils, not as pleasant, and the texture can get gloppy.  i looked these up on the internet; they are made by adding detergent.  i think you probably save money over regular oils by a lot because of how much easier the cleanup is.  and if you dilute them with water they make a kind of gouachy texture.  i like these paints because i can make a thin overcoat using mostly water to alter the shade, and these do dry a little quicker too.  your brushes will thank you if you buy this paint.  i don't know how my paintings will hold up over time with this paint, but let's face it that will probably be moot.  i wonder if you can make your own water-mixable oils by adding detergent to oil paints?",4.0

I like the paints.  they are easy to use.  The colors are limited.  The colors I need for landscapes are not there so I am mixing and mixing trying to get the right hue.  Not so good.  They have a nice texture.  They are also very portable.,4.0

"This is the 5th purchase of Windsor & Newton paints. The teenagers love this set.  Its very portable and easy to take with us to paint outdoors.

If you want to encourage watercolor painting with kids this is a perfect set to start with.

Colors are bright not muted and easy to mix.  The trays are perfect to mix paint when your on a location or just at home.

Im able to teach them simple techniqes just with this set.",4.0
Great for beginners like me.,4.0
"These watercolors are undeniably good, especially for those who don't want to spend the extra money on a ""pro"" set with less fillers, pure pigments, and toxic pigments.

Some colors are more opaque than others, which suits my style, which is why my swatches are so dark. The orange color, 3rd down in the first row, is particularly translucent and was difficult to get that ""punch"". Opposite, the yellow ochre, first on the 3rd row, seemed more opaque.

Should you spend more on a tiny set or buy something else marketed as student grade? I'd say this set is a perfect, truly pocket sized option for anyone who isn't terrible at watercolor, but is still a beginner.

The brush arrived splayed, but was fixed with the addition of water.

Overall, this is a nifty little set. Good pigment, good colors, and the brush that's included certainly isn't bad.

All opinions are my own and I did not receive the set for free for my review. I paid for 100% of this and as a result, my opinions are 100% honest.",4.0
"When I first received my Cotman set there were two of Sap Greens and it was missing the darker green color pan. Amazon sent me a replacement a week later and I have loved this set. Other reviewers have also mentioned the size of the palette but I just had no idea how tiny it was. Its actually pretty cute and fits in the palm of my hand. I posted a photo of it next to a standard stapler and a quarter for comparison.

I primarily use it for cardmaking and find the colors very easy to blend when making backgrounds. The colors mix very well together also.

The one thing I did not care for was the brush pen. The flow of water is too heavy even when I don't squeeze the pen at all. Its too hard to control and impossible to use for small detailed areas.",4.0

The paints are amazing but the water brush was horrible it leaked all over my paintings I would definitely recommend the Pentel water brush to use with these,4.0
"Pretty decent quality. I still prefer professional over Cotman, but the color payout is great for the price. My only qualm is with the Lemon Yellow Hue; it is far less pigmented and rich than the other colors (because its a hue), and I have used better Lemon Yellow Hues from other brands that are by no means as high esteemed as Windsor & Newton. Hence the 4 stars.

But the quantity of paint is quite good and I believe this will last me awhile, even though Ive been using it to paint 11x14 paintings, rather than solely as a travel kit.",4.0
"I like the quality of the case and of the paints.  The reason for a 4 star rating (I almost gave it 3, but the case is too good quality to rate lower) is because this set, and no other that I could fine, comes with even one Primary Color.  To me, even as a beginner seems either greedy or stupid.  I can't decide which.  It would be perfect if it had primary colors in it.  Even if they gave the option to pay a little more for the one with them in it,  I would have chosen to pay more and gotten the one with primary colors.",4.0
"As everyone has said, these are lovely colors and I love how compact it is. What I was not prepared for is that the color ""blocks"" and their pans are not travel friendly at first. I am guessing with time they will mesh together but I was disappointed to find this out after I got it.",4.0
"Love the color selection! I just wish there were also a black included. The brush included is very small and handy, perfect for small details. I haven't mixed any yet but the singular paints all lay down very nicely and flow well. Very pigmented and smooth as well. I saw a lot of concerns before purchasing this, that the paints themselves fell out of the pans, but once the paints are used more, they will basically adhere to the pans, so that didn't bother me. Overall, a very good set for travel and at home watercolor. Will definitely buy the bigger set when I run out of these!",4.0
"I've been looking for years for a travel watercolor kit.  I bring my own travel brush, rag and handmade journal (I make them out of Arches paper).  I sewed a small cotton shoulder bag to make everything easy to carry.

Pros:  has water bottle and small water containers, Winsor Newton (will replace with professional paints when these run out), good choice of colors, vibrant colors (surprised because it's Cotman), all the mixing areas/trays.

Cons: VERY small brush and for me it's unusable (area is narrow so my replacement travel brush does not fit), paints pop out (so added water to the pans then placed the paint back in the pans and that did the trick), depth doesn't make it easy to fit into pockets/purse, took me a while to figure out that I needed to remove/replace the water bottle when everything is closed.

Overall, I'm happy and would recommend.",4.0
"as described, my daughter loves it, good starter set, may re-purchase...",4.0
I love the paints! Very pigmented! But I don't like all the colors. It should have some paines grey and sepia instead of the white and maybe one of the other colors. White shouldnt even exist in watercolor. It does nothing.,4.0

The little brush, which I probably won't use, has a thin tip and is travel friendly. I'm new to water colors and I think this is a great kit for anyone who is starting out. It would also be a great stocking stuffer for a child. I would definitely buy this again.",4.0

"I really enjoy this little travel set.
I wanted something more compact for doodles on the go.
it is smaller than those phones everyone carries, so it really can fit in your pocket or bag.
Comes with a travel brush as well, I bring my own along for preference, but travel brush is really not a bad little brush.

I like how you can switch out the cartriges in this set to anything you want or replace them when it runs out.
only bad thing is if it falls, is knocked around,  when its open the pieces fall out easily ><
So if it falls it will take you a bit to pick it back up and put them all back in order. my first water color set like this- most of the ones that are not tubes don't come out of the container that easily so if it's knocked over or spills you just need to worry about water clean up.",4.0

"This is amazing for beginners because it provides all the colors you could possible need, a great lid that can be used as a mixing palette, a nice small brush that I think is good quality. It's so convenient and tinier than I couldve expected but don't let this fool you! The paints have lasted me a while and you can take the pans out and replace them individually with whatever you want. With that said, the paints keep falling out of their pan and the pans always fall out of the palette. Everytime I have to be really careful I don't tip it and I've dropped it a few times... It sucks having to pick them all up again individually but whatever, everything else is good!",4.0
"I have the W&N Pocket Plus (12 half pans)  and the Compact Set (14 half pans).  Both easily fit in one hand and the half pans can be filled with the provided- Cotman paints or pro quality paints. I prefer the Compact set because the Pocket Plus has an oddly designed case with a rubbery blue attachment that prevents the lids from laying flat when open. (I found that carefully scoring/cutting the attachment with a razor blade can remedy the problem. Or perhaps repeated use & flattening the open lid is a solution as well.). Also the Compact set has a larger area for mixing, as well as a thumbhole.",4.0
"One of my colors is missing.  I was setting up my pallette and bumped it and things went flying.  I found the missing pan for the viridian, but my burnt sienna paint is still hiding.  I suspect it will turn up when I spill something and the color liquifies on my carpet!  Tip:  use a glue dot to secure the pan in place and generously wet the paint on initial set-up so the block is not loose in the pan.  This is my first ""good"" watercolor paint set, so I am seriously bummed about the MIA color.",4.0

"Wasn't packaged very well, but maybe the delivery people just mishandled the package?  The little paints were torn out of there place so it might make the painting process a bit of a challenge (time will tell) but the paint itself was still in tact!  This is not canvas, but rather textured cardboard.  The corners were a bit crunched as well.  If the package wasn't so beat up when I got it I'm sure the kit would have been in better shape.  Also it appears to have very small numbers/spaces to paint so maybe not a good picture for a beginner or someone with difficulty seeing small print.",4.0

"I enjoy painting by number. I am still working on this, and wish I didn't have to mix the paints. It is a little tuff to determine which color goes where. Some of the indicators are hard to determine.",4.0
I have done a few paint by number sets in recent months and It is quite the hobby for me. I like getting the more difficult sets to keep me at peace and they help me relax while I focus on the detail. This set had lots of detail and I decided that I must invest in a liner brush for the details because the standard brushes that come with the kits don't really do the painting justice. The paints that came with this kit were of very good quality and for the most part the paint covered the lines and the numbers on the board. I enjoyed painting this scene but this would be a painting for an adult not a child and requires patience.,4.0
"Perfectly priced for the Secret Santa party we are going to.  Bright, colourful, creative and will fit either as man or a woman!",4.0
"I bought this set on spec in my local art supply store and it is quite decent for its price. In a nutshell, I would say that:

++ On the positive side, the quality of the paint is quite good for an affordable beginner set. Recognizing that I don't know that much about watercolour, I find the colours nice and vibrant. The choice of colours included are perfect for me: I use ultramarine and cerulean blues, burnt sienna, burnt umber, lemon and cadmium yellows all the time. I would probably trade the white or one of the two greens for a Payne's gray.

- - On the negative side, the box is not very good, mostly because all the pans are lose in their compartments and they wabble each time you dip the brush in. This is irritating. Although there quite a few mixing areas, the bottom one that slides is not easy to use while sketching on location (awkward to pull in and out). I haven't tried the brush included because it is too small even for my small Moleskine sketchbook.

If I was to do it again, having experienced it and read reviews now, I would probably buy the Prima Marketing Tropical set for a similar price, similar colours and I would have a nice metal box.

Hope this was helpful :-)",4.0
These paints definitely have more pigment than any other cheaper brands I bought which makes a huge difference in my paintings.  I just wish the paints weren't so expensive otherwise I'd give them 5 stars.  I don't paint enough to use them up before they dry out.,4.0
"I like this painting and it was fun to do, I buy these for my mother and she does them as busy work, some of the problems are that the paint pots are a little small and you run out of paint, although the instructions are good and easy to follow.",4.0
It was a great activity to do as a hobby. I tried very hard to enjoy myself painting this but I don't know if it's just painting isn't my thing or if it was just the product in general. I took me about four long nights to paint this. The paint mixing was hard for me to do and the colors in the water are so peculiar which is a reason why i gave it a four star instead of the five star. When i finished it was simply beautiful and I'm very pleased with the way it came out. As a Paris freak i found this as a great accomplishment. Great Activity and it's fairly easy to paint on. I would recommend this to any Paris fanatics out there,4.0
"Great set, nice colors, nice variety, great start for beginners and students alike.",4.0
The colors are great! Very vibrant. I just wish they were labled on the pans. I am new to paintimg and have a hard time remembering color names. Experienced artists probably won't have artist will probably not be bothered by this.,4.0
"Absolutely love how compact this set is. I have the large professional set that is super nice but the metal case and size makes it heavier to travel with. The colors in this cotman set are wonderful. My favorite has to be thalo blue. Great pigments. Quality Case. I recommend, and for the price it's a steal!

My only complaint is the paintbrush that comes with. Mine is a little defective with extra glue cased on the outside that I cannot peel off. Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. Really it should be 4.5",4.0
"Nice little kit, and it is little. Has more hues than I would have liked, it seems there's no consistent set of colors in the kits, you kind of get what they send. The dinky paint brush is useless unless you need a mini rigger (or an eyeliner) :)  4 stars, because it's still a great little set for the beginner or anyone into plein air. I'm a real novice at watercolor so this is fine for me to get my feet (& fingers) wet. Next time I'll be looking at specific color paint pans or tubes to refill this little kit, but that's how you learn. Nothing against Winsor & Newton, just a few things I wish I had understood before buying. BTW, I probably would have still bought it anyway.",4.0

However, the colors end up very nice and vibrant. I do edit my photos, however I don't have to touch the colors, only the brightness of the image. The only downside I personally saw was the collapsible brush. While compact, it barely holds any water and I had to buy another, larger brush.",4.0

Nice compact set.  Reasonable price.  Only issues are that paint is harder to lift from brand compared to Van Gogh and set contains black and white (which aren't many artists do not use for watercolor).,4.0
"My advice would be to get the smallest size only if you want a very tiny trial pack. I was quite disappointed with the size, but then I used the paints and realized that the paints are worth it, even though the size is a major minus point. Also, the paints may look darker than what they are supposed to be, but don't be fooled by that. I was about to return my set because I didn't think the colors were right, but they are. Thhey just look dark.",4.0

I'm just beginning at water color and my instructor suggested these.  Great colors for mixing.  It is a pretty small case but was fine for my 5 classes of water color and beyond.,4.0
Nice portable watercolor set. I kinda know how to watercolor although I don't think the idea of a brush made of these materials is ideal. I think it's still a bargain; and a lot of people swear these brushes are wonderful. I prefer a brush with the ability to hold water and color that is similar to a real brush. Not that theres anything inherently wrong with these types of brushes I just prefer a real paint brush specifically designed for watercolors. The results these brushes provide is decent but isn't a substitute for the real thing. Although if you don't feel like carrying a water bottle this may be the way to go.,4.0

"After using my friends Winsor and Newton watercolours, I immediantly set off to by my own. Overall, I was quite pleased with the product as I found the colours were mixable and pigmented. The size of the box is really nice for travelling as well. The brush was as I expected it to be - okay. It doesn't work as well as my pentel aquash but still applies paint to paper, which is what it was made to do. I personally enjoyed the colour selection (sorry for my bad swatches) but I do wish that they swapped out alizarin crimson hue for a brighter red shade. The worst thing about the product is just that about half the paints came out of their pans so better glue would be better. However, I am still pleased with the product!",4.0

I have limited space on my desk and lately I've found myself using this rather than my full-sized palette because it's just more convenient. My one complaint is the way the lid is attached. When I work, I keep the mixing wells closest to me and the colors furthest from me. However, with this palette, it's awkward to do that because the lid when open sits in such a way that the wells are flat and the colors slant downwards. It's hard to describe. Just look at the photos :) I still work my usual way, but it's odd to have the colors slanting away from me.

Other than that one small complaint, which I am getting used to, I really like this palette. I like the shape, the design, the simplicity, the size. I haven't yet tried the pocket brush, but I expect it will be decent quality because it's W&N. Some people will find this box too large for outdoor sketching. I find it's just on the edge of being too large. It measures approx. 5x3x1 inches. Cheers!",4.0

"I love the sketchers pocket box.  It's An amazing set, really compact. The case it's self is pretty little but feel durable. The paint brush that comes with the set is, I believe atleast a full synthetic brush. The paints are of course student grade cotman, but they're good paints. I prefer cotman paints when I go do plain air sketches. The one reason this did not get five stars is because it come with Chinese White. Now I'm not saying that it's a bad thing to put white in a watercooor set, I just never use it out in the field. So I just replaced it with a paynes grey. Overall, good set.",4.0
"What a great starter set for those who want to seriously get into watercolor. Its student grade quality, but you get a wide range of paint here to play with.

"These pan paints are great for travelling since they come in such a small and quaint little container. Nevertheless, it is a bit of a mess. I'm a beginner and I'm not very used to painting with aqueous media, so my pans do get a bit dirty, what with all the paints so close together. That said, this set is great, and the colors are very mixable.",4.0
"Great bargain - ""refurbished""",4.0
"Of all the different media that can be used to sketch and paint in the field, watercolor paints are the simplest to stick in a pocket or backpack and just go.  This little gem of a plein aire kit is the simplest, smallest, and most complete designed to date.  12 half pans of colors perfect for landscape painting, two fold out mixing palettes, a #2 good quality brush that breaks down and stores in the short handle, a plastic water bottle, and the kit cap holds it all together.  There's even smidgen of a sponge and a pivoting ring for hanging the kit on a backpack or belt.

April 7, 2017 edit:  Since writing this review I've discovered the ring is a thumb ring to assist with holding the kit while painting.  Still a nifty ring for snap-ringing to a belt loop or back pack, but the design intent is help hold it while painting.

Quite often decent quality art supplies are just as expensive on Amazon as on other sites, but this product is an exception to that rule.  It is lower priced here than at Blick or Jerry's, the two biggie 'cut rate' art supply stores/websites.  Even factoring in prime membership this one is a better deal financially.

My only complaint is that it isn't bigger with a higher capacity water bottle, larger palette areas, more colors, and more brushes.  But then it wouldn't be the ideal watercolor field kit.  This one is for quick sketching in the field, not for painting highly detailed landscapes, city scenes, or portraits.  The photo accompanying this review was the first sketch made using this kit in my sketch book with 6"" X 4"" pages.  (I'm not Rembrandt, so don't laugh too hard)",4.0

"The quality of the colors is wonderful and this has become my go to set for painting (on-the-go or anywhere, since I don't have an at-home set). I take it everywhere. The size of the box (which is made out of sturdy white plastic and snaps closed) is very portable while still being large enough to function well. The only con is that the pans don't stay in the box and a few times I have ended up with my watercolors scattered all over the floor. Of course this is not a design flaw and the box is made as such so you can replace the pans when they run out, so I can look past it. I would recommend this for a small travel set or as a gift.",4.0

"The tubes were smaller than expected, but at least I have a chance to see if I want to order more of individual colors. So far they worked well in a couple of cards I made.",4.0
"This is a nice set of paints. The box holds more than the usual 12. I did find the pans wanted to slide around so I used rubber cement to tack them down. Worked like a charm! I actually saved the cotman paints to refill my smaller pocket box and replaced with the artist grade Winsor and Newton paints which are a bit clearer in color. But even the cotman are nice to work with. I just find they don't mix quite as well for purples and greens. This set has those colors without mixing making it preferable to the pocket box if you prefer cleaner, clearer purples. I have attached my color mixing chart with the professional paints I used to refill my box. If you compare to the cotman sketcher pocket box mixing chart (also below) you can see the colors are brighter and clearer. But the cotmans are still a great set that I use when out and about. I kept the paints from this kit to refill the smaller pocket box.",4.0
"I actually got this because I wanted a very small travel box for watercolor pans. I figured I could always toss the paint and replace with my own, but figured I should at least give it a try. They actually aren't at all bad. Much more pigmented than the Sakura Koi. I did a color chart to test out mixing and they did OK, but not great on mixing nice purples and greens. Really only one purple is possible and it's a bit muddy in tone. If getting these for the paints, I would suggest the larger set with 16 colors if you want a purple. It has one in the set that you don't have to mix. But this is a fantastic small box. I've read some state the pans fall out, but if you use it a couple times and get the pans nice an wet so paint seeps down the sides they will stick down. The problem then is really getting them back out! I used a push pin to lever them out when I decided to rearrange the palette. I also did replace the white with a payne's grey which I found to be more useful for creating shadow tones. When the paints are used up I can simply replace with my own tubes or even try out some W&N professional paints perhaps. I can say that if you want a really nice set of paints that mix beautiful purples and greens, try Daniel Smith. I turned my tubes into pans by letting them dry out and they work wonderfully. Very clear color mixes!",4.0
"Let me start by saying; this watercolour set is adorable. It's small and easy to fit in your bag or pocket, and ever with it being a 'student' grade, the pigments are rather nice and I can see myself using these for quite awhile, even though I now have an artist grade set from another brand. I feel very attached to this set- it were a nice introduction to watercolours and I thank them dearly for showing me the ropes!",4.0
"This is quite a clever little set, I've bust it out a few times on my travels and impressed admiring locals. The design is very satisfying and feels reliable and sturdy, the palettes are sufficient and the travel brush is so cute. So cute. The one thing I did realise, which actually was the reason I wanted the field set instead of just a compact set, is the water bottle is pretty much unnecessary. I can't picture any instance when I would be outside wanting to sketch but not have a bottle of drinking water with me, if I were to find myself in that unfortunate situation I would hardly be focussing on painting. So it's not really necessary for water, but I thought I could put some black ink in there, of perhaps even some resist. It's really a very nice little set for people like me who fantasise about plein air painting and sketching far more than they actually do it.",4.0

"I obtained these 'Cotman Water Colors', from Winsor & Newton, for my first attempt at water coloring and although I'm unable to provide any comparisons I am pleased with the assortment of colors, and the price. I've found the colors blended easily and cover nicely, as well; Two of my grandchildren, ages 4 and 7, were very happy to join me and they were amazed with the results obtained by mixing the colors and diluting with water. We really did have an excellent beginning.",4.0
"I love this palette for the size and weight. This truly is something that will fit in a pocket. It's so easy to hold in one hand - especially for those who may be older, who have any trouble with things being a little heavy or awkward to hold. Even though I've bought two other empty palette boxes (the nice metal ones which have more mixing room), this is the one I want to take with me all the time, because it's so convenient to hold. I do wish it was just one inch longer to hold maybe 4 more colors and one more mixing area.
Now, that said, I really only love the box. I took the color cakes out and filled the empty pans with tubes of Daniel Smith. I'm sure they're good paint cakes for the price, but once you've used them and are ready to upgrade to creamier paint, you can re-fill with tube paint.",4.0
"I really love the quality of the box itself. It's conveniently sized and doesn't feel cheap or fragile. The paints themselves are student grade, but they're easy to extract from their trays while new, so you can swap in artist grade paint. If you're fine with them, just add a little water and they'll dissolve to fix into the tray quite nicely. Comes with a small round tip brush with a cap that can be placed on the reverse to give it a somewhat more reasonable grip, though still quite petite. Capped it's about 3"" (7.5cm) long, with the cap on the reverse about 3.75"" (~9.5cm) not including the brush, which extends 7/16"" (~1cm) beyond. When capped, the brush doesn't nearly fill the space reserved for it, it could have been ~1.75"" (4.5cm) longer and fit quite nicely, and would be more comfortable to hold as a 5"" brush handle.

I ditched the lemon yellow, red pale hue, emerald green, and yellow ochre for separately purchased pale cadmium yellow, cadmium red medium hue, hooker green, and ivory black instead. Also swapped around the arrangement of the trays to suit my preference. As mentioned in a number of other reviews, the trays are not secured. I dabbed a dot of quake putty into each slot to keep them in place. It's got a longer-lasting and tougher grip compared to double sided tape.

-1 star for the dinky brush and the kit not including a black in the first place, but definitely going to invest in another to use for a secondary pallet.",4.0
"It's a nice palette of colors to work with and they mix well with each other. They are heavily pigmented and transparent. Although they are not professional grade,  they seem to be very close. I am very pleased with blending and lifting of these colors. I don't know why anyone wouldn't be pleased with these watercolors. The flow characteristics works best with High quality paper. I recommend Arches...",4.0
"Cotman is not Artist quality but it was a good place to start. When you first get the kit you might drop it - the pans fit loose because they are replaceable so they go flying. That said, once you start using it the pans stick into place from paint so there's not really a worry. The mixing spaces are decent enough though have a tendency to leak from one area to another - I patched mine with Frisket. Works okay. The colours are a little grainy - especially the cerulean but it is student grade so just suck it up and replace the pan with artist grade when you're done. If you like pans you are going to have to hunt for half pan replacements - not everyone has them and Amazon doesn't carry them.

This is a very easy to carry box, the brush is decent for a small travel kit but I carry water brush pens when I go sketching - it keeps it simple.

The colour palette is very good except for the absence of Payne's Grey and the inclusion of Chinese White. I don't know about anyone else but if I need white I use gouache not watercolour. Pop out the white - buy a Payne's Grey and you have a great kit.

One last detail - this is plastic so give the plastic a bit of a scrub with some steel wool the colours will hold together better when you are mixing.",4.0
Awesome !,4.0
"The paints are nice. However, the container is a bit clumsy to open, hence not using it very open. Instead I poured my paints in half pans in a different bin. If I were to do again, I would buy paints separately.",4.0
Very  good product although the colours could be better.  Also an extendable brush  which could go in the paint box would be a good idea.,4.0
"Excellent paints for a reasonable price. Easy to carry around and transport. However, the container doesn't usually lay flat and so is a little awkward to get paint in and out of.",4.0

"What I received matched the written description, but it did not match the picture shown. My watercolor case had less compartments than the one shown. Mine was also only a clamshell case.  Amazon, you really should show accurate pictures of the items you're selling. The watercolors included were great quality and the case is sturdy, it's just not what I was expecting based on the picture.",4.0
"I have never had a watercolor palette that was this small. I did look at the picture reviews, but still expected it to be bigger. I also had to glue the trays that hold the colors down because they would fall out of I didn't. I have these 4 stars because the quality is AMAZING! I just wish that there was a purple!",4.0
"This is a handy set of water color paints for travel, good quality. BUT, I have ordered these for myself in the past, this one I ordered as a small gift for a fellow artist. You would, or least I did, think that a gift order would mean it would be gift wrapped. It is not gift wrapped, it had a small piece of paper with the note that this was a gift from me. Tacky, I thought. Just a heads up a ""gift"" does not mean it is gift wrapped. Not sure what ""gift"" means to Amazon.",4.0
"Decent student grade watercolor. The colors are very vibrant and transparent. Better Than most student grade watercolor I have seen. But the color mixing is a little muddy with several colors. The pans are too hard. It takes a bit scrubbing. Otherwise, it's a nice set. I use it almost every day. It's my go to practice watercolor set.",4.0
"Very nice, arrive on time.
The case is sturdy and practical.
The colors are beautiful, I already used them and are very translucent.
Good for the price!",4.0
Like the colors. Each pad is individually wrapped. It took a little time to unwrap each one. Other then that it is what I wanted.,4.0
This is perfect for painters on the go. Winsor and Newton always has great quality paints and the colors are especially striking. I do think that the price is a steep for the size of the product.,4.0
"It's the perfect size for travel or just for use in the studio. The 24 half pan colors offers a good variety for anyone wanting to explore watercolor as a medium, and the white storage container opens features two palettes for easy blending. Unwrapping each color and popping it into place takes a little time as the fit is rather tight, but overall it's a decent design. I personally like the fact that it is so compact and portable. The colors have good pigmentation and are easy to build on. Good value!",4.0
"I actually got this for everything but the paint!  I needed some extra paint pans that would fit a different Winsor Newton travel palette, so I emptied the cotman paint pans, and filled them with artist quality tube paint from Daniel Smith.  I am planning to use this case for a travel gouache palette - I'll just use the empty wells without any pans to fill with M Graham and Schmincke gouache (they seem to dry/re-wet better than other brands).  The little travel brush that comes with this is great!",4.0
"The set is good.  The quality of paints is good. For the sample colors they chose, it is good, but I would ve liked a few others.  Other than that a great travel kit.",4.0
this is a very good set of student watercolors. I would recommend this set to anyone wanting to try out watercolor pans. the only reason i gave this 4 instead of 5 stars was because the case is a little awkward and the top keeps coming off of my set. The paints themselves are great for a travel set and I will probably buy a new case and keep using these cotman pans in the future.,4.0
Granddaughter used them immediately,4.0
"Great box, colors are ok, just wish that they were based on the CYM colors cake rather than RYB. Or if they sold the box separate so the palette could easily be customized would be even better!
The Box is great, though. My favorite. It literally fits in my pocket with great ease.",4.0
"This is tiny and very portable, a lovely little traveling brush comes with it.  The colors are fine.  My problems are that the color labels didn't always match the name on the side of the paint pot, so I'm not sure exactly what color some of them are.  Also, the little pots jump out of the box readily, so you have to handle the set very carefully.",4.0
"Very happy with the palette. Perfect for sketching in the field. I will likely refill the pans with professional grade paints as they empty.  I only gave the product four stars because W&N provided two warm reds, cadmium red and cadmium red pale which are almost identical.  Would have preferred alizarin crimson instead of one of those reds.",4.0
"I have had this little watercolor set for a couple years, and I've been very happy with it.  The eight colors included are surprisingly versatile and work well for creating ambience in street paintings or landscapes.

The included brush is two pieces--the lid comes off the bristle end and fits onto the other side to lengthen the handle.  When not in use, the brush slides into a small groove in the lid of the case.  (My brush eventually fell out of the groove and was lost forever, but it was no big loss.  I recommend using a waterbrush instead, especially for travel.)

Overall, an excellent little travel set.  I'd buy it again if I lost it.",4.0
This is perfect for throwing in your bag and taking out whenever you feel like painting. Small enough to carry around daily,4.0
"Really good traveling set!
Cotman series are not professional pigments, they are more for students.
But pigments are still good enough.",4.0
Decent paints. I just wish they'd include a black instead of the white.,4.0
only problem i had was that the pans of color would stick to the top of the case and then get glued there. No complaint about the paint or the portability and I love the tiny brush to be honest. only complaint is the paint pans not being heavy enough to stay in their spot. they get tossed around in the case somehow. :/,4.0
"High quality, compact, cute Pokemon.",4.0
Very good product.,4.0
"It's a great set! The pigments are strong and vibrant, with gorgeous quality. The only down side is that the kit, which has ""essential"" kind of colors, doesn't include black. But it has two shades of yellow and two shades of brown. But no black. Or purple. Seems like they didn't *quite* think it through. All the same, the quality is perfectly lovely.",4.0
"My sister is an artist and as I was going to take an online water color class I asked her what I should buy to get started.  She reviewed the course suggestions and was surprised that the teacher was suggesting very expensive water colors.  Since I don't even know if I'll take to this I was reluctant to buy those.  So, she suggested this set for me.  She has one and has been using it for YEARS.  She has taken it with her on many of our trips and even to Provence for a class.  She loves it and so far, I do too!  It's a great starter kit and lasts a long time!!",4.0
"Wasn't quite what I expected, but it works as a travel set...and it is ""cute"".",4.0
"Nice, but I wish I had gotten whole rather than half pans.  Colors are vibrant.  Just too small and go too quickly.",4.0
"These are Chinese made watercolor tubes which are noticeably inferior than older French made products. I found the contents are thinner and more watery than the older ones I bought sometime earlier (French made). All watercolor tubes came ""crushed"" in the plastic box. Despite the negatives I mentioned, it may be still among the best student watercolors in the market.",4.0
"Absolutely love these paints, this set is just the perfect combination of colors and I'm a W&N fan for sure. 1 star off for the incredibly annoying container design.",4.0
Small enough to carry.,4.0
"I have wanted to dabble in watercolors ever since I took an acrylic painting course and this set was recommended by many of my artist friends and bloggers across the web.

Portability - To be honest, it was a lot smaller than I expected however, it's small, compact size turned into out to be one of it's best features! I can put it in my everyday bag without having it weigh me down since it is so light and small. A small downside is that the solid cakes rattle in your bag if you are walking around.

Quality - The quality of the solid cakes are really superb for the price you buy the set for and has lasted me a lot longer than I thought it would. I really can tell the difference between this set and another general set I bought at Michaels for $5 dollars.

Colors - The color palette they selected is a perfect for beginners but I would have liked to see a black cake.",4.0
"This is a very tiny travel set, and I mean very tiny. But that's good for the purpose that I purchased it. The colors are vibrant and the case is mostly secure. It's a step up from the kids watercolor paint sets at the craft store, and this is a much better price than I could find locally.",4.0
Love it the only thing is that the watercolor pallets won't stay in all the time so I have to put them back in all the time other than that the shipping is fast and the water colors are very good,4.0
"I really love this palette. I wish the blues were a bit more distinctive, they seem too similar and waste space. I would have preferred one of them be a purple-y blue.

I love the portability and colors. This is a great set as a beginner.",4.0
"Wanted to try out Winsor's pan colors before I invested further and the price and palette caught my eye.

Did a simple landscape last night and was definitely very pleased with the pigments and color selection. Easy to set up and use. The red that was included seemed almost too pink for my taste (more on the cool than warm side) but after layering it was very pretty.",4.0

"I bought the Winsor & Newton Cotman Water Color Sketchers' Pocket Box as a birthday present for myself because I have been practicing watercolor painting for about 2 months now. I bought it with much appreciation. It is a small container with a lot of features, the colors are very strong and smooth and the brush is of fine quality, I am looking forward to carrying the box with me on my trips around the historic villages and countryside.
I could say that the watercolor pigments are really great. I have made my second watercolor painting and I have never seen a better set of pigments and they are the cheapest and in the smallest, most compact and elegant case I could find. These watercolor paints are great to pair with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Art-Tools-brushes/dp/B00HOYF2JY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Art Tools brushes </a>. These two are very ideal for finishing touches. Both are good if you are taking your art on the road or just storing in a convenient location. Winsor & Newton Cotman is really the perfect portable watercolor set.
If you are looking for a studio set of watercolors, or to do large scale paintings, Winsor & Newton Cotman is not the set for you. However, that should be evident in the product description. After much research, I have not found a better travel watercolor set for the price and highly recommend this for new watercolorists, anyone wanting to paint on the go or a great present for an artist.",4.0

It's true, it does close, but not completely therefore leaving a gap...I'm sure I will learn to live with it.  I just wish the quality of a product was just as important as the manufacturers profits, seems no one takes pride in this any more.

Time will tell how well it stands up to frequent use...with all the moving parts & the quality of the plastic.",4.0

Also comes with 12 color tiles ready to use.. I'm a beginner,but it's easy to see a lot of work and planning went into this product for the artist that likes do painting on field trips with minimal fuss. You can purchase color tiles of your own choosing to substitute any of the tiles. Also, I searched a few art suppliers before I made my purchase, and found the best price on Amazon.",4.0
"This is a cute little compact watercolor set to have on hand. It doesn't have black, but it forces you to be creative in mixing up various shades of black using other colors. The colors you do have are very rich. It's good for all ages, and It's very portable.",4.0
"Really nice set, it would be a nice gift for an artist.",4.0
"I like the color selection.  However, be prepared tp spend a lot of time putting together.  Each color is indivually wrapped and most colors will not just fall out to do this.  The plastic pans are clipped together in groups of four.  So you have to pry out the four pan clip, then pry out each indivual pan, unwrap and put back in.  I do like that each plastic pan is marked with the name of the color and it's number.  It took about two hours to get it ready, so don't plan on using right out of the box.",4.0
"I would have given 5 rating if the seller would not have charged 7$ for shipping. Apart from that, I love them. Very compact box and great colours. Perfect for a travelling artist.",4.0
"I like the size of this set, I can drop this in my purse to carry it with me. FYI- there is no black paint, which is kind of a pain. Also a pain- the lid won't stay propped open; it closes on its own all the time.",4.0

"Very vivid color. I never used this kind of watercolor before. It is as good as the paint. The kit is so cute. Just the cubes are smaller than I expected, because there is box in the plastic bags.",4.0
This has nice quality paints and is solid plastic construction. Tiny and easy to travel with. I also think the brush is quite nice for an inexpensive travel brush. My only issue was that there really isn't enough mixing space to be practical. It is small enough to put in my plastic box of sketching stuff with another small mixing palette. I wish I had gone for the step up which has the extra fold out mixing area. This little guy is a lovely little kit though so if you don't need a lot of mixing area or can come up with a way to carry extra then I would get it.,4.0

"This is my first travel watercolor kit. I like the size, variety of half pans, water trays and small brush. It is hard to open but that is better than one that falls open since I'm carrying it around with me quite a bit. I did find another Winsor & Newton travel set that was much easier to open. I think I would have picked the other set if I had known.",4.0

"Winsor Newton has many good quality products and the colors used are a good base. Obviously for regular painting this set can be hard to get used to as it is very small and the color choices are limited. However, as a design student there have been times I needed my water color set but it takes up a lot of space in my tool box but this does not so it was a must.

Note that the watercolors are individually wrapped and you can replace/change them by ordering new colors so you don't have to buy a new set all the time.",4.0

I haven't used mine yet but it is definitely very compact.  It was less expensive at Amazon.  I think I will enjoy the size for when I want to be outdoors since there is always lots to carry to be comfortable. It actually has all you need to get some very good studies done.  And it may even prove to be all I would need even for finished work.  Hope to find out soon.,4.0
"This item shipped from the UK to the US, and it took less than three weeks from order (3/2/2013) to delivery (3/21/2013). Very satisfied with shipping time. My only complaint about the product is that Cobalt Blue was missing and there was another Intense Blue (Phthalo Blue) instead, making for two pans of Phthalo Blue in the set. You'd think for $52 plus $7.49 shipping for a total of $59.49, you'd get your Cobalt Blue, thus resulting in a four star rating instead of a five star rating. Other than that, fairly satisfied.
One other thing. Why is this classified as a toy? I know these Winsor & Newton Cotman Watercolours are considered student grade, but I wouldn't classify them as a toy. I would not dream of buying my child a $60 set of watercolours just to play around with.

My only complaint is: the brush that comes with the set is not so great.

It could be made even better by providing separate trays for sorting the beads by shape and/or color, and a spindle for sequencing them upright instead of stringing them, as some other sets have.",4.0
"This item is wonderful - love the colors, the cards, the shapes...and my 3 yr old daughter loves it, too.  My only concern is the size of the beads.  3 yr olds sometimes still put things in their mouths perhaps without thinking....and these are a somewhat scary choking hazard size.....because they are quite big but still a very easy size to swallow...and with their bright colors, they kinda look like candy.

"These wooden beads are great for toddlers to help build their development! The beads are very durable and the colors are great! However, they should always be USED UNDER CLOSE ADULT SUPERVISION because the beads are on the smaller side and toddlers/babies will be able to fit these in their mouths.

"They worked for what I needed them for, for belts made of used bike tubes. I had a long, frustrating time trying to install them with a hammer on a wood table until I read on the internet to use a mallet on a concrete floor, and they suddenly worked like a charm.

I have to say I was a little disappointed with the extras as so many were very similar, yet there are colors that exist that were not included (wonder if the 100+ covers it).

Instead that individual crayon seemed to have gotten in the sharpener backwards, so the tip was at the bottom, nevertheless the superior end was chopped off.

Great sturdy knife. I love the choice of blades. It's easy to use and to replace the blades. If I was to make one criticism it's that the case in which they are kept isn't great. I'd have liked something with hinges that snaps shut and has compartments that hold everything more securely.  I suppose you can't expect a top notch case for the affordable price. But the blades and blade holders/handles are a good quality and sturdy!  I'd recommend these to anyone wanting good quality x-Acto knives.,4.0

"PROS:
*Fun box of tools
*Nice wooden box to hold everything
CONS (reasons I don't think it deserves five stars):
*The plastic inserts that hold the tools are not fastened into the box, so I had to glue it in (especially the top section) to make sure it's not flopping around in there when I close it
*Mine is missing the #16 blade (all the blades came in a little envelope -- I triple checked to make sure it didn't fall out in the package somehow & I didn't drop it). It's always sad to get a new toy and find it's missing something it's supposed to have...

Update:  I contacted Amazon, and (as always) they cheerfully offered a solution.  :)

UPDATE:  Box clasp broke off (like the metal is so thin, the thing snapped after very little use), and the magnet to hold the blades in place has trouble keeping bigger blades from falling off and floating around in the box.",4.0
"A classic and very handy set of tools.  X-Acto is notorious for horribly cheap cases for their tools, and while this is pretty shoddy, the design makes it harder to screw up. It's a simple hardshell zippered case which is great. They managed to get the zipper sewn on so sloppily that it's a bit of a struggle to get it zipped closed, but it works.  A good set with a good design for the case that they had to try harder to mess up.",4.0

"This is a good set, with nice quality cutting edges, but was a little disappointed with the box (MDF with a veneer rather than what appears to be a solid wood box in the pictures as of 4/29).

The other thing that really surprised me was the poor finish to the non-cutting portion of the blade.  Many of mine have chips or worn indentations (possibly from finishing the actual blades?) and what appears to be a bad finish on the 'backs' of the blades.  Putting your finger gently on this to help guide a cut really makes it seem like you're knicking your finger on solid sandpaper.  I improved it somewhat by grinding the backs a little with a file, but definitely surprised about the lack of quality finish from a name like X-Acto.

Still, it does the job of cutting well and the box does hold everything together, although I think the fragile plastic inserts will be useless before too long.  In the top of the box the spare blades are held in place by a magnetic strip, and I anticipate pulling this from the insert and gluing it directly to the inside to of the box.

(PS - don't forget to give the blades a good clean before using them.  There was a substantial oil/sheen on mine that would have marked e.g. a paper project)",4.0

"OK, little pricey for what it is.",4.0

"1st, they come wrapped inside the box with tight cellophane that is a bit of a task to remove.  But that's good as it keeps all the blades and handles in place during shipping.

The background the tools and blades fit into are made of thin plastic.  The tool handles are somewhat difficult to remove from this backing, especially the larger handle.  The blade box backing is of the same material.  But a long strip of magnetic material is embedded in the top background.  The blades are easy to remove from the background and just sit in place.  The magnetic material keeps them affixed to the top of the case.  Now if you were to drop this case, you would still likely have the blades scattered about inside.  But this magnetic material keeps the average bump or thump from dislodging them.

The pressed wood case itself is actually quite nice.  And amazingly its got mitered corners.  I can't quite tell if they are real miters or just very carefully made to look like they are.  But the box is a welcome part of this kit.  And if you prefer to have your blades and handles sitting in a pencil cup or something rather than put away in a case, you could always remove the plastic backgrounds and use this little box for other things.  This box has a metal clip that holds it closed.  That's far better than the plastic ones I've got with other kits that break off after a few openings and closings.  It would no doubt shatter or break the wood if dropped from a height.  But it serves as a nice box for keeping the blades and handles in one place and out of the surrounding air and moisture.  Also as you break or dull the blades, you can buy replacements which can take their place in the box just as the originals did.  Another thing great about this box is for loaning to other family members or friends.  If they lose or don't return part of the kit, the box inserts will show you right away an empty spot where a blade or handle is missing.

The blades are of moderate quality and thickness.  I have bought some cheap exacto kits here on Amazon that were useless due to the thinness of the blades.  These will do fine when used with the 3D plastics I intend them for.  They are primarily to be used as part clean up knives to make my 3D prints look better.  They should not be used to cut thick material, or to whittle or chop thick hard wood or metal.  They should be used for fine detailing of parts or objects, not heavy duty cutting.  You get one blade in each of the 3 handles as well as 10 in the top holder.  They are all different sizes and shapes to fit different uses.  Some of the blades are made to fit into the two larger diameter handles and some into the smaller diameter handle.  They are not interchangeable between the different handle sizes.

The 3/4"" diameter handle has a hard maroon plastic grip for more heavy duty kind of work.  But with only 3.5"" long grip surface, it's also the shortest of the handles.  It's a little difficult to get a good grip on it.  It is the only handle of the three with any grip surface on the handle itself.  The 2-part barrel and sleeve are metal.  But the screw threads and slot on this handle leave a bit to be desired and could wear out or damage easily.  If either part is damaged, you would have to throw the entire handle away and buy another.  But it's still a cut above some other brands I've got that actually used plastic parts here.  This one is an all metal blade slot collar and tightening collar.  This collar mechanism is a little different than the other two handles in that it just screws the split collar against the blade until tight.  The blades are a bit more difficult to insert into this mechanism as it is isn't beveled.

Both the middle and smaller diameter handles have a 3 piece design.  The handles of both are smooth metal so you won't be able to get much grip on them.  Unless they get wet with oil or grease, for fine detailed work they should be fine.  The blade tightening in the smaller two handles are all metal round collars that are beveled for easy blade insertion and removal.  The outer screw on collar actually presses on the beveled blade collar to achieve the squeeze on the blade.  If you either break the blade or the collar or the screw on collar or the handle, they could be replaced with the small parts without having to throw the whole handle away.  This is a better way of doing the collars and means you can just go online or to your local hardware store and buy a few extra parts.  Be carful with using either of these handles though.  Both the smaller handles have just under 4"" of handle holding area.  There is only a small less than 1"" area with texture between the blade itself and the handle.  If you are applying force, your hand could slip on the smooth metal and slide up to the blade, cutting yourself.

These blades are quite sharp and will cut you quite easily and deeply.  Don't have them out where a kid or pet could find them.  These are initially sharp enough to remove flesh and skin.  Some people buy these and put them in medical kits.  They would be great for opening snake bites or cleaning up small wounds by slicing away dead skin.  Just use the utmost caution as these are actually sharp little knife blades although they are not quite scalpel sharp.  These are not tools you would want your kid or an irresponsible teen to have access to.  You should put them away in their box when done or (as I do) put them blade down in a heavy pencil cup on a work bench.

I removed one star from the 5 in this review because these aren't great quality like a precision knife set or scalpel.  The metal used isn't really the best.  But I think for the average hobbiest, they will do fine.  I use them mostly with hard plastic 3D printed parts and figurines to clean up nubs and extrusions that weren't intended or will be difficult to sand down.  They should also work for cleanup of soft woods as well.  I found this kit well worth the cost and would buy it again.  I recommend this for anyone who needs to clean up plastic or soft wood parts or art work.",4.0
"Good little kit with every blade you could need for any type of project. Was very disappointed with the thin, cracking plastic that it is all snapped into.

"Pricey, point would be about 9-10 bucks delivered and I'd be stoked.  Exacto depends on its name, and the wood case, and the handle.

I do wish the blades had covers. Or at least, that there were three covers that collated with the three handles, for when the knife is out of the case but not actively in use. There is an accident waiting to happen.",4.0
The knife set is everything I expected it to be. It's a very well made product including the storage box. The reason why I gave four stars is because the blades on the top are attached to a magnet strip but it keeps falling off (wasn't glued properly) I glued it into place so it works out.,4.0

"I owned a set of these as a kid model builder in the mid-1970s. They were useful tools then but I'd lost most of them over the years. After taking up a craft project at home I decided to buy the same set again. The knives are all good quality and seem the same as my originals except for the larger handle has a plastic grip. I have no complaints about any of those.

What I dislike is that the new kit has rigid plastic retainers for the knife-handles and blades. The ones that are for handles will only hold a knife if it has either no blade or a specific blade. So if you have a ""go handle and blade set up you prefer, you may need to disassemble it before putting it back in the case and closing the lid. My original kit had wood retaining brackets that would cradle each handle and you could leave any blade installed - similar to a way a gun-rack on your wall would hold a rifle at two points.

The pastic retainer for the blades has a glued in magnetic strip, but I've never gotten it to stay put. I've reglued it twice. And having it fall out with all the blades attached seems more of a safety hazard than a benefit.",4.0

Nice set of Xacto that can do my hobbie work.,4.0
This is exactly what I was looking for and the price was right.  I took off one star because the blade pre-installed in the medium handle was in terrible condition and because the combination of the strength of the magnet holding the blades into the lid and the flimsiness of the plastic insert holding the magnet causes the whole blades/magnet/plastic insert assembly to fall out of the lid every time the kit is opened.  The wooden box is not great quality but is a nice touch given the price.,4.0

"Good product in a nice pine box. All the blades are razor sharp and useful for many applications. I use my kit for my 3D prints to add some finishing touches. There was a little hiccup with mine however, the magnetic strip that holds all the extra blades kept falling out of the box when I opened it. It was due to the double sided adhesive tape not being able to support the weight of the magnetic strip. I applied a bit of superglue to the strip and it stuck fine afterwards. I urge you to be careful when opening this box because in my case I almost cut myself when flipping the box open and having those razor sharp knives falling onto my hands.

The quality seems to have gone down from what I remember of Xacto products, and my main issue is the blades keep coming out of the handle assembly.

"I like the real thing! I've tried a bunch of other generic brands and the blades and handles are not as good (and in some cases a bit dangerous to use). X-acto tools have always been solid for me.

So why the 4-stars? In the product picture shown the holder for the tools is made of plastic. The one I received has foam instead (see attached photo). The cutouts in the foam for the tools is really deep, so you have to go digging into the foam to fetch them. And it's FOAM holding CUTTING TOOLS, which means over time this foam will get all chewed up. I would much rather have the product shown in the picture versus the one I received. Maybe others received the one as pictured...but I wish I had the plastic insert instead of the foam.",4.0

He is 9 and loves playing with sticks, has begged for a pocket knife forever, and I believe putting focus on something like woodcarving would satiate his hunger for trying to annoy people on a constant basis. When it arrived, my wife and I played with it a bit, trying to figure out some of the stranger attachments. Obviously I'm going to have to youtube it, because.. Well, some of them are definitely not self-explanitory, and look like they just shaped a bunch of useless scrap and threw it in to make it seem relevant.

We tried widdling away at some random large stick segment my son had waiting for it. I don't think anyone needs me to say that Xacto knives are sharp. They're sharp as hell. So with that, it did its job. We cut various parts of the stick to try out the weird attachments, and did everything we were meant to do with it. I even debarked a large branch to make a walking stick for my son.

This set is awesome. But I gave it 4 stars. You know that, because you're taking the time to read reviews for a not-so-complicated item. I only point this out, because I feel I owe everyone an explanation. I mean, that's messed up right? ""You say you love it, but your sullied emotional range is limited to divvying out only 4/5th of stars when given the opportunity?""

Now, this might just be my being particularly particular. Maybe other people will share in my particularity. Who knows? Anyway. The little tray you see in the picture that all the heads and the tool itself sit in? Yea, it's very cheap plastic, like the kind that you throw away when items from Walmart are opened. After a couple uses, it barely even fits in the box anymore. The corners are scrunched and won't fit snug, it just slips out. So eventually, I'm gonna be just throwing a bunch of blades and an imitation screwdriver into it. The box itself is nice though, just not nice enough to give back a 5th star.

Apparent star-nazi out.",4.0
Nice little set. zipper sticks every once in a while but it's not terrible. X-acto products are always pretty reliable.,4.0
"For a wood whittling hobbyist this is the tool kit for you. Yes the blades aren't secured safely within the kit and the the blades are very fragile, but as a hobbyist or beginner the Xacto X5175 Deluxe Woodcarving Set is for you. I'd advice a more sturdy wood whittling kit for those more extreme and advance in wood whittling.",4.0
"The knife attachments don't stay magnetized to their holding position. He magnet is too far back into its groove to make contact with the knife blades. So, I have to store the box upside down or else they will all fall out.  Other than that it's good.",4.0
"This was exactly what I was looking for.  I created a charging station for all of our electronics and was needing a way to cut clean circles in the shoe box.  The Xacto Knife set did the job!  The knife did come loose a couple times and had to be tightened during cutting but for basic jobs, this will do the job.",4.0
"Xacto knives have been around forever, and that's because it's an excellent product and works well. My review is of this set, which is nicely packaged and relatively complete, with a nice assortment of blades, EXCEPT that there is only ONE of each blade. I would have expected at  multiple blade in a set like this. At least 2 or 3 of each.",4.0
Great item and reasonable price,4.0
I love the options and am looking forward to using them all for projects!,4.0
"The tools inside look good.

The case is absolutely terrible, it is just cheap, thin plastic on the inside, just like the inside of a cookie container!",4.0
"For the most part, these knives work very well. I can slice things like butter. I have used them on plastic figures and it slides through no problem.

The hardest thing to cut actually turns out to be regular paper! It will often not cut right the first time and leave ragged edges.",4.0
Perfect for the modeler,4.0
Very nice set and the knife is easier to hold while using with the type of material that was used to make it!,4.0
"So overall, I'm rather happy with this set.  The three size handles are a nice variety, plus the variety of the blades is nice to have.

The only thing that makes this a 4-star product and not a 5-star product, is that the case seems overly bulky for what it's holding.  There seems to be a lot of dead air behind the left hand section, where the handles are housed.  The same goes for the right hand portion, but slightly less so. With a quick redesign, this case could be made either a great deal thinner, or to house more items.  The only plus for this case is that is has the netting portion in the upper right for a small box of spare blades, but that's about it.",4.0
Quality knife set. My son uses it for learning different techniques in taxidermy. Has quality interchangeable blades for different situations. Would definitely recommend.,4.0
I just wish that the divider wasn't made of such thin plastic.  I guarantee I will break it before too long.  Other wise I LOVE it!,4.0
"Works fine, as intended. 3 handles with several blades (More then I need). All blades are thin sharp blades (as the cuts on my fingers will attest to). Blades are kept together by a magnetic metal strip. There is a wooden box to keep everything in.

The only disappointment was the vacuum molded cheep plastic to hold the blades in place in the box lid. The plastic is so lightweight that it will not hold the blades or the magnetic strip in place. The magnetic strip will hold the blades together when you open the box, but they will never be still sitting in the box lid.",4.0
Good supplies,4.0
"Though I didn't change blades yet (actually I couldn't figure how to).. But the one's placed by default work wonder and are quite versatile.. I humbly consider myself a self-made creative and artistic person ;-).. I was making this beautiful lovely hand crafted birthday card for my honey... It was beyond my expectation.. I used the wooden base instead of the conventional polymer base people use ( I chose not to spend more). It cut very delicate designs intricately. Only if there was an informative instruction page as to how to change blades... Sometimes applying more pressure bends the delicate tip but that was probably because I was using the wrong blade. Grip is too good. I was lured by wooden boxes but this box is great too. Very light weight, safe and handy. My honey loved the card. Thank you guys. I owe it to you.",4.0
"This is a great kit!
I use them to cut leather, and other cloth pieces.
I wish the blades were more readily available, but as a starter blade and handle kit, its what I want.",4.0
Never got the chance to use them for what i meant to use them for but they're a great set.  Box is a little cheap but the set is just what you paid for.,4.0
Is as you would expect from X-Acto. Blades are sharp and handles work as I would assume them to. Case is nice. I would recommend,4.0
Great,4.0
Great Xacto kit except the magnetic strip in the top of the box always fell off after it was closed for a little while due to a poor quality two sided foam tape. It was inconvenient to have to move a strip with a bunch of sharp blades each time before use. Eventually i hot glued it down and it has been fine since then.,4.0
Good purchase and was as expected. The blades don't seem to want to stay tight into the handle though,4.0
Perfect for what I bought them for. The only thing I don't like is they keep coming unscrewed and I have to keep tightening  them.,4.0
"After many hours of searching for my original X-acto set purchased about 40 years ago, I finally concluded I'd lost it during a move. I looked for a replacement in several different hardware and craft stores, but was unable to find the X-acto brand and settled for another ""craft knife"" which simply did not hold up. It finally occurred to me to check Amazon, and I am happy to say that my new set is of the excellent quality I expected from the X-acto brand, including the wooden storage box. The only thing which has changed is that the moulded compartments for the tools is no longer rigid plastic, but a flimsy, lightweight substitute which I expect to deteriorate with age. For that reason alone, I cannot give this set a full five stars.",4.0
would have liked to have a guild showing each blade and its purpose,4.0
"Changing blades is a little weird, as in be careful. Still, for crafty type stuff it's fine.",4.0

"This knife set was exactly as described, arrived promptly and works as expected.  Good value and a good set for modelers.",4.0
"Great kit.  I've been using my old X-ACTO blades for years, but needed a case.  For the price of a good case, I got this kit with extra blades and two extra handles.  It's not the most sturdy case, but it does the job well and keeps my blades organized.  I would recommend.",4.0
This is a very good set of Blades. The blades are very sharp. All pieces lock securely in place. They are good to work with paper and wood work.,4.0

"This arrived in a timely fashion and was packaged well. The knives hold together well, and I haven't had any issues with them.",4.0
"There's a magnetic strip that holds the blades onto the top portion of this kit. That strip's adhesive had gotten a little weak and wouldn't quite hold.

"nice set, just as advertised. It's a well constructed box with a great assortment of hobby blades.",4.0
Great set but the wooden box is a little light and the top row of accessory blades will fall down into the box during storage.  The overall set provides a lot of functionality cheaply but if you want a single higher quality Xacto knife you should look else where.,4.0
"They work pretty well, though I thought they were supposed to be sharper...",4.0
"Great Item to keep in my luggage for removing splinters, opening boxes, trimming loose threads, cutting-off tags... Too many uses to mention here; but it's worth the price if you keep it handy.  The case's hinge could have been more robust; but it's still okay.",4.0
"Pretty nice starter kit. Great tool for all those crafts etc.
Makes sure work of opened this stupid plastic packages.
Pretty nice storage case.
Snack snag, the top magnet that holds the spare blades babe loose.",4.0
"This is a nice set (although I haven't figured out what all of the different shapes should be used for), but the glue that holds the magnet strip for the extra blades keeps failing.",4.0
Fairly solid for an interchangeable blade tool. Excellent for someone looking to get their feet wet that would like to try multiple different techniques. I purchased this in combination with a book and a leather finger guard. I suggest the same. Absolutely a fair price for what I got in the $35 range,4.0

Diffrent than the picture but will do. Fast delivery,4.0
Nice box and good quality product,4.0
"Nice sharp knives. The case is a solid wood, but with a flimsy plastic insert to hold things in place. The top half includes a magnetic strip to hold the blades in place, but the glue holding the strip to the plastic insert doesn't stick. I had to get my own glue to fix that.",4.0
"Great set, but odd that the wood box cost less then the zippered case style.  The box is nice and it is Xacto set so it does the job as I required.  Only reason for the 4 star, I would like to have more than on of each blade and maybe not even include the extra blades, but space to lock them in would be nice.",4.0

"Every craftsmen should have, fast shipping.",4.0
"Handy little set; though the top liner holding the blades has already come off.  No biggie; nice ""beginner's collection"" for hobbies and other purposes.",4.0
Can easily break if you are doing a tough job like I was doing. For paper cutting it should be ok.,4.0
Great kit for the price. Some pieces don't hold in well when closed but not a big issue. The box is cheap but doesn't look bad considering that. Tools came sharp enough to do some work with it directly out of the box. Good if you're just starting off in the hobby or just need a light set of tools.,4.0
"Overall its quite good, way to many blades to know what to do with them. There is a guide, but who is going to read that? just grab it and use it.",4.0

"An excellent value for what you get. The blow-molded holders for the blades are very, very thin and will not stand up to a lot of use before they crack. But the quality of the tools and wood case are just fine.",4.0
Nice little set. No issues.,4.0
"The included case is great and I have no clue whether i'll actually use all the different tips. Xactos are such a universal tool and allow for great crafting tools. The one complaint i have is that the upper plastic holder tends to fall out of the case when opened. This is slightly annoying because then all the tips move around and you have to try to rearrange them to fit while they're still magnetically connected to the plastic. I had a couple near miss cuts while trying to do this, but duct tape saved the day on that issue.",4.0
they work like a charm and can't beat the price...,4.0
Product is as described.  Fast shipping.  Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I had to use 2 way tape to secure the blade holders to the box.,4.0
Accidentally bought for a child. It is an adult toy.,4.0

"the set received was brand new, but looked little dated.",4.0
ok,4.0
Really like this set.,4.0
"This is an excellent kit of knives that does a good job for which it was intended. This is a nice assortment of very sharp knives designed for light duty. It is excellent for model making, minor shaping around the shop, or cutting of patterns. This is not a kit for heavy duty carving. I use it to trim corners in groove cuts, cut patterns, and help lift the coating off double sided tape. It is a good value for what it is designed to do.

I did notice that the ""wooden"" case has been cheapened and the plastic inserts holding the knife blades does not fit well and tends to fall out. Minor inconveniences.",4.0
"This set of x-acto blades is perfect for the occasional hobbyist or student

Pros:
Very nice and durable case
Magnetic strips hold your blades in place
Weighted handles
Easy to swap out blades
Small manual to help you know which blade to use for what job

Cons:
The Mesh pocket that ""Holds"" the manual doesn't do a very good job, so the manual falls out a lot
The two metal handles are perfectly round, so they can easily roll away from you if you're not careful
The tip of the standard blade can break off (as it did to me)

Overall, this is a nice set of x-acto blades.  I use it for school to build my architecture models and they work great.  Great deal for the price!",4.0
"A good set, the problem is that the extra blades do not stay in place when you open and close the case. I solved that problem with glue and double sided tape something that I should not have had to do but now no more problems with it falling out. Also should still be made in the USA, like they were in the past, quality would be better, and I would pay more for better quality, as it is they are okay.",4.0

The quality if the packaging stinks,  i can't keep the magnetic strip that holds the spare blades in place, but the blades are sharp and the handles are sturdy.  While on the subject of handles, the plastic keeper that holds them had to be glued in place because it too kept falling out.",4.0
"received my item today .. packing seems a bit old and crumpled.. but aside to that, the items looks clean, not rusted and pretty much usable for craft use (i don't think this would be suitable for those 'hardcore' type of carving?) ...

one of the tools came wit the collar dislodged.. not sure if it should be glued back, or just pushed back and expect a tight fit..",4.0
"Received my set today via UPS (I am in Singapore).

Basically, the comment about the black plastic insert is true.. items are wrapped in plastic, so the inserts are not fitted as snugly as one would expect. additionally, the plastic insert is also weak, where the plastic wrapping seemed to have crumpled a portion of the insert, and lastly, my jewelers saw wasn't packed properly, so the wooden box could not close and latch at all.

but aside to that, I am pleased with the items .. wide range of tools in the set and the very nice looking/sturdy wooden box..  may decide to take out both the inserts and just keep all my x-acto tools in the wooden box.",4.0
"I don't do artsy woodcarving, but I've had an older set of this specific set for more than 30 years, and have found it to be extremely useful in doing a wide array of household fix-its.  I bought this set because I have broken or lost so many of my older blades.  I may be wrong, but the newer blades do not visually seem to be as durable as the old ones.  Also, this set would be much better if it included the type ""D"" handle rather than the type ""C"" which it comes with.  The type ""D"" black wooden handle has a simple flat side which fits neatly into your hand and gives you a lot more control over the use of whatever blade you have in it.  While the type ""C"" handle is made of plastic with knurles and looks stronger, it takes a much stronger and tiring grip to use it.  I bought two of these sets, along with 2 of the ""D"" handle, one each for me, and one as a gift to my son-in-law.  The two items together make a great and thoughtful gift.",4.0
Your standard X-acto.,4.0
"It works just as expected, really sharp. The only issue I have is that the black plastic holding everything in place is not held in place so when I went to close the box everything fell out. Not too hard of a fix, just glued  everything down on both sides and it hasn't been an issue since.",4.0

I love this set! It is affordable and have a wide range of blades. The problems I have with it are that the plastic in which the blades and knives are set in is weak and cheap and almost feels like it will fall apart. Sometimes when working on something the blade comes loose but it's easy to just screw tight again.,4.0
"Great storage case that is heavy duty and zips closed to protect the contents.  I prefer this zipper storage case over the old classic wooden box as it stays closed when zipped while the wooden box would tend to unlatch. The one negative is that the blades and handles are stored on a very flimsy plastic holder with magnets behind them to hold the blades in place. I fear that over time the flimsy plastic will give and crack.  I wish they had chosen to produce thicker plastic.  Beyond that, it is classic X-Acto and it works great!",4.0

"I bought these for hobby use on plastic models. Good to have the variety of shapes and sizes. Xacto has  always been a good knife but these are not quite up to snuff. The handle on the aluminum knives are not knurled the way they used to be and are a little harder to control because of that. The spare blades are held in place with a magnetic strip that is attached to the plastic liner in the box by a strip of double sided foam tape. When these arrived it was lose and I had to reposition it. So far it is okay, but I have a suspicion that it will come lose again although I like the idea of the magnetic holder. The wood box they come in is very basic but seems sturdy although I predict that the plastic trays holding the knives and blades will soon be broken. I read in some of the reviews about the blades being dull but the ones in my kit are extremely sharp and will cut you up if you are not careful. All in all a pretty good set and quite adequate for just about anything you would do with these type of knives. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good quality hobby knife set.",4.0
Xacto has been around for long time - handy tool for hobbyists or professionals like leathercrafters and gunsmiths.,4.0

"Great Set for newbies like myself. I've wanted an X-ACTO knife set for years, for a strange reason. I collect comic books, and every so often, I open a book and find that the pages have not been cut properly (Uncut pages, pages with large, folded-down pieces that weren't trimmed at the bindery, etc.), and cutting/trimming these pages with scissors can ruin the book. These have already come in handy with comics, and with my son's toys (Trimming off little broken pieces...) The set comes with three handles and 13 blades, and has a nice little booklet that explains the best uses for each blade. Overall, a nice set.",4.0
"X-Acto blades have been around a long time and I've used them for almost as long as I can remember... going back to elementary school when I was allowed to handle ""sharp"" things. This kit has quite an assortment of blades in varying weights and sizes useful for any number of tasks. There are three tool handles also matched for heavy, medium, and fine (delicate) jobs.

I especially like the zippered case with its magnetized blade holders. Even with heavy bumps and drops the blades stay firmly in place. A iconic toolset with inumerable uses.",4.0
"I was very impressed by the selection of blades included in this X-ACTO set.  There are some, like the chiseling blades, that I will probably not have a use for.  But I have already used some of the more basic blades and the scoring blade, and I have been happy with the quality of all that I've tried.

I would prefer that the three handles that come in the set had a better grip.  The two smaller handles are completely smooth metal, except for the very small grips right at the top, directly next to the blade.  I find the metal to be quite slippery and I wish the textured grip part covered the entire handle.  As it is, I'm always a little worried about slipping and cutting myself.  The larger handle is made of textured plastic, and it is easier for me to hold and control.

The case itself is great and all the blades and handles fit perfectly and are easy to remove and put back in.  I believe the blades are held in place with magnets.

The only other thing of note is that all my blades arrived slightly oily/greasy.  I cleaned them of without a problem, but I would have preferred they come nice and clean.",4.0
"Who doesn't love an X-ACTO knife? Whether you're trimming a photo, opening your Amazon Prime shipment, or just seeing what you can cut with the sharp blades because you have nothing better to do, everyone needs at least a few. But did you know you needed 13 blades? I did not until I saw this set, at which time I KNEW I MUST have them!

It's a versatile set with three knives and a total of 13 blades. You can cover numerous projects with this set, and the case is a handy place to store it all so you don't lose any pieces. It comes with a booklet in the mesh pouch to tell you which blades to use for which applications. The mesh pocket is too big, so the booklet will easily fall out...don't lose it if you don't already know what each blade is for!

The storage case is a bit thick, and that's my only real complaint with the set. That makes it harder to store and it wastes a little space. A thinner profile would have been more useful.

My only other complaint is with the nature of the knives themselves. X-ACTO knives are round and are known for rolling away, which can be dangerous if they fall off the surface you're working on. Perhaps they have some models that don't, but there are indeed the round knives, so you'll need to be careful when putting them down.

All in all, I recommend this set. It's a great value!",4.0
The only thing that could make this better is perhaps some adhesive on the plastic sorting trays built into the box. I have to take care when opening the box so that the trays don't fall out and send the blades falling to the floor..,4.0
"Nice set, but not for a surgeon.",4.0
"This is a good basic set with a decent selection of knives and handles. (There's a small guide for those new to X-ACTO life suggesting uses for various sizes.) The case could have been much more useful. It's too wide to slip into a pocket, each section houses only a single blade of each type (no backup storage). The hard shell area that could have been used for storing other blades is made of formed trays glued onto both sides, creating a large amount of wasted space filled with air. If you need the zip protection offered by this case you might not mind, but if space is a premium in your tool area (or you like to slip knives into an apron pocket) the extra bulk is annoying. Good basic / gift set but not a complete success.",4.0

"Is there anyone who hasn't used X-Acto knives at one time or another? My girlfriend uses them for bookbinding. I've used them for model making (wood and plastic), graphic arts, microelectronics, laboratory work, graphic arts, trimming leather... who knows how many uses there are? I think just about everyone has at least one X-Acto knife rolling around in a toolbox, art box, or desk drawer. This set, which consists of the classic No. 1, 2 and 5 handles, and an assortment of blades, has been around in one for or another since before I was a kid. Back then, you could buy it in a wooden case at the X5082 set, and you still can. What's new here is the zippered plastic storage case.

I like the traditional look of the wooden case, and the way it sits on the shelf over my workbench, but I have to admit there are some advantages to the new case. It's tougher than the wood case, won't crack, is unaffected by water, can bounce around in a toolbox or bag without damage, and it doesn't cost any more than the wood cased set. For many users that's enough to convince them to get the newer set. Really, both cases to a fine job of storing these knives, so in the end, it comes down to personal preference.",4.0
"I already have the same X-Acto set in the wood box.  I wanted this because looking at the picture I thought I would be a very thin case and I could carry it in my pocket.

As it turns out it is almost 2"" thick.  That is thicker than the wood version of the very same blades and knifes.  So that didn't work out like I hoped.

As for the product itself, the knifes and blades.  The are very sharp and sturdy.  I've rarely ever broken a blade, but have dulled a few.

This is a nice set in a nice thick case.",4.0

I really like this set.  It includes everything you need to get started.  I just wish it came with multiples of the most frequently used blades or more of them.,4.0
"Xacto used to make a very high quality product in every way, but is currently made in China. The tools are decent, although the case is very poor as other reviewers have stated. For the money it's a good kit, but certainly needs better storage.",4.0
"This is a nice set of knives, but the only problem is that the insert is the same old crappy thin plastic that I remember from 10 years ago.",4.0
"Im glad I bought this, I really like it but the only thing that I wish was different is the plastic that holds the blades and handles. Its a real minor issue but the plastic is really thin and cheap and takes away from the presentation from the box. I think it would definitely make a nice gift though.",4.0
"The biggest benefit of this set (to me) is the box. I'm always losing exacto knives and this keeps it in a big blocky box that I'm not likely to misplace easily.

All the different blades are cool, and I imagine they'll come in handy at some point, but for me- someone making plastic models- most of the blade types will go unused.",4.0
"4 stars instead of five because I have bought about 10-15 of these for our office and the magnet strip on the top on ALL OF THEM keeps falling off. easily fixed though with double sided tape. I recommend  the titanium blade packs, they seem to last longer and keep that super sharp edge you need in design work.",4.0
"Box is made of wood and looks to be pretty good quality.  Smells like wood too.  The wood feels nice to the touch and is very smooth.

The inserts are plastic with a magnetic bar to hold blades in place.

So far so good.  Would recommend.",4.0
"Man what happen to X-acto?  I mean they feel cheap now and don't feel like the quality tool that they use to be.  I had issues with the chuck loosening up while I was trying to cut balsa wood.  I take multiple cuts to cut out what I need and i have to go back and tighten it every so often.
Sadly, I misplaced my old set and had to pick up a new one.  The last set I had for 20 years and my father had it maybe 5-10 years before I had it in my possession.",4.0
"The blades are of course high quality but the wood box & plastic that the knives snap into is of low quality. I, in fact, broke the plastic trying to get a knife out which was a bummer. Would still buy again though!",4.0
"Great set of the must-have X-Acto knives. All items are of great quality and so is the fancy wooden box it comes in. -1 star for the very disappointing platic ""mold"". This holder mold is an extremely thin plastic template that came already broken and deformed. I don't understand why they spend a lot of effort on the -again- very nice wooden box and use then a ridiculous plastic mold. They should spend another ~10cents to make this product easily perfect.",4.0
My son earned a merit badge for woodcarving at a camp and wanted his own set.  This set seems to have everything he wanted.  Seems like it will last a while.,4.0
"Bought these to carve a small, quick project with balsa wood. The soft wood was pretty easily cut into, the only issue was sometimes having to tighten the knife holding the blade which was a simple act of twisting it to the right. Glad it came in it's own wooden box, easy to keep things together and to easily locate the set. Will probably last a good amount of times and come in handy for many small projects. Recommended to anyone who needs some project knives for small projects.",4.0
"Very nice product. exactly what i was expecting, the ""almost"" is on account of the box that holds the pieces. there were no pins in the 2 hinges, so i have to find a couple that will fit. other  than that very nice set of tools",4.0
This was a gift so I really don't know how to rate it.  I did look at is after I recieved it and it looked well made and looked like a nice ste.,4.0
It's a nice set. I only wanted 1 but I saw this set and it seem to be worth it. Only this is that plastic that holds the knife handles in the wood case is a little cheap,4.0
"I purchased this item as a gift.  She hasn't asked me to return it or throw it out for her, so I guess she likes it.",4.0
"Due to problems with product carriers failed me, so I can not rate it. Subject arranged with amazon.
Problem solved",4.0
"This was a present to my Dad who was using a jack knife to build a balsa wood airplane model. He thought it was the next best thing to the hoola-hoop. Sure helped him enjoy his creative time.

 Over all a good set, only issue which is a life long issue of Xacto when putting any pressure to cut the blade tries to come out of the handle.",4.0
The tool box was exactly as described. it was well packaged and the tools were of very good quality. recommended for any hobbyist doing light work.,4.0
"This is a nice kit of X-Acto knives in a small, handy wooden box. One blade was missing, #2 , but there were two of #11 Fine point. Not a really big deal per se in that they both seem to be the same style, the #2 is listed as LARGE Fine Point. The package back has a listing of all the blades and their corresponding numbers and names for future reference. Most of the blades have their numbers on them as well so you can find the name on the package. A couple did not have numbers but by process of elimination you can figure out what you have. Not a bad selection for a beginner set.",4.0
"For an extensive set that covers a variety of occasionally needed tools, this is great.

However, this set has taken more of a back-seat, except for the smallest of the 3 handles.  I just buy refills of blades for it and use that one on the daily.  But having the others as options is pretty nice, as occasionally I DO need some odd blades for odd projects.",4.0
"When I got this I was surprised, although one or two of the blades didn't attach if you close the boss, it was a pretty nice kit. This would be more of a intermediate kit, too complicated for beginners, a little too small for experts. The box and blades where smaller than I expected them to be, it would be nice for traveling and such, but over all I was satisfied and it was more than expected for me.",4.0
"The box is nicely made. The black plastic holding all your blades inside, cheap plastic. I think I might use the set to make something better at holding all the blades.",4.0
"PRODUCT SEEM BE AS DESTRIBE I HAVE NOT USED IT AS OF YET, WILL DO A NOTHER REVIEW AFTER I HAVE USED IT",4.0
"I got this because it made more sense for me to have a few extra xacto knives than 100 spare blades.

They work, they're xacto knives, they cut things.

The box is kind of cute I guess. Something you'd get out of a craft store to paint or something. Don't expect anything fancy, it's a wooden box.

The plastic bits inside weren't very well thought out though. They hold the knives in place so tightly that I found myself taking it out of the box to push the knives out from behind, just so I'm not pulling on the knives too close to the blades. I haven't even tried to pull out a spare blade, There doesn't seem like a good way that doesn't involve prying them out. Not really a problem, I just don't like it when they don't have blade covers.

But at least you know that you can have it in your bag, and be able to toss it around, without worrying about opening it up to a jumble of spare xacto blades.",4.0
To start with : I like the wooden box it is a good design and the inside product has a nice variety for different uses.,4.0
"The overall quality is good. Just like the one I had before. But some of the blades aren't as sharp as they should be, but I only noticed 3 of blades being dull. All in all a good product.",4.0
"A lor of people have mentioned the change in quality of the knives compared to what they were years ago.  When I picked up the #2, it felt much cheaper than the one I've had for decades.  I decided to weigh them and was surprised to see they were exactly the same weight down to the gram.  Not sure why it feels cheaper if it's the same weight, but definitely have that impression.

They still work though.  I don't care that the box is cheaper than it used to be.  I'm not keeping it on display, I just need something that holds the knives and blades and this does it just fine.

It's a great assortment of blades, has the knives I use most often, and is a fair price.",4.0
"This is a great product for beginners, but it was a little disappointing with how small the box actually was. It probably measures about 6 1/2 inch long and that's it. My husband liked it, but for the money I thought it would have been bigger.",4.0
"Seems a lot of reviewers are bashing this product because of the case, particularly the liner insert that holds the blades. It's true...you need to glue it in place, but hey, if you can't figure that out, you probably have no business buying this in the first place. The insert actually holds the blades nicely once you get it glued into the lid. I wasn't that impressed w/ the plane (ergo my rating of 4 stars instead of 5), but again, on the whole, worth the money. If you want high precision quality, then you should probably be buying individual specialty items and not this kit. I use it for building ship models (the spoke shave is really handy for rough shaping masts and yards, and the strip cutter is great for planking etc.)and it meets all my needs quite nicely.",4.0
I love xacto and I use them a lot in my studio whether its cutting leather or cutting out intricate stencils for various projects. The plain box is kind of boring so I lacquered mine. Looks super nice now.,4.0
One of my friends was getting into using the X-Acto knife set. And he was going to buy one piece at a time because he couldn't afford a full set. Well this basic knife set fulfilled his needs and made a wonderful birthday gift for him.,4.0
"Very nice set of Xacto knives, I do quite a bit of art projects with my son and having these babies around makes life so much easier when things need to be a little more precise than scissors.  Good price too.",4.0
"People have whined about the case being cheap.

Well, if you want a hand made case, make yourself one. Either that, or go back to 1960 and pay three times as much.",4.0
it helps me cut little tiny pieces of what I need regarding fabric or building material like Styrofoam for arts and crafts projects,4.0
"So far, so good. I like it and thought the price was good since it was $9 more in shops.",4.0
"Arrived in perfect condition.  The wooden box seems very classic and durable.  I will agree with some of the other reviewers in that the steel-blades are not quite as good of quality that I remember, using X-acto blades for many years.  But, no doubt, this is a good kit.",4.0
My nephew is nine yeas old. He wanted to learn how to widdle wood. He loves this set. Very cool!,4.0
"Sure, the knives are 5 stars in my opinion, the box itself is good enough to be 5 stars, but the plastic inserts are just plain lame.  Also, the place where you put the blades is like a puzzle.  I'm not sure why they don't number their blades and the insert to make it easier.  Sure, when you take one or two blades out at a time it shouldn't be a major issue figuring out which one goes where, but when they are all out, it's a pain.  I think that would be better if they didn't cut/mold them to the blade and just left channels all the same size, so you can put a blade anywhere in there.

But the handles and blades themselves are worth the purchase.",4.0
"I found this item while shopping on line. Even though I have one of these already, I purchased another one so I would have it incase my other one gets borrowed and not returned.",4.0
Decent knife set for a decent price.  Unlike some I have had no quality issues.  The fit and finish on everything is alright and gets the job done.,4.0
"No additional notes, the item is as advertised and works well. The brand obviously opens the door to replacing the blades over time as well. If you need this feel free to purchase without fear of being mislead.",4.0
Haven't had a chance to use it but a very complete set of different types.  Using to cut leather for craft.,4.0
Set was a lot smaller than what I expected. The picture makes it look like a bigger box. Other than that seems to be fine.,4.0
A very nice toolset from x-acto that comes in a neat wooden box. The only negative thing I noticed is the grip on #2 blade. It was not as I expected... Blade makes an insignificant tilt on your first cut backwards. This is as I mentioned insignificant but I would expect perfect quality from x-acto,4.0
"product was as advertised and perfectly served my need for a light-duty carving set...good price, exacto put together a nice set...",4.0
I had a set of these before and lost them during a move.  Use them for pumpkin carving.  The blades are a little hard to change but ok once you get the hang of it.  Decent for the price.,4.0
"I purchased this set of Xacto knives for use in building plastic model kits and for my wife to use in her painting projects. The tools themselves seem to be well-built and there is a good variety of blades and tool handles. The set was well-priced.

The only problem I have with this set of kives is the packaging. The wooden box and plastic insert are cheaply made. It isn't easy to takle a knife out of the packaging to use. Other than that, I am pleased with this set of hobby knives.",4.0
"OK it is not made as well as the old stuff.  Not sure if the blades will even last as long.  But you have to keep in mind, for the most part quality hand crafted tools are a thing of the past, when and if you find them now, the cost is usually very high. Sometimes your task will justify additional cost, but these are just craft knives and work well.  Also the classic three knife handle set will meet most needs.",4.0
"Replaced y old Xacto set with a new one.  Quality still excellent.  Only problem is the knife and blade holders inside the box made of very very thin plastic.  First project, replace them with wood .",4.0
"The set I got had its various components actually adhered to the magnets in the case that are there to hold things in place.  I don't mean they were adhered magnetically, I mean they were stuck to the point that I had to pry them off with a small screwdriver!  Once free of their moorings, they were pretty good at what they are designed to do.",4.0
"I purchased this item to use to cut wood veneer,,i am very pleased with this product,,the knife handle fits comfortable in my hand and there is a nice selection of single blades to chose from,,i plan to buy other xacto products,,the only issue i have is the wedge in the sanding block is a bit too fat and tends to come lose,,i cut down a piece of shim that is a tad smaller thus fits and holds the sandpaper well,,overall this is a great product.",4.0
"I bought this at the last minute for a quick stencil project. The swivel knife worked great for that. Haven't used the other two knives yet, but the set looks great.",4.0
The blades in this kit come extremely sharp and without imperfections. The 3 provided handles are great quality and are easy to change blades. The only complaint I have it the case. Housed in a nice wooden box is a junky plastic pressure-formed insert that was already bent and cu by the blades by the time it arrived. It is unfortunate that they skimped on the case but the knives are top quality.,4.0
"Perfect for small carving, in this case I purchased as a Xmas gift for my wife for her miniatures/doll house furniture. Fit the bill perfectly!",4.0
This is just what I was looking for.  Handy in many ways and welcome to our household.  Thanks for rushing this.,4.0
"Always consistantly good, hasn't changed in years.
I really like the box set to keep knives organized
Xacto works greats!",4.0
"This is a good little kit. It includes a wide variety of replaceable blades and 3 knives. I went to work with it immediately. Very convenient to own. If you cut stencils, build models,  or do detailed paper sculpture, it is perfect.",4.0
Decent little case with many attachments. I only wish it came with multiple blades for the most common used types. The big plastic handle comes in handy for projects that need more power but can also lead to bigger accidents so be careful.,4.0
Just what my son needed to complete some Architecture model construction projects.  Amazon's quick ship made it easy to send to my son's School.,4.0
"Have only used a few of the scraping heads and the saw blade for my gourd projects. Word of advice, some of the attatchments have to fit in the groove and some need to be out of the groove when tightening them down so they stay in. You will understand when you get the kit. The items that I have used so far work VERY well for me, they scrape and cut and gouge very nicely. They are sharp and strong and I like the handle. The case is organized nicely but the downside is that the top blades sit against a magnetic strip that holds most of the blades some of the time and some of the blades most of the time but never all of the blades all of the time! I leave mine open so they don't fall out when opened and closed. So there, fixed that problem! I would say that I am glad I bought this kit! Thanks, happy carving, cutting, gouging ,whittling, scraping and whistling while you work!",4.0
"Great little carving kit for hobby and crafts but carving soft woods like pine the blades had worn out quickly and I don t know how to order just replacement blades
Also the magnet used to hold the extra blades dose not work and the blades fall all over the box but if you need this type of kit I don t think their are any competitors",4.0
"These are now made in, of course, Communist China like almost everthing else sold in the U.S. except major appliances, land and at least up to now, automobiles.  The box is wood, unlike what another reviewer said.  They claimed it is made of plastic.  The plastic box comes with a different set of knives.  I use these knives to fix imperfect mat cuts in the corners when they occur when I cut mats for my photos.  The blades are VERY sharp!  So if you like Chicom products, add this one to your collection.",4.0
"Great quality/price ratio.  The box has a really nice finish outside, but the blades and x-acto are in a plastic -mold, not quite fancy. But according to the price, it was expected.
The blades itself are really useful and easy to use, and of good quality :)",4.0
Three X-taco knives a sturdy case and a polethora of different blades to handle most of your everyday needs as a modeler. Great starter set. Highly recommended. I use it every project.,4.0
"This is a very useful set, with all types of blades to choose from. I've used it for crafts, fixing the car, and repairing a telemark ski boot. Somehow wish they could figure out how to keep them sharper for a bit longer, but I guess that's just the reality of knives.",4.0
"Bought the set for some light home prototyping/design work. The handles and blade assortment is great, even though I doubt I'll use some of the specialist blades. The box is also super for keeping the instruments sloshing around the bottom of a desk drawer or rattling around in the old mug I use to hold pens. The price I paid on Amazon was $10 less than the same item sold in the local Staples ($16.29 vs. $25.99).

My main complaint relates to the materials used for the handles. The X-acto knives I used in school had a heavier grade of steel and the handles had real heft. These handles feel too light. In addition, the plastic inserts used to hold the instruments is of a really low-grade, cheap plastic that grips the objects too tightly. This requires you to use more force to pull them out and snap them back in, which could be dangerous if they slipped out of your hand while taking them out. That faux-felt material you see inside of watch boxes and penholders would have been better, in my opinion.",4.0
"These come in a really nice-looking wooden box! I love all the various blades this set has and also, they've really helped me out during my first year of art school. What I didn't like was the fact that the blade attachments were stored on the top half of the box, the lid. Some of them never failed to fall out and hide themselves at the slightest provocation. To remedy this super annoyance, I decided to switch the top and bottom holders and super-glue them to the box. It's all good now. I'd say if you want to get these, go ahead and get them! Also, if you can make a special, better place for storage of the blades, even better.",4.0
very useful,4.0
"not so sharp for details. i am working with fondant! ok for regular designs. i would recommend to a friend.
thank you!",4.0
Used this kit to start my carving hobby and it worked well. It's a good starter kit which you can add on to as needed.,4.0
"Decent product and the box alone on my set was worth the price. Not at all what I normally get when purchasing Xacto tools.
I really only needed the gouges but the rest will be put to work sooner or later. Not too keen on the plastic handle but for the money a great buy.",4.0
"my grandmother bought me this set when I was ten or so: I admit, it's not a tool for a pro, but I have literally been using it for twenty years to do everything from carving an elaborate likeness of my father in wood, to cutting paper (it's great for this), to whittling wax or pumpkins or whatever. I still pull it out whenever I need to carve whittle or shape something. Excited to buy it now for my nephew!",4.0
"Every year we bought those cheap, plastic Pumpkin Masters carving sets for $6-8 so our kids could carve their own pumpkins. Inevitably they broke. No more. This set came with a #15 keyhole saw blade that should last through several seasons of pumpkin carving. It's safe enough for my kids (6 and 9) to use with supervision. If you already have an X-acto knife and want to do some pumpkin carving just buy the #15 blades, which are about $8 for a 5 pack on Amazon.",4.0
"I had a lot of odd size photos from years ago that would not fit in the albums with presized slots so this was a good alternative and works for that.

Here are the positives:  Plenty of room for the old 3x3 photos you might have from the good old days.  The album itself is very nice looking.  It expands alot. Not indefinitely like it says since the piece that covers the expansion part has a finite amount of room.  You get to look at a whole page of 5 or 6 photos at once so it's nice to have a flow of things.  The photos really stick to the page. Almost too much. Once they are down it's hard to get them up without bending a corner.  You can put other momentos in this, I had a few cards I wanted to save.

The negatives:  I had to crop every photo I had.  If you want to put 4x6 on you can only fit 3 if you stagger them.  I sat there with a razor blade trimming photos. But my panoramic fit perfectly.  It is kind of a pain to add sheets.  Maybe I don't have the hang of it yet.  Once you peel back the sticky part it's hard to get the wrinkles out although that doesn't really bother me.

I just spent most of the day arranging my photos and trying to put them in some sort of order. I just love having this huge (and this thing is heavy with 2 or 3 extra sets of refills) book where I can just flip through the pages and see all the good memories.

The reviewer who said this was not acid free is from 2002 or something.  I won't live long enough if these start to fade so Oh well.

Oh the last downside.  This is expensive.  Refills are about $5 for 5 two-sided pages which can fill up fast.  I found some at Joann's with a discount and reasonable shipping. ($27 for 6 packs of refills).  So I'm at $37 already.  But I think without this many of the photos that I really wanted to see would still be in a box in the closet.

Bottom Line: I'm glad I got it.",4.0
"The page size is very practical and it seems to be a high quality procuct (I have only had it for 2 days).  It lays very flat, not uneven like a binder, and it can be expanded a lot.  The only problem is that the refills seem a bit pricy. I could buy another album with 10 sheets for less than it would cost to buy 10 refill pages.  Overall though, I am happy with my purchase.",4.0
worked like a charm for all my odd size photos,4.0
Great for any size photos,4.0
"Great delivery, and easy to load into your scrapbook. I bought it at a great price, but since then I think the price has gone up 2 dollars.",4.0
"These are a great price and a good product. If you've scrapbooked before, they are pretty standard. Benefit: none split when sliding pages in, something that has happened with other brands. However, it says ""10 pages"" which I took to mean 10 sleeves. It meant 5 sleeves = ten pages so I have to buy more. I felt that was somewhat misleading, but then again, reading product descriptions saves lives.",4.0

It is my first scrapbooking album. It is beautiful. The only inconvenient is that I have to cut a little border of 12x12 scrapbooking paper because it doesn't fit in the page.,4.0
"These are a nice quality for scrap booking however, they are a little snug for 12x12 paper so a little side trimming is suggested if you don't want the pages to bend. Other than that, they are fine.",4.0
"very nice and just what I wanted.  It is good to have both the vinyl cover and the insert page.  For those desiring a economical scrapbook, this is what you are looking for.",4.0
"I make a lot of scrapbooks and tend to always make more pages than the scrapbooks have (typically they have 10).  Page protector insert quality varies wildly and so does the price.  When they put the cheap 12 x 12 scrapbooks on sale at craft stores (or if you have the typical 40% off one item coupon), you can get the entire scrapbook with 10 inserts for the same price as this.  However, they're terrible quality and most rip along the seam as you try to insert your scrapbook pages.

These are good quality, thick and with good seams.  The Amazon price is cheaper than I can get at my local stores at regular price for the same quality.  Even the white insert paper is of higher quality.  I take the inserts out and give them to my son's day care for arts and crafts use since I always use materials such as Bazzill cardstock.

It doesn't mention it here, but mine came with extension posts that fit with the existing posts to make the binding thicker and accommodate the extra sheets.",4.0

The price here too is a bit pricier than HEB. There are not a lot of suppliers selling this particular item too.",4.0
"I used it to make care instructions to sew onto an afghan and it worked well. I used it on a light yellow print cotton, and the graphic was black with a yellow matte to match the fabric.

I bought this item to print up some cool pictures of my alma mater the University of Pennsylvania that I took a while ago when I went back to the campus to visit.

I really didn't expect much from this product based on past experience with iron ons.  These worked well.  We designed it so we could cut out our design with no complex white background showing and ironed on a canvas tote.  Looked great. Can't attest to wear with wash but made a nice quick gift.,4.0
"I purchased two packs of these transfer to put on several black t-shirts I was creating.  They were fairly easy to use from start to finish.  I like the fact that you do not need to print a mirror image in order for it to come out correctly.  The transfers are a little difficult to remove from the paper layer, however, if you lightly score the back, they seem to come off much easier.  I had no problem with scorching or overheating.  All of the corners stayed down as well.  So far, all the transfer remain intact after one washing.  Overall, I was satisfied with my purchase.",4.0
"I used this item to create for a costume for a charity dinner I did a skit in.  The print I needed tranferred great and the whole process of the iron-on worked just like in the instructions. I would reccommend keeping the heat low on the iron, a little color did bleed because I had the heat too high.

Also, I'm not sure how permanent this iron is.  I easily peeled off the transfer shortly after I used the costume.  For my purpose that was good, I could reuse the shirt.  If your looking for a more permanent transfer this item may not be the best?",4.0

The Goods:

-Easy to handle(good to go after one practice shirt)

-Will last a fair amount of time, if not washed too ofeten

-Color comparable to all other transfers out there

-Does not look as home made as some other tranfers can be

The Bads:

-If you wear your newly created shirt more 3 times or more a week, do not expect it to last more than a month without it being a crackly mess.

-Be cautious of over ironing the transfer image to shirt, will easily burn if you follow the directions.

-Cheap transfer material not as durable as some other higher priced transfers.",4.0
This is a good product at a good price. Got a few tips tho. Do not expect things to work on first try prefectly be prepared to waste a t shirt or test the paper on a pillow case. Cut close to the edge not right on or else it doesn't adhear properly causing it to wash off. Yellow oust side means you burnt it. All in all good product to try.,4.0

"Ours didn't turn out as flawless as the photo on the box, it's a bit rough around the edges of the hand and doesn't have as much detail, but I like the idea and am glad to have a cast of my son's hand.  After reading the other reviews, I had my 4-year-old practice ""floating"" his hand inside the empty tray beforehand (not touching the bottom of the tray), and I talked him through the process before we did it, and he did pretty well.  I can see where he might have been too wiggly at 1 or 2 yrs old.  I think I may have added a bit too much water to the gel, so it took longer get to a pancake batter consistency, and took longer to set/firm (we counted to 100 with his hand in place before it seemed ready to take out), but I didn't feel too rushed.  I wasn't able to get all the lumps out of the gel, so I wonder if that affected our result (could be just me, I'm not so great at pancakes either...), or if I waited too long to pour.  If we do it again, I would also tell him to spread his fingers wider, because it was somewhat tricky pulling his fingers out without displacing the thin areas of gel between fingers.  I am curious to read others' experiences with hanging it (does the hook hold the weight OK?).  Even if we don't hang it on the wall, it is neat to be able to ""touch"" my sons's hand shape as this age.  I am guessing it will make me weepy when he gets big.  My son enjoyed doing it and was excited to ""measure how big my hand is for when I grow.""  I am now looking for the refill kits for the gel and plaster to keep until my younger son gets a little older.",4.0
"I used this on my 2 sons when they were preschool age (they're now 16 & 17 years old). We are a military family, so we move a lot, and through all the moves, these molds of my sons hands have endured and still look great today.

I now also have 2 daughters, who are preschool age, and was happy to see this was still around. Last night we did my older daughter's hand, although it took two tries, now I need to go buy another to do my younger daughter.

These things last, and are so awesome to have, as they capture even the tiniest crease and groove of the hand. I didn't give it 5 stars though because sometimes, even with an older child, it takes more than one try to get it right. I think they need to add a little more gel because if your child touches the bottom, you'll have to redo it.

I always add slightly less water to the gel mixture than it calls for, otherwise it spreads too thin and takes longer to set.",4.0

"I have owned this serger for over 2 yrs.  I bought mine from Wal-mart and I think the price was $199.  It was a gift from my mother and I was very excited to get it.  It worked well for the small items I was using it for, but as of late it is having problems and instead of taking it to my local shop I have decided to purchase another machine (repairs costs more than the machine).  Because I use my machine everyday I will be looking for a more advanced heavier machine that is not industrial (small space, I want an industrial).  I have noticed that I can only sew light fabrics and it loves cotton (broadcloth types).  There are some tension adjustments needed for silkier fabrics, but those seem to be the only type fabrics it wants to sew.  I hadn't had any problems until I started stepping up my sewing game and that leads me to think that I need a more advanced machine.

This machine is perfect for an advanced beginner who sews a lot, but hasn't quite gotten to the advanced/ intermediate lvl.  It will give a more clean finish to your garments and give you the ""serger"" experience.  Since my original purchase I have out grown this machine, but believe that it has it's usefulness in the beginner category.",4.0

"The Singer 14SH654 is a good little serger for my first serger machine use. I wanted a machine that binds/serges edges well but am not interested in creating fancy edges. One of the bottom threads is a bit difficult to connect. That is the reason for a 4 star rating, not a 5. Otherwise, I like it very much. Even as a newbie to sergers, I've had no problems with thread breaking.",4.0

"I am new to using this type of machine. I have over 50 years experience in using various brands of sewing machines.  The reason for buying this Singer is because I have had very good experiences with Singer products in the past and the price was very low at Walmart.  I was really surprised by the speed in which I could complete projects.  I made two outfits for my granddaughters in less than 3 hours, counting the finish work.  The only thing I do not like about this product is the fact that there is no information about types of thread or how to get the special pressure feet needed for special projects.  I discovered, on my own, that I can use regular spools of thread just by removing the adapter used for cones.  I,also,found that threading the loopers was a bit tricky, but I did it with several tries.  The DVD was very helpful.  So far, I am very satisfied with my machine.

"Singer Serger model 14SH644/645
This was a Birthday gift from my husband.  I am a sewer of custom girl's clothes and a quilter.  While you can do both without a serger, a serger makes it easier.
When my husband made his choice on which model to get me, it was based solely on price.  He bought the one that fit the budgeted amount for the gift.  I really doubted the serger would be the best one out there, but was happy to play with it.
I was hesitant at first, it looked way too complicated.  I dove right in...first using the fabric that came under the foot (knowing full well that the settings can move during shipping) and saw they needed to be adjusted just a bit.  After adjusting the settings, I took some fabric I was using on a current project and played.  I was happy with the stitch quality.  Then...I tried the dreaded rethreading.  I knew that was going to be the absolute worst.  It did take some practice.  It did take several attempts to get it just right.  But the confidence it gave me was worth it.
For the next several months, the only complaint came with the light.  It is an LED that apparently has a short in it.  On sometimes and not others.  I just got a good Ott light to use on the desk beside it and it is fine.
Then the disaster happened.  My small son played with it.  Every single setting was changed.  Several days of working with it to try and put it back right was useless!  I sat it aside and pretended it wasn't there for another couple of months.
I then pulled out the DVD.  Watching it reminded me that it was just a machine and I could master it again.  Pulling out the manual, I worked on it for several days.  Once I would get one stitch perfect I wrote down the settings and the type of fabric I was using.  Then I would go to another stitch.
As with any sewing machine, you get what you pay for, and with any machine you get what you put into it.  If you are determined to make it work you can.  Just depends on how much effort you are willing to put into it.
Do I dream of an air threader with all the bells and whistles and millions of feet?  Yes!  But, for the time being, I am staying with what I have.",4.0
"I've never owned a serger before, so I can't compare this machine to anything else. I've always wanted one, but they look so scary...especially threading it! I was just tired of straight stitching and then zig zagging my seams. Plus, no knits on my regular machine.

At first I just couldn't get a decent, balanced stitch. But with time and patience (I'd say about two hours), I got there. This machine works fine for my personal use and I thinks it's a nice little machine for the price. It saves me tons of time. Practice, practice, practice on fabric scraps and watch the DVD that comes with it. It's very helpful. The manual is so-so. I'm glad I bought it. Also, I've looked on the web and there are several sites that carry parts for this machine. I'm asking my husband to get me some of the optional feet for my birthday.",4.0
"I just bought this model locally because I wanted it really quickly to do some projects.  I'm surprised at how easy it is to use.  It's smooth, to me it's quiet, sits stable and has not caused any problems.
I have a few tips: Read the reviews both positive and negative but be prepared to discount a lot of it.  Obviously if it's not working you have to return it.
Tip #2 - watch the DVD instructions and follow along on your machine.  I use a flashlight and magnifying glass.  Mine came pre-threaded with all white thread.  Do not unthread it.  Check that the thread paths look good and that nothing got tangled or jumped off the tensioners for example.
Tip #3 - start serging on the piece of scrap they left on the machine.  You will see if it's working immediately.  Serge on your scrap cloth, then serge on a project where you can use white thread.  It took me a little effort to sew in a straight line for example as I got used to the machine.
I made a few hand towels with hemp terry fabric and wanted finished edges.  This is as simple a project as can be.  If you aren't able to serge at this point then you're in trouble.  The machine worked fine for me.  The tensions were all good preset on 3.  Later I tried adjusting these for different effects.
Last tip I'm giving - I changed the two loop threads which are the difficult ones.  What I did was tie one knot to tie the original white thread with the new color thread I wanted to use then I slowly pulled the new thread through the guides all the way past the foot.  Do this carefully, manually pulling the thread at different points of the path to make sure the knot passes okay - don't just pull at the end by the foot.  I did one thread then the other.  To change the needle threads is way too simple so I did not need any special trick.

In summary this serger worked well for me pre-threaded and re-threaded with the trick described above.  If I am unable to thread it manually later that would be a separate issue.  I found the sewing smooth and controllable, the cutter worked great, I had mine on a wood TV table and it never walked, I found it quiet for me and I was serging well past midnight.  This was the cheapest serger that I've seen but I would have paid the extra $20-$40 to get a different make if they were available locally.  I went to two stores that had one each.  I bought one and somebody else bought the other.  I noticed it was gone when I went back to buy serger thread in those large spools.  This was on 12/18/2008.  I have just enough time to make some items as presents.  I would recommend you give it a try.",4.0
"Serger is easy to thread. Not difficult to thread as others stated. Just follow the manual from manufacturer. Remember that this machine handles mostly lite to medium fabric only. Unless you can adjust the pressure for the presser foot correctly, don't sew heavy fabric on this baby or you will bend your presser foot holder and cause your presser foot to not catch the threads to form the serge properly/not at all. When I did it, I simply moved it back into position. It works like it suppose to. I did end up buying most of the presser feet for this serger though. It did cost me much more (another $75 total), but needed it in order to experiment with the different styles.",4.0
"This is a great serger! I purchased one two years ago, and purchased a second one this year for specialty serging. This machine is not difficult to thread, operate and maintain at all. I have never had any problems with my sergers, and I have always owned Singers! I believe that the negative responses posted are due to lack of operator knowledge on how to operate and maintain these machines. If you have never used a serger, I recommend taking a class first, or purchasing the Complete Guide to serging. It will make a world of difference!!",4.0
"Having never used or purchased a serger before, I bought this one on clearance and set it up.  It was tricky to get started, but once I found out what my errors were I was on my way.  You must set the threads deep enough into the tension discs.  I've sewn baby items and they've turned out nicely.  I'm pleased overall with my purchase.  Now I just have to practice!",4.0
"i purchased this machine from walmart in store in november 2005 as it had a free arm that is small enough to trim and hem ladies slacks.this is important to my type of sewing as i always seem to be doing circular stitching on ready to wear as well as fashion sewing.i am very pleased with the speed of stitching and the ease of threading. the manual is excellant. also the singer company website has a full color threading guide to print out if you need a large sized picture. the #2022 needles are hard to find in stores however singer website has them in 5 packs for 5 dollars each i have ordered 5 packs as they are combo of size 11 and 14. they are special because of the longer grooves front and back to reduce friction in high speed sewing. however my manual says #2020 may be used but you have to tinker with the tensions. in regard to the creeping or machine walking i have the machine on a sturdy surface, an old typewriter table from a second hand office supply store that is on wheels and has side extensions. i placed  the machine on a vinyl placemat  and this cured the creeping and quieted the sound as well. for 193 dollars i got a good deal.however i would suggest this for a person who has sewn with sergers or someone who can go to an experienced sewer.",4.0

"I received this Simplicity sewing machine as a Christmas present this year, and love it. It seems to be well built, is very sturdy, has a carrying handle on top, and comes with a great variety of sewing feet, including an embroidery foot! The ONLY problem I have found so far (and I've used this machine for at least three hours a day since Christmas), is that the machine has trouble starting out slow on it's own -- you need to manually turn the side wheel, which is difficult when you're trying to do foundation piecing for a quilt. I've found myself trying to hold the fabric steady, turn the wheel AND hit the reverse button all at the same time! I'm also not crazy about the location of the reverse button -- it is awkward to get my right hand over to the left side of the machine -- but I guess I'll get used to it. I'd rate this machine 5-star for a beginner's machine, but serious quilters may want to look for a machine with more advanced features.",4.0
"I bought this machine used, and so far, I'm pretty happy with it, but I am a beginner sewer.

Here are some of the things I wish were different...

1. I wish that when I finished sewing, the needle would always end in the up position.  When it finishes on the down position and I manually roll it up, the needle usually comes unthreaded when I start sewing again.

2. Mine came with a VHS tape with tips and instructions - unfortunately I don't have a VHS player.  I would have preferred a DVD.

3. The base does not fit into the space of a normal sewing machine table.  In order to put it in the sewing table so that the sewing surface is flush with the table, I'd need to make the hole in my table bigger.

Overall, I'd recommend it as a basic, beginner machine.  It does what I need, but I am only using it for simple projects.",4.0

"After my 25 year old Singer electronic passed on, I needed a replacement to sew simple household projects--curtains, dog beds, placemats.  The negative reviews gave me pause, but the one-step buttonhole and drop-in bobbin features at such an affordable price made me take a chance on this machine, and I'm glad I did.  Ironically, I've sewn very few simple projects since purchasing this machine six months ago.  My first task was to cuff several pairs of slacks, for which the blind-hem stitch worked perfectly.  I've just completed a silk waistcoat, for which the button-hole feature worked wonderfully the first time (at least after discovering the correct position for one control). My next project will be a renaissance-style wedding dress, and my experience with this machine suggests it will perform above my original expectations. So far, the only problems I've encountered are those I've created myself by improperly threading the machine. My only complaints:  it's pretty ugly, and the pressure foot could be heavier.",4.0

"I bought this machine a year ago after returning a Brother machine.  This one was inexpensive and seemed to have everything that I could ever dream of using for quilting.  I do agree that the machine has many plastic pieces, but I have not had a problem so far.  However, I DO NOT agree with what other reviews have said about the threading system.  I have used it every time I have sat at my machine and it has not failed once.  Could this be because of a design change within the last 6 months or so?  Or it might just be user error.  The needle does have to be in a certain position to use properly.  Overall, I really like this machine and will continue to use it until I can afford a long arm machine for quilting.",4.0
"Well,  I have not had it that long, but...
If you are looking for a multifunction, first machine, then this would be a good choice for the price.
On thee plus side:
1. The instructional video is very helpful. Watch it before using the machine. It will save you a lot of grief.
2. The drop in bobbin is very easy and convenient.
3. The clear bobbin cover makes monitoring amount of bobbin thread a snap. It reduces the chances of running out of thread at inconvenient times.
4. The shape and color are unusual. It reminds me of an orca whale. Subsequently, I nicknamed mine ""Shamu"".
5. The easy threading system works well up to the needle (see below). It can be done with one hand.
6. Comes with all the basic feet you need.
7. Feed dogs drop for free motion quilting.
Minus:
1. ""Automatic"" threading of the needle? NOT!! I can thread the needle faster the old fashion way. This function has not worked once for anyone that I asked to try it or me. (Not even the gal in the instructional video can get it right the first time.)
2. It ""eats"" the fabric if you start a seam too close to the edge.
3. I have the IMPRESSION that it will break if I try thick fabric (e.g. denim).  This is my first brand new machine: the plastic parts seem flimsy or delicate compared to my 20 and 30 year old all metal models.

"As a person who has sewn for a long long LONG time, I always wondered why a serger would be so important.  Didn't think I needed one till I helped with a local little theater group and the costume designer showed me hers (an extremely expensive one made by another manufacturer).  I was impressed though by the finished look it gave to the items we sewed.  After thinking about it, I realized maybe having one wasn't such a bad idea.  I couldn't see spending MEGA bucks if I could find one that did exactly the same thing.  After checking out pretty much every  serger out there around $200.00, I settled on this one.  Why?  Because it had everything the others had, plus a better warranty and extras the others didn't - like the ability to sew with 2-3-4 threads (most only offer 3-4 threads).  The price was right too.  After I got it, it took me about 20-30 minutes to learn to thread it (I did not rush thru this process because threading a serger is NOT like threading a sewing machine).  I used the manual that came with it and haven't even viewed the video (though I'm sure if it's as thorough as the manual it is good).  I'm very happy with this machine.  It's easy to use, and (considering the threading pattern, etc) fairly easy to learn to thread.  I did buy a serger threader which should help if I ever have to re-thread the loopers (the only really hard one is the lower one).  I've already had to change out the needles (warning, if you need to change the right needle, it is easier if you remove the left one, too - and if you're going to do that, you may as well put in two brand new needles).  I would recommend this serger.  Oh, and btw, I checked out some really expensive sergers ($400+) and their thread patterns were identical to the Simplicity.  Proving you don't have to spend an arm and a leg to get a good serger.  One other suggestion I'd like to make, make sure you buy (I made my own) a bag to catch the cuttings and threads that fall out of the machine.  They can make a real mess under foot otherwise.  Also, keep a can of pressurized air for cleaning out the dust/fabric bits that accumulate inside the machine.  This will keep it running in tiptop shape.  Don't overdo the air (short bursts, stop when the can heats up) - that'll keep moisture from getting inside the machine.",4.0

"Excellent scissors. Easily cut through 8 sheets of paper stacked. Works well for a wide range of ages from my toddler to my teenager and myself and keeps my big scissors from getting overused. Came faster than expected, would buy again. Only complaint is not being able to pick a color as choosing a color would be ideal for back 2 school time.",4.0
"They are useful, nice size, very handy to have in different rooms at the house.....",4.0
"These are good quality and the children had no problem with them. I ordered three pair and got three different colors, nice.",4.0
I got pink ones for my little boy.  Not that I have a problem with that but it would have been awesome if we could have gotten a pair in blue since it's his current fave color.,4.0
"I bought these for a child for elementary school.  They cut paper well.  The handle is solid plastic.  It doesn't feel comfortable to me, but my kid likes them.  The tip is pointy, but not dangerously so.  You do not get to pick the color when you order.  Thankfully mine arrived blue, not pink or purple.",4.0

Work quite well for kids scissors. Hope they really are safe enough.,4.0
"Standard scissors.  I store kid-sized scissors throughout the house so I always have a pair where I need them.
These are a no-brainer purchase if you need kid scissors or small scissors somewhere in the house.",4.0
Really cool scissors. I wish they were a little bit longer. My 3 and 5-year old use them with no problems. Very happy.,4.0
Good buy! Cut well. Wish tips were not pointy.,4.0
cute - works fine,4.0
"These scissors are amazing, and allow my six year old to do much more complex cuts than she can with the standard kids ""safety"" scissors. Great for dexterity.
Just keep in mind that they really are mini versions of adult scissors, and very sharp as well as accurate. I just keep an eye on my daughter when she is using them, and don't leave them in her craft box. I also had a talk with her about how these are different from her other scissors, and how to be careful with them.",4.0
"I ordered two of these scissors for my kids' school kits. They say they give you whatever color they want. I didn't think that was a big deal until they arrived in the wrong colors, according to my kids. I remembered too late that kids live and die by colors they love and hate, so having the option to choose colors for kid scissors would be nice. Fiskars is a great classic brand and we always have good luck with these scissors for school and crafts.",4.0
I liked the scissors but I wish they had been a little more pointed regardless they worked great for our project and kids,4.0
My kid plays on this thing none stop. That includes sitting and laying on it in the process. I have even seen him stand on it which I would not recommend. He has had it awhile now and is still using it so as far as I'm concerned it was a good purchase. Great for his trains and cars.,4.0
"I already had a small table for my son to do his art work on (he's 2 years old) but I wanted to use it for a new toy, so I looked around online and in different stores to get just the right table that I wanted now, and so far this one is working out well. It's big (so beware if you have limited space), but I love it b/c other table was small and stuff was always falling off it. I considered the other kind of art tables that have storage areas up above, but my son is only 2 and I want him to be able to use the table now so figured best to keep everything low in his reach. It's a little tricky for him to get out his things from the side storage bins as the bins fall out easily, but overall he's managing and it's nice to have a lot of space. I was surprised the top was thin cardboard and a space around the edge, so playdo and paint gets caught in there, but the table was made to have 2 sides with and without the top, though I think we'll use it just with the top, because he has another play table for trains etc. A great buy for the price! Plus, it was very easy to put together. Also, I used the chair from the other Step2 table and they fit fine with this table.",4.0
"This is actually the first serger I have ever owned. I have to admit I was initially afraid to operate a serger because they looked very complicated, but when I started a business designing and selling dog clothes, I had to bite the bullet, get one and learn.  It was much easier than I could have ever imagined.  The machine came already threaded with 4 different colored thread cones and ready to sew.  The 4 colors made it easy to see just where the threads traveled from spool to fabric.  Very cool education if you're new to serging.  Of course, I had to learn to thread it right away, and was very pleased that besides good written instructions and pictures, there are colored diagrams and dots to follow in the machine which make it fairly easy.  The included feet pop on and off with the push of a button and are a godsend, as I use a good amount of piping on some of my designs.  I have a second EP serger, a different model, which didn't come with the feet, and that was a disappointment (although I was able to order them separately later).  The stitching is consistent and the machine is pretty simple to use. I definitely recommend this machine to anyone who wants to get into serging, but without spending a fortune.",4.0
"I love the machine, but the only problem I have is when it was time for replacements blades, no has heard of the machine.  Euro-pro do not give enough information on replacement parts or numbers in their instruction manuals.  In addition they do not offer any type of information to what type of blades they are compatable with.  This would help ever so much, if replacement parts could be easier to fine.",4.0
Nice product for creative minds,4.0
"I used if for the Paw Patrol image (the ""3"" and name were done with HTV). I accidentally melted the hat off of Rocky with my iron when I was ironing on Skye, but owell. I used 'Print Then Cut' with my Cricut to cut the characters out.",4.0
I bought this to make a costume to iron on labels on a shirt from a movie a league of their own. The first couple times I messed it up you have to use the iron on a no steam setting and make sure to get the edges very very well I would leave the iron on three times longer than what it says and peel off very carefully also you will need to keep in mind that whatever you iron onto the shirt will need to be in a reverse image. You can do that in Photoshop or an online photo editor just mirror the image backwards so that when you iron it on the shirt it looks the right way,4.0
"Bought this to make a shirt for my daughters birthday party. Ironed on well and is still in good shape, she's a toddler so that is a plus. My only complaint, and it just may be printer compatibility was that is smeared a little during printing. Other then that a good product.",4.0
"I impulse bought these along with the dark fabric transfers and finally got around to using them.  My 1 yr old is obsessed with Thomas the Train and he lost his favorite shirt, so I figured it wouldn't cost me anything to try these on a white hanes undershirt.  I edited the image in my Silhouette software, printed with registration marks,  and then sent it through the machine to cut it out for me.  I didn't have to do this but it made for a really close cut,  really fast. Pressed on my heat press for 20 seconds at 320 F and it looks pretty good! It has that telltale transfer feeling but whatever,  the kid loves it and I have time to look for and buy him more of the shirts he loves. I would only use these for personal projects,  I would not sell these,  but for hobby work these are pretty good!  The dark transfers are definitely more vivid,  but these are cheaper and it's for a one year old.  Avery saved the day!",4.0
Easy to use if you follow directions. Our shirts turned out great!,4.0
Very lightweight transfers for projects.,4.0
"Looked good, but did't wash as well as the black background kind. Also, watch out for tiny lint. Run a lint remover before ironing. You can see it if you look close enough.",4.0
"Good, but a little hard to peel off without ripping them.",4.0
Before you buy it make sure you have a inkjet printer and not a laser jet. As this paper only works with inkjet printers. The reason being is because the ink from an inkjet printer absorb into the sheet for better transfers as with a laser printer the print is only superficial and can wash out!,4.0
nice item,4.0
"overall good product. A little hard to peel backing off, and very vague instructions. But overall good quality print and looks good after applied",4.0
"Great product. Will definitely buy again. Easy to use; all you need is a program that can mirror your image. Was hoping to use the print and cut feature on my silhoutte, but it wouldn't cut through the shiny backing. So I offset my image and use those lines to guide my scissors and that worked wonderfully. I love this because the excess material that shows through is very incognito, just a slight shine. Happy Crafting!",4.0
it is what it is,4.0
Works pretty well as far as transfer paper goes.,4.0
They are easy to use. Addicting to print and hold-up well. Let the ink dry for 24 hrs before you go sweating in your shirt!,4.0
"This was great! HOWEVER, we had a lot of trouble with getting our printer to actually accept this paper. It got jammed almost every time we printed, then the ink that HAD printed got stuck inside the printer, and would leave ink spots on all the subsequent papers that went through it. We tried it on 2 printers, and eventually gave up. We did get a few good sheets out of it, but it was not as easy as it seemed. However, this might just be a problem with our printers, and not the paper. Also, its really cool cause Avery has a website that will create the template for you! All you have to do is upload your image, and it will flip it for you, and then you can adjust the size, position, etc.",4.0
"Used these to make custom shirts for a Disney on ice event that I attended and they worked perfectly. Took some getting used to at first with how long to leave the iron on and how to peel off without damaging the transfer, but they turned out good and it was pretty simple to do. There was not a noticeable line where the transfer ended and the shirt began so it looked less like an amateur job than other papers that I have used in the past. All in all I think that 4 shirts took me less than 15 minutes to complete. Great value for the price!",4.0
"received quickly,  works week.",4.0

"Pleasantly surprised, worked well",4.0
"The print quality was great, however I am not sure if the fault was with me, or the product, when it came to application.  The image I wanted to transfer to a tshirt was the entire sheet, so there was no trimming.  It took more effort (time and pressure) to get the sheet to transfer.  But overall, happy with the outcome.",4.0
Thank you very much.,4.0
Working well. Pricey though.,4.0
"I was really nervous about trying this. I made part of a 50's halloween costume and knew I only had one chance to get it right. Took me hours to get everything perfect before I transferred it but it turned out as good as I hoped. The apron was actually pretty easy to do but the hat gave me a little bit more problems with a couple parts not wanting to adhere. Probably due to it being a tighter space to work with. Don't plan on washing it since it's basically a one time thing, so I can't speak on the wash and wear part.
Overall I am happy with it.",4.0
"These sheets worked better than I expected on white t-shirts, and I have already washed them.  BUT, they didn't work on red t-shirts. I didn't realize this, but the background of these look white, but once ironed on, turn clear. So if you want to use a colored t-shirt, you have to have the entire image be printed in bright, opposite colors.",4.0
"We purchased these to make personalized shirts for a recent trip to Disney World. The instructions were easy to follow and the transfer came out great on the shirt. One tip: need to make sure you go over the transfer with the iron a lot. I was a little anxious for the first shirt and did not iron the edges as much as I should have and experienced some lifted corners. Otherwise, great product and looked great on the shirts.",4.0
"Smooth application, good quality. Only time will tell how well it lasts in the wash.",4.0
"Wish there was an easier way to ""label"" a quilt but this is better than embrodering the whole thing.",4.0

"I purchased these to make special Valentine's Day shirts for my stepchildren, husband, and myself.  After receiving the transfers I saw that it said not to have square corners.  I risked it and after paying a lot of attention to the corners with the iron it was fine.  DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT, put these on fabrics that have ANY stretch to them.  The minute the fabric stretches the transfer cracks.  My little girl's shirt will not make it to next year because of this.  My boys and husband's shirts were done on polos that are not completely flat so theirs have started to crack too.  Mine is the only one that has held up because the fabric is perfectly flat and has no stretch to it.  I would buy these again BUT I would be VERY careful what kind of fabric I put them on.  They were easy to use, easy to print on, easy to attach.  I'm rating it 4 stars because the listing information did not give all the information that came with the transfers and I would have chosen different shirts if I had known then what I know now.",4.0
Works fine in Cricut cutter but difficult to weed.,4.0
works great.  You have to put a lot of pressure on the iron.  The design started 'chipping' after a few (3-4) washes though.,4.0

Tricky if you don't read the directions.  I wasted 2 sheets trying to do a T-shirt.,4.0
Great transfer but the ink starts to peel off after a while. Be sure to iron the whole paper or else the ink will peel and make sure you prink the image flipped,4.0
Works really well on white clothing. Just remember to cut off as much of the unnecessary pieces and the iron is on high (no steam).,4.0
this was everything i hoped it to be. Its way cheaper at Walmart!,4.0
"Exactly as hoped!  I tie-dyed canvas bags and made iron on names for the kids.  Followed instructions exactly and they turned out great.  So far, the bags have been washed and dried 4 times and thrown around on the floor (they carry their toys in the car with them, they are really beat around).  The transfers have held and washed up nicely.
Only 4 stars because I haven't used them long enough to be able say 5.",4.0
"They work and are fairly easy to use, just watch out for bleeding of the ink when washing.  Wash separately the first time.",4.0
this is great to customize a lot of your stuff. I love how it turned out and there were detailed instructions. This is a little time consuming especially with multiple items. You may have some trouble with corners so try to make more simple shapes so it says and will not come off in the wash.,4.0
"I used this to make a t-shirt for a summer camp for me and my friends. READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS!!!! it says for only white, the first shirt i did was black. it didn't turn out.",4.0
"These transfers work well enough, they definitely print color well and transfer correctly. However the claim that any white printed out will just be removed after a wash or two is not true, you can clearly see what would be white on the light gray shirt I put it on. Also the claim that the printing paper left over after transfer would be removed completely after a couple washes and it would appear to only be ink was not fully true, if you stretch the shirt you can see the stretch marks where a bit of the paper is left over. Other than that, the shirt looks great and it would like 95% well. Functionally correct, but auxiliarily a few problems. Ohh and the package the paper was in was a bit damaged (dirty, cardboard was a bit bent, etc.) but nothing too major. Perhaps that could have caused the problems but I'm not sure. Either way, very good and I would tend to buy again.",4.0
These transfer sheets work good. Happy with the product.,4.0
It's more translucent than they depict. Tried to print gray for a pink chair and it looks brown. It was easy to use and the AVERY website is the best place to put whatever it is you're doing together. I tried using independent apps (mac) and none of them were as good as AVERY's,4.0
"I've made several custom items using these transfers. Overall, great stuff. The images do fade and crack with use, but that's to be expected.",4.0

You need to iron it for longer than the instructions stay to keep the print on.,4.0
Works well.,4.0
"I purchased this product in order to make shirts for my son's birthday party.  Overall, the shirts came out well, however, I cannot say how they will hold up during a wash as I don't plan to wash them before giving them out.

 It is obvious that the image is an iron on as you can see the white film if you print the full image (which is why I marked down---although I would rate it a 4.5 if I were able).

The directions were a little tricky as well, be sure to choose a mirror image unless you want to end up with a backwards print, of course I learned this the hard way (in haste).  I just went to the Avery site and selected the type of paper and printed it that way as I don't have the mirror option on my printer.

Lastly, the directions recommend that you don't use an ironing board, I did so, however I put s folder under the shirt for a harder surface.

I do recommend the product.

-------Update------

I purchased this product for the second time in order to make shirts for my sons and once again I am pleased.  This time I cut around the picture rather than leaving the picture rectangle shaped and the edges weren't as apparent as with my previous shirts.  This is definitely still my go to Transfer.  I can't account for whether or not the print will hold up in the wash considering the previous shirts that I made were party favors.  This time around I will have the opportunity to wash and I will update my review at that time.",4.0

"I bought these transfer sheets because I was going to a concert with my friend and we wanted to make our own t-shirts. I bought two 95% cotton 5% spandex shirts and we tried to make our shirts. Anyway, we did everything right, except washing the shirts, which i don't think made a big difference. We rounded the edges of our images, had a pillowcase set up and ironed the shirts more than enough, but both the shirts came out with ripped corners and a thin layer of the images. After washing them , not knowing they were already ruined, they got worse. They were cracked and just not wearable

About a week later I tried again with Russel exercise shirts I got at walmart. I believe they were 50% cotton and 50% polyester. I washed them before hand and cut them into the mussel t type shirt we wanted. THEY TURNED OUT GREAT. I really don't know what was different but each shirt had a vibrant, thick, sturdy image on it. I still have my t-shirt and I have washed and worn it numerous times and it still looks great

TIPS:
- I recommend washing your shirts. If not for the sheets not working better, than for sizing issues. I would recommend not using these sheets on skin tight shirts because it increases the chance of cracking and is just bad for the shirt.
- Also, if you think you have ironed enough, go back and do it again.
-Round the corners. This is very important

"Once I got the information on the paper setting for my inkjet printer it worked like a charm!!  I had to call Avery and they told me to call Cannon.  Hence the 4 star rating.  I feel they should have at least some idea other than to use ""T-Shirt mode"" or ""Inkjet paper""  about the paper setting you should use for the best possible chance of success.  After an hour on the phone with Cannon I finally got an answer - the Pro Platinum paper setting.  They also don't tell you in the instructions that you should wait at least an hour after you iron it on before you wash it.  A small detail but would be nice to have on the instructions anyway.",4.0
We used several different family photos and transferred them onto different pieces of cotton clothing. Each one worked perfectly. Just be sure you follow the direction exactly. We had not difficulties at all. The colors were vibrant and we didn't have any troubles with any of the transfers wanting to peel off.,4.0
"This worked nice for a simple image transfer. I used it to put my daughter's footprints on a shirt sleeve for a March of Dimes walk. It transferred easily and the image looked good, the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is because you could see the shiny part of the transfer material outside of the footprints, but that is probably to be expected, I suppose. Nice product and would recommend it.",4.0

"Cannot use on Black items, but worked well for white shirts and hats.  I used this for Chef hats on a contest and it was a hit.",4.0
I bought these to iron various sized designs onto white cotton aprons for both Halloween and  birthday presents. My only complaint is that while ironing on the design I had to keep the heat on the transfer for about twice as long as the instructions to ensure that it was completely transferred.  Overall these transfers worked as intended and were easy to use.,4.0
"I used these to create unique baby onesies for a friend's baby shower. You have to iron on longer than suggested. And longer than that, even. For a couple of the creations I went back over them after I tested a corner. it was worth it. I would rather experience a little distressing from too much heat than peeling the applique from not enough. I did end up with some distressed edges, but I thought it gave the piece an authentic look.

Be mindful of your design. The instructions offer this advice as well, I'll just second it. You don't want a ton of space between parts of the design. If you can keep it centralized to one section, that would be best.",4.0
I used these sheets to iron on some muslin bags that I sell. Compared to other transfer papers I've tried the transfer goes on quickly and cleanly. Some of my transfers accidentally turned out really yellow because I ironed them on too long. I also think they're a little expensive. I've found much cheaper options on ebay and other companies that aren't the Avery brandname,4.0
"I used these for custom t-shirts for my 2 nephews' birthday party.  Super easy to use and I was happy to not have to deal w/ a screen printer and their t-shirt minimums.  If your design is small enough and you have the software, print multiple imprints on each sheet.",4.0
"Great product, but the directions could have been more clear. I wasted a sheet of the paper trying to figure it out.",4.0
"Shirts came out great but not Amazing. There was a little yellow, possibly from over ironing, but I was a freak about following the directions and ironed on a low heat, just long enough to peel without over cooking them and I made 3 double sided shirts with no failures. The transfers work awesome. Make sure you cut all the way around the edge for easier peeling even if you cut off a millimeter, you want to cut the stock edge off. The colors were vibrant. Make sure your printer is on Best quality...you want the most ink possible. Cheapest way to make 3, two sided t-shirts. They are perfect for a one time thing. Its not like these are going to last a while baseball season or anything though.",4.0

"I realized I wanted to make a custom onesie for my son to wear at an engagement party. Sadly, I only came up with this idea 2 days before the party and it was too late to order one from a custom t-shirt website. I bought this hoping that the results would be acceptable. I made 4 onesies with 1 sheet of paper (cut it up in 4) and the results were very good. One of the designs I did ended up running a little in the wash. I'm not sure if this was because I didn't iron that one on long enough, or if it had to do with the design. 2 of the onesies came out really well though, looked like I had ordered them custom. Overall I was very pleased. And cost wise, this was much, much cheaper than ordering from a company and I was able to make the design exactly the way I wanted.

One important tip, if your design includes words, remember to print it out mirror image!",4.0
Read the directions on the ironing technique.  It is a bit of skill not to do too much.  Good results when your done.,4.0
"With digital cameras everywhere these days, and plenty of people with color inkjet printers at their disposal, this is a product a lot of people will find useful for gift ideas, to celebrate special events, or just come up with an image to wear that suits their fancy.

The usual cautions apply: you'll need to follow the directions carefully to get a decent print for transfer, and hopefully you'll have software on the computer hooked up to your inkjet printer that can let you flip the image so it will transfer right way round, adjust color intensity, add captions, etc. etc. If you've never done this before, be prepared to try a few sample prints on plain paper first before creating the transfer.

When you're ready to try putting your image onto cloth, again be prepared to experiment a little. Cotton, cotton blends, other fabrics, thread counts, iron settings, etc. can all affect the transfer from the paper to the fabric and how it looks. While the sheets are 8.5 by 11, there's no reason your image has to be that size. For practice you might want to try some small designs first - print them all out on one sheet, cut them into separate pieces, and try applying them individually for practice. This will save you from using up the whole pack 1 sheet at a time while you gain experience.

The other thing to remember is this can use up ink more quickly than you might imagine. Be sure to have spare cartridges on hand before getting started on a big project.",4.0
My friend and I used these to make customized t-shirts as party favors for her son's birthday party.  They were really easy to use and the t-shirts turned out great!  The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the colors ran a little in the wash.,4.0
"These are great! Easy to use and easy to transfer.

You do need to follow the recommendations ... i.e. use only on light cotton/poly blends or 100 percent cotton. Also be warned that the pattern is a bit stiff on the shirt (don't expect professional screen printing or direct-to-fabric printing results from this). but for quick, easy transfers on a small quantity of shirts (or other fabric item) these work great.

As an added bonus, like all similar avery products, you can use an on-line template to help produce your design. These work with both Windows and Macintosh computers and I always fine them very helpful.

Have fun!",4.0
"I love these transfers, because you can use them for any occasion. I used them for a children's birthday party. There are many templates available, but I went with my own Tea Cup theme and made shirts accordingly. Everything printed off correctly and easily. To do the transfer I purchased inexpensive tshirts and followed the directions. I sent each girl home with simple instructions to turn the tshirt inside out when washed. I have not washed the shirt a ton of times, because we have it hanging on my daughter's wall. But I think if you are having a family reunion, birthday party or even wedding celebrations, then this is less expensive then ordering tshirts and much more customizable. Love them!",4.0
"This was a very simple product to use, even for those like me that haven't picked up a clothes iron in over two years (took me twenty minutes to even find it).

No paper jams on the print out, the ink did not smear, and after ironing on the transfer the paper peeled off and the product looked great.  Whole process took less than ten minutes.  Follow the directions and there will be no problems.  Washed the shirt already, and the transfer still looks great.

Easy to use, works as advertised.",4.0
"Every year, I make t-shirts as Valentine's Day gifts for my kids. I do things like photos of their favorite pet, game or character from a tv show. Then I print it out on a transfer and iron it on.

This year, I used these Avery T-Shirt Transfers for my Ink Jet printer. The colors when printed are bright and lovely. I used the whole sheet on one shirt and cut out the design for the other.

The cut out one was easier to iron on, the edges being not to straight and exact. I found that once ironed it was simple to pull the backing off. When I tried to remove the backing from full sheet print, it messed up the edge more than once.

The colors are really bright and the sheen wasn't too slick. I find the ones that remain shiny aren't my favorite, as I want it to look less like a transfer and more like a print when done. So after 3 washings, I am not very pleased that the whole sheet transfer print is still stiff and kind of shiny. The partial sheet seems to be less so.

My children don't care and still wear the shirts. They love them and I know both will get a lot of wear and washing.",4.0
"The instructions were very clear and easy to follow. I tested this on a white t-shirt and was a bit disappointed in the results. The transfer yellowed, and I don't know what caused it. Maybe the iron was too hot, wondering if others experienced this? If you are looking for a longer lasting product, leave it to the professionals. The packaging says it is good for about 20 washings. This product would work great for a shirt that wouldn't be worn often, perhaps for a charity walk if you have a group of people and want to show your support for a cause, and possibly less expensive than what a professional would charge. Would also be good for a small company who may need a ""disposable"" shirt with a company logo, painting, or landscaping, etc. I think kids would also enjoy creating their own t-shirts with images of their choice! Overall, very good product.",4.0
"You need not be a designing master in order to fully tap the possibilities of Avery T-shirt transfers. Some patience and attention to detail are necessary, but with a minimum of skill, the product is primarily practical, fun, and rewarding.

You must follow the directions included.  DO NOT use an IRONING BOARD; press the iron on the t-shirt, reinforced with a smoothly ironed pillow case on a hard surface for three minutes--with twenty-second intervals at first left-to-right, then up-and-down.  DO NOT USE WATER OR STEAM.

Besides these warnings, the instruction sheet provided will give you a list of Avery websites and links to click in order to find the right T-shirt transfer.  Get the right one that includes t-shirt transfers.  Otherwise, you'll be toggling around blindly getting business cards, labels, or other products, but nothing for T-shirts.  ""Avery Design Pro"" is about the fourth download option, and it worked just fine as a download to my Windows XP system.  Do some searching, but getting the right product is not a big deal.  You will be given a list; click or highlight it; and it will be chosen into the right-hand column.

You may need some additional advice, though.  They provide holiday and other generic, clip-art type designs.  All you have to do is find the right tools on the left, add a new shape or delete any generic shape given; then upload an image (picture, etc.) from your computer; and you will have a favorite picture or design ready for a t-shirt.  Like MS Paint has a text bar option, you will also be able to add a caption to your picture.  Make sure you preview the print, and place the product insignia on top of your paper in your printer tray. (It prints on the opposite side, which sometimes can be counter-intuitive.)  My print preview didn't indicate that my t-shirt print would be cut off at the caption, so make sure you put your words up a bit on the picture of the page.  (Two inches from the bottom should be the lowest you place your text [ie the picture caption.])

I made two other mistakes I should mention to (hopefully) help you with your projects:  Do not use any other color than white.  My color t-shirts mixed with the transfer and made my t-shirt too (eg red) for display.  Also, don't try to put one design on the front and another on the back.  It will bleed or make the first design you ironed on the shirt look molten.

Despite some caveats and a bit of trial-and-error, I still believe the product is fun to use and has great creative appeal.  (Six transfers are included.  I had two that worked great; two were mediocre; and two were fair to poor.  If you follow the instructions and my advice, you will do far better than I did.)  Enjoy. ;>) JP",4.0
"It works.  It's easy to use.

I cropped a picture of my dog.  I printed this picture using a Canon MX870 on a transfer sheet.  I transferred the picture on a white cotton shirt using the hottest setting on the iron and with no steam.  The transfer went smoothly, and I made a similar shirt for my daughter.  No problems.  I wasn't expecting designer-level quality, and it is good enough for what I wanted it for.  Some documentation/instructions would have helped, but not necessary since the process is relatively straightforward.

It works.  What else can I say?!",4.0
"This transfers are certainly easy to use although a certain attention to detail is recommended.  My Canon MP610 has a print mode for transfers and that has to be selected to get a good print.  The iron should be on maximum heat and the steam shut off during the transfer process.  That process works easy enough, and the results are certainly presentable.  My print bleed a little bit after the first wash but was still acceptable.  Before buying this product, I would suggest to print out the picture on a regular page, cut it out and place it against the t-shirt.  8""  11"" is relatively small on an adult chest!  All things being equal, a good product for quick, funny t-shirt creation.  I am not sure if I were to go professional with it, though.",4.0
"I do a lot of crafting, particularly stenciling with fabric paint to create screen-printed looks on shirts. So when i saw this new paper designed for ink jet printed t-shirt transfers, i knew i had to try it out.
The paper is easy to use - just find your image, flip it, and print it! You have to make sure to cut a small margin around your image (like the directions say!) and iron it the way the directions indicate, and you'll get a great final product.
My only qualm with the paper is that it does feel like a standard iron-on; a little crispy and crunchy even after washing the shirt. It also cracks and looks worn-out sooner than using stencils and fabric paint. However, due to how EASY this product is to use, i think the negatives are worth it. I will definitely be using this product again in the future!",4.0
"A few years ago, I bought a similar product to this (also by Avery, but no longer made) - and it was TERRIBLE.  You washed the t-shirt once, and the image faded - two or three washes and it was gone.  I see they have improved that product line considerably, because...

THESE are MUCH better!  After a couple of washes, the t-shirt images still look pretty good.  So these are perfect, as long as you don't intend to use them on a shirt that will be washed a LOT -- i.e., a sports team's regular shirts.  For that, still go to a professional screen printer.

But if you just want them for a fun event or a shirt that will be washed occasionally (and gently), these are awesome!",4.0
"If you follow the instructions very carefully, you can really get great results with these T-shirt transfers.  They work great for light colored fabrics.  Use them for T-shirts, tote bags, pillows, etc.  I like the versatility of these, and the best part is that you can print out any image you want, the possibilities are endless.  Good quality, would recommend.",4.0
"I did a t-shirt for a friend. He wears it nearly every day and washes it as often. The colors have faded a little, but the image is still really nice, nicer than the shirt itself. I was really surprised at how well it washes.
The first one I did came out perfectly, then I messed up the next two. You really need to follow the directions exactly and make sure the transfer is evenly hot as you peel it off. You have to remember to mirror print your design so it comes out right on your fabric. Using the transfer on really like fabric, like white or light yellow, works best.
I love these transfers, they are really fun. I'm going to make a memory quilt with white photo sections, I also put my grandsons image on his nursery school blanket sack.",4.0

When I wrote back that this would be difficult because we had already given the crayons to our local school, the seller replied that he would refund us a 10% discount on the purchase.

I did not rate the product four stars because both my wife and I were also under the impression that we would receive individual boxes of crayons, each box containing the 16 various colors.  This would have made distribution to the students easy.  Instead, the large box we received was divided into sections, each section containing crayons of the same color.  To distribute the crayons, the teacher would have to take one color from each section and insert it into his/her own container before distributing the containers to the individual students.",4.0

"In my opinion the sticky adhesive side isn't as sticky as I imagined it would be based on the description. I've had other ""industrial strength"" Velcro that had, better, stickier, adhesive on the back. I suppose it makes a big difference what you're trying to stick it to... I used it on smooth plastic to stick a USB camera to my monitor. I think it might have worked eventually. I DID let it dry... That said, I doubt the adhesive would hold up to repeated stress. When I say stress I mean pulling the Velcro apart. I am afraid to test it... I think it'd work better on a rougher, or, more textured surface, maybe.",4.0

The lid of the cooler is normal cooler plastic (not roto-molded). The adhesive holds the two pieces together very well so far. Only time will tell how long the grip will last.",4.0

I purchased this strap to carry a porch mat when taking trips to outdoor event like picnics or 'movies in the park' or outdoor concerts.  The mat is large but folds up and is about 4ft tall and 1ft and 12in in dimensions wide.  For some reason I thought this could be carried over my shoulder but in reviewing the pictures it only has a handle designed to carry it.  The only problem with the strap is that it is designed to carry wider objects. The strap is too short to fit around my mat the long way and the connecting velcro makes is too long to wrap around the short way.  I had to tie and tuck to connect the end of the strap.  I hope that makes sense. Basically the strap doesn't match the measurements of my mat folded up.,4.0

"These are exactly as promised, and seem to hold up well.

My only criticism is that the ""male"" portion of the velcro is limited to the last two inches of the strap - you cannot secure the velcro just anywhere.  In my application, this is OK, but this might make them less than ideal in a circumstance where you want to secure them at a length less than the full 18 inches.",4.0

"These guys are fantastic for the anal retentive motorcyclist like myself.  I have hard saddle bags for my motorcycle that I don't like to use because it's harder to swing the leg over them when getting on and off.  Hard bags also take away from the bike's lines so I started thinking of ways to use my ""Helmet carrier"" which doubles as a backpack too.  The backpack had side loops designed for connecting like this.  I'm not a big fan of wearing the backpack because it raises your center of gravity so I used these little buggers to tie it nice and neatly to the rear of my seat / grab rails on side and back.  Now the helmet pack doubles as my small carrier bag and has the added benefit of blocking wind from pushing the back of my shirt up while riding down the highway.

"Worked well for my bass guitar pedal board project. Cut, peeled the back off, stuck on the wood and the bottom of the pedals and good to go! One box took care of both rows of pedals on my board. Just the right amount. Wish the peel off backing stuck out a little farther so it was easier to grab with my big old fingers. But that may have increased the manufacturing costs if this is cut in strips from a larger roll.",4.0
"The actual Velcro itself is VERY strong, BUT the adhesive on the back could use some help. It really depends on the surface your applying it too! Works excellent on metal surfaces not so great on plastic ones. To correct this issue I just used crazy glue on the plastic surface. But like I said before the Velcro is very strong I don't think you'll be disappointed at all with that.",4.0

I purchased this particular Velcro twice now it does a nice job; however I do find a have to replace yearly as the stickiness on the back tends to wear off and doesn't hold as well. I must say I do use this in a barn setting where there is a variety humidity and temperature it is exposed too. Overall I am happy with it and will continue to buy this particular velcro year after year as replacing yearly isn't that big of a deal to me.,4.0
Used to hang pictures on walls and they don't come off. Might even pull some wall off when I need to take pictures down. Used for straps on dog kennel cover outside and held up to strong winds. Good reliable and strong... Will keep using.,4.0
"A good product. I used it in modifying my Element to a mini-camper. I put up power bar, cell phone lantern. and insulation. It worked great - until the temperature dropped to about 35 F. Then every thing on metal or smooth plastic just dropped off. It seems the adhesive fails at low temperatures.",4.0
Good quality.,4.0
"really strong adhesive! I wish it came with some lines in the back for cutting to certain lengths, but I made do with some approximations.",4.0

Sticks great to the wall.  It did not stick well to fabric though.  Not sure if it was meant to or not.,4.0
"I bought this product for attaching my sofa cushions to my couch so they would stop sliding off, I think it might have worked except for the fact my husband pulled it apart and it never stuck again after that.
They are super strong however and I have been using them all over my house to use up the extra I have.

I've been cutting the strip down into really small pieces and having a blast organizing.

They work much better then command strip sold at Target or Walmart, Much Stronger hold.",4.0

"Handy stuff to have around.  I used a 2 inch piece to create a place to attach my golf glove on the side of my golf bag, and another on my bag cart.

"The Velcro is super sticky, like hard to pull apart but the adhesive on the back of the Velcro not so much.

"exactly what I was looking for, I still have over 3' left, but honestly given the price, I went with it for the small feature I wanted. Backing is hard to get off (a little) when cut with scissors, but I am sure a tuck on the corner will remedy (as it did the last piece I tried). 100's of uses, and def covered the 2 uses I wanted it to do.",4.0

"I used this to secure a pair of speakers to stands. I didn't want to have to drill into the speakers and risk changing the sound, so I just went with a velcro option.

Overall it works, but I was hoping that it would be a little bit stronger at least.",4.0
Not as industrial as I though. Buy not bad.,4.0
love that the Velcro sticks together just perfect not sure about the sticky back. It needs reinforcement by either sawing it which i probably won't do or a lot of supper glue,4.0

AS advertised,4.0
"I bought this for various projects. One of the first ones I tried was to put a strip of velcro on the back of a 'holster' for a Fenix flashlight, and the other piece inside my backpack so my flashlight won't be swimming around in the pack. Both the pack and light are brand new, the pack is made of a thin, ripstop nylon fabric, typical of all day packs.. The flashlight holster is also of typical material, and is a synthetic fiber.

The velcro is a lot stronger than the adhesive. I'm disappointed that I will have to sew these in place or they will come off the moment I attempt to separate the two items. I don't understand why they would make 'industrial strength' velcro with sub standard adhesive. I'd easily pay an extra couple dollars for industrial strength adhesive. You should probably plan on needing to sew these in, and maybe you'll get lucky and won't have to for your particular application. My wife is laughing at me now since I have to learn how to sew for the first time. I guess that's an unintended benefit.

Update - After letting the velcro sit and 'cure' for a couple of days, the strip that is in the backpack is fine as is. I won't need to re-enforce that by sewing. However the flashlight holster still needed some major attention. I have a hot glue gun and using a fresh piece of velcro, I essentially welded the velcro in place. I don't think it's going to un peel now. I still think the tape should be a lot stronger, but you can probably make it work if you get a little creative.",4.0
"I bought these to use on my license plate (and frame). There were already light scratches from plastic dealer frame used to hold the paper temporary plate so I knew I needed to get something to secure it. I am glad I decided on Velcro because it had an extra benefit I didn't think of until I started installing it...

The main purpose I was using this for was to keep the bottom part of the plate from moving (as my BRZ doesn't have the bottom 2 screw holes, only the top 2). So I put the hook (spikey) side on rubber strips already on the car meant to protect the back area from the plate scratching (didn't work) and the soft side on the bottom of the plate to make sure it did not move while driving. But then I noticed the top part of the plate was against the car so I wanted to prevent scratching their as well. That is when I thought to cover the top of the plate with more of the soft side to prevent this.

I think this is better than say, double sided 3M tape because I can still remove the plate from the car during washes (whereas that would involve removing the tape otherwise). I am unsure of how it will hold up in the weather but all I really need it to do is hold on enough to prevent the plate and frame from doing any more damage and so far it has done it's job.

I haven't used the rest for anything else yet, will update review when I can think of other things to do with it.",4.0
These are working as advertised. I was even able to pull them off and recenter them on the plasitic table I needed them for.,4.0
"I use this for so many things.

Keeping datebook/calendar book closed",4.0
I hoped it would be double sided but thats what I get for not reading the description. Strong grip with strong adhesive on the back.,4.0
I'd have more to review but my father stole it for a project so I didn't get to use it.,4.0
"Just not to leather and fabric as other reviewers noted; still in the process of assembling the project but the velcro is super strong and will work when completed.

P.S. were sticking it to couch cushions and a glue gun WONT workyou will have to sew the strips or find some other method to adhere the velcro to your desired surface.",4.0
"Very strong velcro.  One of the strongest I have used.  Need it to use on a shirt.  Problem is, that it does not adhere well to fabric.  I has to improvise to make it work.  Being that it is thick, I did get it to work well for my use making some modifications.",4.0

"So this definitely has a weird smell to it, which is okay for my use (holding stuff to my walls), but might be a problem if you're using it on something that would be near someone's face.  The adhesive seems decent, and the velcro sticks to itself VERY well.",4.0
"Good product giving the user more flexibility. They can be cut to size and at 2"" wide will work well for whatever use you may conjure up.",4.0
"Some plastics I have tried, this will not work with.  Other than that, a great product, I use it for sticking remotes to my couch (so we don't lose them) as well as speaker amplifiers to my desk and posters to my wall.",4.0
"Very sticky.  I used most of the pack on my project and it worked fine.  You have to wonder if this is really ""industrial"".  Have you ever gotten a little Velcro with your E-ZPass (highway toll) transponder.  That's what I call industrial, but I doubt you could get this much for the same price.",4.0
"this product appears to be heavy duty for my use, however I have not yet used it. I expect it to be useful for my project.",4.0
"I use these around the house and at work. I prefer Velcro than to have holes in my walls. When you remove them from the wall they do take some paint with it, but nothing a little touch up paint won't cure.",4.0
"I was tasked with how to attach solar lighting to our deck without being hard fixed to the posts - why not velcro? Works like a charm.  I've used this stuff indoors for all sorts of applications & the adhesive seems to work well.  Using it outdoors (which is not it's intended use) required using staples to ensure it stayed put.  Even the adhesive has held outside to the lighting - I wasn't sure if it would work but it has done really well.  It's been over a year & the adhesive hasn't given up, which is pretty surprising since it's been exposed to the elements & degraded by UV light & still hasn't given up.

Everyone should have this stuff around the house - if you have it, you'll find innovative ways it can be used to solve simple challenges (like attaching a remote to the back of a stereo alarm clock so it's always right there when you need it). Solid product & would be 5 stars for me if it was priced a little more competitively.",4.0
This roll of velcro is nothing short of amazing. Just cut to size and apply to object w/ adhesive backing. Seems to hold reasonably heavy objects very well. Would recommend highly.,4.0
Love that this paint is washable!  Crayola is a very good brand and this is a nice sized bottle.,4.0
I got this for a college art class. Other students had tempera paint as well but the paint they had did not have such a strong smell. Only smells when wet. Otherwise good paint.,4.0
These paints have good color for washable paints. There is a bit of an odor when wet that I do not like. I am not sure if it is harmful and it goes away when it is dry. Check the size bottles when shopping for the best price so you know what your getting. I ordered singles and a three pack and the three pack was smaller bottles. I had not paid much attention! Happy Painting child in my house... Momma happy it cleans up off the wood floors...even when it has dried.,4.0
The bottle is much bigger than it appears on screen.  I'm set for life with this particular paint color.  It's is so true.,4.0

"The paper product is good... clean, bright, white...just what i ordered.  The only down side (which is why i rated it at 4 stars) is the condition it was in when it arrived.  The paper roll looked as if it was rolled by hand, i mean it is not bad looking, but the sides were not flush.  Normally when a machine rolls paper, or at least cuts it, the sides are flush.  When packed in the shipping container, the roll of paper must have jostled back and forth a bit compressing and wrinkling the very ends of the roll.  The rest of the roll is fine.  Other than that, good product.",4.0

Once you get it up though, it lasts all year long. Definitely fadeless.",4.0

"This is listed as having a smooth side and a rough side. It does, but they are of differing quality.

The rough side, is about the texture of typical construction paper, and is very even in appearance.
The smooth side, is a polished surface, but the appearance is not even.  There are streaks through it. If you've ever seen a concrete wall which was poured with wood planks as supports, and leaves the grain in the concrete; it looks like that but smooth. It's like black-on-black wood grain.
-If you need a matte finish for background, the ""rough"" side is great. (it's not very rough)
-If you want semi-gloss, the smooth side is a bit uneven, unless you're covering it up with loads of other items.
-It's listed as heavyweight. It's about the thickness of typical inkjet paper, not butcher or packing paper.
-It's not flimsy/fall-apart like construction paper, so it holds up reasonably well to folding. Tears nice along a fold, both directions.
For chalk, consider some chalkboard spraypaint instead.

4/5 because of the smooth side.",4.0

I'd like to give it 4 1/2 stars but can't figure out how!,4.0
"Background: I needed some black paper to decorate the office for halloween.

"Great product. The perfect height for a bulletin board--it fits my standard boards in my classroom so that only one strip of paper is needed to go across (no more seams if I use the big rolls of butcher paper my school buys!). Haven't had it long enough to test if it fades or not. The only thing I was bummed about was that it is white on the other side. So if you have a stapler that isn't as quality as you'd like, and the staples tear it a little, the white can show through. Staple carefully, and you'll have no problems! :) I'm pleased with my purchase.",4.0

Came a little wrinkled and had to throw away about the first 15 feet.,4.0

I didn't pay attention to the measurements. So not what I was expecting. The paper is a bit thinner then I like for wrapping gifts.

"This is a standard butcher paper roll that feels familiar from use in grade school (many, many years ago). Reasonable quality but is not what you would consider high quality either. What you pay for is what you get this this case.

Bottom Line: I Bought this paper to be used as wrapping paper, now I fear that I'll be wrapping gifts till end of time with this paper since the roll is huge! It worked fine for my purpose, but since it is a bit see through, there is some limitations to its overall usefulness.",4.0
It's only black on one side. I made it work in my favor but would have been nice to know.  Perhaps a pic of it slightly unrolled showing this?,4.0
My grandson needed this special paper for designing and cutting clothing pattern. He didn't want anything but this. I think he has a wish list  on Amazon. we both enjoy shopping...........Thank you,4.0
"did the job just fine but I probably could have gotten by with not buying this whole roll.. I hadn't realized how available this type of product is.. in craft stores. But, this worked well at our wine tasting party, we put in on the table tops and wrote in white sharpie ink the types of cheeses on the platters",4.0

"This is awesome. Used for table cover for kid party and adult party. Looked great with Teenage Mutant Ninja turtle dcor and with my silver serving pieces and Valentines dcor at the adult party. I also bought the liquid chalk neon marker pen and drew hearts, designs, and wrote the menu on the paper. Wish I had a picture!",4.0
"I used it as check paper type, wrote names with white pen. Will have enough for my lifetime! Heavy weight nice paper but a lot on a roll because it is so wide",4.0
I am using this as a photo background & it works very week!  My only complaint is the color is more green than teal.,4.0
"The paper worked well for our project but could be a little thin for folks who need a sturdier paper.  Also, it is white on the back side.  That did not cause us a problem, but might matter to someone else.",4.0
"I like that it's black on the one side and white on the other (more a very light gray actually). It will bend or wrinkle much more quickly than real backdrop, but for the price you can't really complain much!",4.0
This is a huge roll of paper!  It's supposed to have a textured side but I can't really tell the difference.  I painted it with watercolors and used it to wrap Christmas gifts.  You can still see through the paper but my crappy watercolor painting was enough of a distraction that no one really noticed.,4.0
"The paper wasn't as heavy as I expected it to be, but was OK--it wasn't superthin. Color was what I expected.",4.0
Good Paper!,4.0
I've used this paper to do some object and product shots and it works great. I wish it was a tad thicker but for the price I can't complain. Don't use it on a soft surface or it will wrinkle or tear but that is normal for all paper backgrounds. I like it  so much I plan to buy a black one for photography. I imagine it makes great art  paper for drawing too.,4.0
Worked well for the project that I had planned for it - making targets for patterning a shotgun.,4.0
"Prompt shipment, arrived sooner than expected.  Unfortunately, the paper is a very dark brown, not the lighter color that you see on the website.  Be careful when selecting colors without actually having seen a sample, you may be surprised as well.  Other than that, the quality of the paper is as described.",4.0
"The grey color has a bit of a blue hue to it, but it's not very noticeable. We are using the paper to create a racetrack and it works great!",4.0
"It was a little bit thinner than we had expected. I am a teacher and I know that our school uses a thicker butcher paper. However, it was perfect for our last-minute purchase in being used for our VBS decorations for church!",4.0
looked more yellow in person than pictured but the paper itself is durable and thick for our use. arrived quickly.,4.0
Man this paper delivered for me.  I used it to blot out the sun passing thru a huge picture window and it worked exactly as I had hoped.  I connected it to a PVC pipe frame and delivered the blackout without causing any issue or harm to the painted walls or glass.,4.0
This paper is good quality and I will use it for many projects I have in mind.  Arrive on time with no damage.,4.0
"High quality paper and it shipped super fast!  Going to use this as a table ""cloth"" for our wedding where our guests and draw and color on it!",4.0
"I gave this product a 4 of 5 because, in actuality, the color is much lighter than pictured.  Weight of paper is just what I was looking for.  If your have flexibility when it comes to shade, it's a  great product!",4.0
"Good weight, nice and smooth on one side and some tooth on the other.  Just right for what we needed, and lots of it.",4.0
"It seems like there are some bad reviews because people didn't realize how big this roll is. Folks, it is FOUR FEET TALL and 200 feet long. Yes, that means it is big and heavy! Keep that in mind before you order.

I bought the red paper and I think it is plenty thick enough, but if you are expecting something like cardstock, it is definitely not that thick. Reminds me of the butcher paper used to make signs in high school for the sports games and school spirit. I'm using it to wrap presents (for the next decade I think! This roll is HUGE). There is a rough and smooth side and as noted by other reviewers, the rough is approximately like construction paper texture (but not as thick as construction paper). Smooth side is slightly glossy on the red paper. I am using Elmer's Painter's Opaque White marker to draw on the rough side of the paper and it works great! I like how it turns out. My only complaint is that Scotch tape doesn't hold things together very well. After a while it comes apart.

Some other reviewers mentioned...
 - Streaks on the smooth side (but he was talking about the black one), which I don't see in the red paper.
 - Wavy appearance as if exposed to moisture (I think he got a bad roll!), my paper was totally straight
 - See-through. Maybe that's only for the white paper because the red is totally opaque.
 - Doesn't come on a core like photo shows. Well yes, it doesn't come on a cardboard core, but the photos don't show it does!",4.0
"Paper worked great to cover a garage so that my granddaughter could have a glow paint party for her 13th birthday.  The kids had a great time, and the paper with black lights made the paint glow in the dark.",4.0
It was a good weight to make patterns for plywood cutouts.  It erased easily when I needed to make changes.  It was receptive to both pencil and permanent marker.,4.0
I'm using this paper as a neutral backdrop for photos of our products.  It's a bit thin so use double sheets but then reuse it as packing paper.,4.0
"I use this to cover the windows in my warehouse.  I was originally going to order mini-blinds but that would set me back about $1000 to cover all the windows.  I decided to use this product instead.

For my application, even though this product is somewhat thin, you cannot see through it, even with light shining on it from the opposite side.  The light shows through the duct tape much more than this paper.

Light does come through to some degree as the black paper shows up as opaque in my surveillance cameras, but black in person.  But looking from outside in, it does act as a nice privacy screen.

It is very easy to cut.  I roll out as much as I need, mark and cut with a utility knife.  A utility knife is best, since the blades will wear out quickly, cutting over a concrete floor.  Using scissors will prove inaccurate and slow.",4.0
was great for gift wrapping though its a little see through. I plan on using the rest for drawing paper for my kids.,4.0
got this to help do posters for a friends b-day.  great quality and way cheaper than buy indiviual sheets of poster board.,4.0
"I needed to create a large sign to ask someone to a prom.  I cut this down into 3 equally-sized sheets, and taped them together.  It was so close to being a disaster that it worked.

I would use this paper to cover an arts & crafts table in a kid's room, or to make cheap signs.  Note that it's not very thick, so it won' stop heavy paint from bleeding through.",4.0
I ordered this for its ability to bleed and it did this well. A good value.,4.0
"I like this paper, and it serves my needs well for making patterns for woodworking, drawing out designs full-scale, and to protect surfaces from paint or dust when I am staining, finishing, or sanding.  I would call it ""medium"" weight, although I am not a connoisseur of paper distinctions.  It is strong enough to handle the use that I put it to in the woodshop.  It doesn't snag or tear easily on the sharp corners of wood or tools.  Nor is it too stiff for my general use, as really heavy-weight paper sometimes is.  It works well for me, and I wonder if I even got the same product as the reviewer who gave it only one star.  This seems like a good, medium-weight product to me, at a good price.",4.0
I was very pleased with the weight and the difference of texture on each side. Suitable for a workshop project on glass.,4.0
"I was looking for black kraft paper to use as dustcovers on the back of my paintings and they were all very expensive especially by the time you paid to have it shipped. Amazon had this one and it works great! I would also like to find it in the 24"" width/roll. If you need a heavy weight kraft paper, this one will not disappoint!",4.0
"My only complaint about this roll is that it is not Heavy weight at all! It is very thin but it works for what I bought for (finger paints and coloring), so i am giving it 4 stars.",4.0
"Ordering blind is always tough, but this roll of paper didn't disappoint.  It was as I expected, with a decent weight/thickness, and was delivered quickly.  Needed it for my daughter's first slumber party to block out the sunlight from our family room windows.  Worked perfectly.",4.0
"The paper was shipped very fast and was exactly what I wanted.
You could see through it a little when wrapping boxes that had something printed on them. Will work great for kid's projects.",4.0
Nice quality tissue paper for the price. Many colors! Worked great for Christmas gift bags.,4.0
good,4.0
"These would be more convenient if they were organized like a pack of construction paper. Instead it's like 4 sets of rainbow colors. For example, if there were only 3 sheets of 3 colors, they're packaged like: red, orange, yellow/ red, orange, yellow/ red, orange, yellow. Red, red, red/ orange, orange, orange/ yellow, yellow, yellow would make it easier to find the color you're looking for. FYI, compared to the Hallmark tissue paper, they're half the size or less. But that works well for positioning it how you want &/or tiny gift bags & boxes. Would buy again, overall- not a bad price.",4.0
"I was under the impression this was a pack of tissue paper for gifting, but it is just small sheets. Luckily it still worked out for my project!",4.0
Beautiful colors. Note: these aren't suitable for wrapping shirts or other clothes- they are cut small.,4.0
"Nice tissue paper. A bit pricey, but nice to have a stack on hand",4.0
"Perfect size tissue paper and many, many colors. A little thicker than some tissue papers you get in packages, so it doesn't rip or tear as easy, which I like.",4.0
Good buy for the money.  Colors bleed well!,4.0
Not sure why but I do not like these very much. I think it may just be the colors. Not crisp and clean looking. Still if you have projects they would be fine. I was trying for gift wrap.,4.0
Nice assortment and for a good price.,4.0
"I didn't know they were smaller, I thought each color folded out but that's my bad.

I gave a 4 star for the way they're packaged;
They are not packaged like the picture shows. Instead of one rainbow inside, there are 3. So I had to find the specific colors I wanted in the separate areas, flipping through each tissue (since I wanted to leave it in the wrapper). Then, every time I took one out, the ones beside it would come out so I had 5 to 7 tissues come out at once. It was frustrating but I got the hang of it.

So if you don't mind all the colors not being together, or don't mind putting in a bit of work taking them out, or if you have somewhere to store these, it's a good buy.

Just make sure to look at the size of these things first.",4.0
I wish Id have read the question section before I ordered because nowhere in the description does it say it is bleeding art paper but it does say it on the package. I bought these to wrap art projects in and cannot use them because I don't want the color to come off on the projects. I am sure it works great for the right uses.,4.0
"these sheets are bright and vibrant.  looking forward to doing canvas art with my 6 and 3yo with them.  the sheets are much bigger than what i thought they would be, so that is always a plus.  hoping the art turns out great and isn't a Pinterest fail.",4.0
Good tissue paper and good color assortment. Some of the lighter colors are pretty translucent though and there is only a very light purple color.,4.0
"Used these for a silk scarf dying project and they worked very well.  Some colors didn't translate the same once the water was applied, but otherwise everyone was pleased with how things worked out.",4.0
It was fun playing with this product. It'll be fun using it with some of my friends children,4.0
I've had fun using this paper to make tie dyed silk scarves.  Works better when you put the smooth side up before wetting the paper.,4.0
Nice and very vibrant colors.,4.0
So many fun projects this bleeding tissue can be used for though a bit spendy for 100 sheets.,4.0
"Colorful, manageable sized sheets of tissue paper. Perfect size for stuffing in a gift bag.",4.0
"My kiddos are always crafting. ALWAYS. This bleeding tissue paper has been fun. We have done a few projects, and I can't wait until the weather straightens up so they can go back outside to use the stuff. It makes a huge mess when the ink bleeds (like it is supposed to), but trying to get it off of the table and floor (Pergo) can be a bit of a challenge. I think it will be fun to color our pavers this spring. The bleeding paper will produce beautiful colors. I have no doubt.",4.0
"Be forewarned, this is the kind of tissue paper that ""color bleeds!"" I ordered this to use to wrap soap and other gifts for a big gift exchange. I didn't read the comments first and see it was the bleed through kind, so I recommend the seller puts this in the description.",4.0
"The sheets are a little smaller than most sheets I've had, but that's what I get for the price. Great for wrapping smaller packages though! and Great for stuffing gift bags!",4.0
Best color assortment I could find anywhere! Good quality paper. Used them to make paper flowers and poms and was very happy with the result.,4.0
It was perfect for the gift bags I needed to prepare for Father'day.,4.0
Tissue paper is perfect for art projects.  My only suggestion is to package the like colors together.  A bit cumbersome trying to pull out all the yellows that were intertwined among the rest of the colors. Kids end up making a mess. Not packaged like the picture. That would have been perfect.,4.0
Nice large size.,4.0
Nice variety,4.0
Wish it had more colors,4.0
"This is a lovely size, thickness and the color selection is marvelous.  I'd have given it 5 stars BUT it was a real pain to get the colors together and I was shorted several sheets.  Not a really big deal as I'll probably never use up what I have, still it took a long time to go through matching the colors so they were all together.  If there had been a 1/2 star this would have gotten 4 1/2 stars.  ~~ deb",4.0

"Pretty colors!  This was a pretty good buy, although the sheets seem a little smaller than the average tissue sheets.  All in all, though, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase!",4.0
This paper is good but it was not what I was looking for.  Its the kind that bleeds when wet and I didn't realize it when I bought it but the teachers at my school absolutely love this paper.,4.0
Awesome paper it was very easy to use for the project I needed it for.  The size was great. I was very happy with it.,4.0
Good variety of colors and the paper was nice and strong. This is important if you are using it with kid's crafts as I am.,4.0
"I bought these so that I could make tissue paper pom poms. Due to the smaller size, I was only able to make medium sized mums, which was fine, but I had to buy bigger paper as well.",4.0
My wife's birthday is the 26th and this year I went all out and purchased a small gift for each day preceding. So to wrap them I used the 25 different colors to give each present it's own color. I had thought the sheets would be bigger but I made it work. In case your wondering her presents for the 26th have rainbow tissue procured locally.,4.0

My 11yo budding artist loves them. Says they work well and are easy to use.,4.0
"A printed box from a familiar brand of manufacturer. A slim box with a slide out cardboard tray of 28 colors. They are AP certified non-toxic and not recommended for children under 36 months (as printed on the box, see photo).
A nice offering of colors and shades in a small set. Oil crayons are hexagonal and will not roll off the working table. These feel solid to handle and are of a generous size compared to most child-audience art brands.

I have included a color chart and some color tests with this review.
Among the colors, a metallic silver and metallic gold are included. While the silver looks more like aluminum, the gold looks brassy and on the green side.

At the top of the color chart I used the teal color as a base, then used the white on the left side and the black on the right side. The white was pretty decent and I was able to blend out the color of the teal further to the left as I went along.

The black is really opaque and virtually blotted out most of the teal color so I put down a light layer of the teal to illustrate a very dark shade.

I laid purple down first and then yellow to meet in the middle for a 'neutral' color. Having put the yellow down second dragged bits of the purple across into the yellow area. There is also 'crumbs'.
(Thankfully these crumbs are not easily airborne nor do not all easily fall off the working surface even when blown onto. I also have trouble imagining the bits getting easily inhaled.)

I then applied yellow first, and the purple last. That was better and any yellow dragged over to the purple side wasn't too obvious unless there was a close-up inspection.

I put down a long swatch of what I would consider the navy blue in the set, then sampled it with Sakura brand colorless extenders and two different white pastels--the set's own white, and Junior Artist white. The set's own white was pretty good with coverage and blending.

These were really quite easy to use and needed very little pressure to put color down. Layering over the same color did not pose too many problems but putting down thicker layers with heavier pressure did. Colors can be pushed out from under the pastel when heavy pressure and/or too much color is laid down or become muddied and uneven. Layering different colors atop one another might need pre-thought out strategy to prevent color drag.
Blending color can be easily obtained with a variety of techniques/items.

Usage of these colors did not bleed any oily remnants through the sketchbook page, nor out around the swatches.
I would not use them for adult coloring books as colors easily rub onto the page above.

I would buy these with confidence for a child.",4.0

It's smooth and helps me to easily have great pictures. My children are my favorite life's posers. It made the tree come to life.,4.0
I don't know if it's my daughter or the crayons but most of these broke fairly quickly. The colors are great though.,4.0

My 5 year old daughter loves these oil crayons.  The colors are vibrant and look great on construction paper.  I gave them 4 stars because they are oil crayons which means they're messy!  The colors are so nice though  and I enjoy when we color using them.  I would recommend for anyone who loves art.,4.0

A good product for older kids. A little difficult for them but I like them!,4.0

Haven't tried them yet expect Crayola quality,4.0
very nice,4.0
"I really like these oil pastels, for the price. Are there others that blend more nicely? Of course. But these are well pigmented, and consistently smooth. They're non-toxic and cheap enough that I have no problem letting my 18 month old son use them, and he prefers them to crayons (probably again because they result in richly-colored marks and never snag). They hold up fairly well to being dropped repeatedly, even. I keep a set in a zipper pouch for on-the-go pastel needs and I don't feel bad when my son uses one up in a few days through heavy coloring. We've purchased several sets and will continue to do so.

Pro tip, though: The marks aren't that easy to remove from walls. Baby wipes and Magic Erasers will do it eventually, though....",4.0

"I heard about these from my eight-year-old nephew, who uses them in art class. They're nice and create interesting pictures, but in retrospect, I think crayons and markers are good enough for home use (unless you have a dedicated artist at home).",4.0
"These are like crayons only better.  They supply a thick, rich color, which is highly blendable.  Try used dryer sheets.  They blend oil pastels very well.  I wish there were more colors to choose from.

I'm giving these 4 stars instead of 5 because they are too thick for detailed work.  I found them difficult to use for details unless I sharpened them with a straight blade.

Once you use these, you'll never use crayons again.",4.0
"Great price and selection of colors. Good for coloring and blending.  The feel is slightly rough when you color, so if you want a really soft pastel  go with a different brand.",4.0
These were really as I expected.  I didn't want too nice of oil pastels or else I would be more picky about when my 3 year old used them.  They create a nice bold color and my little one enjoys using them to change things up.,4.0
"great artwork! bec of its nature, the colors are more vibrant than regular crayons. the artwork really jumps out at you. however, again bec of the nature of the oil pastels, they do tend to stick to children's hands and can smudge the next page. what my son and i do is once he's done on a page, we put a paper in between pages so as not to smudge.",4.0

"As an artist, I like to use different media. Pastels, soft or oil, are excellent as a quick and easy way to paint different subjects, from still life, to landscapes, to figuers; expressing various moods and states of mind.

No matter if you are a beginner or an advanced painter, it is always useful to have such a set handy.",4.0
"My daughters both loved their pastels that they got as gifts.  The colors are very pretty, and glide well over crafting paper.

"When purchased in bulk, the large beginner crayons are much more affordable.  The quality of Crayola products is always consistent.",4.0
As one of the top sellers in professional markers it stands by its word. I have used them over and over for rendering projects and each time they seem to be new. They never seem to die or go dry like most markers. Prismacolor is a very reliable marker to have on hand. The only draw back of this great product is the price. As you see sets are very expensive and single markers match that tone. But amazon does a good job of lower the bite of the price. Overall with price the prismacolor markers are well worth the dent in the pocket compared to what else is out there.,4.0
I've used these markers for a while now and they've been nice. They aren't the top of the line and they do tend to bleed but they are great for getting started. I would recommend them to anyone just starting out with markers.,4.0
Not that easy to control but im working on it,4.0
Very good!,4.0
Upon delivery quite a few of the crayons where broken. Although not enough to warrant a return.,4.0
"The crayons arrived quickly and safely. However the description should be changed as there are NOT 100 of each color as stated. We needed them for a missions trip and packaged them all into small baggies of 8 and came up well short of yellow, red and orange and was left with an abundance of black and violet. We purchased several boxes and it was the same problem with all of the boxes so it was not a fluke.",4.0
Have it as a Christmas gift,4.0
"As a designer, I wanted a few extra prismacolors simply for rendering in different colors. I think the quality of prismas are excellent, they don't really bleed much as long as you have good pen control, and they glide across your paper. The colors are vibrant and really speaks volumes about the superior standard prismacolor sets.

I will however knock off a star simply because I was hoping for some of the colors to be closer in shade and hue for rendering shadows and giving volume to my drawings. That can be combatted by going through the drawing with a 2nd or 3rd pass, but sometimes can be too cumbersome and make your paper too wet in certain areas.

I would recommend this pack if you're strictly looking for a few extra colors to add to your collection, but not if you're doing serious rendering. In that case, you'd need to seek out and buy those colors separately.",4.0
Very nice fine tips.  But those caps are very difficult to pry off.,4.0
Good markers for the price of $1.5 each. They blend well and the colors are beautiful. Only complaint is there's a lack of nice skin tones and muted colors.,4.0
"Love these markers, work beautifully and colors blend perfectly. Best markers I own, and personally prefer over Copics any day. My only one issue with this was that the PM 8 Pink marker came bone dry. No pigment, just a white dry marker. Wasnt too happy about that, but I was lucky to have an extra from a separate set of 12, however I understand not everyone just has another lying around; hence the four stars.

"Not a bad marker at all. I bought these because they were 75% cheaper on Amazon than they were at the local art supplies store, and I have to say, for the price here, you can't go wrong. I definitely like to use these for projects where I don't want to waste my Copic  markers -- they're great for students and beginning artists, but they don't have the blending capabilities of Copics or the color diversity. Other than that, great marker!",4.0

"Value: 5/5
Pigmentation: 5/5
Bleed through: 3/5
Size: 4/5
Caps: 0/10

Great markers, super pigmented and wet. Not useful for adult coloring books due to the bleed through on every non-artist grade paper. The case is nice and generously sized, but a bit big for carrying every day. My only gripe is the caps. Alcohol based ink needs a good seal to prevent drying out and these markers certainly seal completely, but I can't get the caps off. I'm a 20 something female with decently strong hands but they are very difficult to remove. It's bad enough that I don't use the markers much. If I have any type of lotion on my hands I don't even bother. If you have arthritis or weak hands don't bother with these beautiful markers.",4.0
"I work mostly in pen, colored pencil, and watercolor or acrylic paints - I've never actually worked with art markers before, but I trust Prismacolor and I thought it'd be worth a try!  The large angled tip is very large indeed, and the small round tip is just about right for smaller writing.  I would have liked a medium or small angled tip.  They have a nice steady flow of pigment, and a good spectrum of color.  On a smooth surface, the pigment bled fairly easily.  I'll be experimenting with a number of paper types to find the best match.",4.0

"Very nice quality, and good color selection for a 12-pack. Chisel tip is quite wide, however, and it takes some practice to hold it in such a way that it leaves an even flat line. (I was expecting the chisel tip to be a bit closer in size to a calligraphy marker.)",4.0
"I bought this set for my children to use for their competition poster. They look great, and the colors are good. I gave it 4 stars because it is difficult to remove the lids.

These markers came to my house quickly in good packaging. The colors are rich and vibrant. I believe they are well worth the price. They do a pretty good job of blending together as well. Great set if you don't want to invest in copic markers or if you are just starting out.,4.0

Nice!,4.0
"I really like these markers- the colors are vibrant, they can be blended to a degree and the dual tips are very handy. The only con to them is that I bought them for coloring book purposes, and they bled through some of the pages. I'm not surprised by that, just wasn't sure if they would or not. Still very nice, glad I bought them!",4.0
"They're ok, but not the result I was looking for.  They do bleed through medium weight paper, & even sketch paper.  They dry a little lighter than when they first go down, which is good because they are pretty dark at first.",4.0
"Im not an artist professionally, but I have been coloring my entire life. Until now, I have almost always colored using colored pencils, with cheaper markers only once or twice. After buying another brand of markers because they were on sale, and enjoying the process but not the markers themselves, I decided see what else was out there. I have used Prismacolor colored pencils for a few years, and love them for their quality, so I thought this set would be a good bet.

Well, let me just say I am addicted to these markers; they are amazing! Though I have limited experience with markers, coloring with these has been an absolute pleasure and Im finding it very difficult to go back to colored pencils. You can tell these are artist quality; I have already been able to achieve things in this medium that I previously didn't know was possible. For example, it was relatively easy for me to figure out how to colour without streaking, something I found impossible with other markers and therefore didn't know was an option.

Though Ive heard these are not the best markers on the market, for their price point I think they are as close to perfection as I can expect. However, I will still cover the few negatives I have come across. Some of the markers arrived much drier than others, especially among the lighter colours. I refreshed these by pulling out the broad nib and pouring a small amount of 90% isopropyl alcohol into the marker, and they worked perfectly after this, but that shouldnt be necessary for their price. If you do this, be careful to only add a little, as a couple of times I added too much and had a leaking mess.

The other negative is the color variety. Even though this set of 72 is a great buy, and makes them much more affordable than if you were to buy them one at a time, it is missing a couple of colors I soon deemed to be necessary. Personally, I recommend buying these colors as well to supplement your set: PM 207 Pale Peach for light skin tones; something like PM 70 Sand, PM 201 Cinnamon Toast or PM 89 Light Walnut as your lightest brown; PM 5 ""Scarlet Lake"" as your medium red; PM 96 Blondwood and/or PM 132 Jasmine as your more natural blond hair color; and PM 202 Sky Light Blue for bright blue skies.

Lastly, the fine metallic pens that I received with this set were garbage and thats where I had to put them. They leaked everywhere no matter what I tried and ruined more than one of my pages. Hopefully others have better luck.

Though I'm a beginner, I love these makers and recommend them to everyone that isn't able to shell out an absolute fortune for Copics. Ive posted the pages from coloring books Ive colored in with only Prismacolor markers, but they may include a couple colors that Ive mentioned that didn't come in this original set of 72.",4.0

"I have quite a few PP art markers.  When I began doing more serious adult coloring and my own art work with these, I really grew to love, love, love, them.  They are definitely professional grade with prices to match.  I also have some Copic markers, and I love those too.  And I know many will disagree, but I think PP & Copic are pretty much equal in their performance and stability.  I think your preference depends on the type of art work you do and how you work. And PP are less expensive per marker than Copics, but NOT refillable, which can make them more expensive than Copic in the long run.  Finding a favorite brand may take a lot of experimenting and I also use less expensive Spectrum Noir and a number of others to a lesser extent.  I get great results with SN; vivid colors and smoothness and pretty good blendability, BUT they tend to bleed and smear more than PP & Copic. Grade of paper will also affect performance (generally, the thicker the better for all you new to alcohol markers.)  Deco Pink & Ballet Pink are my two favorite PP colors....absolutely lovely!",4.0

"The end caps on this set are very difficult to remove. On one pen (black one), the insides came away with the cap and I still could not get to the nib. I love Prismacolor products, but this set was of inferior workmanship. Colors and nibs of other markers are excellent, but the plastic of the casing needs upgrading. Maybe I just got a bad run.",4.0

"I bought these as a gift for my son that used up his old small set after years of use. He loved these! It had so many colors he'd been looking to buy separately and more on top of that. He loved having all the warm greys that he didn't have and bought separately are expensive just to try out. As many other reviewers mentioned, the plastic trays the markers sit on are useless and thin that if not picked up very carefully pens go everywhere. For the money, these should come with a decent case or tray at the very least. I spent all I had just to get him these pens, so buying some other thing to carry them in just wasn't possible. So to tide him over until he gets himself a real case, he took some thick foam he had and sliced it in strips and slipped it into the box to hold the pens still while upright. He also taped the large flap closed so he just uses it standing up and for now it works for him.
But the pens themselves are great as always.",4.0
"Even the fine tip is pretty large, and these bleed a lot. Maybe I'm using them wrong, because I still get visible brush strokes.",4.0
these are really nice to color with and gives me things to do,4.0
"I received these markers on Saturday and tested them all out one by one as soon as I received them, not a single one was dry! These markers work beautifully and leave vibrant colors behind. I haven't tried out the blending since my artwork doesnt require much of it, so I cannot comment as much on that.

However, there is only one thing that disappointed me a little about this product. The amount of each color. There needs to be more of the most often used colors! The distribution is very very uneven. I had about 12 blues, 6 oranges 9 yellows, and 3 reds??! Not only that, upon testing the ""reds"" only 1 of them was actually red! (And a very dark shade of red at that too) The other 2 were more orange than anything even though they were labeled as being ""red"". So now, if I want a bright red I have to use a sharpie instead. In addition, there aren't enough skin tone colors, out of the 6 or so that looked on the outside like they could work for a skin tone, only 2 actually did. The others were too pink or too orange. And of the 2, one was a vampire-type pale skin tone, the other dark. And considering I draw lots of people and characters whose skin tones vary, this part disappointed me the most.

However, that is where my complaints end, everything else about these markers are great, and I can always buy some of the ones I need separately! Just keep in mind, 72 is nowhere near a full set and you will likely end up having to buy a few separately to get the full range of colors that fits for you!",4.0
"I have only used these in adult coloring books so far. These markers are more for painting. I l like working with them, but there is a learning curve. First, the color on the marker is alot different than the actual color. They do bleed a little, so if your trying to color in tight spaces, know it will spread a little. They are good for filling in and it's nice having the double end. That said they are fun to play with and I'm anxious to use them for free painting.",4.0

I noticed when making a color chart hart for myself. A few of the colors are very similar. They did bleed on special marker paper that advertised they would NOT bleed. Prismacolor needs to recommend a paper suitable for these markers. Depending on the type of paper used the color can change drastically......the hue or shade.",4.0

"Before I bought these markers I read a review saying how bright they are and that it kinda takes away from dark art you might be trying to create. I agree, I wasn't even trying to make moody art either, the colors are just really bright and vivid so take that into consideration before you buy. Also there is no peach color for skin in here so that's a thing also. But otherwise standard techniques apply where going over the same spot will darken the color (be careful though not to work on one spot for too long so as not to let the marker bleed through the paper onto the next.)",4.0

"The markers work pretty well and the case they come in convenient. These markers are great and I am happy with them. The chisel tip and fine tip allow for different lines. I do have one problem with them though. The fumes. I'm not sure if I'm just not used to it or if they are just really strong. If you uses these markers, work in a well-ventilated area.

"I don't care if there are other products out there they may be newer, or have fancier inks, this like Sharpies are items I have used for along time. Periodically I buy a set like this to upgrade colors that  have been used. It can save money on the per piece price by buying sets like this at a good price. I started using Bic Markers back a few years ago and I buy a 36 color set, then buy a 24 color set to fill in the ones used up. I have started doing this with Prismacolor as well, bought this then take a list of what other colours I need to local art store and fill in the holes. I started doing this in times I could only afford a few tubes of watercolors and I was selling works to buy more supplies and food. About a century ago, it seems.
Primacolor today is the marker I use for a final drawing, besides these ,I use the Bics in permanent markers. In watercolors Stabilo and Pentels markers have served me well.
 Another thing about Prismacolor Markers is they are made in the USA. When I find things that work well, I stick to them. The products mentioned here are available from Amazon, and I consider these products supply a good bang for the buck.",4.0

"I am an artist and I prefer to use Prismacolors, not only because of the ink quality but also because of the vast majority of products that prismacolor puts out. I like how there's so much from erasers to pencils, to watercolor pencils to markers, etc. I do feel they are a quality product. Markers do run out-not just Prismacolors but any, so I would say it depends upon how often and how much you use them, also don't leave them uncapped. The only thing with this set is that Prismacolors, like good quality markers could be costly- you're not paying for kindergarten markers and in saying that, I would not have liked to have paid for 3 black markers. It would have been nice to have had a clear blender and perhaps a white included with the set. However, given the price, it is worth it that the set usually costs more elsewhere, and what is packed inside the box isn't up to anyone except the company. Overall, yes, I have been using Prismacolors for years and will continue to do so.",4.0
"I'm an architecture student, and I was required to buy this set of markers for one of my freshman courses. This set doesn't come with greys, which was a little disappointing since they would have been the most useful I found. Go for the 72 pack, you get cool, warm, and french grays along with the 48 pack - saves you a bunch of money in the long run. I would highly recommend getting some brush tip markers too (black & cool grey) if you ever plan on sketching. They're magical.",4.0
"So I'm not a proper artist.  You should temper your use of my advice with the understanding that I'm not a pro and didn't go to art school and sometimes my people are a bit funky-shaped when I draw them.

Prismacolors are the low-end standard.  Marker people really love Copal or Letraset markers more than Prismacolors and allegedly those are 'better'.  They are dye-based, which means that they will fade in sunlight, although most of the other popular brands are also dye-based.  They will soak through normal sketchbook paper, so you probably want to use marker paper instead.

They are still one of the standard markers, so art instruction books will talk about them.

These are the standard double-ended Prismacolors.  There's the little side for pointy detail and then there's the big side that's a chunky broad-stroke marker.  I'm fine with this.  Some people hate this.  There's also a similar set that has a brush instead of the broad-stroke side.

Now, this set of 24 has all of the basic colors you want... and you can mix colors by laying one layer atop another... but it's not quite enough for serious drawing.  You probably need some gray markers and a few more colors.  If you do people, you probably want Eggshell and Ballet Pink and Light Tan, for example.

Also, the marker stand/case is kinda nice.  I have this set and another set of markers that I picked up piecemeal and I can just throw the stand/case in my portfolio case and set up wherever.",4.0

My husband and I both use these when coloring our concept art for projects we're working on. I love the chisel tip side whenever I do broad strokes and he likes the fine tip side for detailing. Great product.,4.0
"These markers are such high quality and really are the tools for great results. The shape and ink flow make for easily even tones without bleeding, blobs, or smearing. It's a good idea (if you you plan to be layering or covering a lot of area with the markers) to purchase Marker Paper as well; the paper will absorb the marker rather than letting it sit on top of the paper - this controls your lines and evenness more. Two issues I do have with this set is that I've found I use certain markers more than others (3, 5, and 7), and while the set includes 3 black markers, I wish they had doubles of some of the more highly used values (I barely use my black). My other critique is that the fine point ends are just slightly darker than the broad tip end. So, even though you are using the same marker value, it can be difficult to achieve an even tone when you want to switch between fine and broad tips (getting into corners etc.) But overall, really happy and impressed with this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for tools to create realistic dimension on 2-D surfaces! TIP: When creating gradients, work fast so the markers stay wet and blend easily!",4.0

One drawback is the labels on the markers (apparently like the rest of Prismacolor's products) are not color-matched.  Some of the labels were printed in a reddish grey, some were blueish grey, some of them were darker than the actual color, and some of them were lighter.  What I did was got some little white stickers to mark the actual color on and wrap around the marker.  I wrote the %grey value on them as well.

* Double tipped design for many possible line thicknesses

* Good deal for 24 different colors

Cons:

* The box the set comes in has two stacked thin plastic trays that don't physically hold onto markers (they sort of sit in slots).  So not all of the markers are accessible when you open the box, and it is sort of wonky to pull out the top tray and set it off to the side of the box with markers sliding off of it.  You will probably want some sort of caddy or holder for your markers if you want them accessible on your desk.

* 24 color set contains colors that are very basic.  If you are buying these thinking there will be some close shades of the same color for drawing shaded areas, you would be wrong.  Here are the blue shades, for example: two fairly dark blues of different hues, a sky blue, and light pale blue, and a light blue/purple.  So if you drew something that you would like to color with the different markers, you would likely want more shades of a similar hue.  Or like others have mentioned, use a gray marker set along with this for shading, which will be my next purchase.",4.0
This set is a great start for an artist's first marker set. The only gripe I have is that the box is kind of awkward and this does not come with a carrying case so as soon as you open it it will spill out randomly sorted. My suggestion is to cut the top of the box flaps and tape the corners so you can make a holder out of the box.,4.0

"The daughter required this exact type of marker for her design class at college.  She had been buying the individual markers at the student book store, but they were expensive. Although still not inexpensive, the set was a real bargain compared to the individual prices.  She is ecstatic about the markers.  They are excellent quality, and having the 24 separate colors allow her much more creativity in her college work.  He classmates are jealous of her new set of markers.  Good quality, good buy",4.0
"I got these for my 2d design class. We were allowed to choose our media and I immediately thought of these. I used these on a project my senior year of high school and was amazed by them, especially after getting used to them.
I originally bought the 24 piece set at Blick, but returned them the day after because this specific page came up. For the 24 piece set I paid $65, and for just $10 more, I doubled the number of markers.",4.0
"I recently purchased a color set of these markers and I've really been enjoying them but there were no greys so when I found this set I was very happy.  I really love these markers.  The colors lay down smoothly and dry quickly.  A good alternative if you cannot afford Copics.  The only reason I rate four stars is they do have an odor, a bit like a Sharpie, and they do bleed a bit.  That's not too much of an issue though if you have Bristol paper on hand.
I'm really liking these makers so far, and would recommend them.",4.0
"I've never had the opportunity to work with good art markers prior to receiving these so I'm quite pleased with my purchase!  The colors lay down smoothly and dry fast.  I would recommend them to anyone who can't quite afford Copics, they're a good alternative.  The only reason I rate it 4 stars is they do have an odor, kind of like a Sharpie, and they do bleed a little.  Although if you have Bristol paper it won't be much of an issue.
Nice product.",4.0
"-Smells healthy. much better than the sets my dad used to own as an exhibition designer before 3D MAX.
-the color labels are WAY off. It might be the problem of my computer monitor since I've never got it color adjusted, most of the color labels on the markers don't match with the color plate on Prismacolor website, and the labels don't match with the actual color of the marker (sorry about the long sentence)  I have to look them up by their names. You may want to create your own color plate just as I did, or test each marker out before you use them on your artwork.
-it blends beautifully.
-the colors are a lot lighter when they are dry.
-the package can be better. It doesn't fits the markers perfectly, but I found it convenient as a shelf on my table.
in general, I absolutely enjoy working with those markers.",4.0
"I bought the 24 set from amazon and these are some pretty good markers for the price. They indeed deliver rich and vibrant colors. They might not be huge professional markers (like copic markers) but still are way cheaper for the people who don't have that kind of budget.

There are only a few things I have to complain about these markers. The color labels are misleading, and the marker's color is usually a lot darker than what it says on the label, but that isn't too much of a problem. Second, they don't blend as well. You'll still see streaks, but they still overall blend a lot better than regular markers.

If you're thinking about buying the 24 set, you won't get too much of a variety of colors, since they mostly come with primary and secondary colors, which are the basic of the basic. Like the other reviewers said, you might want to get some grays for shading. Also, if you draw human figures a lot, a set of skin tones is a must. The 24 pack only comes with one skin tone (peach) and that won't look good enough. Since I'm an illustrator, I draw human characters a lot, so I had to go out and buy some skin shades.

Also, these will bleed quite a lot on regular paper. You might want to get marker paper to keep it from bleeding so much and not waste too much ink.

Is this a top professional marker? well, no, but is this a good place to start for beginners who are leaning towards being a serious artist and want to use something other than regular markers? absolutely.",4.0
"I've been using Prismacolor Markers for five years now, and I've never needed anything more than them. They're a cheap alternative to Copics, which are better in quality sure, but are much more expensive. There's also a bit more of a color variety for Copics, but Prismas cover the basics.
The one thing you learn to hate about them is how badly they bleed. If you're drawing in a sketchbook, unless you want the three pages behind it to be colored as well, you have to place paper beneath it. I've learned that two to three sheets of scrap paper work just fine. The second problem I've ran into with them is that there's a bit of a color difference in both nibs. The broad nib colors a bit darker, and bleeds much heavier than the fine end. But I suppose that's to be expected.
If you're on a budget and you just want a set of markers that aren't Crayola, I'd recommend these. If you're a hardcore wannabe Mangaka or Comic Artist, I'd go with the Copics if you can afford them.

Myself, I'm a casual artist that draws for fun and nothing else. If you're like me, these will work just fine for you.",4.0
"I bought these to draw and color manga. The color selection wasn't too great and bleeds on paper. Prisma is a good brand, but there are better alternatives such as Copics or Shinhan Touch markers.",4.0
"I am a prisma lover, so I won't say much about the markers. They're like any other prisma set. (But yay red, purple, and browns! I needed those!) The casing is pretty awesome. A bit strange on how it connects together, but not horrible. The casing is sturdy, and so far hasn't burst open if rough handled. (Don't really wana test that.)Though if the case is open, some of the markers will fall out when stored horizontally.

I'm enjoying the good colors! No grays though. (Of course :P )",4.0
"Thus far I believe these are some solid markers but they don't go well with some sketch books so if you have very thin pages in your sketch book like I do then don't plan on using these in it, instead use faber castell Pitt pens they don't bleed through your pages. If you have thicker pages that you are working on then these are probably going to be fine and that is where I find that they are meant to be used, but overall the marker quality is very good and I would recommend them to people who are trying to be marker artists.",4.0
"I use these on a professional level and these are the best I've ever used.  I rate'em better than the old Pantone markers which used to bleed outside of an ink line too much.

As one reviewer suggested, you might want to get a set of the gray markers to backup the ones in the set.  I tend to use earth tones and grays alot.

WELL worth the money!!",4.0
I use these for fashion Illustration and mix them with other media. They work perfectly to create great effects.,4.0
"Prismacolor markers are twice as expensive at my local Michael's store - you get only 12 markers for the same price as these - so I was excited to find such a deal for professional grade art markers. The color lay-down is rich and different colors blend extremely well. The only disadvantage is that the thick Bristol paper I normally use sucks up more color from the marker, so they dry out faster. Also make sure to that the cap is -secure- after use, as even a tiny opening can dry your markers out. Still, it's a great brand.",4.0
"I bought these items for my daughter to use at University. She loves them and enjoys using them. If I need more supplies for her, I will return to Amazon first.

I love these markers! The only thing I don't like it the stand that is provided for them. You would think that for the money spent they could provide a nicer and more fitted way to store the markers. The stand is poorly made and the markers don't fit in it.,4.0
I'm always satisfied at Amazon with whatever the product I buy.  Where else can you go to get the variety of products and the satisfaction guarantee.,4.0
"These are very high-quality, expensive markers. The markers are substantial, and feature a cap at each end, allowing the artist to choose the type of line needed. They fit together in a black plastic case which can be set up at an angle so that they, each with it's own colored dot at the end, are visible at the the same time, for ease of choosing and storing.

The Prismacolor markers are perfect for the professional artist or for those with experience in the type of art that demands markers, such as graphic arts, doing story boards, or the like. I am not such a person, however. I purchased the 24 marker set as well as some Prismacolor pencils (both Premier as well as Verithin) recently to expand my drawing hobby. The pencils are fine for me; I've been using them, and they are versatile for my needs. The markers I will be returning or reselling, though. I don't need anything that fancy. I DO need some gray markers, though, which the 24-set does not have, and I don't want to have to buy a bigger set. Also, I am sensitive to the smell of the markers. Not so bad as some, but still stinky to me.

I've tried a few other types of markers, and decided on a set called ""Dual Brush Pens"", which is just fine for my limited art-marker needs. I wish they came in more colors. But I'll be using mainly pencils and some paints, so I won't need the Prismacolor markers.",4.0
"These are good Prismacolor markers, and I like the price. They have the 'new' fine tip (the one that looks like a brush and acctually works), and they're really nice for shading and greyscale pictures. However, you should be aware that there's only 10 colors in this set, Cool Grey from 10% to 90% and then three black markers.
I wish that I'd bought these before I bought my color marker set, but they work wonderfully in conjunction with the colors too.",4.0

This is a simple 8-pack of washable markers in your most basic colors.  Washable is key in case the kids get adventurous and start coloring things that are not meant to be colored.  You just have to make sure the caps are securely tightened by the click after use - not every child will have the strength/dexterity to do that.,4.0

"My four-year-old twins are starting school this fall and I wanted to have some basic school supplies at home for when they learn to write letters and numbers. I remember using Pink Pearl erasers in school so I found a 3-pack of these as an add-on item and thought this would be a good start for us.

I purchased the 3-pack of ""large"" erasers, though I'm not so sure they are large since they are the same size as I remember from the 80s and 90s. They are 100% latex free as well as smudge resistant. They measure 2 1/4 inches by just under an inch by 3/8 inches. They are the same pink I remember and are made in Malaysia.

I ordered these several months ago and I'm pleased with this product. They erase cleanly and don't leave a lot of marks behind, at least in my experience with these. I can still see some of the pencil but it's minimal and not enough to say these erasers aren't doing their job. I've taken lots of standardized tests in my lifetime and filled in lots of little bubbles with pencils. I feel these erasers would be good to use during those tests when you may need to erase an answer. These erasers are soft, don't crumble like some erasers I've had, and are comfortable to hold. They are also a good size for my kids to use for when we practice writing their letters and numbers.

Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase and would buy these again when we need more. I'm not sure why these erasers are classified as ""large"" since they are the same size as most erasers of this style. We got a great deal on them and I would recommend them to students or anyone who needs good erasers!",4.0

These Fiskars #8 Premier (spring action) Scissors are convenient to use and prefer them over conventional scissors. Just wish the spring was stronger. After several months of use they don't open all the way unless assisted by your fingers.,4.0
"It's a bit strange getting used to scissors that only have one hole for you to put a finger or two into, and that open by themselves--plus I've never actually had a pair of bent scissors before.  So I really wasn't sure this pair from Fiskars would work for me.  However, I've found they're really quite wonderful, and now my poor arthritic hands can use a scissors again, even when my knuckles and finger joints are badly swollen.  This model is recommended for ease of use by people with arthritis, and I agree they really do make a difference.  As several other reviewers have noted, it would be nice if Fiskars made this style (easy action, bent) with smaller blades--or maybe they do and I just haven't seen them on Amazon.  There is one shortcoming I've found with this model, and that is that the blade-locking gizmo is kind of hard to operate.  I'm usually unable to simply reach up and slide the button to the open position, and sometimes have to ask someone to help me with it, which is kind of humiliating.  But it's a really nice scissors, and is overall extremely easy to use.  I definitely recommend it for anyone who has limited grip strength or other limitations related to their hands.",4.0
These scissors are useful and are very sharp.,4.0
"I've been having problems with my thumb joint and these were recommended as making it easier to cut. They do. The automatic opening action doesn't require you to use your thumb to force the scissors open. It makes it much more comfortable on the joint.  They cut well. No forcing, clean cuts.

I think my only complaint would be that the blades are so long. For crafting, you sometimes want a slightly shorter blade.  These are very large. Fortunately they are also light, so it isn't that much of a problem. They are maybe 2 inches longer in total in comparison to my standard scissors. (I usually buy the 3 pack scotch scissors from Costco)  They are great for long cuts but not so much for curves.",4.0
I have an older style of these and I was worried that these would not be as nice as the older ones. These are almost as good as the older style. The locking mechanism is not as secure or convenient as the one on the older scissors. Buy a pair before they get improved into uselessness,4.0

These are an updated version to their other scissors and they are good but I prefer the latch on the older version as it is easier for me to use. Other than the latch difference these are good scissors and easier to use than the plain scissors as the spring load takes less hand strength.

These scissors are fine...they do what I expected them to do, and the spring action is a must for me. I've used Fiskars for years, and always return to them when it's time for new scissors.  My only complaint is that they just don't seem to be as 'springy' as my last pair had been.",4.0
"I bought these specifically because they were supposed to be easier for those with impairments involving the hands.  I had considered using electric shears, but in the past, I had always felt as though they were on the verge of taking over and cutting according to their own design.

These shears leave me feeling in control, while making fabric cutting incredibly easy, cutting through even up to 4 layers of lightweight woven fabric working almost without effort. I found them to easy to use with very little fatigue afterwards.  However, when cutting a heavy twill (about the same weight as an average pair of jeans) the fabric frequently jammed up in the scissors, wedging between the blades instead of cutting.  This is highly disappointing, as I was growing to love these scissors.  Instead, I had to drag out the trusty old fashioned ones to do the job.  That has cost these scissors a full star--they should be able to cut this type of fabric dependably as well.

The grips are comfortable, and fit my hand well.  The motions required to operate the scissors are easy for the hand to repeat without fatigue, and the scissors are easy to control accurately while cutting.  These are all great features while using these scissors.  The sole negative that has nearly cost these scissors a full star is the locking mechanism.  It does not operate easily and I cannot operate it with one hand.  That means if I want to lock OR unlock the scissors, I have to change my grip and use the other hand to operate the lock.  This isn't convenient, and does not enhance the perception of quality in a pair of Fiskars scissors.",4.0

"The older model of these scissors was WONDERFUL.  I'm left-handed and they are the most comfortable scissors I've ever used.  BUT, the redesign makes them merely very good.  The latch is located such that unless I'm very careful, it gets latched while I'm cutting.  I'm finding it rather annoying to have to unlock the scissors several times when I'm in the midst of cutting something out.  They're still comfortable to use, and they can be sharpened when needed, but why, Fiskars, put the latch in such a weird spot?",4.0
"I like that the spring opens up the scissors so that it's one less motion that my hands have to do.  I'm hoping that the springs will soften up after some more use because they're a bit stiff.  I use these primarily for cutting fabric.  I use my regular Fiskars scissors during the actually sewing.  Since they're either opened up all the way or locked closed, they're not that convenient for snipping thread and making small clips and cuts at the machine.",4.0
"These scissors are great for ladies who sew a lot.  The thumb is not used directly to operate them - just the other fingers and the palm of the hand. We were disappointed, however, that they are no longer made in the USA (but in China). Only time will tell if they are as good as the US made ones.",4.0
"These are great, well designed scissors that are very easy to use. It took me a while to get used to using them, but now I am very happy with them.",4.0
"The Fiskars 9911 model pictured with this listing is the older version of these same scissors -- which is the reason I chose to purchase them here. However, it appears that Fiskars no longer produces the version pictured. They new model has been redesigned to be more ""ergonomic"" I suppose... but the slide lock mechanism on the new models isn't located in the same spot which makes it slightly less convenient for me large hands. Also, the lock on the new model tends to slip forward when cutting and hinders the range of the scissors and will occasionally slip back and let the scissors open when they are in my holster.

All in all I have always been happy with the Fiskars scissors -- the blades stay sharp and the cutting action is smooth -- but as with some other products in the past (think ""New Coke"") the older model is superior to the newer.",4.0

"I bought this marker set because I'm beginning to do a lot of scrapbooking, and I wanted something that I could use to write on colored paper (particularly black), photographs, and magazine pictures. Unfortunately, these markers are poor on all 3 mediums listed.

They write ok on colored paper but not great on black paper. They are ok on photographs and magazine pictures but sometimes the ink will glob up and not stay in the whole area you wrote in.

However, these markers are great if legibility is not important (like if you're just coloring in something). Also, the silver and gold markers are SPECTACULAR! They show up beautifully on any medium, and they appear truly metallic. I would buy the whole set just for these 2 markers.",4.0
"Excellent flow of pen ink and quality of ink. I painted letters on a fiberglass sea kayak that have lasted 3 years with only a mild fade from sun.

I used these to paint coffee cups and they worked great. The only down side was that the paint seemed to run out before I thought it should have.,4.0
They are about what I expected. I used one on a ceramic mug and tried two days later to rub the paint off with water with no success. That was without using a sealant. I have not tried to wash it in the dishwasher yet. One complaint I have is that some of the pens flow pretty heavy. When I opened the first one and pressed on the tip to get the paint to flow out it went everywhere. I recommend lightly tapping the tip several times on some scratch paper to get the paint flowing. The ones that I did not do that with now flow paint out very heavily and I can't use with stencils because the paint runs underneath. The tip is not that fine either. It is larger than a regular sharpie point. The tip is more rounded and not pointy. Otherwise the paint adheres well and the colors are nice.,4.0

"These are great paint markers but my black marker doesn't work! All the others are fine but the black barely marks at all. Almost like its clogged but this is how it was from the beginning. Each marker comes individually wrapped so it is new.

The colors are bright. Almost neon looking! The metallics are really shiny. They stink so make sure you have some good ventilation if you decide to use these for a large project.

Don't drop them either. I dropped one and the impact made paint splatter everywhere! You wouldn't believe it! It dries really fast too. I ended up having to repaint large portions of my project with the base color.

Also the cap doesn't ""click"" on which makes me feel like they aren't on well enough. Time will tell if they dry out or not. I've had paint markers from other brands that stay usable as long as there's ink. The cap doesn't stay on the end while you're using the pen either. You just have to hold onto it...",4.0

"Product is as advertised, however, if paint-marking something with this that you'll be touching often, it'll start to rub off.  It'll leave a silvery residue on whatever it's rubbing against.  Really great, metallic silver color though.  For my particular application I found that nail polish sticks much better, although I couldn't find the same nice metallic silver color.  I bet you could clear coat this paint with nail polish and have the best of both worlds, now that I think about it.",4.0
"I bought these paint pens for decorating wine glasses and such.  They work wonderfully.  After using all types of different paints, these by far work the best for decorating wine glasses.

"Worked great. Very easy to use, but they do take a bit of time befor is he paint saturates the tip. The tips seem more durable than other brands. The orange, unfortunately, was much paler than the cap would suggest.",4.0
excellent product for marking those tough to mark items.,4.0
"Preface:  We use these to mark bottles with glossy paper.  Whenever we would try sharpies, it would just rub off, thus the reason we decided to give these Paint Markers a shot!

Pro's:
1)  Great solid colors.
2)  We dot things ~ Once paint is flowing, its very easy to dot hundreds of times without having to get more paint running from the tip.
3)  Not easily scratched off (which is great for our application)
4)  Easily wiped off if a mistake is made (assuming you wipe within a couple of seconds of using)

Con's:
1)  Getting the paint flowing can't be tricky.  And you CAN overdue it.  We use a scratch piece of paper and just move it while adding slight pressure back and forth and this will get it flowing.
2)  Once in a while ~ Paint will just flow, for no real reason.  I have ended up with permanent pink spots on my paints during the learning curve involved :)  Those jeans have now been relegated to gardening!

Conclusion:  Love these paint pens.  They work well once you fully understand how to use properly!  Colors are vibrant and highly visible!  We'll continue to use for the foreseeable future.",4.0

i only gave these a four because they are smaller then i expected size of a pen instead of a marker works well for my needs great buy,4.0
"I was afraid that the sticks would come broken from being tossed about during shipping.  Thankfully all of them are in one piece.  I have never used water soluble oil pastel before therefore I did not know what to expect.  However, the result from my first try is not shabby at all.  I use the 3 shades of yellow (pale to orange) to fill out the blank area from a coloring page I was working on using US Art Supply's water brush.  The result was satisfying.  The pastel touched the paper between waxed crayon and regular oil pastel.  If I used too much force, bits would crumble.  However, the color is opaque enough that even at a light touch it adhered to the paper nicely.  I like the result and will definitely use it more in color blending.

(the rest of the coloring mediums are metallic markers, metallic pencils, and metallic water color paint; only the big block of yellow area is done with water soluble oil pastel)",4.0
"I rate these four stars, but as a ""student"" grade product. Otherwise I would give them a much lower rating due to the fact that several of the colors are not very lightfast.

I did a lightfastness test (strong sunlight in a west window) and then rated them on a scale from 1 to 10 (10 being most lightfast), and here are my results:

10: True Blue (the lighter blue), Blue Green, Yellow Green, Golden Brown (the ocher color), Rust (the sienna color), Medium Brown, Grey, and Black
9: Cerulean, Blue, Blue Violet (the dark purple color), Green, and Slate Grey (the very blue grey color)
8: Yellow, and Moss (the khaki green color)
6: Violet (the lighter purple color)
5: Red Orange
4: Yellow Orange
3: Orange
2: Red Violet (the lightest purple color), and Peach (the light ""flesh"" color)
1: Pink

Those rated 10 showed no degradation, even in the wash application.
Those rated 9 showed a very slight lightening of the wash application only.
Those rated 8 showed a little more lightening of the wash, and little if any lightening of the dry (and so stronger) application.
The Violet, rated 6, had a little loss of intensity/brilliance in both applications, resulting in a slightly duller color.
The Red Orange, rated 5, had a little lightening dry, but more in the wash, with also a loss of some of its orange hue in both applications.
The Yellow Orange, rated 4, lost all of its orange hue and now looks a lot like the Yellow.
The Orange, rated 3, lightened about 50% dry, and about 70% in the wash.
The Red Violet, rated 2, lost about 80% of its color in both applications. The Peach, also a 2, lost about 90% of its color in both applications.
The Pink, rated 1, forget about it; nothing but the ""wax"" left.

I gave away (to some neighbor's young children) all those rated below 4 (5 of the 24), and probably should of let go the Yellow Orange, and maybe even the Red Orange too.

I would rate the remaining, in general, as a 5 star product, especially considering the price (even just for those I kept). They are fairly well pigmented and wash well, and with little of the dry strokes remaining after applying water.",4.0

"The water solubility was somewhat different than I expected. The product couldn't be dissolved once applied to dry paper. It has to be applied to wet paper. The application is very creamy and smooth, but you can't spray the crayone and expect color dispersement on your page. It seemed like I would be getting a student grade for less. That may be true, but it is a slightly different animal than other water soluble similar products. I will adapt to the products differences, and once I don't mind it's performance, I will be happy that I paid half the price, and got twice the colors. My advice? Make sure the product performance matches your application. Then you will be happy with the outcome. :)",4.0
"Great product! I was able to sand down the rusted chrome rim on the drain of my 50's porcelain sink and apply the Sanford Uni-Paint PX-20 oil based marker.  It now looks new again.  It is a metallic silver, as close to the chrome finish as I could find. Great price, and fast delivery too.",4.0
"I expected the usual felt-tipped marker, However, the construction of this marker reminds me of a small tin of spray paint with a ball in it to shake and keep the paint stirred.  One fear is that the tip may dry out or be hardened while paint is still left in the metal body. This is left to be seen.

I have used it once for a very small job. It worked well! And this is the important factor.",4.0
"When I ordered this product, I knew I was buying a great brand of oil based pens. When I got the pens I Shook them, and wrote with them and painted very nice and bold. BUT...

I shook the new ones, and compared it to my old ones, and it seems as if my old ones have more paint in it than the the new ones! the new ones are lighter, and don't sound as loud as the old ones. Just a little disapointed with the capacity of paint in the cartridge... But despite that, These pens are fantastic!",4.0
My 15 year old son asked for these pens to do artwork on his surfboard.  They worked fine and he has done some really cool art on his board.  He did say that they really smell and it is imperative that you use the pens in a well ventilated room.

"i'm a local artist and i usually paint w/ acrylics, but in my art class i started messing around with the oil pastels more. It took me about 8 months to find out that the Portfolio brand (Crayola) oil pastel is the one i most enjoy using when i was in class. It took me that long because where i have class, is in an art museum, and the bin of pastels, well, none of them really have their labels still on them. Alot of them are reduced down to little nubs or 1/4 sticks - that's how much use these pastels have gotten. I asked my art teacher if he knew which brand they were, but he didn't know at the time. I searched all over the local art shops here, stores like Jo-Ann's, Michael's, even Office Max to try and find the great pastels i sought. I knew what they weren't thru use of me using them when searching: they weren't Galleria, Rembrandt, Pentel, Craypas, Niji. (I was thinking they were Craypas Expressionist until i bought Craypas, and also Pentel til i bought pentel, but they weren't.) It wasn't till about 2 wks ago in my art class i happened to find a shred of a label off this brand. i used that color and it had the same rich and buttery richness as when i first tried them long ago. This is how i know it's Portfolio. I'm so glad that i now know what brand it is i truly enjoy because they are so awesome to work with.

They blend easily and like i said are rich in color and spread like butter when i used them on my canvas. I didn't know they were water soluble though. That's an added bonus for me. I like how they blend with soft pastels as well. I've also used them with charcoal as well.

I can't believe i've found a great product at a small price as compared to other higher priced brands.

The only reason i give the pastels a 4 star rating is because how fast you will go thru them if you happen to be working on some large canvases like myself. Since the cost of replacing them is small, i don't mind too much and maybe you won't either depending on how frequently you go thru a set, but if you're after something else with more staying power that doesn't run out that fast, maybe you should look elsewhere. I hear Niji is pretty solid.",4.0
"These are great. I take these in my purse with a sketchbook for on the go ""painting."" They're easy to blend, great colors and convenient packaging.",4.0
"These are the creamiest smoothest pastels, easily blendable with a delicious texture.  the only negative to it is they changed the color of red-violet from the rich, bright, gem tone that it used to be, to a duller, more subdued tone, which does not jump off the page like it used to.  i was very disappointed by this, actually.  The red-violet was my favorite color and i used it for so many of my paintings.  now i have to go to the trouble of attempting to mix to try my best to match the original color.  all in all, a great tool, beautiful colors, and smooth as cream!!!",4.0

"Well, first off they are not orange - they are now RED.  If you see any of the original orange lefty Fiskars, BUY THEM and sell here or on ebay.  These are now RED and no way as sharp as Fiskars reputation would lead you to believe.  No better than other stainless scissors in this price range, except my lefty daughter swears they are the only scissor that don't make her hands sore.  She used her original ORANGE handled pair so much she wore out the pivot pin.  I still give them 4 stars because relative to most of what is being sold these days (apparently only CHINA can make scissors anymore...)  they sharpen up quite well by running them through the Fiskars scissor edging tool, and now cut fabric quite well.",4.0
"I don't know why it took me so long to decide to buy left handed scissors, but its a great choice instead of struggling continually with ones for the right handed.

My right (dominant) hand is out of commission for a few months. I couldn't get typical scissors to work at all using my left hand.

"True left-handed scissors! If you're left-handed, or like to use scissors with your left hand, NEVER use scissors that claim to be ""ambidextrous"" because they will not work well for you.

"They are scissors, and they came recommended.  My son is 12 and has difficulty with motor skills. I never thought about needing lefty scissors.  I bought the kind that said worked for both.  I asked people who were lefties what they most needed specially made for them. They said, overwhelmingly, scissors.  

It turns out that my son cuts with his right hand.  He has bigger hands than I do, so these fit nicely, but they were totally awkward in his hands. He felt uncomfortable and unnatural.  I felt scared watching him try to cut something.  I'm donating them.  They looked well made.",4.0

"Good scissors, reasonably sharp when delivered, fairly comfortable LEFTY grips. These scissors are designed for left-handed use, not just re-purposed righties with lefty grips, therefore the cutting edges don't spread in use.

The grips are large enough that they are comfortable to hold, too.  I highly recommend Fiskars.",4.0
"Very high quality scissors.  We have both left and right-handed members of the household and it is definitely not fun watching a left-handed person cutting anything with ""regular scissors"".

"So.  You know.  Left-handed scissors are good.  Cutting with righted-handed scissors always made my cut ""go uphill"" (Lefties know what I'm talking about).  These fit much better in my hand.  If you are left-handed, I recommend these.",4.0

The seam on the handle could have been finished a little more carefully, which is why I withheld one star, but these are very good all-purpose scissors.",4.0
"The rating of four out of five stars (instead of a full five stars) is really just my own fault, as follows: Both my husband and daughter are left-handed, so I thought buying a pair of left-handed scissors would be a good idea. But although the scissors are quite nice, they are girl-sized (ladies size 7 glove). I will save them for my daughter who is off at college and purchase another pair, this time being very mindful that they be large enough for a burly guy with large hands. So, if you buy these, be mindful of the size of the handles if you are buying them for a large-handed leftie.",4.0

Nice Grip and tight sharp blades.  Not loose like the cheaper models.,4.0
very sharp... easy to use,4.0

Well priced pair of scissors. Cut all the way to the end like advertised. Does not feel cheap.,4.0
"Not like the originals, but pretty good,  The originals did cost more than this ten or fifteen years ago, so I suppose if these were still that same quality, they would be extremely expensive.",4.0
"These work very well and have slightly soft/flexible thumb and finger openings.  I'm ""old school"" - still have (and prefer) my 15 yr. old originals that have rigid finger and thumb openings.  Bought these to get my originals back from my wife and she loves them.",4.0

Nice reasonably priced scissors.  Nothing special to write home about.  They feel good in the hands and work like they should.  I owned several pairs of these in  the past and abused them terribly.  I must admit they held up considering how I misused them.,4.0
"Ergonomically designed, handy and sharp.  Scissors for everyday use, reasonably priced, light weight yet durable.",4.0
"Fiskars makes very good scissors.  They hold up over the years without the two blades beginning to wobble because of a cheap bolt in the middle.  Just like any other scissors, they do need sharpening after a while but start out extremely sharp!  They are sharp and also have some weight to them unlike those cheap ones.  The grips are large enough that they are comfortable to hold, too.  I highly recommend Fiskars.",4.0
They are nicely designed and well crafted scissors from a reputable manufacturer/  They are better than I expected.  It was well worth it.,4.0
Scissors are all-purpose and good for general home or office use.  The double-pack option makes them an even better value.,4.0
I am one of those type A personalities that want organization at their fingertips.  I purchased several Fiskars scissors to have in various areas of the home this way I am not running from room-to-room and I save time.  You know how important that is to on schedule folks!  The Fiskars brand is reliable and I don't even think about purchasing a generic brand.  What would be the use?,4.0
"These appear like many of the orange-handled Fiskars we've seen for decades.  They don't have the authoritative snip of older, heavier fabric-cutting shears but are adequate for multiple-usage purposes and are a reasonably priced choice.",4.0

"I am happy with the crayons, but I found them after reading an article about updates to the old ""flesh"" color crayon. What I expected was for each of these crayons to say ""flesh"" on the outside, with the rub being that there were many choices. Instead, they have their regular Crayola color names on them. The multicultural aspect is in their being boxed together. Still good but could have gone one step further, imho.",4.0
"I tested this machine for a small needlework shop to see if it were worth keeping around for emergencies and odd jobs.
Although the description claims that this little machine takes the ""intimidation"" out of sewing, it's really a fussy little gadget that best serves experienced stitchers in emergency situations or while travelling.  To expect that a neophyte would be able to know how to adjust tension and manipulate fabric is to invite verbal abuse from those who don't know what they're doing.
One of the main flaws of this machine is not necessarily its mechanics (it's far noisier than a regular machine), but its accessories; it's shipped with a pack of bobbins and spools pre-wound with the worst thread imaginable: cheap, fuzzy, short-fiber spun polyester.  Not only will spun polyester thread cause expensive machines to choke, but in this machine, it's a recipe for the disasters of tangling thread, throat plate jams and damaged needles.
The needles it's shipped with -- inferior metal, semi-ball point -- will only handle plain-woven midweight cotton fabric.  If you attempt to stitch on stretch or knit fabric, be prepared for skipped stitches and jamming, unless you purchase ballpoint needles and long staple polyester thread.  Woven fabrics are best stitched with sharp-point or universal point needles.
I was disappointed that I couldn't find a way to adjust stitch length, even though I've operated dozens of domestic, commercial, and industrial sewing machines.  The ""speed control"" buttons are practically useless, and do not control the feed dogs.  There is no reverse stitch control to form backstitching at the beginning and end of a seam.
I found the size of the power pedal small enough to hold between the knees (to keep it from ""creeping"").
When the proper thread and needles are used for the project (and again, a complete beginner would have no idea about using undamaged points or when to choose long staple poly or cotton) this machine stitches well enough for quick seams and hems.
If you're looking for a ""first"" sewing machine, buy one in the $80 - $140 range from a shop where the staff are willing to help you learn to sew.  The Euro-Pro Dressmaker 998B is NOT for raw beginners without an experienced sewing buddy, but for experienced or casual stitchers who use the proper thread & needles for small projects or emergency repairs.",4.0
"1. It is so convenient for me to use this lovely mini sewing  machine without worry about the bobbin and needle threading.
When I open the package to take out this machine,then I can
start to sewing quickly.
2. This machine is very reliable even if you continue to operate
it over 7 hours,it is still in good conditions.",4.0
"I've been sewing since I was the age of 6. Twenty years later I am alot better than when I started. I remember my mom bought me alittle play sewing machine, but it is nothing in comparison to this little machine. I wish this could have been my first sewing machine.

I bought this little machine for a girl that wants to learn to sew, but I have borrowed it from time to time from her to do some repair works while I am not home where my fancy expensive machine is, and I must say for the money ... Not bad, not bad at all.

Threading is childs play and even the stitching is slow enough so that any beginer or child can keep up with it.

I will not recomend it though for making of clothes or heavy duty jobs, but it perfect for kids or just little repair works.",4.0
"I love this little sewing machine to my heart. I don't sew a lot and hence this little one is good enough for me to add a small bow to my daughter's dress, make the pants/shirts little tighter if needed etc. For a professional stitcher or for those who sew ""a lot"", I don't recommend this product.",4.0
"I don't believe this unit deserves all the negative reviews that it has gotten. Much to my delight this gizmo was able to do basic sewing after a bit of practice on my part.  It is capable of sewing light fabrics using the materials provided.  For heavier fabric like pants, you really need to use your own thread.  Otherwise, it's useless.  As another poster noted, you might want to buy your own needles as well, though I haven't tried that. This unit paid for itself after I hemmed three pairs of pants!  Not bad for an absolutely basic sewing machine.",4.0
"I received everything from the 100 piece set to the foot pedal to the plug in adapter. I followed the direction completely as it was written. I had a problem when i switched to a different material of similar strength, and got a bad understitching, but once i adjusted the tension it was great. The book even tells you when to adjust the tension. I made a small little bag and put some pottpouri in it. It's good for making pillow cases and small projects. You can't control the speed effectively, but i still love it. I've never sewn or hemmed anything before, and it was a great experience. I did have a bobbin problem, but after i kept trying --i finally got it. I've got small hands good for guiding the material, but i was thinking it probably would be harder to use if someone were to have bigger hands. Patience is the key.",4.0

"All of my art teachers recommend Prismacolor colored pencils. I just wish I lived close enough to an art store that stocked replacements. It's hard to shell out $4.00 in shipping charges for each different color that I order. But, that's life in the boonies. This Sunburst yellow color works well for sunflowers, if you're into colored pencil art.",4.0
I love the non photo blue concept but Ive yet to figure out how to use it on a new scanner. However its possible to edit out the blue in photoshop or Manga Studio for a clean ink over. I suggest you pay extra for faster shipping other wise you gotta wait a bit. Maybe I was too anxious. Love them though!,4.0
"I was dismayed when this pencil arrived in a simple cardboard envelope. It was tightly in there, but that doesn't stop the shipper from throwing it, piling heavy things on top of it, etc. After reading other reviews of these pencils I knew they are fragile inside. And indeed, when I attempted to sharpen the pencil, I had to resharpen it 3 times (using the Prismacolor sharpener) before I could get it to a point because the lead was broken and kept falling off. Really disappointing, but I'm sure I'll enjoy using the rest of the pencil as it is a pretty color.",4.0
This thread is a little thicker then I thought it would be but it is  a good quality product. I am using it now and am very pleased with how it works up. I probably will try different colors in the future.,4.0

"As described and shipped fast. They work good. I accidentally left the cap not completely closed on one and it dried. I touched the tip to water and it and it started working again. They will eventually round off on edge as they are felt like tips, but they last a long time if you don't press too hard on them. Will buy again.",4.0
Good product. Used for students and not a big budget. Good quality for the price and let kids try out calligraphy.,4.0
Gives clean lines and writes very clearly.  The standard sharpies lost their sharp point quickly these  hold up very well.,4.0

"I ordered these pens for a class art project doing Illuminate Manuscripts with calligraphy. It worked like a charm, since I have 12 kids in the class. Using these pens was a great solution for my delima, since I didn't have the budget to give each kid a fancy set. These are sharpie markers with a chisel point, and they gave the kids a great feel for the early monks and the calligraphy that they created in the Illuminated Manuscripts.",4.0
"I have always avoided felt-tip calligraphy pens because of fuzziness of the line, but I like these for practice.  They do not dry out as others  have.  The line is not as sharp as a metal nib, of course, but with the right paper it leaves a nice, sharp edge.  I can keep it in my pocket and doodle with it or write impressive (if large-lettered) notes.  The line is dark enough for me even though it's water-based.",4.0
Love this type of lint roller.  Works wonderfully and you don't have to have refills.  Just rinse and it's ready to go again.  Bought two-one for the suitcase and one for home,4.0
"I've only had this product for a short time by it seems to work pretty well. I have to wash it more often than I expected but overall, it works well compared to a tape lint roller.",4.0
"It's clear as day that it says SOLD INDIVIDUALLY. Look at all the color choices. Again, they are clearly sold individually as a replacement of a color you have used a lot. I buy what pencil I need when I am getting low on a particular color. The price is a little high. I wish it was more like $2.00, but it's Prismacolor, which equals good quality, which equals more expensive. As far as lead falling out, I've had this happen with every brand I try on a pencil or two. It's par for the course. I did switch from a cheap sharpener to a better one and have less problems with lead breakage or rough edges. Also, if you push the pencil too far down with force, this can cause lead breakage.",4.0
"I find these to be best scissors and very easy to use, no matter left or right handed.  They precision cut, very shape.  An improvement I would like to see is a plastic blade cover, which would be very helpful.",4.0
"These little scissors are great for what I bought them for - cutting curves and other small places where larger scissors are awkward.  They mostly live up to what I expect from Fiskars, in that they are comfortable to hold, make clean, precise cuts, and the spring action makes them easy to use.  Unfortunately, the orange locking button broke off after only a few days of use, and now they cannot be stored in the closed position.  I will be able to deal with that so I will not be returning them.",4.0
"I like it because it is easier on the thumbs for cutting.  Less stress on the thumbs is what I need.

I only wish that the blades were a little longer.",4.0
"Fiskars have always been at the top of my list for scissors. I have always found them to be value for money spent, easy to use, and high performers.
