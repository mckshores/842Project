"flimsy
not good for harsh weather condition
sticks to car
pull off at your own risk
may take the paint off with it
you get what you pay for",2.0
"I chose the correct length for my car but it does not fit well, and there's no way to fasten this thing. Gone with wind.",2.0
Leaves particles,2.0
"Doesn't fit a 2007 Grand Prix GT...need to work on your fitment software.  I think it will fit my son's Z/28 and I can use his cover that was too big last winter, otherwise it will be returned.",2.0
Disappointing,2.0
"I am really surprised, the cover material is completely coming to shreds after about 5 month of use. My car stays outside under the sun, so I suspect the material is getting very hot. I will try the warranty to see if they send me a new one.",2.0
"I used this to cover my car in the driveway while I was away at my summer job. The fit was fine, I was content that I was protecting my car from UV damage. I covered it at the end of April.  By July my neighbor sent me a photo.  The cover had been totally shredded by the elements. He asked if he could remove the eyesore that was no longer doing its job. I do not recommend this cover for long use.",2.0
"I have used rainx for years, I love it. However, I think they are cheap rascals because the company does not put a washer under the cap to keep it from leaking all over the place. So, either buy a washer to place under the cap, place in another container or put up with the leakage and smell in your car.",2.0
Received with about a quarter missing. The seal was broken and it appeared to have leaked in the packaging.,2.0
I thought that it was going to be easier to put on and off and the material scratches the paint a little bit,2.0
bad,2.0
rip on the first day,2.0
didn't last more than 3 months under a California Burlingame sun. I would recommend spending more and get a quality cover - sometimes you get what you pay for - in this case I'd agree.,2.0
Don't use this on your front windshield. Has a haze and glare from oncoming headlights that is a safety problem. On sides and back probably okay.,2.0
"Bought this a couple months back. Really liked the fit, was easy to put on my Cadillac SRX 2006 Base model.

But like other people have said, it's not very tough material. As soon as summer hit (~100 degrees Farenheit here in Tucson, AZ) it literally started to disintegrate. So that's $40 for 2 months of protection. Better luck next time.

TLDR: Don't buy this if you live in a place that has over 100 degree weather. It's lightweight, basic protection. That's it.",2.0
Material is very flimsy. Cover blows off in the wind. Developed tears after a short time. Then started to fall apart altogether.,2.0
This thing fits my 99 chrysler 300M but when hooking bungie to bottom to keep it on top of car because it will blow off it ripped the wholes that the bungies were suppose to go through. Very thin. I think if you take great care of it and are lucky and there is no wind ever where you live then it may last 8 months to a year,2.0
The cover is impossible to put on alone and there isn't a hole for the antenna to go through.  Not great.,2.0
"I don't like it because it's so big and I can not set it up by myself. I must call my friends to help me to set it up. And when I take it out, it is difficult to compress.  Even I return it that I can not to find a box that has enough space to  fix it.",2.0
"Be warned! The B-5 cover I purchased last year for my '77 Toronado was perfect, if a little baggy. So imagine my surprise when I ordered two more recently only to discover some inconsistencies...primarily they no longer fit large cars! I ended up moving my original cover to my '59 Cadillac where it fits comfortably over the large fins, and putting one of the new B-5's on the Toro, where it just barely covers bumper to bumper.  A friend also ordered a new B-5 recently and had to tear holes to get it over the fins of his '60 Cad.

The two latest, ill-fitting, B-5 covers have Budge tags, but only one says Budge on the front, the other says Style: B-5 on the front. Oddly, the generic looking one has a stitched swatch on the front like the original, and the one marked Budge is just stamped onto the fabric. The material appears identical but is a slightly different gray from the proper ones. One of the bags came with a drawstring while the other had it cost reduced out and used a fabric strap, yet both came in Budge boxes with identical part numbers. If they weren't both clearly marked as 5's, I would have wagered they were size 4's.",2.0
"Don't know what fabric this is made of, but it ripped a month or so after I got it.  My Lexus has has the GPS antenna on the roof like most new cars.  The cover caught on it when removing and it ripped.  Now it sits in a bundle on the garage floor.",2.0
"Worked for about 6 months before it just started coming apart.  I live in Southern California, so it very seldomly rains and the temperature never wavers between 65 and 75 degrees.  Nevertheless, this thing had the consistency of tissue paper after 6 months- it would literally crumble in your hands when you tried to lift it off the car.",2.0
"This might be fine for indoor use, but it is not suitable for any vehicle that will kept outdoors.

Pros:

Fit my Jeep like a glove
Looks great
Easy to install
Keeps debris, water, etc off of vehicle.

Con:

After about 4 months of mild outdoor weather tears started.
NOT suitable for outdoor use",2.0
"Yes it causes rain to pearl, but these pearls only fly off at speeds higher than what I thought. Most of my driving is <40mph, and the pearls just accumulate and that requires me to run the wipers, defeating the rainx purpose. Actually my wipers clean the windshield better without rainex, with rainex applied I get streaks. Anyway, I tested this on the highway too, and around 70mph and above you get an amazing effect where the pearls simply fly off quickly enough that you do not need to run the wipers. That's cool. If you do mostly 70mph+ driving in the rain then this product would be good. I prefer to have good wipers, an no such wax applied to my windshield so the wipers run as clean as possible for my city type of driving.",2.0
I originally purchased this for a gift.  In Florida we have the rainy season and thought this might help keep the water off the top of the convertible.  NOPE!  It is not waterproof by any means.  One shower and it was wet and so was the top of the car.,2.0
"Not waterproof. , The material is too thin, use soon, there are many holes, oxidation or may not withstand wear and tear. Only suitable for indoor use.",2.0
"Already using it for my car washer fluid. Bought it again for shower door to prevent build up of hard water stains which I removed using A-Maz....It probably helps by 20%... not impressive.

Pros:
It does make a difference (I applied two layers)
It works better on car windshield at high speeds, since the wind blows the water drops.

Cons:
Doesn't repel (as opposed to NeverWet)...water drops stay on the glass and when they dry they leave marks... probably 20% less but not that impressive.
For car windshield it leaves a bit of a haze which can be buffed away, however it becomes visible during night specially when it's raining.",2.0
Should have known better. This is really a cheap cover. Had one previously and it was constructed much better than this. This is one oftheproblems with buying sight unseen. I'll use it until it tears then replaceit with a better one from Pep Boys or Auto Zone.,2.0
Bought this to be able to attach my BBQ to my 5th wheel propane tanks. The hose diameter is too small over the 15' distance and the resulting loss of pressure results in a very small flame.,2.0
I chose this size by going through the steps and amazon told me it was the right size. When I put it on my 2003 Camry it appears to be a little bit too small. Some parts on the sides are still exposed. Doesn't completely cover my car. Still have 2 stars because the quality isn't bad.,2.0
said it fit my car. almost doesn't work. I had to clip the front to my license plate. it will keep out pine needles and leaves. it's better than nothing. made in china.,2.0
I bought this to cover a Buick Roadmaster that does not get driven often and to keep sap and birds off of the car.  It is a very tight fit even though the dimensions should work.  It blows off easily in any wind and we have a good bit of wind.  We have a difficult time keeping it secure.,2.0
"Very cheap and ripped and came off during first high wind. May be ok to protact something from dust in an inclosed area, but wouldn't recommend for outside protection. But you also get what you pay for. In this case, it is true.",2.0
"This isn't like the Budge car cover I bought about three years ago, which I really like. With elastic all around the edge, this new one is very difficult to put on the car. My old one has elastic only on the ends and is very easy to put on my car.",2.0
"This cover fits our Miata perfectly, and the weave of the material does a pretty good job of keeping dust off the car. But while the ad states that the cover is ""water repellant"", we've quickly found that the ad should read ""water permeable"" as it completely fails to keep even light rain off the car. If you're looking for a cover to keep your car dry; keep looking--this isn't the cover for you.",2.0
"Fit well for my mgb. Falls apart less than a year under Florida sun. Now need to buy another one, different brand.",2.0
"This cover didn't match the description.  I was looking for a cover to fit a 2005 Jetta.  This one fit the qualifications but when it came it was too small for the car.  The material repels water well and is semi-durable,  I wish it fit, I am returning it.",2.0
I bought this to keep the drippings of trees off my 2010 Ford Focus and it is NOT long enough to fit from bumper to bumper.  Otherwise it would have been fine.,2.0
"I tried this product a long time ago. Yes, it repels water, that's for sure. If your wipers die on a rainy day, this can help keep the windshield clear. Now turn on the window wipers as normal on a rainy day...and the wipers smear the water around, and it just causes a murky, hazy, smeary look that obscures your vision. My wife was in the car and was really disappointed too. A shame! It's probably good for windows that don't have wipers, like your sunroof or side windows, for instance.",2.0
"The water just ends up beading up on your windows and you can't see out anyway- instead of increasing visibility I think it actually decreased it for me. This was especially a problem on my rear window, which doesn't have a wiper. Also when the sun hits the windshield things are sort of fuzzy and I can see where it was rubbed into the glass (even though I cleaned thoroughly before application and followed all instructions). It just didn't work quite the way it was advertised and I'm not a fan of the effect it had on my windows; will not be purchasing again.",2.0
Thought they were bigger. These are shot glasses next the tranny funnel,2.0
"Greatly reduced visibility during night storms, caused excessive fogging, boyfriend was freaking out while driving because he couldn't see anything. Scrubbed it all off with rubbing alcohol the next day for safety reasons. I don't get it, I used this stuff like 10 years ago and it was great, but now I wouldn't risk using it again.",2.0
"It did not work AT ALL on shower door as advertised. I wrote to the company to say it didn't work. They told me to try it again and use two coats. Water did not bead up, only fogged the door",2.0
"Tried it many years ago.  Hoped it would have improved.  Did half the windshield.  When driving under street lights at night in a light rain, the RAIN-x half looked foggy, and the untreated half was clearer.",2.0
Cost of this small funnel is to much for the size.,2.0
"This is very strange.

Years ago, I had a small metal can of this stuff, and it was like magic!
You could literally be driving in a rain storm and not use your wipers.

I finally decided it was time to try it again. Not sure why I waited so long.

With this new bottle, something just isn't the same.

Back in the day, I remember quite a bit of haze on the window, and the effort required to apply it.  It was tough, but worth it.

Also, it was fun applying it, because it was so interesting to see the water bead off it.  It looked like mercury in those old thermometers, or that black alien stuff from The X-Files.

However, this time around, it was different.  Very little haze.  It didn't seem to smell as potent, and the water didn't bead so much.

There is something strange going on here!  I can't believe this is the same formulation as in the past.

I also had to use a lot more of it to get any effect.

Another reviewer mentioned the same thing.  This is not the same as it used to be.

Maybe I have to find the product in that little metal can again.  I always loved rain-x, so I am not sure what it up with this product.

If anyone has similar experiences, please post them...",2.0
Pour opening too small for motor oil.  Good for Power steering fluid.,2.0
"While this will function as a funnel for a gas can it is EXTREMELY small.  I would not recommend it for fueling up your car.  Much better suited for a lawnmower or snowblower.  For the price, I feel very irritated at what I received.",2.0
When screwing this in it was dented by my filter wrench. Metal is thin an susceptible to denting. Audi oem filter when compared to this has stronger metal. Would  it buy again.,2.0
funnel? Too small to hold any volume- not clearly described.,2.0
"I bought this thinking that it would work well but it isn't beading the rain drops as much as another brand we use to buy but don't get anymore. It works out quickly, in about a week or so.",2.0
I bought this to coat the interior of my glass shower wall.  I followed directions and there was no visible difference.  I had high hopes after some reviews I read but it was a bust.  Wish I could return product.,2.0
Wouldn't fit over the lug nut and I threw it in a pile with more garage sale stuff.,2.0
"Very hard to get key to work. Must pull key out slightly and try, wiggle, try, wiggle, try. First Master brand I have ever had a complaint with. Not up to their normal quality.",2.0
"It's a fine product, but the day after I bought it on Amazon I saw it in an auto parts store for $1.10. Wish I'd gone local with this one.",2.0
"has taken the finish off of part of my faucet.  Use ""faucet wax +"" from the same company instead because it isn't abrasive and won't take off the finish.",2.0
Put lock on wheel and now the keys will not open it. Think twice,2.0
Didn't fit my tire,2.0
don't expect much from this lock. you might as well have nothing on for protection. Cheap and not secure at all.,2.0
"Not very pleased with this product. Besides being very expensive - you need to purchase at least two of these overly priced tubes to procure the color change you're attempting acquire.

Don't recommend and will NOT purchase again.",2.0
"Great idea/concept, but not for all applications, I suppose.  Lock latch wouldn't engage backing plate.  Had to return it, look for something else. FYI, the hardware this unit was mounting over was probably too large, the threaded shank being 1/2'"".  Anything smaller may have worked.",2.0
"This did not work for my boat.  Went on horribly.  Looks awful.  I use other Meguiar  products on my car and they are great.  I do not know what happened, but thought others should know my experience.",2.0
"It was easy to apply, but too small.  The edges didn't reach/fit under my iPhone case.  Also, I dropped my phone and now the edges around the top and home button are cracked and jagged. I'm so afraid I'm going to cut or get a glass shard in my finger.  I'll take plastic over glass any day.",2.0
Will not fit in deep well.,2.0
"The material is too flimsy, a piece broke off during shipment.",2.0
had to adapt it to get it to work on a longer stud,2.0
Over-priced,2.0
"A good concept, but hard to attach and then to get back off, and it's very easily bent.",2.0
Cheap,2.0

Does not work for a jeep spare tire.,2.0
Too small for what I needed.,2.0
The sticker on the outside was the hardest thing to remove I have ever encountered and after trying gasoline to try and remove the film and failing this thing met the bottom of our trash can.,2.0
"This is a flimsy piece of junk. The locking tabs barely engage the base that mounts under the lug nut, and in my application, the top housing lifts up enough to be able pry it off.",2.0
didnt work,2.0
The unit was much smaller  than it showed,2.0
Bought to try out on a used ipod classic with medium to light scratches on the screen. Only noticed a little improvement on light scratches. Wouldn't buy again.,2.0
Returned for a better quality product.,2.0
This is way smaller than what you expect. This can be used to fill bottles but not if you plan to pour larger quantities.,2.0
too small for my lug nut on MB sprinter,2.0
very el-cheapo,2.0
"You get what you pay for, very cheap quality. It funnels well though...if that's what you're into",2.0
"Did not fit, needed a different type of lock.",2.0
"The lock seems to be decent quality material, but the locking design is not great, and it is sloppy and loose. I put a zip tie around it to help the flopping, but it only cuts it down, it will not eliminate it.. My lock is on a boat trailer, so the rattling is far from the cab. If you put this on a spare tire on you car or jeep, it might drive you crazy.",2.0
Quite flimsy. Although I have purchased 4 of these to put on spare tires of trailers we make I really don't think they offer stout security.,2.0
"I have a Suzuki Jimny. The spare tire is held on with 19mm round top nuts. This lock fits on with no problem but there is too much play - its loose and shakes around. By moving it you can create a large space to stick a flat head screwdriver in and pry it off. This is a deterrent, like a dummy security camera, but gives little protection.",2.0
I don't know what they had in mind when they made this but I can tell you this would not keep anything secure. Very dissappointed!,2.0
A little flimsy,2.0
was difficult to get to lock on lug once tire mounted had to grind away some of lock but made work,2.0
"Does what it's supposed to do but I really did expect something a bit heavier duty from Master Lock. I'm not sure it would take much of a hammer to break it off. If I did it over I would have bought one of those HD braided cable locks to protect the spare tire instead of this. Sorry Master Lock but it looks like you have fallen into the cheapo products category now too.
Don't manufactures realize we would rather pay a bit more and get something GOOD?",2.0
Very cheap,2.0
"Never been disappointed with a Master Lock product before this, but this just doesn't live up to the quality I expect from Master Lock!
Cheap pot metal and cheap keys, definitely would not buy again.",2.0
Only works on certain rim styles. DOES NOT FIT JEEP WRANGLER WHEELS,2.0
It would be better if it actually fit on my lug nuts. I have a  2012 wrangler sport. The lugs were too long to fit in the lock.,2.0
"Bought for my trailer, however it does not fit the aluminum wheels on the trailer.  It will not fit within the lug nut holes.

Don't look for this to stop the determined thief as I am sure it can be pried off fairly easly.",2.0
The base won't clear the ridge around the lug hole so the top can't be secured. The base should be slightly recessed inside the cover but the raised ridge on the wheel keeps the cover from engaging the base plate far enough.,2.0
Was not even able to use it the funne was to large for my Hyundai sonata engine oil opening and gas tank opening seems like a quality product that would work with almost all vehicles,2.0
This lock did not work as the feed through hole for stud is way to small for any stud that I have ever seen. Very cheaply made for being a master lock,2.0
To small and it leaves part of the rubber tire exposed,2.0
"Bought this for my spare tire on my utility trailer. Very inexpensive (cheap), flimsy and loose fitting. Seems like it can be broken off easily. Will probably end up getting a cable lock. This device doesn't really give me a sense of security. I suppose for only five bucks you get what you pay for.",2.0
Didn't fit my tire rim.  I wish there would have been more specifiic details regarding the type of rim the lock fits on.  I was really frustrated!  Now I have to start looking all over again to buy something else.,2.0
"For the purposes listed, I thought this funnel would be great, and if it were $1, it would be, but it is overpriced by 500% for what it is. It is very small, and since the size information for items on amazon is hardly ever accurate, I assumed it would be 3 times the size that it is.",2.0
"Nice lock, but don't fit my spare. I have chrome rims from the factory and this lock don't even come close to going on the lug!",2.0
"As always, arrived quickly from Amazon.  I have preferred Master Lock products.  However, I am surprised they would put their name to this item.  The housing does not fit tight to the lug nut.  There is a full one-third inch gap that would allow a point of leverage to pry the lock from the wheel.  It is flimsy enough to do such.  It will also rattle around, due to the floppy fit and is aestetically unattractive.  The top of the housing appears to dangle.  Will buy a cable lock instead.",2.0
"I bought this item in hopes of being able to keep the key with me, rather than try to hide the standard lug nut lock key in my car. I thought this was a great idea, however this lock does not fit over the lug nut for the spare tire on the Jeep Wrangler 2011. It would have been helpful if they listed the vehicles (with model year) that this lock would fit, or offer an option to buy a lug nut for your vehicle. So over all great concept, but poor execution for this product.",2.0
It does what it's supposed to do. I think I over paid for it though. It was like 7 dollars for a piece of plastic.,2.0
This funnel is very handy to have in the garage. Just do yourself a favor and get it at Wally world for about $1,2.0
"Well, I think it was just an overrated wax.  It made the colors better but did not restore badly faded colors as it was advertised.  I bought this because I couldn't get the Starbrite brand sent to Alaska.",2.0
"This item was disappointingly small.  I know that I assumed and what that means, but I think that they should have had a small side note on the description that this would be best used on a Vespa.  However, I will use it for small liquids.",2.0
Cheap plastic...,2.0
"This look pretty good at first but then it started to bubble up and flake off  less then 1 year old. Would not recommend, Have replaced with a different product,",2.0
We followed directions yet it never really set up and hardened.  My husband is an art teacher and we have done many home projects and have used epoxy type items so I don't think the issue was the way we were mixing it.,2.0
"Instructions poor, and the amounts to mix together are in fl.oz, which is hard to gauge given these are pastes in tubes. Also, it's more translucent that hoped for: the dark Fiberglas under still shows through, so while the spot is repaired it also still shows.",2.0
Didn't do very good sealing a gasoline fitting,2.0
They claim on the packaging that it is gas resistant but it is not.  If you look at the data sheet on their website it clearly states that gasoline will dissolve it.  Don't use it for anything that will come in contact with gasoline unless you really like doing the repair over again and having gas leak all over the place.,2.0
"I had a tiny leak on the bottom of my gas tank.

I'd read that Seal-All was easier to use and just as good as the epoxy gas tank repair compounds.  After all, it actually says gas resistant on the label.  Unfortunately, Seal-All doesn't appear to resist dissolving in gas at all.

I had a hairpin crack at on the bottom of my tank on the edge of a divot.  So tiny that it dripped maybe once every 5 minutes.  It was about 1/1000 mm wide and 1 mm long - so imagine the tiniest crack you can get.

I ran the tank empty, angled the car on stand to make sure the remaining gas did not come out, then cleaned and applied Seal-All.

For the first 24 hours it worked and it adhered well to the area around the leak too.  Then the area were the tiny crack was started to go from clear to white and bubble.  Then gas began to seep from under the 2"" round patch I'd made.  I made the patch that big to ensure adhesion on a possible seep leak, but after it started coming out the whole path was subverted with gas.  In the end, the adhesive area that had initially turned white from gas contact became so gooey gas leaked directly from center of the path too.

The product is absolutely and unequivocally, not what 'common sense' would call gas resistant.  If you only need it to hold for 24 hours before dissolving, this is the product for you.  Otherwise, get an epoxy sealant for applications involving exposure to gasoline.

I gave it two stars, because it does glue other things well.  You'll find other comments here and elsewhere about this failure to hold back gasoline.",2.0
"had a small plastic gas tank leak that was too large for melting fix; thought seal-all was perfect; it's not; small print on package says ""not recommended for use on polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene ..."" Many gas tanks are one of these products. Product review doesn't say that.",2.0
OK,2.0
Didn't seem to help faded gel coat,2.0
"I'm happy with the product, I've bought it a few times.
Just gripes me that they no longer ship the red tube with it any longer.",2.0
"This product does not arrive as described in the vendor's information.  The vendor information states that two lug nuts are included in the packaging, however, they are not.  One of two things needs to happen, either the vendor corrects their product description or they start including the lug nuts.  A trip to the local hardware store was all that was needed to purchase two, half inch fine thread nuts which now allows this product to do what it was purchased to do.  The low review is due to the miss information provided by the vendor, otherwise this works exactly as it should.",2.0
"Received without nuts needed to mount it. Ordered this and received it before my wheel arrived which was back ordered and didn't realize that the nuts were missing until I received the spare wheel/tire today and tried to mount on my trailer. Since I am beyond my shipping return window I am stuck with it. Threads are non standard as well and local hardware stores do not carry that size nut/thread combination. Make sure you check packaging and confirm all parts are there as soon as you receive this or you will end up with a useless piece of hardware, at least the lock works, 2 stars for that!",2.0
"Can't really recommend them. I was about 230 pounds at the time and all the cushions fell off 2 of these within a month or two of heavy use. Then I had to always fiddle around with them to try and keep the the cushions in place under my butt or to them from blowing away while trailering. Turned out it wasn't worth all the effort. What a shame. These would be the best cheap lightweight boat seats on the planet if they could figure out how to permanently attach the cushions. The plastic ""snaps"" they use now (or whatever they are) just don't hold up. On the plus side, the seats themselves are very durable and should last years and years. they are also comfortable enough without the cushions, so I say just buy the cheaper version that doesn't have cushions till this gets corrected.",2.0
"It's not really automatic, i have this connected to a 12v 110ah AGM battery, when i plug it it charge the battery but when it start mantainer mode sometimes just stop and red light start to blink and not passing charge, if you don't notice this and unplug and plug to start again then in a few hours your charge will be drained",2.0
I guess I expected it to do what it was supposed to....it kept the odors down but it did not break up the waste like I thought it would. Not sure if I would buy this again or recommend it to anyone either.,2.0
Two of the three components (locks) would not work in my applocation.  The hitch receiver Lock was too short and the hitch losk (for trailer hich lock lever) was also too short.  Could not use two out of three components.,2.0
"Disappointed, not nearly as good as powder for breaking down solids, or odor prevention !",2.0
"The rings do not fit a regular car battery, so it required modification.  Clearly made for small applications.",2.0
"It lasted a little less than one year, then just died! No reason, looked at it one day and not working.",2.0
"did not break down tissue, waste or control odor.  Very disappointing.",2.0
"It doesn't recharge dead batteries.. it will maintain a charge on an already charged battery, but even that is iffy.",2.0
"It charges but is the noisiest charger I have ever had , Makes a loud buzzing and vibrates , not sure why I have tried to mount it differently and with rubber mounts but is still noisy",2.0
This thing is huge. I couldn't find a suitable mounting location for it so I returned it for a traditional style trickle charger.,2.0
States it is for marine use. After reading the instructions you have to remove the battery from the boat.,2.0
Bought this for maintaining a 12V Boat battery. Charger quit working and actually started draining battery before it was a year old. I think I'll avoid Shumacher products from now on.,2.0
Lasted about a year would not recommend From what I have seen this is normal for this product,2.0
This item didn't even last a year and what the fun part about all this I get one from harbor freight for less money and has last more then10 years .,2.0
I have a 2010 Ford Expedition that I only drive a couple times a month and I wanted to use this to maintain the battery between uses.  It needs a longer power cord and better mounting bracket and the battery connectors are oversized and need to be replaced before you can use them.,2.0
Hooked it up to the battery in my truck and left it for a couple days.  Went to start my truck and it wouldn't start.  The charger drained my battery.  I cut the wires as I'm not going to keep jumping my truck every time I want to drive it somewhere.  It shouldn't drain your battery.,2.0
"Not impressed - stiff, drags across car instead of sliding, not really that absorbent. I have an older artificial chamois that is infinitely better.",2.0

"I bought an SE-1-12S a couple years ago and like it, so i tried to buy another.

It seems to have been superseded by the SE-1-12S-CA.

This new version looks the same but weighs less than half as much. My presumption is that the charge circuitry in the old version is inductive (uses transformers or coils for major funcitonality) while the new version is more capacitive (uses more caps, probably depends on switch-mode conversion). I have no qualms about the choice of technology, either can be done right or wrong.

The new version could be made much smaller, however, and there are certainly people who would appreciate that in some applications.

The problem is that my new one does not appear to switch into the maintenance mode.

It's my understanding that the se-1-12s is a true 'float' charger, meaning that after a regular charge cycle, it continues to deliver continuous current and can immediately respond to a drop in voltage by switching back to the high current charge mode. This style is preferred by people who plug in so that they can use 12v accessories when the engine is not running without fear of draining the battery.

Some battery maintainers have a built-in timer that is activated when the charge cycle completes, and only checks the battery voltage again after the timer has expired - many products use a 24 hour timer, so they maintain charge by charging the battery a maximum of 1 time per day. This will not allow the use of 12v accessories when the engine isn't running - the battery will simply drain.

The SE-1-12S-CA does not appear to be a float charger. Or maybe mine is defective.

I bought this 2nd unit because i have a diesel vehicle that is not working well that i am working on from time to time. It has trouble starting so it may need to crank a long time, and because the compression of diesel engines is 4-5 times as much as gas engines, diesel starters use more current, and since the engine won't fire unless the starter cranks at full speed, a drop in voltage will prevent starting. There is also the glow heating cycle to consider, with each glow plug drawing several amps. Diesel engines depend more on the cranking amps delivered by the battery.

The diesel vehicle i am working on may also have a current drain issue when switched off. Which makes a true float charger even more important in the interim.

I installed the SE-1-12S-CA in my diesel, plugged it in, and then i didn't have time to work on it again for a week.

When i went to crank it over today, i only had enough juice to start it once.

When i checked the charger, no LEDs were lit. I unplugged it and plugged it back in. No change. I unplugged it, waited a few seconds, and plugged it back in. Then the red charging LED lit up.

On my other vehicle with the previous SE-1-12S version installed, if it is plugged in there is always an LED lit up, and i have watched it switch automatically between modes.

So on Monday i will get on the phone with Schumacher to ask if my SE-1-12S-CA is defective, and will see if i can send it back. I had to replace the ring terminals on the cable to install it, though, which might prove to be a very disappointing problem.

As it is now, I can't recommend this product.",2.0

"I was looking for a small onboard battery charger to trickle charge a small car, King Midget, that doesn't get driven enough to keep the battery completely charged. So far it's worked as advertised. It's small and light weight so I was able to attach it to the outside of the plastic case holding the battery. Unlike other reviews, I didn't mind the 6 inch AC cord as I didn't have to worry about a longer cord becoming undone and wrapping around the chain drive.

It worked well for six months and suddenly stopped working. I'm going to try another one as I liked the size.

"I have a 33' long 5th wheel trailer that's 12' high.  After having extensively worked this unit over with 3M's fiberglass gelcoat restorer and wax, a task that took considerable effort over more than a week of chipping away at it, I was happy with the results.  That said, I live in the desert and figured a good coat of Mequire's Flagship Boat product would be beneficial if for nothing else as to add in some UV protection (this product touts that as a key attribute).  So a couple of weeks after the 3M work I applied this product to my large trailer and the results were extremely disappointing.

My trailer is white gelcoat and after having applied this product I could see a white 'haze' over much of the surface the product was applied on.  When i started out the surface was pretty much a mirror finish, but now had a slight haze on them, very disappointing.  I went back over the entire unit to ensure I had buffed it all off well enough but that didn't seem to do anything.  After being on the coach for about a month now I'm resigned to the fact I need to go back over everything again with some carnuba-based product (which is frustrating given the effort required).  A sample area I have already re-waxed with Mequires ""cleaner wax"" (a carnuba product) brought back the high luster that the Flagship Marine Wax screwed up.

Bottom line for me is I'm going to stay with carnuba products and most likely the 3M line as those have proven to work well for me over a 10+ year period (you just have to be careful with hard water around them or it'll get stripped off).",2.0

"I'm quite an avid automotive detailer, and strive to keep my Corvette Z06 in showroom condition which is difficult with how many miles I put on it. So regular washes are necessary to keep the grime off. I had previously been using a microfiber type drying towel, which was lent to a friend who never returned it. So before washing my car one day I ran over to Autozone and purchased on of these 'Absorbers'. While it is good at removing the large buildups of water on a vehicles surfaces, it is not good for final streak free drying. No matter how hard you wring this Absorber out, it still leaves water streaks. I had to run out to find a suitable drying towel and re-wash my car to remove the dozens of water spots the absorber left. Since using it, I have purchased a ""Carrand 40059AS Microfiber MAX Supreme Deep Pile Fiber Drying Towel"" through Amazon, and my goodness what a difference. So now I use the absorber for removing the bulk of water from my Z06, then finish up with the Carrand Drying Towel.",2.0
"I found that the spacing of the bars doesn't fit my rims.  I have 5 bolt, 15 inch rims which are pretty standard.  The bar end spacing doesn't fit the spacing of the holes in the rim.  The item description says it will fit basically any rim, but it apparently doesn't.  I had read some other reviews elsewhere that said the same thing, but I took a chance on it anyway.  In my case, I made a flat bar to span the two bar ends and was able to adapt the carrier to lock through the decorative holes in the rim instead, and still use the locking brackets on top.  My trailer has an angled 2 inch square brace that I can lay the tire on so the Fulton carrier doesn't carry the full weight of the tire, so it's reasonably secure.  I would have had better mounting options if the bar had fit the hole spacing in the first place.",2.0

"Not worth it.  I already lost one of these.  Pay more and getter the better one.  These don't stay on the plug very well.  Fit loose.  And then then large loop that connects to the wire that's supposed to be a retainer (when not covering the plug) is also too loose.  Completely fell off a couple times in the driveway before I lost it completely.  So it fails to protect the plug from the elements, therefore fails in its purpose.",2.0

"I hate it, is not fair, but this product was very underwhelming. I purchased it specifically to get out some minor hazing on my headlights and did next to nothing if not make it worse. I then tried using it for other things around the house, just to see if maybe my headlights were too messed up and I was using it incorrectly, but nope, it still sucked...

I tried it on the dashboard plastic cover over my speedometer and such and it made no difference, if not add some swirls. I tried it on the plexiglass from the side of my antec computer case, which was well scratched, and it did not remove any swirls or even fine scratches. It did however, clean it pretty good. It's hard to explain, but I thought it would work like a cd scratch remover and get rid of some of those small scratches and in all times I used it, it did nothing like that.

Very disappointing, but Amazon was great and they returned my cost on the product. Thanks amazon for being so great!",2.0
Did not fit my plugs to small.,2.0

did not really work as it was supposed to. No real changes following application. Not worth the money spent on such product,2.0

"I used my entire bottle of mothers plastic polish on my 08 Honda Fit's headlights, taillights, sidemarkers, and visors and was MUCH MUCH better in all categories. Application method, composition, protection, and longevity. Spend a buck or 2 more and get yourself the Mother's brand. The mother's brand applies like standard wax, wax on, haze, wax off. The Mequiar's goes on and has to be buffed off before it dries, I am not fond of this method of application.

I am not knocking Mequiar's because they have other amazing car products that I use, including NXT paste, but there is a better alternative to this.",2.0
"Not as I imagined, but it helps for small areas only, can't let you feel big deference before and after using it.. this is my own experience, maybe because i'm not professional and it need someone with certain kind of experience to do it right. at the end seller suppose to provide you after purchasing with needed information about how to use this product properly well",2.0
"I used this product a few times on one of my headlights that was starting to oxidize and it covered up the problem, but within a few washes and a few more applications, it actually made the oxidation worse. Maybe I used it incorrectly, I'm not really sure, but I haven't used it since. That headlight was eventually restored by a professional and then replaced as it got damaged in an accident. I do like Meguiars products, just not this one. My other headlight is starting to look a little shabby and I decided to use Ultimate Compound by Meguiars and it has done a much better job. I also used it on my girlfriend's and dad's headlights and the Ultimate Compound really cleared away the oxidation. I then followed that with some carnauba wax, very nice.",2.0
I washed my headlights and proceeded to polish with this product for an hour and saw no improvements. I will go back to the traditional method of restoration.,2.0
Although this product seems to be rated highly by other buyers it fell way short of my expectations. My van is 5 years old and does not have severe discoloration but this product removed very little of it. I advise using one of the heavier duty products.,2.0
I received these and afraid to use. The ball goes on the shaft and a screw on top turns maybe 1/4 to lock or unlock. If the hitch is on top and that screw on top gets turned the trailer is coming off and causing an accident. Pin to hold ball should not be a screw and should be on the side.,2.0
"I didn't know you had 3 differint types of the cleaner. This one if for very lite haze. You would need the one with heavy haze to fix the headlites the right way. I haven't even tried this yet, but know it won't work well.",2.0
"This product did work... Some. I have a 2005 vow jetta out in California and the headlamps were pretty bad and one needed replacement. There my reference is pretty accurate. Comparing the 'repaied' with the new, this product only restores to about 50% of the original. This might be acceptable to simply improve 2 existing but looks obviously different aside a new headlamp.",2.0
"I bought this Cleaner because of the good reviews it has. I wanted to clean the headlights on my 6 years old car as they became foggy and blured. I've followed the instructions on the back of the bottle, I even bought the ""Megular's Even Coat Aplicator Pad"" as stated in these instructions - no result at all. The blurred part of the lights stayed blured and the part that wasn't that bad got a little more shiny here and there, but I didn't need this - I needed overall improvement and I didn't get it. So if you have slight problems with your headlights it may work for you, but harder spots doesn't get improved at all! I guess this is part of those ads where you need to by something, then you need to buy SAME company accessories to work with the product (of course) and at the end you're finishing with whole bunch of workless junk. Later on I found there is kits containing everything you need so you don't have to buy such items separately. My advise to you - go to your local autoshop and buy such items from there so if something don't work for you at least it'll be easier for returns and get your money back. If you buy online the item is yours forever - it's pointless to return it as it's pretty heavy and the shipping costs are on you. Then you end up with 3/4 full bottle of something that doesn't work and you'll be like me - very dissapointed...",2.0
"I got tired of seeing the commercials and wondering if these products really work.  Now I know, they help a little, but do not restore the lense to perfect like they claim.  It did make the light seem brighter, but the lense still looks old and dull, not like the one on the other side.",2.0
I tried this product after the 3M lens restoration kit to get the lense even clearer and it didn't help at all.  I had some Zymol cleaner wax and it was much better.  Amazon even sells Zymol.,2.0
"There are plenty of headlight restoration kits on the market now.  I went to Pep Boys, looked at the different kits, and decided that 3M, being a giant industrial chemical conglomerate, probably has the best egg heads in their labs.  I have a 2005 Nissan Murano and the headlights were getting foggy and a little yellow.  Not hideous, but not brand new looking anymore.  First off, if you don't have flat, simple headlights, this is going to take more like 3-5 hours than 1 hour.  I'm a perfectionist, and my car-buff brother and I went to town with this kit to get my headlights back to new.  This kit just doesn't deliver.  The fogging from before is ""gone,"" but now the entire headlights are slightly foggy.  No, we didn't over-sand them.  Yes, we followed the directions exactly, even following the ""tips and tricks"" section of the instruction.  We wiped the slurry and dust away every 1-2 minutes, etc.  Our method was, humbly put, flawless.  The product just doesn't do what you'd hope.  So, yes, it makes an improvement, but it will NOT return your headlights back to new like their little pictures and diagrams show they will.  So, basically, I spent [...] on the kit when it was on sale, and got about a [...] improvement on the appearance of my car.  My car, btw, is babied, covered, and coveted.  I'm very, very disappointed. A professional car detailer with this kit couldn't get the headlights back to looking new with this kit.  Perhaps it's because Nissan does use shoddy plastics and glasses for their headlights, which is well documented, and I hope that's the culprit, but I'm suspect that it's just this product.  Try a different one unless you get a really good deal and you're simply looking for a slight improvement.",2.0
"I tried it on my 2002 Lexus gs 300 and the results were not very good. I followed the exact directions that came with it. They improved but only for a few weeks-then they were cloudy again. Finally, i paid Lexus dealer $200.00 to do it with a product called BG. The result was very good, and 3 months out it continues to look very good. I do not reccomend Plastx, unless your headlights are mildly fogged. The BG is far better.",2.0
"This product did not improve the clarity of the hazed headlamps on my 1997 Dodge Caravan. At least it did no harm.

I received two of the 3 wheel chocks without the pull cord. Disappointed!,2.0
"I used this for a while. Though hollow plastic I felt it was designed to hold a camper from rolling and it did. One day I forgot to remove it when pulling out and it seems to take very little pressure moving forward to flatten it like a pan cake so I though my 50,000 investment may be better served with a heavy duty galvanized wheel chock that won't give in and even let me move over it by mistake and let me know its holding solid if I ever did again roll forward over it.",2.0
"Well I am glad these guys don't sell shoes, because you would only get one shoe, which would work about as good as one wheel chock. Come on, I've never seen these being sold that we're in pairs, thus my disappointment in receiving only one...I guess I can put it under my one wheel trailer......",2.0
"Much too flimsy. On first time out I accidentally ran over one. It flattened out. Better to pay a little more and buy the heavy duty Chock. If you don't drive over it, I suppose it would be okay.",2.0
"Only fair.  NOT very durable and do NOT fully secure the trailer.  Spend the extra $$$ and get the X-Block and / or the Fastaway (we now use both, Fastway for intiial set and the x block for final lock in)",2.0
Very small but what do expect for price. I would not really call it an RV Chock. Would not hold back RV,2.0
"I don't deny this is a well-made product at an affordable price, and it may likely work for your purposes, but the angle of the chock is designed for a really big tire given the size of the chock.  They look downright silly on my Coleman pop-up with 13"" tires.  Only about the first rung and a half of the chock actually touches the tire, so the rest is left sticking out in nowhere.  I'm left thinking a simple block cut from a 2x4 will work just as well for me. Maybe an improvement to the existing design would be to make the back half gently curved down as well, rather than a straight shot. Then users would have two options, one which could fit smaller tires better.  As is, they really are over-kill on small popup campers.  Sticking with a simple block of wood works too.  I'll be returning my chocks.",2.0
3M 5200 is great I have used it extensively. The four cartridges were not well packed well and were loose in the box.. The ends of all 4 cartridges were dented all the way around on both ends.,2.0
"Not impressed - stiff, drags across car instead of sliding, not really that absorbent. I have an older artificial chamois that is infinitely better.",2.0

"Not sure why, but it didn't dry well.",2.0
"Too small for a whole car. And I don't know how to store it. If you keep it dry, it will become hard and easy to break. If you keep it wet it will not do the work.",2.0
I cannot figure out how to get this clean after one use so I may legitimately never use this again.,2.0
Beware. The instructions say you must use within 24 hours of opening. Not a good thing if you don't use the whole tube.,2.0
Fan seems loud - not the air movement but the motor itself.  I assume at some point the blade will need to be cleaned.  It appears cumbersome to get at.  The box looked like it had been re-taped. Maybe I got someone else's reject.  For the money there has to be better options.,2.0
Noisy,2.0
"Either I am using it wrong or the product doesn't dry the cars as others described. I bought this based on other reviews, I used it once and my car ended up with alot of swirls. I will try again another time and see if I can get better results.",2.0
These have a weird rubber feel.  They dried the car finish fine but definitely doesn't glide well as you're drying.  Creates very visible streaks on the glass though.  You'd be better you get a soft shammy.,2.0
The fan has too much vibration.  It should have been better made.  I had to return it as it walked on the floor.,2.0

"Just opened the box. Really nice selection of built in mounting methods. Decent amount of breeze generated, BUT the blades are out of balance.  While sitting on a table in the van the first speed is fine, but above that it definitely isn't going to cut it with my wife, guaranteed! It turns the entire van into a magic fingers vibrating bed.
  For what I paid I expected more(or less vibration). Really a pity cause the rest of it is very nice. I'm returning it.
UPDATE: 7/22/17 I emailed the company and they assured me the problem had been corrected so I ordered another one. Arg! Same as the first one. I've already got it boxed for return and won't be ordering another. Probably be okay in a kennel, but not in my camper. Downgrade from 3 stars for the hassle.",2.0
"Three disappointments with this fan.  First, it is louder than I expected, especially on medium and high speeds.  Second, the low speed is not really low, but more like a slightly modified medium.  And third, and most important, on the lowest speed it wobbles from being out of balance.  I could see it falling off the table in the middle of the night.  Returning and hope to get a better one.  But not all bad, it doesn't draw too much battery power and pushes a ton of air on high, although with considerable noise.",2.0
"Only used it 1 time,  we need to try it on a few more projects in  order to give a full review.",2.0
"Takes FOREVER to cure, it's been on for about a week now and is still tacky.
It may be resistant to gasoline when it's dried but I think that will be in the spring when it warms up.",2.0
"arrived damaged, I returned the tube",2.0
"It works already but the feet at the bottom are really flimsy. The tabs at the top under the handle also seem like they could break at any moment. It has lots of big stickers on it that make it look cheap. It also has lots of flashing (extra plastic due to sloppy and/or cheap manufacturing methods) that make this the trashiest-looking item in my RV. If it moved an amazing amount of air, I would be fine, but it's not really that powerful. I usually have to flip it back and forth each time I get it out of the cabinet so that I can figure out which direction it's blowing when on.",2.0
"I took off two stars because of the build quality. My fan came missing 4 screws on the casing and I will have to call customer service and have them send me screws.. Quality control with all ""fan-tastic"" products is REALLY bad. For a fan that has MADE IN AMERICA on all sides of the box I am shocked with the condition both my RV roof fan and this endless breeze fan came to me in.

All that being said I chose to keep this overpriced fan because I like the 12V motor and fan blades. It is relatively quiet on both low and medium speeds and blows a decent amount of air. It's 2016 and you still don't have many choices with this type of fan so this will have to do =\",2.0
I found the first stage oxidation remover be a little aggressive so I decided to stop,2.0
"I bought this because I was trying to remove some light oxidation on my 22' Stingray boat. I applied the first step, used an orbital polisher and it removed almost NONE of the oxidation. I then had a neighbor come over and offered me some Pro-Tec Nu Paint Moisturizer. Followed the same step and that removed 98% of the oxidation. I have used Meguiar's on my car for years and love it but this product, not so much.",2.0
I can't understand how 80% of over 1000 people give this 5 stars.  It leaves water spots all over my car.  I give it 2 stars because it is very absorbent.  Good for spills but worthless for cars.  I have a 20 year old natural chamois that is nearly worn out but doesn't leave spots.  Very disappointing.,2.0
I didn't like this. It doesn't dry very well and it left streaks. Not as advertise and the price is too high for just a wet rag,2.0
Did not work as well as expected. I ended up going back to the Meguiars cleaner and polish wax which was cheaper and worked better removing the haze from the front cap of my RV .,2.0

"I needed a fan I could run from an alternative power source in case of power outages.  I am so disappointed,  It is a cheap fan, like I could buy for $10 at the local store except for the power plug.  I am disappointed but since it was needed for my emergency kit I kept it.  It is not solar either though it was advertised as such.",2.0
I used this on my car and it turns black when i wiped the roof...abd color will not wash out,2.0
"I was disappointed with the quality of the product. Cheap plastic at that price didn't impress me. The breeze was alright, but does come at a price. Even at low amp setting the drain on my battery over a 24hr period was +200 times greater then my current similar size 12 volt fan. If battery life is not an issue then it's fine. But if it's not an issue, why would you want a high priced fan? I returned mine, sticking with my $20 similar size 12 volt fan.",2.0
Moves air well but very noisy.  In my opinion it is not worth $70.  Returning it after we get back from this camping trip.,2.0

"Did not work as described. Purchased it to clean our fiberglass pop-up camper. Ended up using plain old ""Barkeeper's Friend"" (in liquid form) and it did the trick for 90% less the cost.",2.0
"Receive this fan today in good condition.  Unboxed it, set it on the shelf in the window and turned it on. It started hopping around the shelf and would have fallen off had I not caught it. I gave it two stars instead of one because it did blow a good amount of air and was not too noisy.  For the price this thing should work perfectly out of the box. Im going to give Amazon another chance on this one because this fan is exactly what I need.  I will return this one and hope that the next one has a balanced fan blade. NOT repeat NOT happy.",2.0
"No doubt this is a good sealer, but I don't think I will ever use it again.  There was a warning on the tube about not inhaling the vapors, and to use adequate ventilation, but I thought that by using it outside it would be ok.  It wasn't.  I spread the tube on the roof seams of my old camper in still, 90 degree weather.  About an hour after I finished, I started to feel very weak and sick.  I soon began to be nauseated with the usual attendant symptoms.  I had very bad headaches and eye aches and could not eat for two days.  I stayed in bed and had no appetite for about five days.  It was the closest thing to hell I've ever experienced.  It gave me a new resolve to warn people to avoid the real hell at all costs.",2.0

"Alright, I have a 10 month old travel trailer with a dark brown front that was starting to get ""white"" from the sun.  I ordered this stuff hoping to restore it to it's glory.  I used a Griot's Garage orbital powered polish/wax applicator which is better than any job you could do by hand.  I saw very little improvement and it did about the same job as a bottle of $12 marine/RV restorer I got from Wal-Mart.  This does an alright job but not worth the time/money since you have to do 3 applications.",2.0
I attempted to use this to repair a vertical crack in a pool skimmer. It was too loose and just ran to the bottom of the skimmer. Kind of pricey for this kind of performance.,2.0

"I ordered two of these fans because of the many positive reviews. I have had them for about a year now, but have only recently removed them from the box to put them to use. Both fans worked great initially, and then suddenly one fan stopped working about two weeks later. I use the fans in a guest bunkhouse that tends to get hot during the day. One fan works great, if not a little loud. The other fan doesn't make any noise at all... because it doesn't work anymore. I took the broken fan apart and got it working again, but it continues to die on me. Disappointed because of the high price. If this was a cheap fan I wouldn't care so much, but I would hope an American-made product costing this much would work well for more than a couple weeks.",2.0
"When I first got fan it made a very irritating whine and I was not happy.  I do not run invertors due to the same sound.  Googled a camping website and a person said their fan whined and the person called Fantastic and was told to run the fan with reversed polsrity for a while.  I ran my fan reversed polarity for 10 min or so and when I hooked it up properly the whine was gone!,  I am very happy now!  I am guessing the bearings are sealed and motor pre lubed and running it backwards helps to spread the lubrication uniformally.  I have been listening to noisy 12v fans for a long time and my Endless Breeze fan is exactly what I dreamed of.  Now I have to see if it bothers my 12vLed tv when I go to my camper.

Update..  The fan does not bother my 12 v led tv.  The fan motor seems to be getting quieter with more usage.  I am running it off deep cycle batteries and solar panels now...when I first tried it l, it was powered by a battery charger which probably made the motor whine more than normal.

Update..the whine did not go away and was driving me nuts!!! Who could not notice the whine noise from the Atwood motor??? I ended up taking off the grill on the side that is near the back of the motor so plastic would not amplify the noise. Now it is bearable.  They should have used a better motor or had better noise reduction.. At this pricd and their nsme on the line there is no excuse for the unmistakeable high pitched torturing whine!!!!!!
I have a wood stove in my work / storage trailer and having the fan to quickly circulate the air when it gets to warm is just as nice as using",2.0
For some reason I thought this had both types of plugs. I suspect I mid-read the info. Not really happy with this. I didn't find it quiet enough to suit me.,2.0
"Bought this based on our total satisfaction with the Fan-Tastic ceiling vent fan in our old travel trailer.  Appears to be exactly the same, but in a box fan format.  Unfortunately this unit seemed quite a bit noisier - a high pitched whine that drove me nuts.  Returned it (a truly painless process with Amazon).",2.0
"Bought one for use in horse trailer gooseneck, - moved a lot of air, but much more noise than expected.

"Moved a LOT of air but just too noisy for a small camper. Had to return it.
Also, as others mentioned, the swing out feet are very fragile and loose.
Manufacturer should redesign the feet so people who don't mind the noise might consider keeping it for the excellent air flow it creates.",2.0
"It squeaks, a lot.  The fan blows air but, has a very annoying squeak on each of the 3 speeds.  No amount of changing the position of fan, gentle taps and raps, or other things makes the squeak go away.  I would not purchase it again because of the squeak...very annoying.",2.0
Product only works for minor levels of oxidization. Two out of three bottles in the box were cracked at the seam and I lost 30% of oxidization material & polish. I had a hard time with getting the oxidization material & the polish out of damaged bottles.  The shipping box did not show any damage but the product box had been tossed around!,2.0
I have an older absorber that I was looking to replace.  The new one doesn't seem to soak up water like the old on did when it was new.,2.0

"I typically replace my boat's sea water impeller each season.  This time around I decided to also replace the housing and backing plate.  Upon receipt and inspection of the Sierra 18-3150 pump kit, I was concerned/disappointed to find the housing's inner surface has rough ridges around the ports left from the molding process.  There is no way I'll be able to assemble this pump and feel safe about it's operation unless I somehow grind or polish the areas smooth.
Next time, I believe I'll cough up the extra dough and stick with genuine OEM Mercruiser parts.",2.0

"I have owned many Fan-Tastic Fans in my RV's and generally they are an excellent product, if pricey. It was with this expectation that I bought this fan. Well, I guess everything a company makes can't be a home run. This fan is a full 6 dB over my $21.99 Wal-Mart fan and an irritating noise to boot. When you charge $80.00 bucks, only $40.00 less than you can buy an window a/c from home depot, you expect an outstanding product. This is not an outstanding product. Yes, it's 12V, which I guess adds a dollar of two to the cost of a fan motor, but come on, this is not good for your reputation. $29.99 maybe....It's coming back for sure...",2.0
"I got this fan for my travel trailer since it would run off a 12 volt socket. 1st issue was it was all I could do to get the thing plugged in. Either my socket was undersized or the plug on the fan was oversized, it was all I could do to get the thing pushed in far enough without breaking something. When I finally got it in far enough to power the fan, imagine my surprise when the fan blade rubbed on the fan housing as it was spinning , which caused a lot of noise. I promptly returned the fan.  I gave a second star for the ease of returning an Amazon product...otherwise it would have been just one.",2.0

"I've ordered this very item probably 10 times in the last 2 years and always gotten a Wesbar brand wiring harness in retail packaging.  This time I got what appears to be a cheap made in Taiwan knockoff.  Instead of the wire insulation being the same color all the way through, the plastic on all the wires is brown (lighter in color than the genuine Wesbar) and the green and yellow is paint over the brown plastic.

First picture shows original Wesbar on the left, the knockoff on the right.

Second picture is the same as the first, with better lighting to show that the insulation on the knockoff is painted.

Third picture shows the packaging the item comes in.

Rag can't go through car it stays.....,2.0
"I paid the extra money for this item because it was made in the USA.  It is a very simple fan, with a sturdy hard plastic case.  The switch has a solid feel to it and I don't expect it to break like on cheaper fans.  There's no digital mubo-jumbo or micro circuts to burn up or break.  The fan motor is made by Panasonic.  Overall I expect this fan to last a very long time.
HOWEVER.. The fan blade is horribly off ballanced.  There is a nasty hop-hop-hop as the blade spins up which turns into an annoying vibration at higher speeds.  The ""shroud"" which encircles the fan blades is visibly out of round.  I can't believe this fan made it through quality control (if they have one).  For the price of this item I expect a ballanced fan blade. All in all this fan is ridiculously over priced.",2.0
"This fan has only two speeds. It is marked 3 speed, but two settings are exactly the same speed. I would never recommend this fan to anyone. It pushes air, but poorly made.",2.0
"My fan will not work on high, so not sure what the problem is, power source? anyway I do like the fact that's it's made in the USA and it does blow a lot of air on low.
It could be a good fan depending on your use.
I purchased it for tent camping (8 man Tent) and unless you need hearing aids, this fan is noisy, so much so that we would not be able to sleep with it on.
To bad, it could be a great fan if the noise level could be lower, but than the trade off would be NO AIR.

Like I said depending on your use, it could be a very good fan for you. Noise is my only issue.  Good luck.

Anyway, I am happy with Amazon.",2.0
Hmm. It arrived damp. Did not absorb water on my glass shower door. I have let it dry out and will see if that makes a difference next time.,2.0
"It gets so stiff after it dries, it's like cardboard, which makes it hard to fold and store when not in use.",2.0
"I do not understand this thing at all. After soaking it in warm water and using it, it moves water around, but doesn't absorb it and certainly doesn't leave my car dry, it is also hard to move it along the surface of the car.",2.0
Not worth it,2.0
"I don't like this for drying cars.  It seemed to smear the water rather than absorb it.  It always left streaks on my newly washed car.  After ""drying"" with this, I'd have to go back and get rid of the water spots.  I now use Meguiar's X2000 Water Magnet Microfiber Drying Towel.  Sucks up the water for a streak-free shine.  The Water Magnet can even get rid of DRIED on water spots.  It's crazy.  I'll be using that from now",2.0

"i bought this specifically to clean the interior of my car as other reviews said it wouldn't leave lint. it really didn't pick any of the dust up, so i wouldn't buy it for that purpose. then i used it to dry my dogs after a bath and it worked GREAT, just as advertised. however, i stored it like it said to (damp and in the container) and when i took it out to use it again it was covered in mold. i ran it through the washing machine, soaked it in vinegar, nothing worked. have to throw it out. i give amazon 5 stars though for giving me a full refund!",2.0
When it arrives it is in a plastic tube and is already wet- it feels like rubber. When it does dry out it is as stiff as cardboard and difficult to use. Not cloth-like at all.,2.0
This is not a shammy!!! It dries out like cardboard.  When in use it must be soaked prior to use and after use it just dries out in the trunk/boot of the car and it has a peculiar smell.  I dumped it after the second use.,2.0
"I have purchased several absorbers over the years and the product has always done a great job of drying my cars.  However, the absorber I recently purchased does not absorb water from my cars nearly as well as the older models.  I have to go over the car several times and wring out water to get all the water off without leaving streaks and drops of water.  the material may be a little different as it doesn't feel quite like my old ones used to.",2.0
"Tried using mine after washing my car. I followed the instructions before first time use, but it didn't seem to work well at all. It didn't leave streaking which was nice, but it wasn't nearly as absorbent as I was expecting. I had to ring it out every wipe or so for it to keep picking up water. I ended up resorting to a standard towel for some larger areas on my car.",2.0
first set delivered were very poor quality.  Called Co. and they were replaced. Pretty  good on second set.,2.0
"I've been looking for something that replaces a natural chamois for awhile, I like the idea of a washable chamois, but this left a thin sheen of water behind which left the glass streaky.  It also went moldy when left damp.  Dried out it seems fine for other jobs, but not what I had hoped.",2.0
"This may be more of an oversight on my part. I was expecting something like the Shammy but what I got was some rubbery polymer that does absorb spills but again, not as good as paper towels. Save your money unless you are into spandex!",2.0
"I had the original ABSORBER (several in fact over the years). My most recent finally wore out. The orignal versions performed very well. BUT the ""NEW"" version....NOT!!!! I am amazed at the good reviews received on the very poor ""new"" Absorber being sold now. It performs no were near as good as the original. What a big step down in quality. Hard, Barely absorbant, Discolors easy, Tears easy...... look elsewhere......I am not sure where???, but someone has to make a decent synthetic drying cloth (by the way, a real chamois is very hard to care for and thus my search for a good synthetic)... sorry for being wordy.",2.0
"I'm quite an avid automotive detailer, and strive to keep my Corvette Z06 in showroom condition which is difficult with how many miles I put on it. So regular washes are necessary to keep the grime off. I had previously been using a microfiber type drying towel, which was lent to a friend who never returned it. So before washing my car one day I ran over to Autozone and purchased on of these 'Absorbers'. While it is good at removing the large buildups of water on a vehicles surfaces, it is not good for final streak free drying. No matter how hard you wring this Absorber out, it still leaves water streaks. I had to run out to find a suitable drying towel and re-wash my car to remove the dozens of water spots the absorber left. Since using it, I have purchased a ""Carrand 40059AS Microfiber MAX Supreme Deep Pile Fiber Drying Towel"" through Amazon, and my goodness what a difference. So now I use the absorber for removing the bulk of water from my Z06, then finish up with the Carrand Drying Towel.",2.0
"Could not get these to work for me, the buckles won't stay locked closed which makes them essentially worthless.",2.0
I detail cars at my work luckily not for much longer but anyways this chamois does not work that well the cheap ones i have at my work are much more effective. Overall SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! its not worth it. but get a chamois if you care about your car towels leave swirl marks but don't get this one,2.0
Not enough protection behind the buckle.  You could easily damage the gel coat if your not paying very close attention.,2.0
"What we didn't realize before buying this is that you have to be aware of the length of the piece from the hook to where it is sewed to the material on the upper end.

"As simple as this :-

This product is not good for drying your car

It is IMPOSSIBLE to dry a car with it , it almost like polishing towel not drying at all !",2.0
"Not that good.  I based my purchasing decision on the great reviews here, but should have paid more attention to the one negative.  Yes, it does a good job sucking up water, but it'll be completely saturated in just a few seconds, and then you're ringing the heck out of it to get the water out of it.  Another couple of seconds, and it's completely soaked again, and you're ringing the heck out of it again.  A real pain to be constantly ringing it out just to use it for another couple of seconds.  And if you don't ring it out, it'll just streak and leave large amounts of water behind.  I suppose if I had 5 or 10 of them I wouldn't be complaining, but I had money to buy 5 or 10 of these at $12 a pop, I wouldn't be washing my car myself.  I'll stick with my good, clean, cotton towels to dry...",2.0
"I have used this three times. It dries my car well. After each use I have stored it damp and rolled up in the tube, as per the manufacturer's directions. Last Saturday I got it out of the tube and it has little pink spots all over it. I think it is some kind of mold. I used it anyway and it still dries well, but I don't like handleing mold or rubbing mold on my car. I think I will go back to towels.",2.0

I bought two with the hopes of using one in the house and one on the car.  Will try two for the car on wash number two.  Maybe that will make the job easier.

Also takes a few swipes to pick up the water.  Need at least a second try.  I detailed the clean with a nice towel ""Meguiar's X2020 Supreme Shine Microfiber - Pack of 3"" I bought two of these and should have just bought four sets in hindsight.  They work as advertised and am impressed with the results. Easy to use and no streaks.

"don't think you are buying a substitute for a chamois. you are not.

"UPDATE 6/28/16 Originally I had given this 4 stars but after having this since October 21, 2015 it has gone from hard to use to impossible to use. I have tried several lubricant sprays and greases but nothing works for long, this does not work well for a boat trailer where the coupler gets wet frequently as it just starts to corrode and get hard to use, my original coupler lock was still going working great when I maimed it and this one is now dead and I am looking for a replacement.  I had expected it to last at least a couple of years of use and it hasn't lived up to that expectation.

ORIGINAL 4* REVIEW:
I recently had to replace my coupler lock that i had been using for the last several years&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trimax-SXTC3-Premium-Stainless-Steel-Coupler-Lock-3-5-34-Span/dp/B000W0MOLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trimax SXTC3 Premium Stainless Steel Coupler Lock (3.5"" Span)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trimax-SXTC3-Premium-Stainless-Steel-Coupler-Lock-3-5-34-Span/dp/B000W0MOLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trimax SXTC3 Premium Stainless Steel Coupler Lock (3.5"" Span)</a>&nbsp;which after using both I prefer the Trimax. For this review I will compare and contrast the two on the major features:

Fit: About even, they both are the right length and diameter for wide couplers.
Security: About even, they both have very small pins and large heads for good leverage and they wouldn't slow down a dedicated thief much at all.
Finish: Advantage Trimax, it is less intrusive visually and has a nice brushed finish and even the pin feels like it slides better when you put it in.
Key: Advantage Master Lock, a normal flat key fits much better in my pocket than the round barrel key of the Trimax and you can have extras made.
Rubber Cap: Advantage Trimax, they both work but the Trimax is easier and feels better and this is after 3 years of use.
Installation: Advantage Trimax, the Master Lock is a 2 hands and a knee operation where I could close the Trimax with either a hand and knee or just 2 hands.

Over all, let your budget be the guide.  When I bent my Trimax (I have a habit of leaving them on the bumper when decoupling and driving away)  the cost difference was enough to make me try the Master Lock which works fine, I just prefer the Trimax.",2.0
Initially it was extremely difficult to open and one of the two keys wouldn't unlock it at all.  It worked much better after I drenched it in WD40.  I keep it in my car fearing exposing it to the weather might freeze it.  Although it works better since lubricated one still has to jiggle the key around before it will turn.  I've only used it 3 times and I'm afraid with time it will be more difficult to open.,2.0

"This cargo bar works like it should, but not a good value for the price. I should have shopped around before buying. H.F. Has it for $22.99 plus 20 percent off, with coupon. So for under $20 you can get the exact same product. This not a H.F. Brand for $20, they are identical side by side.",2.0
"It ratchets just fine, but having trouble getting it to release.",2.0
never really fit tight or grip tight in other words it would slip if the load shifted.,2.0
Not completely happy with this cargo bar.  It doesn't seem like the ratchet assembly allows you to adjust the bar to really secure the bar. The bar adjustment either is too loose or too tight where you can't lock the ratchet assembly to secure the bar where it doesn't work loose. Unit did not come with instructions on the box or inside so maybe there is something simple I'm doing wrong.,2.0
This bar is one step above a shower bar! When extended it is weak at the ratcheting point where it will bend. The locking system seems weak when trying to tightening and afraid to try because it appears the lever will break and strip. Does not seem strong and sure as heck don't feel confident enough to put anything up against it.,2.0
Very wobbly and kept slipping even with a light load.,2.0
item is to lite for my needs,2.0
"I agree, it is flimsy as  hell. Ratchet works, holds in place but I have a feeling the first can of gas to slide into this is going to break it in half.  Should have made this at least 4ft wide and then ratchet out from there.",2.0
In theory should work great yet just the opposite.  Not heavy or strong enough to hold mouldings down in the bed of my truck.,2.0
Wasn't as heavy duty as other one's I have owned.,2.0
"Its started out great. Barely use it, but within a couple of months it was becoming obvious that the ratcheting system was giving out, binding, and over all gave out. Maybe the weather got the best of it, I could sat there and lubed it every two weeks, but I need something to just sit there in the work truck without major maintenance or I got bad one.",2.0
"At any point in time I have 4-6 of these in rotation. I use them in my business to secure items to one wall or another in my work van daily. Soooo why only 2 stars? Well... The ratchet itself holds up, it's the bar with notches that ends up giving up the ghost. The holes wear out from daily use or the small piece of metal between each hole bends ever so slightly and the trouble starts. It will begin to be VERY hard to unlock. Once they wear a bit more it will start skipping gears. Why do I keep buying them? I'm stuck... This allows for minor adjustments in pressure unlike others I've tried. I'll keep buying them but only because I haven't found better.",2.0
"The ratchet is in the middle of the bar so you have to climb inside the bed of the truck to reach it. I have some cheaper versions, which are not as strong but the ratchet is on the end so you can easily reach it, over the side of the bed and lock it in from the outside.  Other than that these are well made and ratchets tight and secure just a hassle to secure due to having to get into the bed",2.0
Good item but found same item cheaper elsewhere,2.0
It worked great until one day the ratcheting started to slip. Now it is very difficult to get into a solid tight fit. Will need to replace it with something that will last longer.,2.0
The bar becomes very floppy once you get it extended out enough to span a pickup bed. Also you have to choose between tightening it up so much it flexes the bed or just a little less where it's on the floor when you arrive. There are better choices out there and I found on at a Uhaul of all places. I wish I had taken a pic of the brand. It was far better designed.,2.0
"this thing is not at ALL what I expected, it is far too bulky at the ratchet section, and honestly, it isn't strong at ALL.  flexes and doesn't hold it's position.  If the packaging were better, I would have sent it back.  Packaging is such that you destroy it buy simply removing it from the packaging.",2.0
This item is not for heavy use.  If you ratchet it more than just snug it pops back to the previous tooth.,2.0
"The ratcheting function does not work well. It goes through the motions and appears to work, and then the lock jumps out and the bar loses tension. Because I through the box away I did not make an attempt to return; therefore I blame the manufacturer for an inferior product and NOT the company that sold it to me.",2.0
Missing a screw at one end now I have to go to store and find one to fit! Packing should have been better. Ends were open.,2.0
"The ""feet"" on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless.
When the ratchet is extended, the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck.",2.0

"Poor suction cup.  It was mounted on a clean glass windshield and it fell off and broke the mirror glass.  Held good at first, but after removing and reinstalling three times it would barely hold.

suction cup does not hold as well as needed,2.0
"Purchased to use on my Polaris ranger.  Figured if it was designed for the harness of a marine environment, should fit my purpose too.  Well the mirrior is made well & seems solid.  Unfortunately, the suction cup keep falling off even riding on smooth trails.  I had mounted it to my glass vertical windshield.  I guess that it would have worked betted on a flat dash?  Since the price was good compared to others, I removed the suction cup leaving a metal ball shape at the end, which just so happen to fit a ram suction cup mount had laying around.  With that lock down suction set up it has not come off again.",2.0
"Well it is a mirror to replace the interior truck mirror that fell off. I didn't see the ""objects in mirror are closer than they appear"". It makes me very dizzy and will be no help at all for backing. I wish I could get my husband to just replace the regular mirror or re-glue it on again. I'll order something else.",2.0
"Great Mirror , broke after just a few uses",2.0
Suction does not stay on - in summer it falls off the windshield. The angle is kind of awkward so I had to have it upside down and when I tried to adjusted the tiny link between mirror and suction snapped.,2.0
"I purchased this to use as a baby mirror for my car, and it worked great at first. Unfortunately, this mirror falls off every 3 days or so. I have stopped using it, as I am afraid it might fall on my daughter. The suction cup just seems too flimsy for the weight of the mirror.",2.0
This mirror was okay but is already broken because the suction cup doesn't hold very well !!!  It only lasted for about a month and was hard to adjust.,2.0
This thing broke the first time I used it.  Try to adjust the mirror angle and it fell apart. Find something else.,2.0
I bought this mirror to use it as internal rear view to the view the blind spot.  The quality of the mirror is good but the suction part sucks.  The suction does not stick to the glass for more than 15 minutes.  I would appreciate if the manufacturer focus on making a good suction like one in any GPS devices.,2.0
"Well its great if there is no heat .....because it falls off when the glass is heated -_- i would recommend using an adhesive if you do buy this also the mirror is ""fisheye"" perspective",2.0
"I thought this mirror was going to be great, and it was for a few minutes. The I went to adjust its angle and it snapped right off of the base.",2.0
"This item broke within 30 seconds of opening the package.  As soon as I stuck it on the windshield and tried to adjust it, the mirror broke off of the suction cup.  It's the worst, cheapest, thinnest metal I've ever seen.  Just the force it takes to adjust the miorror will break the metal.  It's total crap.  I actually gave it two stars instead of one just because it was only $12, if you know it's this crappy and baby it and very gently adjust it then it could be almost usable and nearly worth $12.",2.0
"If they had spent a bit more on better materials, this would have been a great mirror. Inside that nice thick ribbed boot, is a very thin metal rod, cast from some kind of grainy(like sand), low quality metal. The first time I tried to adjust it, it snapped off in my hand. Buyer beware.",2.0
"Its a very nice mirror and worked great for the first year. No loss of suction, never fell off. However, starting in year two, it would never keep suction. I tried cleaning the window and the suction cup; huffing a little moisture onto it prior to sticking, not huffing on it, nothing worked and so I went without a mirror. Plus you cant really make it go above your windshield, so it blocks some of the forward view. It was a quality mirror for the price, but now its in the give-away box. Will be buying a clamp-on that I can position above my windshield. So I do not recommend this product.",2.0

"Cheap POT Aluminum arm between the suction cup and the mirror broke when adjusting - I determined the cause; the ball and socket assembly that is supposed to be the swivel point was over-tightened and did not allow any movement so all my twisting did was bend (and break) the connecting arm.

I think a stainless steel part would solve the issue best, but you could check the tightness of the ball and socket before adjusting and avoid breaking the arm as is.

"For many years, until someone took it from my desk, I had the simpler version of this cordless pump.  I absolutely loved that unit.

As the simple version is no longer available, I purchased this one even after reading some of the poor reviews.

I should have paid attentin to those reviews.  This unit does not keep a charge. I charged it for 24 hours and then tried to use it.  After trying to inflate one bike tire, it ran down.  So back to the charger for another 24 hours.  Same thing happened again.

"First let me say that I've had two Airman pumps for almost 8 years each. They have been reliable and handy saving me many trips to the gas station. Not to mention helping with other uses around the house since they come with multiple tip adaptors.

The nicad battery packs have since given up the ghost and no longer accept charges but in fairness they lasted longer than I expected for nicads anyway. I happily continued using the pumps with the included cigarette lighter adaptor.

Now my oldest pump is not generating any output pressure. Time for a rebuild. In the hopes that ActiveTools sold repair parts or at least offered a repair service I emailed ActiveTools USA directly.

No response. Not even after two attempts. Nothing, nadda, zippo.
Not even a redirection of my email ""help"" request to a different department.

I'm not completely surprised in this day and age. But I am disappointed because I specifically chose Airman (after much research) over several other cheapo, made-in-China, disposable, ""use once and throw away"" products. In fact, it was quite easy to find junk pumps everywhere and very difficult to find a quality pump.

You could say I got my moneys worth after all these years.  But it's a shame to throw away a perfectly repairable product that has served me well for years simply because the manufacturer doesn't have their customer service act together.",2.0

"A year later & a 1-2 foot wake so now its 2 stars.  Bent and released 1 mooring (I was using only 1 of these for the back) for my jet ski in what was a pretty good wake.  The plastic gave at the thinnest point that you can see in the bottom left of the picture.  So these are maybe still good for a quick dock connection if you moor/attach at two points and stick around but I wouldn't trust them for a great deal more.

Original Review
I've used these for a couple of weeks so I don't know about durability (hence 4 star) but they look like they should hold up well (1 year later & no they don't). I've found them to be a quick and solid connection for my rear mooring line to the jet ski at the dock. I put it in upside down so I can more easily reach the tab that locks it in place.  Prior to having these I had to feed a rope through the holes in the rear deck of my Waverunner which took longer.",2.0

They can't take the heat....if your jet ski is under shelter it may last longer...but float charger or frequent charging doesn't help.  Won't buy this brand again....went and bought an EveryStart fluid battery for $51...only has a 3 month warranty...but if I get a year out of it....it's a better deal than this Odyssey.",2.0
Only work so so. Requires frequent repumping and loses pressure easily while trying to pump.,2.0
"Good news - this makes changing your oil more convenient assuming your oil filter is accessible from the top. I'm not sure it saves time - see below.

Bad news - you're not going to see anything else that may be going wrong elsewhere under the car if you don't ever get under the car. That may not be a bad thing depending on your whole program - but that's how it is.

This thing works as long as the oil is relatively hot when you pull it out. It is mess-free on extraction. It gets a little dicey when you transfer to a waste container. The thing comes with a spout to connect when transferring to the waste container. For me, emptying the tank with that spout connected was not mess-free. I ended up using my funnel without the spout. The spout has a small diameter, and there does not appear to be an air release, unless I missed it somewhere. The result is a slow glug... glug... glug... and resulting spurting stream of nasty black oil, all while you're bent over, trying to keep from spilling everything all over. Once I took off the spout, it poured quickly and neatly into my funnel. The good news is that transfer operation can happen away from the car, on a piece of scrap cardboard, so spills are not so terrible.

All in all this is not a bad purchase. The hose that fits down the dipstick tube is very nice quality, the remaining components are good enough for their intended use. Nothing exotic or overly high quality, just good enough.

Bottom line is you don't have to jack up the car, pull off the belly pan, burn your hand, scrape your knuckles, or strip out the oil pan or its plug. I'm not convinced it saves time because the oil flow rate is slow. It does indeed make the oil change more convenient, especially assuming your car has a filter accessible from under the hood. Plus it's cleaner, almost no chance you leave oil on the driveway with this tool.

Delivery was almost instant with Prime, no packaging or missing parts issues.

UPDATE: Second use, I decided to get the oil good and hot so it would flow better. Well- about the time the oil got to the 4 or 5 liter mark - the housing sucked in. I guess the hot oil softened up the plastic housing and the vacuum was too much for the housing. I tried to blow it back out after emptying it but by then the plastic was cold and hard. Had to fill it with hot oil, let it soak, then us compressed air to return it to sort of normal shape. The instructions don't say to avoid hot oil, and it really needs to be  hot otherwise this thing is just silly slow. And back to the beginning - this tool was supposed to make oil changes easier and less messy. This time - I got oil ALL OVER THE PLACE! Plus, I had to use my air compressor to make this thing SORT OF useable again. The canister needs to be stronger and more tolerant of hot fluids or else this thing is a dud. Too bad because it's a great concept.",2.0
how many times can you use this product before warranty runs out ? (30 days)  worked great first time.  have never been able to hold vacuum since.  is there a replacement part for the pump ?,2.0
"The ""bottle""'is sturdy, but connecting parts are not.  The ""seal"" between the round parts come off & are loose.  I glued 1 of them, but seal is bad. I've bought 2 of these.  There are other sim ilar, which are better",2.0
Didn't really work..  was very slow to extract oil.  I followed the instructions and warmed up the engines so that the oil would be warm.,2.0
"The wand won't fit down every dipstick tube, hard to know ahead of time. This one didn't  fit my 2013 ram 1500. It did fit my mustang but once I siphoned out as much oil as possible (which took forever and hundreds of pumps even with very hot oil)  I pulled the plug to see how empty it was and another quart and a half came out of the bottom. Maybe it's the shape of the pan, maybe it would work better if you have the car jacked up on one side or the other or raise the front or back so the oil poops directly under the wand. Either way a siphon is a siphon and I may find use for it down the road in other areas.",2.0
"Great concept but flawed execution.  It would literally take hours to remove all 7 liters of oil from my BMW 3.0L I6 engine.  It doesn't matter if the oil is 70F or 210F.  The extraction is SLOW.  That's assuming the vacuum remained constant.  It doesn't.  I have to go back to the extractor and pump some more every 10 minutes or so.  Otherwise the flow of oil will stop.

The pump doesn't secure to the tank so you'll have to hold it with one hand while pumping with the other.  This makes it difficult to adjust the tube to get the oil flowing.

I wanted to like this extractor since changing the oil on my Audi is annoying (one has to remove a plastic splash shield underneath the car to get to the oil drain plug).  Still, the extractor is so slow I can perform several oil changes ""the old fashioned way"".",2.0
I am not super happy with this purchase.  I have to pump it a lot to evacuate the crankcase of 5 quarts of oil.  I've used these type of products in the past and they haven't been so slow to suck out the oil.  Not real happy with the product.,2.0
Relatively inexpensive.  Works well but could use more capacity.,2.0
...get a mechanical one.....,2.0
Could not get this to extract nice and hot oil out of a brush mower. It did at first and then failed. Had about 10 ounces come out when I took the filter off so this is going in the trash. I'll do the old fashion way from now on.,2.0
difficult to use-wound up not using very much,2.0
It works but....the tube is so small it takes FOREVER to drain your oil pan. On the other hand its a great work out!,2.0
"I tried this on  a  2001 and 1999 Toyota Camry.  Even with a warm engine  and  a lot of pumping I only got about 2.5 quarts out.  The dipstick pipe has a curved neck, and this may be preventing the extractor tube from dipping deeply enough.

It would be nice if the pump had a wing to place your foot.  Then you could pump with both hands.  The way it is you need to use one hand to hold it and one hand to pump.

I am going to try it on a 2011 Ford Ranger to see if it works better.  If that doesn't work then this tool has no value for me.",2.0
"Read the reviews, did as suggested. After driving the car at 70mph for a half hour I came home and immediately inserted the tube, left the oil cap off and pumped up the unit as directed and the oil started flowing. Looks great, It works!?! After about an hour the oil is now cold and we're still only only about 1.5 litres along. So much for warming it up. Day 2 and we're still trying to get the last 2 quarts out of the engine. Yes it works, but very slowly, especially for 5w-30 synthetic oil. 20 minutes to do an oil change as one review suggested? Maybe on a lawnmower! Used by a professional mechanic? Not on the job or they'd be unemployed!
I bought it because the reviews were good enough and I had a frozen drain plug I couldn't risk pulling this time of year. So it works. Good for emergencies or small oil capacity engines. To do regular oil changes on a car it is not a time saver.

The pump must be held vertical on the unit for it to work. Its a press fit and will slip the seal easily if not held down.
 Dipstick tube seems durable and flexible enough for tight routing. I never worried it would break.",2.0
"The unit makes great suction when pumped up and holds it nicely. The problem is the pump never stays attached to the unit, so you have to use one hand to hold the unit and the other to pump.  Keeping in mind ever time this is used it cleaned, including every gasket ans sealing surface. Not recommended!",2.0
"Bought this because my car has an oil filter located on top of the engine making me think that with an oil extractor I wouldn't need to get underneath and deal with transferring oil between containers anymore.  I used to change my oil by putting a large oil catch pan underneath and removing the drain plug, letting it drain for a half hour, reinstalling the plug, new filter, new oil, pour old oil into jug and done.  Using this, process is simpler, just pull the dipstick, insert the tube (which took several attempts to get into what I suspect may have been the bottom of the pan) and pump the vacuum attachment.  Then pump the vacuum attachment.  Then pump some more.  After about 30 minutes you should have gotten a decent upper body workout and most of the oil in your pan out.  If you can't get to your drain plug, then this product is probably exactly what you want, but if you can easily access the plug this is a total waste of money.",2.0
"I bought this because of all the great reviews.  I guess I got a defective one.  I let the car warm up, and then pumped, per the instructions and after a few minutes had maybe a teaspoon of oil.  The only way the oil would get in to the holding tank was with CONSTANT pumping.  Made sure seals were tight. Nothing worked.  Think I'll try an electric one. I'll get my exercise in the gym.",2.0
I tired watching Youtube seeing how it worked. I contacted the manufacturer about it. I tried multiple fluids and vehicles that are supposed to work. It didnt. I love the concept but the product needs some more description or testing before i could recommend.,2.0
"This unit is pretty slick.  It works well, but extremely slow.  I bought this to pump the oil from two twin 454 CI Mercury Marine Engines.  Each has a 7 qt capacity.  I estimated that it takes at least a 1/2 hour to pump 1 quart of oil.  It's not a unit where you pump 15 times and expect it to pump the sump dry.  I had to repeatedly pump it to keep suction going.  I had to attend to it and re pump for several hours for each engine.  VERY SLOW PROCESS.  Impossible to keep the engine oil warm and flowing at this rate.  Save your money and buy an electric pump, save your arms and wasting your time with this one.",2.0
"The suction tube didn't hold up very long.  I emailed them for a replacement, they never responded.
Some reviewers suggested repairing with electrical tape.  I wouldn't want to having the tape unravel and get stuck in my oil pan and clog the oil pickup and blow the engine.  Sounds like a bad idea.
Also, unless you're abusing the flexible tube, it should hold up longer than a year (4 or less oil changes).  Assuming you can get a response from Pela, they should have replace for free instead of trying to make a buck off of their bad design.",2.0
"The product seemed to be of reasonable quality and I attempted to use it but found the suction tube too short to reach the bottom of the oil pan on my Chevrolet Astro Van.  I was only able to get about a liter of oil out before it started sucking air.  Since I was also interested in draining transmission fluid and the dipstick for the transmission was even longer than the oil dipstick I knew it would be completely useless for that application.  I would have been content with the product if the tube had been maybe six inches longer.  It was slow pumping out warm oil but not so slow that I would have really complained.

I tried to contact the manufacturer to see if there was an option for a longer tube but they didn't respond to either an e-mail or to a phone message.

I am returning the product and will look for an alternative.",2.0
"It does work, but it took me over 45 min to vacuum out 8 quarts of oil (not including a stop to empty container half way through) and I had to babysit it because it would lose suction after 30 seconds, so I'd perform 5-7 pumps every 30 seconds to maintain pressure.  Was not the set it and forget it vacuum pump I was hoping for.",2.0
"Product failed at the beginning of the first use on a relatively new Kubota RTV 500. Directions were followed and the oil extraction tube inserted through the oil dipstick tube went in with no effort.  Before pumping up the unit, I tried to bring the extraction tube out a little, and although I never felt it hit bottom, it became stuck somewhere in the oil pan.  The oil was drained manualIy, and new oil extraction tube remains inside the oil pan. System failure. The extraction tube was cut off, dipstick reinserted, and after talking with the Kubota folks, I will end up taking the Kubota to the dealer to pull the engine, remove the oil pan and remove the oil extraction tube. I would call your dealer if you plan on using this product for any ATV type vehicle.",2.0
"Maybe it's just me, but this is the second pump I've bought and neither worked well.  First I tried a hand pump and no matter how hard I pumped I was only able to remove about 2 quarts.  Using this device I got about 3 quarts out but finally had to just give up.  Each time I warmed the oil running the engine but the pumps just aren't strong enough to keep a continuous draw going. Unfortunately I don't have the means to get the container lower than the engine. I'd opt for a larger vaccumm vessel next time.",2.0

"I used this product with no problems for a couple oil changes
and it was convenient and clean.  But then the flexible tube
got a little worn and the flexible plastic sheathing that
covers the spring steel tube developed several cracks.
With the cracks the tube cannot hold a vacuum rendering
the product totally worthless.  None of the resellers have
a clue about  replacement tubes, and  Pela themselves are
totally unreachable.  Three times in the last year I've gotten
zero response to email inquiries and the last email simply bounced.
I'd like to recommend this product but can't.

If you're going to buy a Pela extractor then get the one with
the hard plastic tubing rather than the more flexible plastic
covered spring steel tubing.  The latter will eventually crack
and then it's done.

[edit]Some months after I created this review, I realized I could
fix the extraction tube with heat shrink tubing
from the local hardware store.  Cut off the old plastic,
found a heat shrink tubing size slightly larger than the
spring metal tube, slide it on, hit it with a heat
gun, and it's good as new.  Still never heard from Pela though.",2.0

Tthe three times I attempted to use it in rain I was forced to raise/remove the shield because I could not see well enough to drive and will take the rain to the face or wear a full-face rather than lose 85-90% of my visibility and still be wet.

On a positive note and only reason it did not get a single star, it does secure well to the helmet and if you are only looking for an item to deflect bugs and debris it would work fine...but is more than useless (unsafe) in the rain!!",2.0

"My car has 17 inch tires and the when I to test this pump the valve stem was at top dead center and the hose could barely reach the stem.

"Does the job

I have to edit this review and lower to 2 stars.  The pump broke after less than a year.  Air leaks from the head making it impossible to pump anything except maybe a balloon ball.  it's cheap, but I expected it to last at least  few years.  It's not like I used it very often.",2.0
doesnt work on all bike tires,2.0

"the first time the kids used it, tipped over and hit the garage floor, and the plastic rim snapped, and that was the end of that.  tried gluing it about 5 times but it never held.

not the pump's fault my kids pumped and ran without putting it away gently, but i would like to live in a world where items can survive a fall from their own natural height.  this is a long, thin tube with retractable feet and a flexible ballast, if there's one trauma the engineers could have anticipated and designed to survive it's exactly what happened.",2.0
I bought this to use on my golf cart tires. Two were low so I tried to pump them up. I did get enough air in them to go down the street but I will only use this if I have too. very easy to use but it takes a very long time. I could never pump up a car tire with it. Debating if I want to keep it. Price was right...,2.0
"Barrel threading that connects spray head to trigger body sheared off during first use. I don't see how the weight of the paint can could have caused this, likely due to over tightening in the factory. It worked great for the 2-3 minutes that it worked...but breaking on the first run isn't all that useful.",2.0
"You get what you pay for. This pump lasted me about a year, at which point the hose connection popped off the bottom of the cylinder. I tightened a hose clamp around this to secure it, which fixed it for another month or two, then the rubber hose core bubbled out and popped. It also forms a leaky seal on anything above about 30 psi, and could not pump at all beyond ~50 psi (definitely not 70 psi as stated).

Honestly, I am surprised it lasted as long as it did. it has obvious cheap construction. The 'pedals' to stand on while pumping do not unfold properly and as a whole it probably cost about 10 cents to produce.

Anyway, it did meagerly suffice for a year with repeated use on car/bike tires.",2.0
"Not happy about it. After two year's very light use, the tube of the pump broke at the connetion to the pump. Air is leaking out from the tube. I guess that how long long a rubber tube can last? Not good quality.",2.0
"For the little while it worked. The gauge is hard to read, and the plastic thumb-lock does not work well. Not recommended.",2.0
"Like many people looking for this product, I had an older one that worked great. I just can't find it anymore, so I'm looking for a replacement.
This one seemed to have a short chamber; pushing a small quantity of air with each push (I might be wrong).
I started inflating the front tire on my bicycle. Before the tire could be called inflated (it was still soft) the pump made a puff noise and stopped working. It is now very easy to push and it is not pumping anything. Somehow the piston failed.
I'll open it to see what went wrong, but until then I could speculate that actually there might have been an obstruction in the pump's house that restricted the output of air, or the pump is so fragile, it cannot take the punishment of inflating tires.",2.0
POS used 2 times and it quit working,2.0
"This product has a stationary supply suction as compared to the old one has a threaded tube with washer and lock nut for adjustment and cleaning, not user friendly as the old style was.",2.0
I'd rather get the LX club.  It's better looking and is better quality.,2.0
"Product Description Claims: This product is guaranteed for one year * up to $1800.00 against the owner's comprehensive insurance deductible.
In Reality, once you open the package ( also printed in the package ) . . . it only has coverage Up to $500.00, and the limited warranty is only 90 days from the date of purchase. * The one year guarantee is good for one year IF you have COMPREHENSIVE insurance coverage. I guess people that only carry liability coverage are out of luck.
I rather take my chances than registering ""The Club"" for Winner International having my information and selling it.
Now . . . . on to the product. The locking mechanism works fine, but it does not take much effort to unlock the unit. It takes less than 1/8"" of a turn to get it unlocked. ( the key turns 90 degrees from lock / unlock ). It takes almost the whole travel of the key If you use the key to lock it.
I have an old ( over 10 years ) club; and on that one it takes almost the entire travel of the key to lock / unlock it.
I'd return the one I just bought if it wasn't a hassle to get it packed and shipped back to amazon . . . . I guess I'll just use it as a deterrent hoping that a car thief sees it in the steering wheel and leaves my car alone.

Having the club may have unintended consequences:  [...]",2.0
"I give it three stars because ""it is what it is"". It's a theft deterrent, and it might stop the lower level car thief looking for a joy ride, or an amateur, but a professional (or even someone who simply knows what to do) can easily cut through the steering wheel and slip the Club right off. You can look on YouTube of videos of people removing the Club from steering wheels, one of them is simply whacking on it with a hammer and it opens. Also, the Club provides a thief with leverage to help him remove the steering wheel altogether, and put on his own! A better option would be a ""brake lock"" which slips around your brake pedal and prevents it from being used, very hard to remove.

One thing I thought was funny, I opened the package and saw a piece of paper inside, asking me to ""register"" the Club, as if my car was stolen and I could prove the Club was defective, they would reimburse me $1800. First of all, how can you prove that? Also, if you read the fine print, the amount of paperwork they want from the police, affidavits, papers from your insurance company stating how much your car was worth and how much you were paid for the loss (what does that have to do with them?), proof of any insurance settlement, etc....it probably isn't even worth the effort. If time is money, you could easily spend weeks getting all this paperwork together, and even then they might deny you, it's their call. I would honestly love to meet one person who ever got the $1800 from them.

I'm attaching a photo of the registration form,because it's so funny. They are asking me to ""register the Club"", but it's obvious they are only collecting information for marketing purposes! Why do they need to know my: income, education level, age, etc?  They probably sell all this info to marketing businesses. Of course, you have to ""hurry and register within 5 days of purchase to be eligible!"" And some states (like mine) aren't even on the list, for some reason. Why would a state refuse to allow a company to reimburse me for their product being defective? Something sounds fishy.  They probably sell all this info to marketing businesses.

Personally, I think the guarantee is a joke.

They only pays toward your theft deductible! If you happen to be using The Club on a vehicle that does not have theft coverage then the ""guarantee"" is completely worthless!

If you have a $500 theft deductible then regardless of the ""up to $1800"" guarantee: you will only be reimbursed that $500.

You are REQUIRED to use the original registration form that was included in The Club's packaging for some reason, although there is no serial number on it.

They also will demand your ORIGINAL register receipt, so, too bad if you lost it.

I think the fact that my insurance company won't even give a discount for use of The Club sums it all up.

Found this online:

Back in the 90s, I was working as a design engineer for Chrysler. As part of our attempt to figure out where best to invest our design dollars, we hired some professional car thieves to provide a more hands-on perspective than us engineers had.

At some point, the Club was mentioned. The professional thieves laughed and exchanged knowing glances. What we knew was that the? Club is a hardened steel device that attaches to the steering wheel and the brake pedal to prevent steering and/or braking. What we found out was that a pro thief would carry a short piece of a hacksaw blade to cut through the plastic steering wheel in a couple seconds. They were then able to release The Club and use it to apply a huge amount of torque to the steering wheel and break the lock on the steering column (which most cars were already equipped with). The pro thieves actually sought out cars with The Club on them because they didn't want to carry a long pry bar that was too hard to conceal.",2.0
"Price is great, but the durability and value is not.  After using this pump about ten times to inflate our cars' tires, it became impossible to get the pump to maintain a good seal with the tire valve stems.  The pump is still usable, but I fear it won't be long until the pump allows more air out than I  can use it to put in.

Update (1/11/15): the next time I went to use this pump after posting this review the ""clamp"" that attaches the hose to the valve stem broke off.  The pump is now completely non-functional.",2.0
"The pump functions properly.  However, the cord is barely long enough and must be positioned very close to the tire making it awkward to pump.",2.0
I bought this to replace the gun that came with my CH 3500 HVLP system. The original replacement gun was over $200 so I opted for the less expensive one. I have over 20 years experience finishing furniture in my opinion I did not like the way it atomized the material I sprayed. I thinned the material and warmed slightly as I usually do for good atomiation. Nice touch coming with two different sized needles.,2.0
Has a pressure-fitting that is all too common in pumps these days - I was hoping for a traditional screw-on fitting.,2.0
Only used a few times and leaked from valve no matter what you did. Then started leaking from where hose goes into pump. Cheap China pump... Spend the extra and get a better one...,2.0
"The price of this pump reflects its quality. It worked a short while for me, and that is all. I'd look elsewhere.",2.0
This doesn't have a gauge to tell you how much air you've put in so you have to just keep feeling the tires and hope it's right...Kind of useless.,2.0
cheap price and quality,2.0
"Not sure if it was just the one we got, but it would not pump up our bike tires and it broke after first use, returned it with no problem",2.0
"Rubber coating has repeatedly stuck to my leather wrap steering wheel and removed bonded patches from wheel. The finish on my steering wheel is now heavily damaged and it will continue to happen unless I cover the club before installing. Can't get keys made anywhere either, havta go to manufacturer.",2.0
"Worked well for a bit over a year (I kept it in my trunk to periodically reinflate my tires). Pump blew out one evening a week ago when I was trying to put more air in the tires.

Not sure if I was doing something wrong trying to reinflate tires after I had driven the car (air in the tires was quite hot), but the pump is still rated for 70 psi and I was trying to go up to 38.

Will look to buy a different replacement pump now.",2.0
This pump was suppose to be for bike tires and balls. Missing the part to insert into balls in order to fill them with air.,2.0
This pump is underwhelming. It does not do a good job of inflating bike tires / wagons tires/ wheelbarrow tires.,2.0
"This would make a fine ball pump but don't rely in it for tires.  The first time I used it to pump up a bike tire, the hose blew out on it.  The tire was only up to 40 PSI.  The hose is thin rubber with a cloth mesh around it for strength.  There is no way that thing could take 70 PSI.  I'm still looking for a simple tire pump without all the bells and whistles.  I should have known this wasn't it by the cheap price.",2.0
"This is a very cheaply made pump
It is flimsy from the beginning and looks like it will fail shortly after use.",2.0
Ok...I spent 5 dollars for this and I can see it! It does what it supposes to do but it's not a very good pump at all. Try something different if you don't need it very much.,2.0
"worked fine for a few pump ups, always felt weird because you had to estimate how much pressure you put in the tire,
then one tragic morning I pumped at around 5PSI and the cable just popped out and cut not be reattached... trashcan...",2.0
"The nozzle that attaches to the tire's valve stem didn't work properly from the beginning.  It's supposed to grip onto the valve stem while you're pumping the air.  On mine, it would grip for about 10-15 pumps of air, but then pop off.  I had to keep re-attaching the nozzle before I continued.  I see a lot of others really like this pump, but I have to return mine.",2.0
This pump works incredibly well on children's bikes.  So well in fact that my daughter blew out a tire by over inflating.  The problem for me is that I bought it for my own bike and it doesn't work at all on my tires.  I can hear the air leaving the tire faster than I can pump no matter how many times I try to re-seat the connection.  I only gave it the two stars because for light duty it gets the job done.,2.0
It is not back lit all the time.  I am not sure how to reset the time.  It is not obvious and I no longer have the instructions.,2.0
"I wanted to hang this in my locker at work.  The double stick tape that came with it was poor (it fell off the first day) and if you do hang it some other way, you can't get to the back to access the buttons.  It's also too hard to program.  Should have bought something else.",2.0
"This clock is lit, so you can read it at night.  It's a nice design.  But as far as being a good clock for your car, it kinda sucks.  I had to reset it every couple of months because it consistently ran slow, even after changing to a fresh battery.  Also, it simply will not stay put.  Take a sharp curve, hit a speed bump, slam the door, and the thing flies off it's flimsy little slide and falls on the floor.  Normally I'd tape it down, but that wasn't feasible because I kept having to go in and reset the time.  All in all, cheap product, could be a lot better.",2.0
"As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a very good clock in some ways and useless in others. The main problem is the face of the clock is unreadable at almost any angle other than straight on.  If the clock is mounted lower than your eye level - which it most likely will be -- you can't read the time.  This seems to be a function of the way digital clock faces work.  So, it's very effective in telling time, but you can't see what time it is.  Not very useful.

There's a second problem, too.  When you want to read the time in the dark, and that was the only reason I bought this clock, you can't unless it tap the right side button on the clock.  Of course, it's dark so you can't even see the clock, let alone find the button . . . so you fumble around until you knock the clock off whatever you've mounted it to. Again, not a good idea.

So, I'd pass on this clock if you (a) want to mount it anywhere other than directly at eye level or (b) want a clock you can read at night.  I'd return it, but return shipping costs make it uneconomical to do that.  Too bad.",2.0
"The clock looks great and is large enough to see from everywhere in the vehicle.  However, when the battery is inserted it makes a high pitched faint squeal, and is intolerable while driving.",2.0
And that is about it. There is no psi gauge so it is really hard to tell when your tire is properly inflated. If you have a road bike don't even think about getting this. It is great for little kids bikes were you just have to fell if the tires are full. Not worth it for the price.,2.0
"At first I was pleased with the performance of this product, but less than six months after I purchased it, it failed. I was in the process of inflating a bicycle tire when the hose popped near the base of the pump. Not only did the pump fail, but it let the remaining air out of my bicycle tire-- rendering the bike unrideable. Based on previous reviews, I expected better.",2.0
"The only way you can see what time this clock displays, is if you look straight ahead at it. If you move the clock up or down, or left or right, the display 'disappears'. Even if you light the background. I'm sure this is because of the lcd display design. Good luck with this clock...",2.0
"This clock is advertised as a large clock. The size was very small. The size can be found by looking at dimensions but should not be named ""Large"". Also, lighting does not stay on as it seems in the picture. The backlight only turns on when the button is held down.",2.0
"used the velcro to mount in the bathroom. It ran for 2 months, then ran slow, then it stopped. Not worth the $10.00 price.",2.0
Purchased this item last summer. Unfortunately it doesn't keep accurate time. Loses 4-5 minutes every couple of months. Very disappointed......,2.0
"Beautiful looking, but it never would pump up our bike tires, even though they only needed 50 PSI.  So we passed it on to someone else with smaller wheels.",2.0
"The pump works, but it doesn't seem to actually work anywhere near to 70 psi. It has worked for pumping up soccer balls, but is not adequate for tires.",2.0
This pump worked fine until I pulled it out to use it today and the clamp on the end of the hose was broken. It doesn't lock into the valve and air drains out of the tire no matter what.,2.0
"very disappointed,  product broke just after a few pump ups.  will have to order a better one.  get what you pay for :)",2.0
"The locking tab on the valve stem end won't stay locked so you have to hold the tab while you try and pump with one hand. And it was more of a work out trying to pump a bike tire to 35 psi than the bike ride after, I could not imagine pumping something up to the 70 psi this thing is supposedly rated for.",2.0
"I live in a cold climate area, so I have to warm the pump up prior to getting any pressure. I use mine as an emergency back up for my four wheeler tires. Other than that, it might work okay in temperatures above 32 degrees. The biggest problem with the pump is that it wears out quickly, and will not hold enough pressure to pump anything up when cold. I'd probably suggest a better pump, and will not order anymore of these toys unless improvement is made. I suggest one shop for a better pump as this one can get annoying.",2.0
"Although it is cheap, the quality is too poor for its price!
I used it for 2 or 3 times, and the plug start to pop-up. I have to hold the plug with one hand and pump with another hand.",2.0
Too clumsy to operate and heavy.  I've never used it once but will in case of roadtrips.,2.0
CLUB OK. like key to be coated with rubber like it used to be years ago.,2.0
It does not fit well in my Titan Nissan.,2.0
"The vinyl chemicals actually reacted with my steering wheel. There are actually marks on my steering wheel because the coating came off. This is from the first time I put it on! I can't seem to remove the residue... I wrapped it with tape to prevent further reaction. Such a drag...

On the bright side, my car is not stolen yet.",2.0
"I want to use the device, but I have run out of means to try to protect my steering wheel from getting damaged by the sticky rubber coating the device.  When it sticks to the coating on the steering wheel it pulls the coating material and causes surface damage.  Additionally, the weight of the long end applies too much pressure causing a dent in the soft surface of the steering wheel.  Its a brand new car, so its not the fault of a deteriorating steering wheel.

Also, the packaging has a tiny sticker which notes that California has recognized a component in the product as causing cancer, and then goes on to recommend washing your hands after handling the Club.  This is not noted anywhere in the Amazon description.",2.0
"I've bought 2 of these clubs in the last several years when they were on sale. I still don't understand how it stops someone from driving, but for $30 it gives me a little peace of mind. I would not pay more. The first one failed after 3 years. One day the lock mechanism just broke. The second one has worked fine for about 4 years now, cross my fingers.

But the warranty and their ""guarantee"" are a joke.
Their product warranty is only 90 days, that doesn't speak highly of the quality.
Their ""guarantee"" is: if your car is stolen with the club attached within 12 months, they will pay your insurance deductible if you have a claim. But ONLY within 12 months of purchase. After 12 months, if your car is stolen they won't cover you.

So if you can get one on sale or with a rebate, it's worth it for peace of mind. But if you can buy a better one for the same price, with a better warranty and insurance guarantee, I would get a different brand.",2.0
Why anybody needs CLUB? No thief is going to cut the club. it is impossible. They cut steering  wheel instead. It is made of soft alloy or plastic so there is no damage to you during collision. I saw it on TV few years ago; it takes 10 sec or less to cut the wheel and remove CLUB. Steering wheel no need to be replaced because stolen cars are going to spare parts anyway. Don't waste your money!,2.0

The gloves were too small.  Quite stiff and were not near as warm as suggested.,2.0

"The gloves are good for cold weather with 200g of insulation but for snow removal/wet snow removal in 30 min's my hands were cold and still dry. I could see the break down in the glove's ability to be waterproof. However I bought these gloves to keep my hands dry, waterproof, and warm. These gloves failed in the warm category. When the glove's got wet and started retaining water my hands got cold this happened about 30 min's into snow removal. The work part of the gloves has held up for being tough.",2.0
"My fingers still got cold when using these gloves, and the outside temperature wasn't even below freezing. They do work better than other gloves I have tried, but not anywhere good enough.

They are also hard to grab things with the thick fingers.

For the price and product description, they should keep my fingers warmer.",2.0
"I work in a freezer full of frozen foods where the temp is consistantly 10 degrees fahrenheit. after 20 minutes with these gloves on plus a polypropelyne glove liner my fingers had already started getting numb.

the padding around the fingers to keep them insulated is nonexistant.

I like the dexterity and the grip from these gloves. That's about it.

for 49.99 though, I think the average person would be better off buying an extra large ski glove from walmart and layering that up with glove liners to keep warm during work.",2.0
"there is no heat on these blowers, after calling the company I was told the heat comes from the fan motor and would be more noticeable when the temperature is 75+ degrees outside. why would I need heat  at that time?
also, the legs are so small and short the blower falls over from the weight of the hose, if you're going to have one either mount it to a piece of plywood or cut/shorten the hose to about three feet, put a shoulder strap on it and it should be usable.
in my case I'll stay with the electric leaf blower, works as well on the car and cleans the driveway too.",2.0
"They did not work out for me. I could not depend on them sticking, I would find them floating in the water and have to retrieve them. I bought them for my wave runner but was told by another wave runner owner they worked on his older unit but not with the newer units with newer body style.",2.0

My marking wheel will not stay screwed on the end. This is not a defect and I think this is just a cheap tool. Now I have to buy another marking gauge because this one is so bad. I have it 2 stars because it does work as long as you keep tightening the screw that holds the wheel. The most expensive tool is a cheap tool!,2.0
I bought this item in the hope that it will make marking wood easier but it did not. I am not an experianced carpenter but entheosiastic  DIY person.

"I had this alarm professionally installed by PepBoys (which is DesignTech's recommended professional installer). After the initial installation with all the wiring was done, PepBoys found out that the brain was defective. They confirmed this as well with several tests that they did. After being on the phone with DesignTech's horrible customer service, and several faxes later, they sent me a new brain, and I just mailed out the defective old brain with a prepaid mailing label that they provided. After my 2nd visit with PepBoys, it was the same problem. And yes, DesignTech sent me a defective replacement. Several more calls and faxes later, I got the 3rd one, and that one turned out ok.

The features worked fine, and the batteries lasted me a long time. But the fob themselves are made up of really cheap looking plastic (even the silver one). Other than that, it worked fine.

It required 2 people.  Finally my mother tried squating behind thechair and got it to recline that way, but still couldn't get it upright. One person has to hold the buttons in and another has to push the chair upright.  Despite figuring out how to recline it we have to leave the chair reclined all the time because you have to press so hard on the buttons that it leaves your thumbs really aching.",2.0

"Well, all in all I'm disappointed. It's no doubt durable, but then that's what you'd rexpect of a 1/4"" piece of injection molded hard plastic with ribs. Without any padding or give I haven't yet decided which is more comfortable, laying on this or the concrete floor. Certainly it's not as cold as the concrete. I'll give it points for that.

As to the length; one reason I chose this one was because people said it was longer than some others. Again disappointing. I'm 6' which leaves me with the choice of either my head or ass hanging off.

After all the hype, and the relatively high price, I was expecting more. As a kid I made my first creeper from a scrap piece of plywood and shopping cart wheels. After adding a small pillow it was far more comfortable than this. And, unfortunately, with this one there's no place for a pillow.

As long as I'm on a rant, let me say something about the construction. At a mere $60 why would I expect the wheels to be bolted on? I was happy to gather the tools together and spend the 20 minutes it took to faster 16 bolts. After all, I've got nothing else to do. What I don't appreciate is a pile of included literature telling me all about the company, their many different products and facilities, etc etc, all the while emphasizing that it was made in America, and then find the caster mounting holes don't line up. Again, run around for a drill and bit to open up the holes enough for the bolts to go through. I'm all for buying American, but not when it's up to me to get the thing to work. Here's some free advice, skip the glossy advertising and put that money into getting the injection mold right.

All in all, I'm sure this thing will last a long time, especially after I dig my old plywood one out.

Oh, one more word to FedEx; I want to thank you for reaffirming my decision to use UPS whenever possible. I'm up here in rural Vermont. My driveway is pretty long.

"I was putting a wax finish on an old coffee table, it leaves this kerosene line smell for hours after you treat your wood products.  Really just gave me a headache.

"Mine came damaged as other reviewers stated.  The shipping box had a smell similar to gasoline and was nearly saturated as it sat in the mailbox.  I opened it and found the product to be separated into a liquid on top and a gelatinous mixture beneath similar to vaseline.  I don't believe that stirring it will re-incorporate the liquid.  The product still has a very strong gasoline smell and couldn't imagine using this anywhere but outdoors or in the garage.

I've used some of the vaseline like substance on my cast iron tools and it hasn't prevented all rust from appearing so I'm going to move on to something else.  It may work if it had not been left with the lid cracked for a week in the heat and separated, but I'm not going to try for another one.",2.0
"I noticed a really strong solvent smell upon application of this wax.  Left the window open and fan on the wax and went out for 4-5 hours.  Came back and still really strong solvent smell.  Next morning still very strong solvent smell.

What's up with this, I thought this was wax?

While the ingredients are not listed on the can, SC Johnson does post the ingredients on its website, and also goes beyond the call of duty and points you to different environmental and toxicology databases.

However, in the end, I will not buy this product again because it does contain a solvent (deodorized naptha).  While I'm not an expert at understanding the scientific literature, it does seem to have long term effects on the nervous system.

Instead I just bought some hard paste wax from Bioshield, #32.  It contains Beeswax, Linseed Oil, Orange Peel Oil (d-limonene), Isoaliphatics, Carnauba Wax, Bees Wax, Larch Resin, Essential Oils, and Lead-free Dryers (Zircon, Cobalt Octoat).",2.0

Blankets work well and the 30 to 45 minute timer it's a great failsafe in case you fall asleep however the major drawback of this is that it will drain your car's battery in under 3 hours. I thought since it said low draw on the package that I could at least run it for four to five however I was sadly mistaken when I had to get a jump from a nice friendly man in the parking lot as I was freezing with a blanket that wasn't working and a car that wouldn't now start,2.0

Not much heat and poor quality,2.0
I just installed this today. I have an under hood fuse box. I connected the red ( hot ) to the positive connection of my high beam fuse. I grounded the unit. Mounted inside the grill with the zip ties provided. Works only when high beams are activated. This was easier than connecting to the head lamp connector as it was not very accessible on my Traverse. I did not realize it was going to chirp as loud as it does. I thought it would be a frequency we as humans don't hear. I will see if I can tolerate it. I've hit two deer in 2 years both times replacing the front bumper and grill assembly. If it can avoid another one I will be happy.,2.0
"Installed easy enough, and was initially loud and easy to hear, but got quiet VERY quickly and stopped working within a month.  It's too hard to disconnect to ""return"" it.  I've had others that lasted much longer, I'm pretty disappointed in this.

"Let me start off by saying I really had high hopes for this product. I have been using it for about 1 month now and the blanket only partially works. Roughly about 2/3rds of it does not. Nearest the power input it puts off fantastic heat, but the further you get from the power, the less heat it produces. Would have loved to write a positive review, but it is not working as advertised. Would most likely not recommend, unless they address this issue.
Just so I am clear, my blanket was used with a 12 volt 135 amp hour, fully charged battery (13.2 VDC). I gave the blanket 2 cycles of 40 minutes with the same results.",2.0
Did not work as expected,2.0
For about 3 weeks my wife positively reported that it worked great.  Then she ran over a fawn.  Thankfully there was no damage to the MDX.  Maybe it just works for adult animals.  I would recommend purchasing if you have a teenage driver that drives to school.  The teenager reports that it works well.  The kids she passed in the parking lot gave her more attention than a yellow Lamborghini in Miami.  She reported no near misses with humans.,2.0
"Updated after 1 year:
I changed the rating from 5 stars to 2 stars.
This dear alert stopped working after 1 year.
The winter might be harsh in my area with a lot of snow...
But this alert needs to be installed outside of the car, so it should be weather proof...
but apparently it failed the weather test.
disappointed...
---------------------------
To be honest, i am not sure if it works, maybe it works. I live in an area with a lot of dears, but i drive very cautiously so i never hit a deer. I bought this alert at amazon and had a local guy install it for me. The total cost is about 35 bucks. I think it is very reasonable to have this alert at such a low cost and add an extra layer of security for my driving. After i installed this alert, i did see about 5 deers in the past 2 years. The deers seems attracted by the sound, and when my car is close, the deer just run away. I drive very cautiously so it is hard to tell how well this alert works. I don't know if without this alert how the dears will act differently. Anyway, drive cautiously is number 1 rule. With only 35 bucks for all cost, it may not a bad idea to have an alert like this.

If i understand correctly, this alert is not a deer expeller. It will not scare deer away. Instead it will attract deers attention, so when you are far, the deers will stare at your car. But when you are near, the deers will run away, hopefully not towards your car because of the sound. This is just the instinct of deers. I think most deer hits are caused by sudden movement of deers towards your car. This alert can avoid this kind of sudden movement. The deers will still run away, but not towards your car. Therefore, this alert will not guarantee that deers will not hit your car. You still need to be cautious.",2.0

Gives off minimal heat. Wouldn't recommend it,2.0
"Functions, yes, as indicated: it plugs into a lighter / 12V power outlet in your car / boat / RV / whatever, and it warms up. Barely.
I'm surprised at the many reviews that say this gets ""nice and toasty"" or really keeps folks warm. It's a smallish-to-midsize, cheap two-ply fleece blanket -- so it has some passive insulating value, certainly -- with wires between the plies that *barely* gets perceptibly warm. You're better off just buying a nice, heavy-duty fleece blanket for the car; it'll do more than this blanket does. Returning mine; disappointed.
(For what it's worth, after trying it in the car with the kids, who gave it a ""thumbs-down,"" I let it ""heat up"" undisturbed on my kitchen counter for 45 minutes, connected to a 12V / 6 Amp transformer. Same results: it was *perceptibly* warmer than an ordinary blanket would've been, but hardly worth the effort.)",2.0

Well, with the 45 minute shut off if you fall asleep you wake up freezing. Also, there is no way to regulate the temperature like there is on all other heating blankets that i have ever used. It is just one heat level and its not all that hot, more like a warm, so over all I'm not to happy with this product.",2.0

It is a great idea just a bad product.  It worked for a month.  I was warm and my husband didn't get cooked.  One day I turned it on and a noise like a toy machine gun came from the control box.

"So I bought this to use while I sleep in my camper when it is cold. Works great, but can only be ran for 30-45 mins! After that the timer shuts it off. Went back and read the product description - says nothing about shutting off after 30-45 mins. Great for a car ride, bad for a sleeping blanket. Using a thermostat instead of a timer would have been better, I'll probably return.",2.0

"There's really not a lot of technology required to scrape ice off a windshield.  You just need a sharp, slightly curved edge that won't scratch the glass.  This product is WAY overkill.  You can get a perfectly effective ice scraper for less than $10 that is easier to store and can de-ice smaller areas like side mirrors.  In fact the blade on this unit is so big that unless the curvature of your windshield is just right, the entire blade doesn't make contact with the glass anyway.  Over designed, overly complex, and overly priced.",2.0
"North Texas doesn't get a lot of icy weather and after only a couple of uses per year, the IceDozer broke this year just when I needed it and began to use it.  The handle is relatively thin where the scraper is mounted and it snapped mid-stroke.  I'll go back to a lower priced, single piece of plastic ice scraper.",2.0
"I'm in the Boston-area and most winter mornings I wake up to ice on my windshield. I was looking for something that would cut through thick ice, as well as lighter coatings, quickly and easily. I was hopeful for the IceDozer, but ultimately disappointed with the performance. It definitely does not clear large swaths in a single swipe, as the description claims it will. That was one of the things I was looking forward to. The way you can grip the handle to apply pressure is nice, but it does get awkward as you try to reach the center of the windshield. My bottom line is that it's not any better than a regular plastic scraper, with the downside that it's very large to store in your car.",2.0
"I haven't been able to peel ice with this guy.  I experience mostly heavy frost and this took care of that pretty well until it dulled down (which was fairly quick).  I tried breaking up ice as they show in pictures and videos, but nothing worked.  The design also makes it impractical to clean the front windshield because it REQUIRES 2 hands to keep good pressure and to stabilize it.",2.0
"Purchased this scraper in December 09. Got to finally use here in Virginia during the blizzard we had in February. It's ok for pushing snow off your car; it pushes great, but it's not long enough to push snow all the way off your windshield or roof. The scraper works as expected, pretty good. The long handle lets you get more leverage for that thick ice. The brush attachment is kind of a pain. It constantly falls off of my scraper when I am using it or the scraper side. Overall, it's a decent scraper if you get it cheap enough, but you could probably do better with a normal hand scraper and a brush.",2.0
"This item is difficult and tricky to use. Also heavy to handle.
May be good if ice was thick but as a general snow removal/ice removal implement for the vehicle (every day use) not that good.",2.0
For normal snow and ice this product is not as good as the least expensive windshield ice scrapper you can find at any supermarket.,2.0
"Okay, finally out east where I live we had our first storm. So I took out my new icedozer to try it out. I didn't realized its not wide nor very good for brushing snow off the car. I then used my 99 cent snow scraper to brush off the snow otherwise this icedozer would take me forever. While I tried brushing the snow off the car with the icedozer the brush fell off. I'd snapped it back on with no problem, but is it suppose to come off? For this price I would stay with those cheap snow ice brushes. Ergonomic on this is overrated. Stay with a hand ice scrapper and a snow brush. This is over priced and just a gimmick.

Pros
1)scrape ice off the door windows.

Cons
1)expensive
2)small brush
3)parts may fall off

PS. I did use this on my door steps. It works well removing ice/snow.

update.. was told brush can be removed, but by me or by itself?",2.0
"First off, I don't own one of these and haven't tried it at all. But I watched the video and it's quite apparent that it was faked to mislead the potential customer. The ice in most scenes where the Dozer is being used has obviously been heated from underneath so as to loosen any bonding to the glass. You can see it slide around smoothly with a dampened effect that can only be caused by the presence of a liquid layer. The regular ice scrapers are being used on hard-frozen ice though. Truly a very misleading presentation.",2.0
The Ice Dozer was a little disapointing.  The handle could be 4 inches longer and the ice scraper blade isn't any better than the standard ice scraper.,2.0

So instead.. Here's how you use the tool.. . Disclaimer: (DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME! PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!) Verify that the engine does have a clockwise rotation as viewed from the crank pullley bolt (my 02 acura mdx does.) Then, get a long breaker bar with a socket on the crank bolt and wedge the breaker bar against the frame (so that when the engine rotates clockwise the bar doesn't move, I used the lower suspension A arm.) . Make sure everyones' hands are clear and just Bump the start just for a split sec ( don't start it!) and that bold will come right off!!

"First off, don't be scared away from this review... if you have to DIY the timing belt then get it.  You have to have one of these to keep the crank from turning while you loosen the crank bolt.  However, there is so much slop the part that you will pull your hair out getting the thing set up because it will fall out of the pulley everytime unless you hold everything in place while you begin loosening or tightening the crank bolt.  Very unnecessary and annoying considering it's just a bad job manufacturing the dimension. I wrapped a run of electrical tape around it to thicken it up and make it hold a little better.

As I start to work on my car (jack up car, take off wheel) I notice that the crank pulley tool was too big to fit in there. I was thinking maybe there was a certain way to use it, but there was simply no way it would fit in the crank pulley. I was disappointed in the tool as I needed my crank pulley tightened to torque spec. I also made sure from their list of cars that this would fit on my car.

"This is an okay waste container, but I found that it was not worth it to me to pay this much for something which has similar competition for less money. I bought it for two daughters as well as myself, and they were underwhelmed. It is good if you tend to toss wet trash in a waste recepticle and don't want leakage, but beyond that it is not worth the price. It won't tip over, which is good, but I would hope that by the time someone is middle-aged like me, they would know how to handle garbage without making a huge mess in the car.",2.0
I did not like the way  the cover fit and returned the product.,2.0

"I started using the item, seemed somewhat decent.  The four sides are not fixed in place like my last trash container was, too flexible for my liking.  After using for about a week or so, the stiffener (seems like a piece of plastic) broke in half, allowing the container to pretty much collapse on to itself.",2.0
"I had a round plastic trash can for years, but I got tired of it falling over and dumping its contents a couple of times a month. I thought this would be a brilliant solution, but I ended up returning it. Good points - it certainly doesn't tip over and it hold plenty. Negative points - 1) It folds in on itself. One person described how they made a brace of popsicle sticks and duct tape to hold the sides open. I don't want to do that. 2) The lid, which I didn't care about, is useless. 3) There is velcro on the bottom which doesn't stick to the car's carpet at all, but it doesn't matter because the weighted bag holds it firmly in place anyway.",2.0
"Initially felt this was a good product. However, after a few months use and shuffling back and forth to different sides of the vehicle to accommodate for kids getting in an out the stitching broke open that contains the plastic bars that help give this ""shape"" and keeps it squared up, stable and standing. Poor quality for active family. I would recommend something much more sturdy.",2.0
I can not recommend because this bin does not retain a box shape. There is no interior support to keep it open so it ends up like a collapsing bag and you have to open it each time in order to insert debris. Disappointed as otherwise it seemed well made and waterproof and weighted.,2.0
Arrived with a broken zipper,2.0
Lid didn't attach well to the Velcro. The metal wire braces on the sides popped through their sleeve so it wouldn't stay supported. Was so glad to get rid of this thing.,2.0
"We like that the container is weighted. It stays in place in the car.  We like the size as it is big enough to hold several cans and several bottles but not so big that it takes up leg room. We've had it a few months and it has kept its square shape.

"This poorly made item is not worth the trouble. Others have described the size and design features of the product, so I won't belabor them. What I am annoyed at is the two hard plastic strips, which are supposed to lend rigidity to the frame, lack a way of being fully attached to the frame. There's a ""male"" metal snap on the end of each strip but no corresponding place to insert them into the rest of the item. Pictures on the box and Amazon showing such a receiving snap are inaccurate. My solution has been to use binder clips to hold it all together. Works so far, but looks like the kludge it is.",2.0

"Won't stay in place with the amount of weight in the base.  Sharp ends of the wire frame poked through the nylon fabric the first week.

It doesn't stay up.  Wires have come thru material.,2.0
I don't like this product because it just looks and acts like more trash on the floor.  I'm sure if you are a neatnik this could be great.  But if your not don't expect miracles,2.0
Once I tried to use the product it was too small for my needs.  If you empty it every day then it would work well.  Weighted bottom so will not tip over.,2.0
"Velcro on bottom does not hold this in place, even when empty, and I don't drive fast and furious. Would not reccomend",2.0
"Bought this because it was ""LEAK PROOF"" It definitely is not leak proof. This broke within the first week. A piece of cardboard is at the bottom to keep it flat but that bent super quick.

I don't recommend purchasing. Save your money.",2.0

"I purchased the large size. It is very small. I hate to see what the normal size looks like. Also it comes with Velcro strips that do not stick to the vehicle carpet at all! I will need to buy some Velcro myself and attach the fuzzy side to my carpet first, THEN it may work. For $15.99 it is really pretty much a rip off. If I didn't have to pay return postage, I would send it back. BUYER BEWARE.",2.0
"As soon as I took it out of the box, I just opened the trash can and the ""plastic liner"" immediately split apart along the seam in two (2) places.  So you can forget about the idea that this thing has a waterproof plastic liner.  I'm not sure I would put anything liquid in this thing anyway, but the plastic liner is very cheap.  It cost too little for me to go to the trouble to return it.  I'm not sure why some of the other reviewers complained so much about this thing sagging or not staying open/upright.  It seems to do that fine on its own, although I am reinforcing the two short sides with the cardboard packaging from the box as others have suggested.  It can't hurt.  I don't like the sandbag that goes in the bottom to stabilize this and keep it from moving around.  There's room in the bottom to put in a bigger, heavier sandbag that would work better.  I'll have to improvise something.  But it does have velcro on the bottom.  The top seems superfluous to me; I think I will keep it open all the time.  What surprised me is that the top doesn't completely detach as I thought it did from the picture; it's fully attached on one side so you can't remove it (or lose it).",2.0
"It's ok but two things I don't like. One, it's a little small for my taste. Two, it needs some way to weight it down, like flaps with sand in them. It is continually falling over",2.0
This is very small. I would save your money and purchase a trash bin for your car. It's nice because it's weighted and won't tip over and it's water tight but we just went on a 15 hour trip and never used it.,2.0
"The little fabric-based trash container isn't big enough to hold things like old newspapers and magazines. It also, ironically, looks like garbage you have been meaning to throw away. It doesn't stand up too well and it's not marked in any way so nobody can really tell it's a garbage container. I'm sure it's not all bad, I just wouldn't buy another one.",2.0
"This trash can is alright, but it doesn't stay on the floor very well.  Before you purchase, also take into account where you will put it.  I  have a jeep compass and there really isn't a good place for it.  I wish that I would have purchased one that hangs behind the seat.",2.0
"the litterbag has several flaws.
Pro: good size and 2 sides are rigid; durable
Con: sides are too flexible. have to add cardboard to keep shape; has no way to put a small bag inside and stay; bottom has velcro but not the kind that will stick to carpeting; weighted 'beanbag' is too light;

overall, won't hold trash in a bag and won't stay in place",2.0
"I get a SPITLOAD of junk mail.  I got this hoping it'd hold a week's worth of junk mail from my box at my condo association's mail kiosk along with the occasional dead coffee mug or empty tissue holder.
It anchors real good to the floor, but  if I emptied one day's junk mail into it, I couldn't close the lid.
Oh, well.

Look, if you are really good about emptying the gunk out of your car *every bunch of errands you run, then this little doohickey is for you.  If you're a messy slob and dump half a cup of dead latte into your litter bag instead of emptying the mug into a gutter, than this doohickey is for you.  *I* would be worried about the stink, even if it didn't leak into the car seat or the car rug.

Otherwise, buy a nice soft squishable renewable components fair trade basket in a soft oval made in one of the countries in Afrida for the same price or a bit more, and know it'll hold more and do you just fine.  It is what it is.  I repackaged it and will give it as a gift to a neater and somewhat more obsessively tidy friend.  It'll do the job for her, but it wouldn't for me.",2.0

"I should have read the fine print better.  This product is labeled XL - but it should be labeled XS.
it is not large at all.  it works fine but it is not even close to the full volume on the inside that the outside view implies.

"This might be really great if all you need is a place for used kleenex. Please read the product dimensions and try to imagine what that size container would hold,  considering what you have in your car! In my car I have small water bottles, other drink containers, an occasional fast food bag, and mail that's not going home. This will hold about one day's worth of that! One-half day if my grandchildren are with me.

Product is well built and attractive. The weight (a bean bag) takes up some of the trash space in a zippered compartment on the bottom. The bag I have is 7 x 6 x 8. (Not the listed dimensions) Minus the bean bag = not much space for trash. Right now there is a water bottle, a juice bottle, and a crumpled up paper bag. Full. Time to empty.

I am returning the three I just bought for all the cars in the family.",2.0
Although it is a great product it is way too small for how expensive it is. I was thinking it was going to be a bit bigger anf after some research a two gallon just like it for only $13 dollars. Make sure if you buy the item you have a compact car. Other than that the product is great.,2.0
"Although I am the only person who uses my car (i.e. only one person's worth of trash) and am relatively neat, this trash can is still too small -- much smaller than it looks in the picture.  Once it has one coffee cup it in, it is mostly full.  It's better than nothing, but if I were buying something now I would definitely get something bigger.  Also the velcro doesn't really work, and, as others mentioned, it's annoying that it doesn't close properly once you put a liner bag in.",2.0
"For $17, I was expecting a lot more than what I got. The trash bin is so small, I can't believe I paid $17 for it. If you put a bag in it, the bag will be in the way of the velcro to keep the lid closed. A magnet would be a better idea. It works, and is nice to have.",2.0

Based on the description I ultimately ordered this as I thought it would meet my needs, but I did not and it has been rated accordingly.  If and when Fluke's descriptions are clear, I'll edit the review accordingly.  Overall I found most test lead manufacturers to be circumspect, a bit like shopping for mattresses.

"This is an overpriced, cheaply made/designed, and useless product.  It is very bulky when closed so if you need cargo space and fold it up, it takes up a lot of space.  Removing it from your car is a hassle (less so if you can store it in your garage, but again, it's bulky even when closed).  It's also cheaply made, with the a poorly designed piece breaking off that is needed to fold the walls.  And no, I never carried it by the walls (need to carry it by holding the bottom).  It's also a waste of money for such a lame product.  Like another reviewer said, I would have returned it if I had kept the box.  I never use it and it's not easy to get rid of due to the size/bulk.",2.0
"This is actually a great product. HOWEVER, ours arrived with only 3 holes drilled for bolting to roof rack. The 4 bolts were included but this totally escaped quality control. Since we needed it for an immediate trip we didn't have time to request a replacement. Usually Amazon includes a link to contact seller - but that didn't happen either. We ended up having to drill the 4th hole to install it - which caused a significant delay in our travel.",2.0
"Seemed cheaply made for the price.  I expected something light and rigid like an ice chest, but instead it was a flexible plastic!",2.0
"I bought this cargo box initially to store backpacks. However, once it was professionally installed, I quickly saw that the bottom part of the box was made of a very flexible plastic material; not ""hard"" like I was expecting. Once there is any kind of weight in there, it is very difficult to get the top latch lined up with the bottom, due to the softness of the material and its flex. I have been very frustrated each time I've used this thing because it takes me what I consider to be too much time to get the thing latched (at least 20 frustrating minutes of trying to get the top lined up).  I was expecting a cargo box that I could close, and latch the first time.

I will say that once latched, it has stayed latched.",2.0
"I would have never purchased this box if I realized that it would come with about 200 bolts and pieces, needing to be put together.",2.0
Hands down one of the most frustrating things I have ever put together.  I'm wishing I had splurged on one of the pricier models of Thule boxes now.,2.0
the cargo box is ok but the keys for the locks are junk they broke off in the locks after just a few uses,2.0
"I went with the Thule brand because I thought it meant quality. Many comments centered around the difficulty in building the box, but I was confident I could handle it with the help of my son. Unfortunately, however, the first problem I encountered was with the pre-drilled holes for the locks. One of them was drilled too low, causing the lock not to sit flush against the outside wall...it was pre-drilled too low and sat at an angle against the lip of the cover. Ok, I routed out a little plastic at the top edge of the hole and made the bolt/nut assembly fit flush against the side. If that had been the only problem I wouldn't have given it two stars and written a review, but unfortunately that was only the beginning. The next problem was the fact that the pre-drilled holes used to mount the box to the rack of my 2014 Subaru Outback wouldn't line up with my cross bars. No matter which set of holes I used it would place the necessary holes right over the center of one of the cross bars on my standard Subaru Outback racks. Ok, no problem...so I drilled a couple extra holes to make it work...a pain, but not the end of the world.

I thought I'd be done well ahead of the 2 hour average assembly time many have posted, but alas, here I was at the 2 hour mark with extra work just to get to this point. The 4-step directions are very poorly illustrated for such a relatively simple process. Maybe I got a lemon, but once it was finally together and we were heading down the highway there was a very loud and annoying vibration above 40MPH. I tried several things to stop the vibration including straps, additional weather stripping along both inside edges, repacking the stuff inside, driving with it empty, tightening the rack nuts and repositioning the box, but nothing worked. After nearly 10 hours on the road it was a huge relief to be home.

I don't know if I got a lemon or what, but if you own a Subaru, especially a 2014 Outback this, sadly, might not be the cargo solution for you. I had no choice but to return the item.",2.0
"This box looked adequately constructed for its task but it was just too short and narrow to hold two golf bags with clubs. I therefore had to return it and instead got the larger Yakima RocketBox 15 Cargo Box (see my review and others on Amazon). The RocketBox easily holds two golf bags with clubs, a few pairs of shoes, sox, golf balls, etc., though it is no longer available on Amazon and costs more than the Thule 682.",2.0
"I was pleasantly surprised when Amazon shipped this product to me ahead of schedule but when I started to unpack the box it was obvious that something was wrong because parts were falling everywhere. Also, I saw that someone had installed the vinyl hole covers and the foam gasket. I had been shipped someone else's return. The U-bolts had signs of wear and the following parts were missing:

1 U-bolt
1 Knob
2 Keys
1 Large nut
4 Small nuts
1 Large screw
3 Small screws
1 Large washer
1 Large cap
2 Large cap retainers
2 Small caps
3 Small cap retainers
Instructions and parts list (I downloaded them from Thule's web site)

A missing bolt might not be a problem if I could match them up at the local hardware store but this many missing parts after I spent this much money is unacceptable. I found a return UPS ground mailing label with the previous buyer's details on it. This is a real shame because this is one of the few cargo boxes that fits on my MINI Cooper and carries all my aluminium sailing kit parts. Unfortunately I'm going to need to send this back to Amazon (who have a great return policy). It's inconvenient however and I was hoping to use the product this weekend now that I have it but I guess I'll need to keep looking.

This is one of the very few times that Amazon has let me down.

The box itself is light and the lid is quite thin and flexible but I like that it is light and it has two locks. Looking at the U-bolts I doubt they would survive taking the box on and off the car a few times. I paid full price for a new product, not a used product. At least I get to see how it fits the MINI and how  well my sailing components fit inside the box. After more thought I don't think I'll get another one, it's just not very high quality.

I positioned the box on my MINI Cooper and it misses the aerial and fits comfortably on the roof without obstructing the sliding roof. I'm expecting that it will carry sails and spars without a problem. My inflatable rubber boat will need to go in the back of the MINI. I am nervous about how well the U-bolts will hold over a long trip given that the knobs have no locking mechanism and could loosen over a long trip with the vibration. The other consideration is the way the knobs stick up into the box but I guess that's the price for convenience and simplicity.

I really did not want to pay over $600 for a plastic cargo box (I think about products using a baseline of the cost/complexity and quality of an iPad) so this box at $261 was attractive. Given this box is pressed out of a mold and the parts are not expensive items I would guess that the margin of profit on this item is large. I estimate that the basic cost of materials (high volume production) is maybe $20 hardware (generous allowance) plus the two halves of the shell at around $40. It does not appear to be the high quality product that you would expect from a company with the name brand of Thule.",2.0
"Requires 2 people to put together, screwdriver, and 2 different size wrenches, plus an adjustable wrench (for lock assembly).

First step is to put weatherstripping on. No idea why this cannot be factory applied. Need to peel and stick foam strip around inside edge. Hopefully I got this right.

Next put locks on. Fairly easy. Next you have to put 2 halves together and bolt hinge. Would be easier if you were on the inside!:  requires a lot of stretching with box barely open reaching through narrow opening.

Next bolt support arms to top. Next tweak fit and tighten all fittings. I did all this myself, took about 1.5 hours of messing around to get locks to latch.

Put onto car. Not easy to put far side clamps on due to that side not opening (hinge side). Quite a stretch (I'm 5'11""). Position on roof and bolt down. Now I find out again that rear lock will not latch again.

Not impressed with required assembly. This should be done at the factory, or made a lot easier. Side opening seems to be good now its on the car, but getting it on would be easier with a rear opening box.

Not impressed with quality - seems quite flimsy. Need to stretch and bend when closing to get to fit, especially at rear. Need to spend more time on locks (locks need to latch before driving anywhere).

Wondering now why I didn't go with a wider box, I have wasted width on my roof bars, but not enough to put anything else (ie bike rack). Considering returning and getting Yakima Rocketbox 12. 5 inches longer, same height, but get 11 inches wider equals 50% more space than the Sidekick.

"This cargo box is attractive and very lightweight, but quality, and probably durability, is cut dramatically in order to achieve that end.

"I bought this coil to use on my 24"" Insignia CRT flat screen TV because I accidentally placed some speakers and a guitar amplifier by it, thus creating a significant ""purple"" spot on the bottom-right corner of the screen.

The product itself looks pretty professional. I mean, I know nothing about TVs and degaussing coils but this product looks like something you would see a TV repairman carrying...

I read the instructions and tried degaussing about three or four times, but each time I was still left with the purple spot. It did not make my TV worse, it just didn't improve it.

Maybe my TV is too magnetized or I'm just doing it wrong, but at $60 I decided to send it back. The return process was very easy and I did not have any problems with the company.

I would probably say avoid using one of these coils altogether unless you are familiar with how to use it because I think it screwed up my VCR and VHS tapes. However, if you are feeling adventurous (like I was), give it a shot - it may work for you. Besides, even if you send it back you're only out like $5-$10, which is a ton less than it would cost to have a repairman do it.

  These are not chrome, very thin stainless, center hubs are not stainless, hand holes are very small so you will have to purchase valve extentions, ($60 for decent ones), The front ones stick out off the rim about 3/8"", the rear ones 1/4"", when seated all the way in on my 2002 Chevy 1 ton. No center decal. Had to cut the plastic inner rings on the front ones to fit over valve stems.

The Pros:

 Cheap, have a nice shine, fit very tight. If its all you can afford, they're better than rusty rims.",2.0

"Bought this for camping - used it once with no problems.  When we got back we plugged it in (the manual says you can leave it plugged in all the time)a couple of weeks later I noticed the display was flickering, when I unplugged it the display did nothing (it should show percentage of charge or amp draw depending which 'mode' you're in) The 'customer support' number listed in the manual is not a good number, so I went through a process of requesting online support - 2 days later I got an email back asking me to call a different support number and supplied a 'case number'.  20 minutes on hold later, Xantrex told me to talk to Amazon, I told him I was out of my 30 day 'return window' with Amazon.  The product has a 90 day warranty, and I was within that, but he insisted it wasn't their problem, but Amazon's.

"Bought this product for our scheduled camping trip in August.  The unit arrived with a defect. First, The display button that is suppose to give you the number of watts drawn by your load (through the inverter) is not functioning, it displays zero all the time.  Second, according to the manual if you press the display button the second time, it should give you the remaining battery life in percent. But even this, is not functioning too. Third, When you turn on the main switch with the load already plugged in, the cooling fan (pressumably for the compressor) most the time will kick-in thus eating up extra juice from your battery. So I then called amazon and they were so quick to send me a replacement but it is unfortunate that no luck for me because the second unit that they sent me, is as bad as the first one so I am going to send it back to them.",2.0
"This arrived missing the cap for the light.  It doesn't seem to last very long at all before it loses power - it is simply powering a motion-activated remote camera, and will not go two days.

"I bought this 1.5 years ago and used it on occasion.  Recently, I noticed that the LED display started acting finicky and would not always display.  The problem quickly worsened to the point that now the LED will not display at all (no matter what) even though the unit still provides power as before, and even though it appears that the unit still can charged with the included A/C adapter.

The lack of a working LED display is very annoying because I will no longer get feedback as to how much power is left in the battery, or how many watts are being consumed when using the unit.  Since the warranty only lasts 6 months, I'm out of luck.

I tried temporarily disconnecting the battery and reconnecting it to see if that would ""reboot"" the display but it did not help.  I also tried removing the battery altogether and opening up the plastic case of the unit to see if there were any loose connections inside that would cause the display to fail but did not find any.  Some of the connections are in compartments that didn't seem accessible.  Looks like I'll just have to live with the lack of the LED display.

The only LED that still works is the one that lights up the power switch of the inverter.

Another complaint I have is that the clear plastic covers that protect the inverter and 12/V stockets are awkward to flip open because it is hard to get a good grip with my fingertips.

UPDATE:  The LED seems to be working again.  I have no explanation as to why it wasn't working before or why it is working again.  Looks like the LED problem is intermittant.  Battery was certainly sufficiently charged the whole time.",2.0

The stuff sack that comes with it is totally useless since it is far to small to accomodate the XXL jacket and pants (it might be OK for a small or even a medium) the zipper appears to be plastic (at least it won't rust) and the snaps do pull apart very easily in the vertical plane.

"I bought these to install on my 1977 Chevy K20 3/4 ton pickup. It has a dana 44 front axle and although these hubs were supposed to be the correct ones, they did not work properly. I installed the hubs and when they are set to ""free"" they do not release all the way. The hub still puts enough pressure on the gear that slides into place to engage the axle to cause it to rub against the splines it is supposed to engage. This causes a ratcheting sound when rotating the tire by hand. The contact would cause problems if the truck were run in that condition. I tried the other side and had the same result. I am a mechanic and always heard good things about Warn products, but now I am not so sure. I was surprised to see ""Made in China"" on the box when I opened it, and even more surprised when I installed them and the will not work properly. Another observation is that these hubs are very stiff to turn by hand. Someone without much hand strength may have a problem operating them. My advise to anyone installing these hubs would be to make sure they are not making any sounds when in ""free"" mode.",2.0

I lined up the front deflectors  prior to applying and they looked like a perfect fit.  Once applied they appear slightly short or warped since the front didn't fit into the window channel and wouldn't have been able to be completely go over the rest of the window.  There's about a 1/2 to 1 inch gap between the deflector and Windows.  On a side note the tape works extremely well..

"This is my third truck I have installed Air Lift brand on. As in the past I like the end result but I am very unimpressed with the directions and quality of the kit.  The directions bounce all over so plan on reading them several times.  If you have a Silverado, plan on ignoring some of the specific instructions.  They call for placing a thick spacer washer to level the upper bracket - well, after trying and uninstalling the bracket I called their technical folks they told me very casually to NOT install the washer - I must have a different truck.

The white nylon installation tool is handy - if they would only thread it properly.  Instead of rolling the threads they should cut them properly so you could actually get the guide nuts on without wrenches.  They do provide all the hardware and even a few extra's so when you loose parts inside the frame rail there are more to choose from.  I had to cut off a few of the bolts as they were way too long.
Even though they don't call for any specialized tools, having a set of crows foot open end wrenches that can be calibrated to your torque wrench would be handy, or you need to be cleaver enough to find a way to torque the bottom bolt going into the plastic base of the bladder.  I know about that because of truck number  1.
They don't provide enough wire tie wraps for the hoses so you'll need to get extras.

I must add that allowing four hours for install, calling tech help and fixing a few minor things is more appropriate than the 2 hours they suggest.

All that considered, the ride is great and they do exactly what they are supposed to do",2.0

"Be real sure to check your clearance from frame to tire - both Amazon and the manual say 6"", which I have, but that apparently wasn't enough.

For what it's worth, the manufacturer replied to a question on this listing that 7"" is actually required - too bad the manual doesn't agree with that nor the item description. Waste of time and money in my case, make sure you have 7""+ and you'd probably be just fine. Can't speak to the long-term durability since they lasted only one trip.",2.0

"Be aware - Air Lift Air Springs are very prone to leaking!  So, why might that be important to you?  Well, here's what it's meant to me.

I've had these on one of my vehicles for several years now and learned the hard way.  I bought this kit assuming they held air like tires, check them every once in a while like I do my tires and I'm OK.  Wrong!  Do not make that assumption.

One sleeve went flat within a couple of weeks of installation.  I didn't know it.  Running flat these things self destruct.  You will see this mentioned in other reviews.  It's common.  Anyway, I checked the other sleeve.  It had also leaked and was low but still good.  note: I plumbed each side separately with its own valve.)

A hundred dollars later and I was back on the road but the new sleeve also leaked.  I called the factory to complain and was told that, if I didn't like having to check the sleeves every time out, buy the compressor kit.

Well, why don't they be honest about it and tell you that right up front?  For many, like me, the Ride Control Kit is not an acceptable solution all by itself.

So, if you add a $200 compressor to your order, you're now spending $400.  And you have a lot of work staring you in the face.  Thinking twice?  Why not do it right and replace the springs like you should have done to start with?  They don't leak.  I can get real nice springs for $400?  And, in the long run the installation is a whole lot simpler.  See all those little parts?  They all have to go somewhere.  All those threaded things?  They go in holes you have to drill.  Don't forget to use jack stands.)

I will admit, the kit does work well when it is aired up.  I have to add air just about every time I use the vehicle and carry a small 12V compressor everywhere I go.  It's inconvenient (imagine cold, rain, wind, snow) and I think unkind thoughts each and every time, even when the weather's nice, but they do work.

If you're still convinced to band-aid your problem with this solution, do yourself a huge favor.  Go all the way.  Don't buy just the Ride Control Kit.  Get the compressor kit as well.  Allow plenty of time.  An extra set of hands is a good idea as is a spare vehicle for those errands to the store to buy other stuff you might need.  Watch your language if kids are around.  Read the instructions first.  Better yet, read them before you buy.  Look simple?

Why am I writing this so long after buying?  I just lost another hundred dollar sleeve.  My fault.  I forgot to check the air last time.  And, I'm deservedly grumpy.  Can you tell?  Don't let this be you.",2.0

"After a lot of research, I was originally going to go with the 50 series, but I ended up second guessing it and choosing the 40 at the muffler shop.  I knew that was the wrong decision for my 4.3L V6 Chevy S-10 on the way home.  The sound from the outside at idle and with a blip of the throttle is deep and mellow.  I wouldn't call it overly loud at idle, and I actually did get some complements on the sound.  Where I never quite got on board with it was the resonance inside the cab.  It is hard to describe, but while cruising, the constant ""bwwahhhhh"" sound was just the right pitch to get on my nerves in that small space.  I was late to a friend's house once, so I was rushing to get there.  When I arrived, he told me that he heard me come around the bend a mile up the road!  This was reinforced by the fact that several people have told me through the years that they could always hear me coming and I experienced it myself when people returned the truck after borrowing it.  If I had it to do over again, I'm would definitely have gone with something quieter for sure.  Something that didn't make it so that you have to yell to be heard by your passenger and had a better sound at cruising speeds or while under load.  On the other hand, if you've got a teenager, and you want to know when they come and go, get these!  Part of my issues could have been due to the small truck that it was on, and the fact that the muffler had to be located directly behind the passenger seat.

"Ok, I have a 1989 chevy K5 Blazer, TBI 350 mild build nothing special, with a Y-pipe into 3in pipe to a 40series with dual out 2.5 into 3in tips. Now when I origianlly installed this set up i still had the catilittic convertor and the sound was kinda blah, muffled like blowing air through a straw. No real depth to it, So i had the cat removed and woah. Now it is ridulously loud, way way way more than I ever anticipated and it has a horrible drone. So from my personal experience if you want a obnoxiously loud truck that drones down the highway and yells ""HEY LOOK AT ME IM DRIVING A BIG TRUCK"" then this is for you.... if your like me and just wanting a good depp rumble that you can live with every day try another set up. Im gonna try something elsee as soon as I can. But as far as the quality of the muffler and the looks I can say it is great, been on there for about 6 months before I removed the cat and still looked brand new and it went though a good KY winter. So in conclusion, durable, looks good but loud way loud. not something you can live with daily.",2.0
"It doesn't fit into my 03 Nissan Sentra 2.5 L as advertised both on Amazon and on K&N website. It is about 5 millimeter longer than it should be, making it impossible to lock in. I was disappointed and had to return it. Otherwise feels more quality than the cheaper ones.",2.0

"Only lasted 1 year in Arkansas weather.  Disintegrated on the top where it was exposed to sunlight.  Sides were still in good shape.  Might work better if parked in the shade as a dust cover.  As others have noted, this does NOT keep the camper dry.  I have had other covers of similar price that lasted 2 seasons.  I don't expect much more.",2.0

I checked under the cover to see if it was in fact working as advertised: ""This durable, convenient cover provides all-weather protection for your folding camper trailer. Treated for maximum water resistance and repellency"".  So after having been on the trailer for several days it was WET underneath the cover all over the entire top of the tent trailer after the first rain.  The reason I purchase the cover was to protect it from the rain. I would not recomend this product as a way to protect your tent trailer from getting wet.",2.0

"Works decently, though much too easy to over-tighten and bend. Only supposed to be one bend in this plate. It bent before I hit the suggested max torque of 60 ft-lbs.

Should be included with the load extender,2.0
I have a 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit and the plate doesn't fit well on the receiver.  The chain holes get in the way of the angled metal and it doesn't grab the protrusion around the receiver very well.  It did fit better rotated upside down but you're fighting gravity in that direction.  I will be travelling with it installed in the proper direction tonight.  I feel it will slip off the receiver and I'll have to install upside down.  I did have a little movement even when tightened. It wasn't much and a lot better than without it.  There may be better options for this vehicle.,2.0
It's really sturdy and heavy but it doesn't stop the wiggle. I was hoping this would be the answer. All it does is make taking the bike rack off and putting it on much longer and more difficult.,2.0
"Bought it on 6/7/16, arrived on 6/9/16 and installed on 6/10/16. Used it to remove the play my hitch bike rack had and it WORKED AMAZING! After having it on my car for the weekend I went to unbolt it and one of the nuts got stuck on the U-Bolt. Had no other way to get it off than breaking it off. See pictures attached, it was not cross threaded. Would have been a 5 star review other wise. I am currently seeing if Amazon will replace it. If not, I'll have no choice than to buy another one. Amazing product that works well, I just had an unfortunate mishap with mine.",2.0
"Didn't work for me. Should have read the description more carefully, I have a 1.25"" hitch and this fits 2.0"" hitch. Product is cleverly designed and well made.",2.0
"This works assuming you don't have anything to work around, and that any adapters extend far enough.

I couldn't use this with a bike rack because the bike rack had a 2"" to 1.25"" adapter which didn't stick out far enough to ""grab"" the adapter...which was where I needed to reduce the slop.

Then I later got a cargo tray, and it sort-of works but it doesn't work well with the clamp-on-tube wiring holder I have, because this depends on the receiver having no other clamps protruding from it.  I was able to use it on the tray, I just had to put it farther down the pipe so it just barely grabs the end of the receiver flange -- it seems to remove most of the slop in spite of being not in the ""right"" position.

UPDATE: Finally gave out...during a recent trip with my cargo carrier, I was pulling out of a parkinglot which had a ""bump"" as it met the road.  Everything seemed okay but when I went to remove the hitch-tightener I found the bolts wouldn't budge.  Apparently the bump I ran over was enough to stretch (or somehow otherwise damage in a way that isn't directly visible) the threads so it was stuck on my car in spite of having no load on the shelf at the time!  I finally managed to get under my shelf with a big torque wrench to get enough leverage and loosen the bolts enough that it wasn't grabbing and I could slide the whole mess off my car.

I wish the ""over the tube"" bar was a bit heavier metal, then maybe it wouldn't have had trouble.",2.0
"When tightened, lists hard to one side. Its not bent or cut straight",2.0
"So this hitch tightener is number one.  ""Only because it is the cheapest"" I got roped in on this. It does work but after a few uses the metal bends and the nuts come loose. I will buy the shim hitch tightener that won't bend this one maybe useful on a bike rack. It's just not going to keep its shape if you carry heavy loads.",2.0
might be good for a very light trailer.  this u-bolt stretched under load and was rattling away in no time at all.,2.0
Black metal piece tends to bend allowing slop on heavy loads. The ones with the metal bar across in place of the metal plate work better.,2.0
"Very good, worked as advertised",2.0
There are smaller better hitch tightners out there for about the same price.  Not all require tightening two bolts too.,2.0
"but  i was wrong. Followed instructions. I hall a Honda CRF250r on a UltimateMX hitch lift. It weights in the ball park of 275lbs fueled up. I bought this and several other device and have a few more on the way. Simple design. Tighten screws evenly with little torque check the wobble and tilt as i tighet. I install it I added a load of about 30 lbs dead weight the not anti tilt was not achieve along with the wobble. Continue to tight the the paint on the metal bracket start to crack, bending the plate. Applied the bike and the device was proved to be not sufficient. Added to my scrap metal bit. I will be submitting a you view once I receive a worthy device. So i can illustrate the the good and the failures.",2.0
There's any information about fitting and I guessed its for 1.25 because some product photo have class 2 end shape.,2.0
"does not fit well, adhesive does extend across the length of the bug shield, there are only four 1inch pads that don't even line up with the shape off the hood. This forces you to use the screws to attatch it",2.0
"I purchased this Torin 2.5-ton floor jack (Mod# T84025) from a big, orange box store. The description here in Amazon, as well as the Northern Tools and Home Depot web sites said this is an ""aluminum/steel"" jack. You would think that the jack being made from ""aluminum"" would result in a much lighter floor jack than those made completely from steel. However, when the jack arrived at my door, I noticed the weight wasn't a whole lot different from my (then) current 3-ton jack.
Even Torin's regular steel 2.5-ton floor jack (Mod# T82501) weighs 83 pounds, so a ~20-lb difference between the two didn't impress me much. Curious as to how an ""aluminum/steel"" jack could still weigh in at 60 lbs, I took my trusty magnet out of my toolbox. The only aluminum pieces on the jack is the receiver for the pump handle, the side chassis, the back wheels and the side handles.
That said, this is a good-looking, stylish floor jack. It functions well, and the key details like button-head bolts, make this look like a well-designed and built device.

Pros:
- clean lines; smooth finish
- nice details (button head bolts)

Cons:
- no pad on the handle to protect the lower edge of the car
- not as lightweight as one would expect
- no saddle pad
- under load, one rear wheel lifts about 1/2"" off the ground

If you're looking for a true light-weight floor jack, this may not be what you want. If you want a nice looking, lighter-than-some-others jack, then you'll like this one. I would have rated this at 4 or 5 stars if the description didn't make it seem as though the aluminum portion of this jack would result in a weight found in the lightweight, racing-style jacks. In all fairness though, the descriptions at all three web sites did say this weighed 60 lbs, so it's not as though the weight was misstated.",2.0
This did not fit my 2002 Ford Ranger Edge V6 although the website identified this model as a fit.  After a little more research I ordered the right model.  Return was easy!,2.0
"Not much to say, the jack was heavier than expected but it is good looking and fairly easy to move around. I does not work !! I have followed the procedure to remove air and checked the oil level. The jack does not raise at all. Called customer service and left message. Will update as the case progresses.  Customer service called back, and gave me a procedure to follow, the procedure made sense, but unfortunately did not fix my jack. Called customer service, left message, they immediately called back and offered to send me a new pump. Exellent solution. Will update when pump arrives.",2.0
"This turkey is going BACK!  The hydraulic pistons were leaking right out of the box and still leaking after a few uses.  Beyond this failure, I still am wanting for anything good to say about this jack besides it's moderately light weight.  Compared to my old Craftsman 3.5 ton jack, it is inferior several ways (a lot of loose tolerances and play, for starters).  Waste of my time.",2.0
"I ordered a set of vent visors for my 99 f150 and loved them. They fit into the window channel, which gives them a sleek, finished look. The set that I ordered for my Excursion are attached to the vehicles paint with double sided tape. I think they look hokey, like a cheap aftermarket product. If I ever order another set, I will find a set that fits in the window channel.",2.0
"These didn't fit properly. They were just a little bit off, but enough to easily notice, especially while installing. I had to decide to cover the window fully, or have this fit in its intended spot. I had to bend these to get them to fit. About 15% of the 3M tape is serving no purpose because of improper fit. From far away, these look fine. They do their job keeping rain out and they are still hanging on, so 2-3 stars based on that.",2.0

Two of the underhood mounting tabs broke off along with an orange wedge sized chunk which popped off. This may have been because of the cold or the thinness of the material. Either way, not good.",2.0

I'm thinking about taking them all off because that one looks tacky....I'm a little disappointed now.",2.0

Needless to say it looks stupid and now they are stuck on there.",2.0
I received this product yesterday and right away installed it. I should start the front instead of the rear. When I ligned up the front its too long. It didn't fit well. It overlap the black plastic for the side mirror. Now there's a gap.,2.0
"I know that AVS is a good brand for auto accessories like this. However, I am not sure if the one I received was either incorrect or just made poorly? I installed these on my 2004 Civic Si hatchback and they don't really fit. When I unpacked them, they were slightly curved (not in the obvious way, more like bowed or bent). And the shape of the visor is incorrect too, almost like my car window/door is too long for this visor. I ordered the right model, so I am not sure why the fit is not right. It is still sticking on after a few weeks, but I won't give it too much longer. If it falls off, I'll go without one or get a different brand. I bought this because it was a good price, but the only way I can explain it is that the fit is not correct. I had to force it on and make sure it was stuck with the tape before I let go, because I was worried that it was too warped and misshapen that it would fall off. Not sure what the deal is with this but it's almost useless. Also, since the fit is not good, there is a gap so that rain and wind come through the front of it. I hate that I purchased this.",2.0

It stated it would fit our Ford Explorer but far from it. I tried to fit it up and would take a lot of change to get it to fit but wouldn't look right anyway so I went a got one from Ford and I put it on in about 15 minutes and it look great. It may work on some other car but it sure wasn't for ours.,2.0
"The bug deflector looks super nice on my 2001 f250 ,however there are two things that kinda bugged me ...
1st- it needed a little bit of modifying near the 2 rubber spacers mounted at the front of the hood,the function of those spacers is to keep your hood ligned up with the fenders,so it took about 10 minutes of modifying ""NOT A BIG DEAL"" if you got some tools on your hand .
2nd -what pissed me off was that after I mounted it on the hood I tried closing the hood to see how the finished product looks like and Sure enough the hood won't close ,I had to shut the hood with more force In order for it to close .
Still ...not a big deal ,it closed.
After all that said and done I was shocked to see that there was a scratch near the AVS emblem on the front of the deflector and its really noticeable ,so now I don't think I'm gonna be able to return the product because Ive already done the mods on it ,so a piece of advise : inspect the product before you mount it .",2.0

"I have a 2001 Ford F350 Crew Cab. This is the second shield I have installed on this truck.

Pros:
-This shield fit the hole pattern on my hood.
-Seems to be sturdy.

Cons:
-This shield fit the hole pattern on my hood but did not fit around the factory hood bumpers. After some modification I was able to mount it.
-The cheep cabinet quality hood protectors used to mount on top of the hood to protect the shield from wearing off the paint. My previous shield had 3/4 "" high bumpers (high quality and I used them again).
-Shield looks to be rubbing on the front underside of the hood. I'm concerned it will wear off the paint. Used the cheap cabinet protectors provided to try to protect the paint here. Will have to keep an eye on it.
-Shield only goes to the end of the hood and does not cover the front of the quarter panels. Last shield wrapped around to cover the entire front end.

"This deflector, while well made, is not compatible with the 2nd generation Nissan Murano. The roof of the Murano is curved and there are seams on each side that prevent proper adhesion of the deflector to the roof. I installed following the directions to the letter and the deflector worked great the first day. The second day I noticed that the corners had already started to come unstuck  (2-4 inches on each side). This clearly posed a safety hazard as it was only a matter of time before the deflector came off at high speed in the rain or snow. I unfortunately had to return because it would not work with my car's roof design.

All in all this is probably not a bad product for cars with a flat, seamless roof.",2.0
"I'm giving then 2 stars only because when I purchased this bug deflector they had a promotion with $25.00 mail in rebate, the item it's good and it fits and looks great, however they didn't honor the rebate even after I sent a copy of my proof of purchase along with their rebate form, I'm very dissatisfied!",2.0
First item didn't arrive. Amazon immediately shipped out a replacement to make it right. I purchased it as it says to leave 1 inch on each side of the sunroom. That measured out to be 38.5 inches for me. However the visor is too long and does not provide a very nice fit. I probably could of gotten away with a step down on the size. I drive a 2009 Chevrolet silverado. I also have noticed since install that it makes a noise when open that sounds almost like leaves are trapped up around the visor. However after close inspection there is nothing in or around the visor that could be causing this. So i assume it is the seal on the visor. Contemplating removing all together.,2.0
This would have been 5 stars BUT the hardware that came with the bug shield is junk. If you order this you will need to go to the auto parts store and purchase trim screws for a couple dollars. I would have paid a extra few dollars for a bug shield that had good hardware with it. I put the bugflector on my truck with the original hardware and the bugflector actually came off when I closed my hood due to the hardware supplied. Other than that the actual shield seems to be very well made.,2.0
Did not fit truck as described. Required special fabrication to get it to fit. Not sure why because it was clearly advertised to fit the truck. Too much of a hassle to return.,2.0
Poor instructions. Needs to be cut out around grill brackets to clear brackets on 98 GMC sierra. Otherwise decent product.,2.0
Be ready to work!!!  This hood shield is not a no tool installation item as stated.  I've NEVER seen such a piece of garbage install kit with anything I've ever installed.  I finally ended up installing it with very short self tapping screws.,2.0
"I put in my car year, make, and model on Amazon.com and it said that this product was compatible with my vehicle but when I actually tried to install the product it was far too large. I tried putting it both inside of the windows and outside the windows but both ways it was far too long. Its a shame because I really wanted this product to work with my vehicle to protect it from the heat in Florida, leaveing the windows down would make my vehicle alot cooler if I didn't have to worry about my car getting soaked by rain. The product consisted of 2 long pieces for the front windows and 2 shorter pieces for the back windows. The insides of the platic pieces had all weather double sided tape (the red one you find in hardware stores) and it came with 4 alcohol wiping pads to clean off the area before applying the double sided tape.

--------
- Great Price, half the price of the Weathertech branded deflectors.

Cons

- It didn't fit my 2005 Nissan Sentra S even though the website said they were compatible, they were far too long.

Conclusion
------------
It would have been great if it fit my vehicle but unfortunately it didnt.",2.0
"Messed up, had to return,,",2.0
It's ok and does what it's supposed to but it is now a major major pain to unlatch my pickup hood because this thing rides so far out from the hood edge. I had another brand before this one that was much better. So I don't recommend this one.,2.0
"I had a heck of a time trying figure out the instructions and only then realized that the attachment pins, weren't long enough and hardy enough to stay locked-in their holes, to keep the hood shiled in place. I am still hopeful that I can find some soft plastic attachment pins, that are about a half-inch longer. I do not have the hood attached to my 2002 CRV at this time.",2.0
But 1 was poorly milled. The edge on the driver side front shade had two small cracks in it from what appeared to be the tooling getting hung up on the shade.,2.0
"It's probably my fault that I didn't read the directions and I never owned a car that has no door frame surrounding the top of the window. My Outback is my first - with its window down it has no frame above the door. Anyway, when I first installed them I put them right above the window - where they are supposed to go as I thought. Well when I opened the door the windows ripped the visors right off. They are supposed to go higher so that the windows can clear them. After running to the hardware store for more double sided tape I got them properly installed according to the directions. I believe this product is defeatist as the point of it is to create a wind break RIGHT ABOVE THE WINDOW NOT AN INCH ABOVE! There is a reason why it was so hard to find this set... the entire concept of a window vent is not kosher for cars that have no door frame. They simply made them so that people who know no better would buy them, but they do not keep weather and wind out very well at all. In fact with the window open a crack I now have a jet of cold air hit me just behind my ear. It's winter here now, and I'm afraid of the rain come this spring. Bottom line... SAVE YOUR MONEY!",2.0
"Downside to this otherwise fine product:

1) WAY overpriced.

2) For the $125 cost I paid should have received two kayak strap sets - only comes with one...",2.0
This serves very little purpose. I no longer use it and just tie my two kayakes on to the luggage rack.,2.0
I made a mistake getting this for two kayaks. Get the Hull-a-Port if you're hauling a 12+ kayak and 10ft kayak. It's MUCH faster to use that over this. It was taking me FOREVER to securely tie down my kayaks. Ended up getting the Hull-a-port during the sale and I am MUCH happier with it's easy to load capabilities. I just needed something that took less time and I'm not happy with this device.,2.0
"I bought the Thule stacker for my 2009 Honda CR-V. Getting it onto the car was easy. It was from there that things did not go well.
Like another reviewer experienced, the racks (which are able to fold down) could not be tightened enough to stay in an upright position. This, understandably, causes the kayaks to move when in transit, affecting the tension on the lines and thus causing the kayak to become insecure, creating the potential for an accident (to a person or to the kayak or car).
I have a WS Ride 115 (76 lbs, 11.5 ft long, 33 in wide), and it is clearly too wide to use this rack safely. It fits the specifications for the rack, but in reality it just didn't work. The stacker also failed to properly transport our Spitfire, which is a significantly smaller kayak. We faced the Spitfire hull in, as demonstrated in the instructions, the kayak slid inch by inch the entire drive (despite the straps being very tight and secure. Eventually the kayak had slid down so much that it was hanging off of the edge of the rack.
In the meantime, the Ride 115 also slid down into a flat position. If we had not had the bow and stern straps, that beast would have been straight off the car on the passenger side.
It took two hours to transport two kayaks 30 miles for all the stopping, readjusting, cursing, damage to the car and kayaks.

We had other paddlers comment on how secure the boats were, etc, so I know it is not a user issue.
Ours is going right back to REI, and I also believe that the J shaped bars MIGHT be safer to work with. But I am feeling done with THULE.",2.0
"I bought this for a 2015 Jeep Wranger and was disapointed.  The spare tire does need to be removed to use.  The tire is heavy and takes 2 people to place back on.  They need to add 3"" to the hitch mount for Jeep Wranger owners.  All other items are tops.  Truly, Dave from Pa",2.0
"I ordered this because I like the quality of Thule's products, but it arrived damaged and with nearly all of the parts missing. I shipped it back and had a replacement sent, which was prompt, but again the package was already open, damaged, and while some of the parts were there many were still missing. Sent it back for a full refund and ordered it through a local supplier instead.",2.0
"Hard to get a good grind, paint on wood is of poor quality and is coming off.

Need to turn the handle a long time to get any coffee.",2.0
"When I received it, soon as I opened the box I saw gold paint smeared on the bag inside the box. Needless to say, the paint wasn't done very well. The grinder itself, I found to be loose on the base. I have to hold the drawer in while I grind the coffee, which takes longer than any grinder I've seen, but the grind is very consistent. The wood was also I much brighter orange than I thought it would be. Overall, I wouldn't have gotten it if I knew this is how it would be, but it does the job that I got it for. I can grind coffee while the family sleeps without waking then.",2.0
"This coffee grinder works ok. It grinds coffee just as well as an electric grinder and looks really cute on the counter. It also seems well made. However, when we took it out of the box it had this really horrible smell. I guess its the oil they use for the grinder? Not sure really but wow does it smell! Thinking it wouldn't transfer into the coffee we ground some and brewed it to see how it would taste. Instead of walking into the kitchen to a pleasant aroma of fresh coffee, I was bombarded with a repulsive stench that like burning metal. We couldn't even drink it! I had to clean the coffee maker soon after because the stench then moved into other pots of coffee that were brewed. I will say though that months have passes since we bought it and the smell has actually died down to the point of not even noticing it. I'm in no rush to attempt to grind and brew anymore coffee with this thing however. Sadly my quest for a non electric coffee grinder continues. I only wish I could have gotten my money back on this thing! Its only getting two stars because it looks pretty.",2.0
"While it looks attractive, its put together poorly and doesn't hold more than a scoop of coffee; was delivered with screw which is needed to keep base from rotating.",2.0
The grinder works ok but has a terrible odor that seems to be comming from the catch drawer. This odor is present in the brewed coffee. It must be some species of wood from China. I also had loose screws securing the base.,2.0
"The unit is a bit too noisy, so much that it is very annoying if not on the low setting (but still noisy).  I've had it several months, and have found it to be reliable, but not that good of a cleaner.  It is a bit large, but not heavy.  It's probably best for a room in which you wish to circulate air, with a small bit of purifying needed.",2.0
"I am not sure if the product is malfunctioning or cycles on/off too much. A little disappointed, but still reviewing operation of product.",2.0
I could be wrong but this may be only used for Kooltron products.  I used it for another portable refrigerator and drained my battery.,2.0
I loved it the first time I used it but it quite working after the first use,2.0
Not really what I expected!,2.0
It stopped working within one day.  Complete and total waste of money.,2.0
none,2.0
"This tent isn't horrible, but it simply isn't worth the price tag on it. The product is very cheap. Mine came in a ripped bag, and when I called the company to possibly get a new bag they completely blew me off. If it rains you WILL get wet, and you'll have to close your hatchback to stay dry completely defeating the purpose of the tent. It'd be a five star review from me if the tent cost $30. $130 for this tent is a rip off. You're better off getting some mosquito next, opening up your hatchback, and draping it over the hatchback, as it's just about the equilavalent of that. You can find better deals elsewhere........",2.0
"It doesn't work on my Pontiac Trans sport as listed in the description  as a vehicle that this tent will fit.
It doesn't!!  The entire bottom is too short to fit around the vehicle, so mosquitoes and other critters could enter.
The first night we used it,  I had to stretch and tape the entire  bottom to my van. And unfortunately, it rained
so I cannot return it. My only alternative is to sew an 11 foot  length of tent fabric to the bottom and re-string the bungee
cord.  I really did not plan to work that hard.  I'm giving it 2 stars because I like the concept of having an
additional  ""screen""  window  for air movement.  But I am very disappointed.",2.0
Sadly the product does not fit my dodge caravan (2008). It is way too small to reach the sides and too short to reach and fit to bumper when the rear door is open. The product specifications says it's suitable for a dodge caravan. Sadly it is not. I would give the item a higher review if it actually fit my vehicle. It seems like it would be nice (definitely see the need for magnets and likely you have to shorten bungees chords and make lil alterations to get a perfect tight fit if it does fit your ride. If you have a dodge caravan 2008 or newer I would not recommend this product.,2.0
"Didn't fit Honda SUV very well.  Also, tab to insert pole in was sewn in wrong.  Good idea but I had to return it.",2.0
Clumsy to use.  I think there are better products out there to use.,2.0
"Affordable and works okay.  After about one month of use, it has started to break down. so now everytime I use it, I get a ton of black dust on my face and clothes.",2.0
Like how many CDs it holds but it started falling apart after 10 months,2.0
FELL APART AND CRUMBLED IN MY CAR AFTER 5 MONTHS,2.0
"After a few months in my car, it started to break apart and leave this black gunk raining down on my lap whenever I would pull out a CD",2.0
"This began disintegrating after about six months of very light use. It lost its hold on CDs in the first pocket, letting them fall out when making turns, and it got thick black plastic dust all over my dashboard and passenger seat. I wasn't expecting premium quality for this price, but still I expect car accessories to last at least a few years before needing replacement. I'm shopping for a new one now, and will not be buying another of these.",2.0
"Worked well for 4 months, then CD separator material disintegrated.  True it was inexpensive but it became unusable quite suddenly. Had to throw out.",2.0
It held the CD's fairly well but the coins constantly fall out of the pocket when I turn and the straps just barely fit around the visor.,2.0
Ok,2.0
"Does the job but my husband sometimes struggle with it, mainly inserting disc back. Not so sturdy.",2.0
Cheap construction and stitching is already coming apart.,2.0
"Does the job, however, within days the little change pouch was coming apart. That feature is currently useless. I know it's very inexpensive, but I expect things to work as described for at least a little while. Should have gotten something nicer.",2.0
"I was expecting this to be sturdy.
It warped my CDs from the heat of the car when it's not running.
I had an ID card in the slot and its completely warped too.
Bummer.",2.0
I placed an order for a 7.2AH 12V B.B. Battery.  Recieved a 7AH 12V B.B. Battery.  Waiting on response from company.  First experience with company not so good...,2.0
Super cheap looking.,2.0
Very bulky. Not as magnified as expected. Going to keep it because it was so cheap.,2.0
Served it's purpose for about six months then randomly fell apart while I was driving. The makeup was cheap. Mostly two sided tape holding it together.,2.0
Smaller than expected in the details aren't there it's just a very simple rectangular mirror.,2.0
"I had been yearning for someone like you. And you really met my needs the first 2 weeks. You fit so well. On my visor.  But then reality of the bumps and flips of life set in and you started making noise just Erving down the road. Then was the big crash. Now you live in pieces in my door panel, you jerk.",2.0
Too small,2.0
"I wanted a cheap mirror and that's what I got. The metal hooks on the back are super cheap, and the plastic is super cheap. It's a large mirror which is nice, and the quality of the mirror seems pretty decent. But the housing and metal are not very good. Looks pretty bad.",2.0
"The clock was not very big, and I was under the impression it was at least 2"" in size.  1"" is closer to the actual size, and getting the clock set is not very easy as the buttons are not very responsive to your touch.  For the price, it is what you get for that price.  If I could have seen the actual size, I would not have purchased it.",2.0
Setting the clock is nonstandard and not intuitive.  Clock has repeatedly changed settings spontaneously and sometimes had to be coaxed back to showing the time.,2.0
Fits my visor too tightly,2.0
Fell apart almost immediately but epoxy/hot glue fixed it easily.,2.0
"It is so small that when mounted, it must be near eye height. Very hard to see in low light.",2.0
I purchased this for my motorcycle.  This didn't fit on my Sportster.  I do not recommend this purchase.  Very disappointed.,2.0
"Plastic does not work well in the Arizona desert heat. My clock melted on my dash. My bad, I should have known better.",2.0
"I stuck it on my motorcycle, it doesn't keep time well, which is it's job.
Within a week, it's 15 minutes fast.
Being on a motorcycle, it's not exactly ever a good time to try to set the clock, if I could remember the sequences - have ended up figuring it out but it takes time to do each time, and a clock should keep time.  Losing or gaining a minute or two every month or so I could live with, but not 15 minutes every couple weeks.",2.0
"Its functional to some degree and at least fits in the space it needed to.  However, this thing is the cheapest piece of flimsy low quality plastic I've seen in a while.  The cup holders don't even hold anything due to them being so shallow.  Terrible design.",2.0
Looked nice but broke when the first rock hit it.  Suggest buying the flat type that is guaranteed for life rather than this product.,2.0
Did not line up with tags,2.0
I received the two covers and found that one was cracked. Having used this type of cover before I normally get a years use prior to it cracking.  Did not return due to the hassle,2.0
"Very cute, went on easy. Use for my front vanity plate. Someone bumped my car and this this fell apart. Not sturdy. If you love in a metropolitan city this is not for you. Suburbs with plenty of parking, great!",2.0
"I thought this one was great, until it cracked for no apparent reason.  I'll be replacing the cracked one with a different brand.",2.0
"Was missing the front rod, hard to get any service, impossible to get replacement parts...friend put it together and manufactured a rod for me!  Go to a store...save time, which is money to me, and make sure all the parts are there!",2.0
The auto wallets we received were not what the picture showed on-line.,2.0
Made of cheap materials.,2.0
"It was new but had big yellow  ""Bell "" written on it.  I wanted solid black and though that is what I ordered.",2.0
Did not like that it has advertising on cover that does not show on the photo.  Otherwise it is usable,2.0
"My glove compartment box is always a mess, so I thought this would be a great thing to get.  It is a good idea; however, it falls short because it is so cheap.  The ink on the registration wore off on the plastic, it gets stuck in there, and the heat melted off the glue for the velcro so I have sticky stuff all over now.  I don't recommend this at all.",2.0
"The material is of poor quality, which is understandable due to the low price.

However, registration has to be folded many times to fit this wallet. Why is it Registration Holder when registration does not fit it?",2.0
When installing the four bolts and nuts that hold it in place the threads stripped on the bolt and I could not pull it up tight.,2.0
Screw was broken. I cancelled.,2.0
The plastic screws broke off way too easily. I had to use stainless steel replacements.,2.0
Don't use the screws! They disintegrate and get stuck in the screw hole,2.0
Missing 2 plastic covers for plate,2.0
"i gueas it was cheap, so it feels  cheap. like i broke it on install cheap.",2.0
"The screws that come with this are plastic and can come out easy. The one little plastic quarter size cover for the screw, fell off and I don't know what happened to it.",2.0
"looked ok, but cheezy for the $11.00 I paid, I found the same one at o'rielys auot parts for $6.00
so figure it out.",2.0
"The frame is fine and looks nice but I couldn't believe that the fasteners were plastic (very cheap plastic)
I tried using them and they all broke! 30 minutes trying to get them out and then a trip to autozone to pay $2.99 for 4 screws?",2.0
"I really like how the caps hide the bolt heads, and the skinny frame allows the state-required stickers to be viewed easily on my license plate, however the bolts themselves are plastic and the head of one bolt sheared clean off while I was tightening it, so I had to use needle-nosed pliers to unscrew the bolt shaft from the car and use the old, metal bolts that were previously used to attach the license plate to the body of the car.  The bolt caps do not attach securely over the metal bolts, so now it just looks pretty silly.  Will replace as soon as I can.  I can't be mad, you get what you pay for!",2.0
Cheap piece of plastic. Not worth the price,2.0
"Made of plastic covered in silver, very cheeply made. I thought it was stainless steel according to an answer by a seller. Bought for use on commercial vehicles where air pressure is around 80psi. This is not an accurate gauge, it reads about 10 psi lower than our shop air gauge which is accurate. There's better quality cheaper products out there.",2.0
Doesn't work very well and broke after three uses,2.0
"Product looks and feels VERY cheap!  I hope it works well and is accurate, but a I anticipate it to break due to its weak construction.",2.0
"Pretty cheap, I'd recommend Milton's heavier duty Pencil Gauge:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Milton-S-925-Pencil-Tire-Gauge/dp/B002XMW8RG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Milton S-925 Pencil Tire Gauge</a>&nbsp;for passenger cars or one of Milton's other offerings per your specific needs. The Milton units are not much more expensive and EXTREMELY well built (in the USA). Way better than this flimsy plastic gauge.

It works, but the feel in hand leaves a lot to be desired. If you could buy these in bulk for like a buck a piece I'd say it was a great deal and give them out to all my friends.",2.0
Cheaply made. You get what you pay for.,2.0
I thought this gage was steel after reading the description and answered questions from the seller. The tube is really thin steel but the head and clip are plastic. And feel very cheap and weak. I guess I should have known from the price.,2.0
"When I bought this it was on sale for around $5, down from original price $95.  That's right 90 dollars off retail price.  The description said it was fully made of metal, I don't remember the exact wording but it made it sound pretty nice.

This is absolutely not made of any metal whatsoever and absolutely not worth $95.  It's very light and flimsy.  However it does read to 100psi and it was only 5 bucks, so I give it one star for price and one for function.",2.0
"I do not know how anyone can say this product works.  The commercials show a man using the product on a black sports car, and it dries like new.  I have a black Cobalt and used this product for the first time today, in the shade, and in 74 degree weather.  I followed to instructions exactly and after rinsing I noticed the soap had left a white film all over my car!  The water was drying spotless but the soap wasn't.  The water also wasn't drying ""before my eyes"" either.  I still had to end up going over my car with a cloth to remove the soap film.  After I use all this I will not be buying a refill, if I even use it again.  Luckily this was a gift or it would be going back to the store!",2.0
I saw the ad on television and got pretty excited.  That excitement turned to extreme disappointment when I first used this.  It's more work to wash the car with it than without it.  It's a complete waste of money.  I had a few friends who warned me about it before I bought it and now I wish I had listened.,2.0
"I had a pretty dirty car and I used the Mr. Clean Starter Kit. I followed all the directions. I also washed my car in the shade, and I rinsed and soaped the car in portions as one reviewer mentioned. I waited about 30mins or more for the car to dry and the only parts that were really clean and shiny were the windows. It still left a lot of dirt on my car, despite all the scrubbing I did during the soaping step. It even took more water than what I would have used washing it the old fashion way. I looked that the FAQ sheet that came with the kit and it said that if you see streaks it may be dirt, and all you have to do is go through the steps again to get rid of it. It's just a hassle. At least I can wash my house windows with it until the filter get's used up. Otherwise it's a waste of money.",2.0
"Another reviewer wrote about how bad the adapters are... I want to expand on this.

Spark plugs are typically easy to install.  These adapters are NOT.  First off, a spark plug has an electrode to help guide it into the spark plug hole.  The adapters have nothing but threads.  This means that you must mate the threads square, most of the time without being able to see or feel what you are doing.  Be careful - if by some miracle you happen to get the threads engaged, make sure you don't cross thread!

The second thing about a spark plug is its length.  This little bit of length allows you to install the plug by hand.  The adapters were simply too short to allow you to be able to thread them by hand... at least in my application.  This brings me to another point - the adapters are NOT the same size as a spark plug!  WHY? I already have the spark plug socket out, couldn't you make the adapters the same standard sizes???

The last thing woefully wrong about this product - the hose.  If, by some miracle, you were able to thread the adapter in, now you must ALSO thread the hose to the adapter!  The thick rubber hose is extremely rigid and next to impossible to turn. This problem would have easily been solved by using braided stainless line of a smaller diameter.

I'm pretty sure I could have pulled the engine, done rings, bearings, seals and gaskets in about the same amount of time that it would have taken to do all six cylinders... but I'm not sure as I stopped after wasting an hour and only testing one cylinder!",2.0
"Perhaps mine was defective, which is in itself a problem, but I thought the point of a compression gauge was to HOLD the highest reading as the strokes occur, and then you can release it when done.  Well mine never held, they flipped back to zero after every stroke, and this made it really hard to read.  I fiddled with everything that came with it, read the instructions completely, and no luck.  very disappointed.",2.0
After installing this product i did notice an improvement on the noise reduction but not as much as advertised.,2.0
"This product was really a waste of money. I was pulled over several times because the cover, covered up too much of my license plate. I had to trim it down to show the month and county stickers. The Dynamat strip that came with it, was junk as well. I ended up having to replace it with something else.",2.0
"Product is great but need more of it, still rattled the plate number, better off getting others for the price like audio technix",2.0
"Im all about sound systems. Ive been an audiophile since before I put the key in my first car. Coming from someone who has invested countless hours and dollars in car audio the only thing I can say about this product is that wether or not you have a giant system in your trunk, why would you want to advertise that you MAY have one? The only thing I see coming from this is someone seeing the Dynamat logo and the ""I have better sound"" slogan and thinking hmm Im going to break into this car. I have about a grand worth of equipment in the trunk of my Chrysler 300, and I don't want anyone to know that when the car is off and parked. You would be better off buying a roll of 20 feet of stick on insulation at Home Depot for $20 and doing the entire back of the license plate AND the inside of the trunk lid at the same time like I have done on the past three cars I have owned. Hope this helps!",2.0
"This amount covered 4 doors on 2005 Tahoe and both A and B pillars. Did nothing to deaden the sound from outside car, from what I understand you need to do roof and floor for this to reduce sound to where you can tell and in some cases use a mat on floors. That would be over 800 bucks worth of material for a 6-8 db drop in sound. If your looking for a sound reduction find a cheaper material or get ready to spend close to a grand.
2 stars only because I noticed slight gains in music quality but even then I feel it may be in my head.
before you say it wasn't installed right, I had a professional shop do the work.",2.0
"Works well with thicker (10W40) oils when kept on a workbench, but you probably keep an oil can for that purpose.  The unit leaks with thinner penetrating oils (my intended purpose), and you would not want to keep it in a shirt pocket for the same reason.  I thought it would work carried in a tool box, but you can't readily tell if it still has oil in it, so you may find yourself out of oil at the job site.  I would not buy it again.",2.0
didn't quiten like i heard it would,2.0
"Dynamat makes two versions of this roller, a cheap one and a more expensive one.

The more expensive one is rather overpriced and should probably cost about the same as this one.

This one, unfortunately, is so cheaply made that it is just not very usable.  The wood roller (instead of the hard rubber of the better one), means that it slips along the Dynamat instead of stretching it, and pressing it harder into the surface, which is necessary to get rid of the little gaps and bubbles that reduce performance.

Even though the more expensive one is overpriced, I still recommend buying it instead of this one.  If you buy this one, you'll probably be back in short order to buy the better one, and that will waste even more money.

Here's a link to the better one:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dynamat-10007-Professional-Heavy-Duty-Roller/dp/B0007WTE08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dynamat 10007 Professional Heavy Duty Roller</a>",2.0
It is what it is. you get what you pay for. The bracket that hold the roller was junk. the rest of the roller was good. worked well until the roller kept coming out.,2.0
"in this case, means CHEAP. If you plan to use this item more than once, do yourself a favor and upgrade to the fancy, expensive one or purchase a roller designed for vinyl flooring installation. The brackets on this are weak and bend to allow the wheel to fall out.
It does what it it was designed for.",2.0
Bought this to install Dynamat Xtreme and after 5 minutes the metal portion bent and the roller kept slipping out whenever you gave it some pressure.  It is a very disappointing product given the price and the fact that it is a Dynamat product.,2.0
"Falls apart after time.  I also installed dynamat throughout my entire car not just a panel.  For a small panel it is probably good, but for large items, I would upgrade.",2.0
"I paid a professional auto sound dampening installer nearly $2000 to put Dynamat Extreme in my 2014 Toyota Avalon Limited that has soooo much road noise.  It was simply unbearable on the freeway.  I had the doors, trunk, firewall, and entire floor done.  I also had the Dynapad laid over the flooring Dynamat - I was told that would ensure sound coupling.  The only benefit was the doors but had very little if any effect in deterring road noise.  I was so angry at all the hype and promises on how wonderful Dynamat products are.  I feel the same way as the person who did his Toyota Highlander!  It may work on older cars, but the new more rigid body structure vehicles just cannot be helped.  If you go to Dynamat sites they typically display older cars - that should have been my first clue.",2.0
"Under the pressure of use the product quickly deforms. You might be better off with a better-made product. Nonetheless, for a small job, this would work fine.",2.0
"I just finished my Dynamat installation in my car and this tool was infinitely valuable!  However, this particular roller was below what I'd consider to be of good construction.  The two metal peices holding the roller cylindar in place kept bending outward causing it to dislodge mid use.  I probably had to stop my work, disassemble the roller, and repair it at least 10 times over the course of this single car installation.

Is a roller like this worth it, DEFINITELY!  However, I'd check the reveiws on a few others of like design and buy one of those.

A tip for those installing Dynamat, look for one a little thinner than this also.  It worked great and I wouldn't demerit it over the width, but I found that it was slightly wider than many of the molded grooves in the car body.  A slightly narrower one would have worked better.",2.0
"The product worked well for awhile, but after using it to put Dynamat on just three door panels the metal part began to loosen and the roller would fall out of its mount if I pushed too hard. I had to hold the metal tight with my other hand while I rolled.",2.0
Still prefer the old version. New type in black  feel thin and after fixed up can still hear road noise. The older vesion almost totally cut off road noise.,2.0
"In theory I didn't believe it, yet had to try it. Not much of improvement. And you have to buy a lot to cover as much as possible.",2.0
I bought this specifcally for exhaust drone but exhaust drone is still there after i dynamated my entire floor and trunk,2.0
I really hear no difference in sound deadening claims. It may minimize rattles but doesnt seem to have quieted road noise.,2.0
I bought this under the impression that 1 box would do the trick. But infact I needed 3.5 boxes to line my whole car. (2door coupe) 142$ project turned into a $500 one. The product is good just so expensive for glorified tar and foil.,2.0
"I paid a local shop to install a double layer of dynamat in the front and rear doors of my 2007 Toyota Highlander.  $500 labor and $300 material.  It did ""thunk"" and blocked a lot of sound from passing cars but did not reduce road noise from my own tires... measured at 83 dB at driver ear at 35mph and 86 dB at driver ear at 65mph.  I read a lot of reviews stating that treating the floor, firewall and wheel wells would reduce noise substantially and bought another $600 worth of dynamat and mass loaded vinyl, and put off the job knowing it would be a hell bitch to do.  After more than a year of putting it off, decided to tackle it this week.  It was complete hell yanking out all the plastic trim.  You have to take it out in the right order, like a jig saw puzzle that only fits together in one order, and the pieces are not numbered.  There are 3 different types of trigger connectors under the driver seat alone.. and they work in inintelligible ways.  Every piece of sheet metal has razor edges and I was cut at least a dozen times just brushing against them.  It took about 3 grueling days.. pulling out the console.... you must release the gear shift to get the trim out, etc. Installing the mat was the easiest part, and only took about 4 hours.  Then I cut the heavy MLV and covered the firewall and under each front seat.. single piece.  And also under the rear seats.  Got it all back together expecting something fantastic... and was shocked and outraged that even before I turned on the Radio Shack dB meter, there was absolutely no change.  83 loud dB of tire noise at 35 mph and 86 dB at 65 mph.  I can only conclude as another reviewer did: that tire noise is 95% of the cabin noise, and that because of the way the vehicle is constructed... at least mine... the tire noise is transmitted through the frame and to the cabin... not so much through the flat panels on the floor.  The reason that there is ""almost no sound deadener"" on the floor panels, is that it doesn't help and car makers know that.  I am pretty close to outraged at the misprepresentation by this fraud industry, unless somehow my Highlander is different from most cars.  And the door treatment did boost the bass.. but door bass now overpowers midrange which does not aim directly at the listener, so most of it gets lost.  Horriffic waste of money for me.",2.0
"dynamat bulk pack consist of 9 sheets of its product,you need at least 4 ( if your car is a sedan ) or 8 sheets depending of how many doors you want to isolate----so whats left ? 1 sheet for the whole car????  LOOK closely to the pic in DX bulk pack ,it shows the 2 front doors, the roof and all the trunk full with dynamt, not even close as i stated you need at least 4 for the front door, at least 2.5 for the trunk door so your left basically with 2.5 sheets for the rest of your trunk!! that won't isolate even half of it and forget about the roof thats just for the pic--in order to comply with this pic you would need at least 18 sheets or double of what they offer.

i'll like to admit I MADE THE MISTAKE  of not looking carefully into what 9 sheets of dynamat can cover BUT as a customer you think you can trust a serius company in what its product shows it can cover.....to bad, as i said at the beginning VERY MISLEADING.",2.0
"I installed Dynamat, Dynaliner, and/or Dynapad throughout my '03 Honda Civic Si. I covered everything except portions of the roof that were obscured by the sunroof assembly, and I did not apply anything under the hood because engine noise has never been a problem. I have a lot of positive things to say about these products: they are fairly easy to apply to irregular surfaces, the adhesive is very good, they are all well constructed, and the company is helpful if you call them for support. It probably took me around 20 hours to completely gut my interior, install the materials, and reassemble everything. In all it cost over $700. The car is certainly quieter now, especially when it comes to road noise. However, there is still a lot of wind noise that evidently comes through the windows, and an annoying amount of road noise remains. As others have commented, the stereo sounds cleaner and has more bass, but this is not a big deal to me. I hoped to make the car more enjoyable to drive on my two hour highway commute, but it is still quite loud. Dynamat simply cost too much time and money for the small benefit. For me, the lesson is if you want a quiet car, buy a quiet car.",2.0
"Dynamat Xtreme was a product that I had high hopes for, given the information on the company's website and the testimonials from people like Chip Foose and Jay Leno. However, after installing it on my truck (I also installed the Dynapad) to dampen my loud aftermarket truck exhaust, I wasn't very impressed. In fact, I noticed an increase in exhaust noise so profound it made my vehicle unbearable on long trips. A representative of the company pointed out that after installing the product some noises may seem more pronounced due to a decrease in overall noise. This was hardly the answer I was hoping for after spending hundreds of dollars and many hours on installation. I cannot recommend this product because the  the results achieved seem slight when compared with the price. It may be a good investment for older cars, but I'd be wary.",2.0

Not worth the money for what you get. If you want to do deaden the sound in your car you'll need more than these two little squares of stuff.

This rendered data interpretation impossible. No local repair, no download fix, sorry! If it had this error, quite obvious on start up and should have been caught prior to leaving the factory, what else was wrong and lurking within?

I then wrapped the pump in a thick hand towel and it decreased the decimal level about 7 points to 7.2-7.3 decimal level. So basically I spent $26 for something that didn't work as well let alone better than a hand towel. Not happy with product at all.

If you have to spend any extra time cleaning a particular spot, the soap will be gone before you even move on.

"I had been using Armor-all Car Wash for a while, and then I waxed my car with Nu Finish Polish.  I liked the Nu Finish Polish enough to try the Nu Finish Car Wash with Orange Oil.

The Nu Finish Car Wash performed well, but with one Big Problem:  The Orange in it attracts Bees for the first 2-3 days after the wash as well as other flying insects that are less dangerous.

The first time that I used it, I thought it was just coincidence--maybe I was in bee areas?  After 3 days bees were not attracted to the car anymore.

So I waited a week more and washed it again with the Nu Finish Orange and same thing driving in different areas:  Bees like the formula!  I came out of Walmart a few hours after the wash and a bee was on the tailgate buzzing against like it was trying to pollinate a flower or eat my paint.  I had to rapidly close the moon-roof stopped at a traffic light when a bee started buzzing against the roof.  At other stops, more bees coming up to the car.  Like they had radar--they zeroed in on my car.  In addition after parking, other less threatening flying insects taking up residence on the body of my car.  After 2-3 days no more bee problem as the Orange odor wears off I guess?

So to make sure it was the Nu Finish Orange wash, I waited a week more and went back and washed with Armor-all again and drove around--no bees attracted, no insects.

I returned the Nu Finish to Walmart--way too dangerous to use with the bee attraction.  But it was a good wash.

Instructions also lacking information on how much water per oz of wash to use.  I used the same as I do with Armor-all--1 oz per 1 gallon water, and it seemed to be enough.  They should provide clearer instruction.",2.0

"Bad Customer Service Policies

The included manual includes a phone # to call, stating don't return these, call the phone # for replacement parts.  One of mine needed a 4x30mm shear pin (they call it a GB879-4x30 Spring Pin).  The pin was cracked in half length-wise new out of the box and fell out in 3 pieces.

CSR agent was fine but their policy is locate the part # and they'll ship it.  I located the part #, then they stated can't send the part because it's not in your manual.  Huh?  It's a part on the jack and clearly was defective.

They expect me to pay return shipping on 30 lb item to exchange it instead of just sending a 1/4 ounce shear pin in a USPS envelope which IS A PART THEY LIST.  It's even more ridiculous that I waited on the phone, got cut off waiting, spending over a half hour to find this out.

Besides the fact that I now can't use one of mine (!), it's a reasonable quality jack stand.  Stand plate metal is thick enough, reinforced legs 3/4"" up, double locking is nice, especially if I end up having to substitute some other shear pin (which may not be the same shear force) because they refuse to honor their warranty.

Center column is reasonably thick iron, thick paint job on it.  Saddle is beefy enough but no center notch for unibody car *frame* hack points, but it does dip down and you can get saddle covers to adapt it.

Hey Torin:  If you don't want to honor a warranty, don't offer it.  This would have been no big deal at a brick 'n mortar where I could just inspect them at time of purchase and pick a different set instead of this extra hassle for a defective 50 cent part.

I want to add that their customer service rep was not rude or incompetent, seemed to do her job fine but was bound by their strange policy to not replace the defective part.  She did state I can ship the whole thing back but meh, I bet that costs 2/3rds of what the whole set cost, over 10X as much as my having to hunt down these shear pins somewhere and buy a pack.

Would only buy these again if I could inspect them first, and only then if there wasn't something else of fair quality near the same price.",2.0

They are not cosmetically clean and I would venture to say these welds have prosody and are not structurally sound. If they were Ex-rayed they would not pass for sure. These stands are not good enough for me to trust. I have returned them for a refund and I have already ordered the OTC jack stands model # 1736 A  6 TON.  Bottom line you get what you pay fore.

"Didn't even get the 2nd stand out of the box - first one wobbling on my kitchen counter.  I'm not a welder, but even i could see how poorly the welds were laid down.  Even the paint was marginal with large splotches of dried paint on top of the primary coat.
I knew what i was getting in to at this price range and took a gamble.  The welds MAY be functionally strong enough, and the poor paint application purely cosmetic - but I really can't handle the fact the stand doesn't sit level - there must be literally ZERO quality control at these plants.
Still deciding if I want to try again to get a decent pair of these, or just upgrade to the 6-ton OTCs, which are a bit out of my intended budget.",2.0
"I already own the Torin 6 Ton Jack Stands with the Locking Pin, and the Torin 3 Ton SUV Jack Stands.  Both pairs are great and I use them very often.  I needed another set, and liked the way the locking pin works on the 6 Tons, so I thought I would give these a try.

So why the three star rating?  Well, the pair I received - the pins were not aligned properly making them both a pain to use and moreover unsafe to use.  When I would raise the jack to height, and attempted to slide the pin in, it would not slide without lifting the extension arm with the other hand and ""finagling"" the pin into position.  Think about that for a minute - typically, I slide the jack underneath the car (which is still being held up by the floor jack), and I then slide the arm up to height, and insert the pin.  Note that I try to get this done quickly as the car is still only floor jack supported.  With these, I would have to find the height, and then have to try and use two hands while lying down under the car to jimmy the pin into alignment with two hands.  I did this once and realized these were not made correctly.  Not sure how these got through QC - then again, seems like lots of things get through ""QC"" these days....

So why didn't I just exchange them as QC issues happen all the time?  Well, I tried two sets and both sets had pin alignment issues.  Enough for my blood - I just was not one of the lucky ones I guess.  Two for two with issues on both are just plain bad odds.... besides, I am trying not to support companies that allow such blatant QC issues ""slip through"" for public consumption.  As a result, I probably won't be buying anymore Torin Jack Stands - and take solace in the fact I have two good stands already.  Let's face it - two for two on defective products is more than chance.

Sadly, I was not happy with these - and I really wanted them to work out.",2.0
kinda sucked so I threw it away,2.0
"First, I admit that I bought this bracket for a potentially difficult task. I needed to mount a single DIN radio in a nearly 30-year-old Toyota truck. Considering that this was the only adapter I could find that might work, it was good buy.

But using it was no picnic. This adapter is made of plastic and is designed to accommodate a wide range of vehicle types. Once you find the right brackets for your vehicle, you have to cut off the tabs you don't need. Sounds simple enough. The instructions tell you which ones you need to keep, but they don't tell you exactly HOW to cut off the ones you don't need. They're tough little buggers. A ""dremel"" type tool might be useful.  I ended up using a small hack-saw in some cases, and nibbling them away with wire cutters for others. But be forewarned that you need to get rid of those tabs completely, right flush down to the base of the bracket. If you don't, you may not be able to fit the finished piece into the car.

Once the brackets are prepared, you screw them to another plastic rectangle that will hold the DIN enclosure. Again, simple in concept, but I had to file certain parts down on the bracket, and file and hammer on the car to finally get the thing to fit. And even then, the opening for the radio was slightly bowed, causing me to wonder if I'd ever get it to work. But after quite a bit of cursing, filing, pounding, cutting and jamming, I was finally able to get the metal DIN enclosure pressed into it, bolt the whole thing into the frame and still get the radio to fit in.

BTW, the instructions say that if you want to retain the plastic pocket below the radio, you need to buy some other part from Metra. You might not have to. I was able to use the previous pocket without any problems.

So, in short - it works, but it should have been a lot easier.",2.0

"After reading some reviews on the bad spot welding and the pins not fitting.... but also seeing a lot of 'great' reviews, decided to buy it and hope I got a good set, as I was looking for a double lock feature... as I needed to just raise the front end of my SUV...

Well.... after getting these, saw that the welding was about 50/50 on each jack stand, as in half good, half questionable. And, I have a 2-ton jack stand, and they seemed to be about the same gauge steel used on the frame.. hmmm..

On one stand, the safety pin, barely goes under the jaw of the stand(see picture), it was straight, but only about 1-2mm under the jaw.. the other stand, was a different story. The pin was offset. as soon as you put the pin in, you could see how crooked it was, so it engaged under the jaw halfway in.

I decided to give them a test under my trailblazer.. as soon as I lowered my vehicle onto it, I never heard stands make metal cracking noise... made me worry about even getting under the vehicle... I was changing out some front wheel bearing, so wasn't going under... I ended up putting my 2-ton stand next to these, my front tires I took off under the frame of the vehicle AND the hydraulic jack just pressed against the frame to make sure.. I had to get my axle bearing replaced and it was late, so no other stores were open...

Anyways, these are going back... and I ended picking up a pair of 3-ton craftsman jack stands, on sale(cheaper) the next day! They were more heavy duty looking and the welding was all around good on it.. they didn't creek when I lowered the SUV onto it... it didn't have the 'safety' pin on it like I was looking for, but, I've been using jack stands without it anyways, just thought this was a good feature...if it was done right...",2.0

These are NOT.",2.0
"I had to buy 4 jack stands to get a desent pair (returned the others). Its hard to get good quality jack stands, I have searched around for a while.

The major quality issue with these jack stands is their welding. Either the welding is discontinuous/not finished to the end, or the weld have holes in them. The other issue is that some of these stands are very wobbly, and it has to do with the 4 legs not being the same length. When I got a pair that I thought had acceptable welds, I ended having to grind the legs to make them more stable. Afterwards, I spray painted them with several coats to prevent the metal from rusting. I think I now have desent jack stands.

The last thing I want to say is that, don't decide to purchase these stands based off the double locking pin. As other posters have mentioned, you truly do get only minimal engagement between the pin and the teeth of the saddles. I don't think the pin would save you if for some reason the main locking mechanism of the jack stands failed.",2.0

I liked these due to their price and 6 ton rating.  My favorite feature was the locking safety pin, which seems to be a rarity these days.

After engaging this stand, setting the safety pin, and adding some weight  it gave way with a simple bump. I was very surprised as the safety pin was in and it still gave way.

The other issue I had was very similar to others -- really bad / incomplete welds, and very poor workmanship.

I don't believe this unit was damaged by shipping and I believe this to be an overall workmanship / quality issue.",2.0
"I read the reviews about the bad welds.  I concur, on 1 of the 2 stands the weld looks very bad not smooth at all and just looks like an unskilled weld.  The weld on the other jackstand is smoother and more reassuring that it can possibly hold 3 tons.

I grew up with a mechanic and I have to say these stands are definitely scary compared to other stands I have used.  Each one is so light and metal very thin on the base.  I'm doing an oil change tomorrow for the first time so I'll make sure I keep an eye on it.

"It is lucky that I do not need to wear these regularly, as they are obviously two different gloves. They are both of the same style, size, and color, but the left glove is made of textured leather and is nice, supple, and well fitted. The right glove is made of smooth leather, is much stiffer, is much thicker, and has awfully proportioned ring and pinkie fingers. The right glove also pinches the index finger badly when bent.

Looks like it will probably come apart soon. And the left glove is a little tighter than the right.

"You get what you pay for -  we used it on about a 8"" lifted old Chevy, lifting a 700r4, and it worked well.  Unfortunately, we had this model for less than a year - we did the first transmission and tried a second less than 6 months later, on a heavier sm465 in a different truck (no lift kit) and the hydraulic lift on the jack failed, dropped the transmission & screwed up the clutch too.  It's cheap, worked well on one job, with a relatively lighter transmission, but if you're looking at using this on a regular basis for work, I wouldn't recommend.

Buyer beware.",2.0
"I purchased a Torrin 1000 lb transmission jack to help with the a Toyota FJ40 transmission rebuild job, having no desire to try and rig my floor jack to do the job. The unit is ok, except where it comes to the part that is different from any other jack - the top that holds the trxmission.

First, the instructions don't match the actual unit. It says you should attach the two chains to the chain bolts - well, there is only 1 chain, and the ""chain bolts"" don't even fit through the chain. There are no photos other than the one small b&w photo on this instructions (that don't match). It is not possible to understand what they are telling you to do with the arms at the corners of the top plate without further instruction.

The little fish hook screw that should hold the chain is only about 1/8"" in diameter and since it is about 4"" long, very flimsy. Secondly, the chain catch on the other side of the top plate - doesn't. If you get even 1/4"" of slack in the chain, it drops out of the catch (which is just a slot cut in a bracket welded to the top). So, at 1am last night, in the rain that was about to turn to downpour, with the trxmission 1/2 way out, I said to heck with it, and went to the barn to retrieve a strap.

Up and down works pretty well. Tilt features work pretty well on the top plate. The handle to raise the unit comes out too easily, normally while you are trying to use it to pull the transmission across the floor, as that is the only thing that you can easily use to move the 200 lbs sitting on the jack. The knob to lower the unit opens the valve extremely quickly such that the load can drop much too fast. The unit is very tippy and must be carefully balanced when you have a transmission on it. Did I mention that securing the transmission on the jack is impossible with the supplied chain - oh, yea, I said that. It bears repeating.

In all, it gets the job done, but it is not a unit I'd recommend anyone purchase for more than a single transmission.",2.0
"Definitely not recommended.

Packaging: awful, arrived in only the manufacturers box, which is too flimsy for the weight of this thing.  It was practically falling out of the box, which was smashed to hell, when it arrived.

Adjustability: terrible, once loaded with weight more than ten pounds, the knobs are impossible to turn by hand to tip the table.  I had to use a channel locks to turn it.  After a few cranks, the plastic knobs broke.

Load capacity: it says it cans lift 1000 pounds, but it had trouble staying up with more than 100 at first.  Trying to get the hydraulic valve tight enough broke off another cheap plastic knob, but a vice grips on the remaining metal bit worked well, and it then held pressure.  Also, the chain is a joke, used a ratchet strap, which worked well.

As a side note, the jack got lost in shipping with two day prime shipping, but Amazon sent out another one quickly with one day shipping for free.

I give it two stars because it was pretty cheaply crafted, but it wasn't terribly expensive, and in the end i was able to replace the clutch in my ram 2500 diesel with it.  The transmission weighs around 400 pounds, and i would not have been able to do it without the jack.",2.0
"Update:  Toxic Mold / Fungus growth underneath the mats!  See attached photos.

I purchased 2 of this from Walmart including a matching $58 center seam strip which I later found out wasn't really  necessary as the mats were heavy enough to stay in place w/o the center joining strip.

Upon unboxing  this mat, it was REALLY heavy.  Not only that it was rolled-up in such a way that it was a PITA to roll out facing up.  The first box, I just unrolled it flat with the ribbed side facing down since it came rollup up the wrong way.  I then had to flip the entire mat right side up and it was a PITA.

The 2nd mat, I just tried to roll it with the ribbed side facing up, it took a lot of back and forth slowly rolling it a few inches out since the way it came rolled up, you could just roll it out.  Not sure why it came rolled up that way.

After it was all said it done, it did look amazing when it was clean.

However, when it gets dirty or wet, there is not way to easily sweep it due to the ridges.  You either had to just sweep it all the way to the front of the garage or grab a vacuum.

When it gets wet, same thing, you can try to use a rag but it's hard to get in between the ribs.

Today, I decided to grab a hose and hose out the entire mat and drying it up took forever due to water getting trapped in between the ribs.

I first grabbed a broom to swept as much water out as I could out the garage. I then grabbed my microfiber mop to get the rest of the water.

This thing is hard to clean.  Especially sweeping up a few dirt and sand.  Easier to just vacuum it up.

Also, there are a few areas where the cover has been gouged.  Not sure how that happened.",2.0
"This is not exactly as Id hoped it would be. It is too narrow (& I have a small car) there are no ""sides"" to keep the melting snow from spilling over to the garage floor, which defeats the purpose for my needs.

I spent about an hour wrestling with it and sort of have it on, but it doesn't really lay flat.

The quality of the material seems ok. There is a white felt liner inside and that makes it extremely difficult to position the cover on the spare. It also gets immediately trashed up from the grease and dirt on the tire (yes, if it was just the vinyl material it would be dirty but you wouldn't see it, it would wipe clean and it would be returnable ;-) Now that I have it (sort of) on, I'll leave it, but I don't see myself ever putting it back on if I have to change the tire, just not worth it.",2.0

"Still looks like new, it was easy to install, and it worked nicely for a while, but it's pretty pricey to have to change it at six months.  I didn't find any other similar switch to purchase, so I'll have to pry it open and see if cleaning the contacts will fix it, as another reviewer described.  I had it set to the lowest setting, so it probably turned on pretty often, but still, there are lots of cheap relays which run for years without the contacts getting dirty.",2.0
Ive been using this for the last year and have had problems with it twice. Ive had to take it apart and clean out the contacts so that it would conduct once again. For reference I have used electric fans for about 5 years and haven't had a problem with a thermostat until now.,2.0

"When it works, it works well. The problem with this unit is the rheostat (temp control). If you set it too low, it comes on and stays on most of the time. I would recommend that you wire this unit into a switched relay. I installed mine with a direct connection to the battery. The idea being that it would draw power directly from the battery to run the fan, and let the temp controller be the off switch. Like I said, when it works it works well. One day I shut down the truck and the fan was running, no problem. About an hour later I came back to the truck and the fan was still running. I made a slight adjustment to the rheostat and the fan shut off. The other day I made a short local drive. The outside temperature was around 95 deg. F. When I arrived home I notice my trucks coolant temp gauge was almost maxed out. The fan had failed to switch on. Again it was the rheostat, with a slight turn of the knob the fan came on. The electric fan works great. The weak link in my system is the temperature control unit. I'm hoping I can find a better temp control unit.",2.0

"Yes this insulated 'blanket' keeps heat from soaking in quite as fast.  But what nobody talks about is it still lets heat soak in and, once it soaks in it stays soaked in for much, MUCH longer than if you were to have a bare starter that was cooling in open air.  I went from a 15-minute cool-down until start was possible to over two hours.  Now it did keep the starter from overheating in in-town short jaunts, but once the hot weather arrived and I drove on a cross-town freeway well bam.  I was dead in the water.  I pulled this off and replaced with a proper factory heat shield.",2.0
"This is simply a remnant sheet of pipe insulation. So given what it is, this is EXTREMELY overpriced. I know it will work as it is the same stuff they wrap industrial steam pipes with.

"Do not try the cross stitch that requires two needles!  After an hour and 15 minutes I was only 1/3 of the way done.  At that point I was at the first ""spoke"".  I could not make it look right and gave up.  If your steering wheel has wide spokes I don't think the average adult male has a chance.  I used to use this product years (25?) ago and was generally satified with the results, but I sure could not make it work with a modern steering wheel.",2.0
"Because the pattern is the same width throughout, there is significant bunching of the leather around the spokes.  In addition, the diameter of the cover is a little too large for the Yaris' steering wheel, so there is a 4 inch or so area of bunching at the bottom of the wheel at my start/end point.  I used the cross stich pattern, which is more time intensive and took about 3.5 hours of steady hard work with a thimble to assist me.  The end result looks quite poor.  I have successfully used this product on an older car with a thin steering wheel that was uniform in thickness around the entire wheel.  I would not buy this again for a modern car.",2.0
"I attempted to use this product on a new-style Jetta.  I was unsuccessful.  I installed this item in three different ways, three different times, without satisfactory results.  The entire cover has the same circumference, including the edges, so there was a lot of bunching and gathering.  This may be due in part to the large spoke areas of the Jetta wheels. It may be due in part to the type of material used to manufacture this cover.  Other styles that I have used left me with a close-to-professional look.  This one was a horrendous mess.  Your mileage may vary.",2.0
"I recently purchased this item and spent 5 HOURS installing it onto my steering wheel. The package comes with instructions, giving three different stitching methods which can be used, along with the cover, the lacing and two needles. I opted for the ""cross-stitch"", which needs both needles to be completed.

I had gotten about 10 stitches made when one of the needles broke. I had to pull out my work up to that point and begin again with another stitching method. When I had gotten about 75% finished, one of the laces actually pulled completely through the leather cover. I had to improvise a cover-up stitch, which worked, but did nothing to enhance the look of the steering wheel cover. Then, to add insult to injury, the second needle broke with about 8 stitches remaining. Not wanting to remove the cover, I had to go to the store and purchase an additional sewing needle to finish the job.

All in all, the cover looks just ""okay"", in that it doesn't completely cover my steering wheel. There is a small gap between the inside edges of the leather cover.

Be warned, the needles included are NOT as strong as they need to be and there may be some weakness to the actual leather cover itself. And remember, it also took 5 hours to install! I don't think I would purchase this product again under any circumstances.",2.0
"Bought one. It ripped putting it one. Thought we were to rough. Ordered a second one, size B. Also ripped. You should have heard the words said when that happened!

I elected to trash it and order the much more expensive WheelSkin which is custom sized for my wheel. The edges are also double reinforced and the holes are easier to get the needle through.  Installation was way easier as I wasn't concerned with tearing out the holes.  For these covers to look good you must stretch the thread until the edges of the leather meet.  If you don't have to stretch the cover onto the wheel, you will have slack!",2.0

Definitely will NOT fit on most modern vehicle steering wheels.. Maybe older vehicles because they used to have much skinnier steering wheels.  In the era of air bags and steering wheel controls for cruise and radios etc no bueno.. It went about halfway around my steering wheel in a newer Honda civic which looks really cheesy.. I ended up taking it off and ordering the larger supposed thicker version. That covered 60% of the wheel lol.. Still looked terrible looks OK from looking straight on to it but if u look from passengers side or looking down on it the steering wheel looks ridiculous.. Half covered and just not nice looking at all. They have another one here in amazon I ordered after these two that covers it much better and it a FAR superior material.. It's like a smooth matte leather looks very high quality.. Only thing is that one comes with needle and a line with which to sew the seam into the wheel so it takes some time. With no sewing experience it took a good hour and a half to sew it together... But it looks amazing perfect coverage..expensive high end look and no plastic line wrapping around it over and over to keep it on.. You literally stretch the leather over and sew it together around the wheel.. It looks like a custom leather wrapped expensive steering wheel that belongs in a Cadillac or Mercedes.. Really high end compared to this cheesy product.. If u search around I'm sure u can find it..roughly same price as this just look for the one that comes with sewing needles,2.0
"As many others who have purchased this item have noted, the item as shown is not quite what is sent.  It is of a much lower quality than what is shown in the picture on the box and as described.  I ordered the size ""B"" for my 2017 Forester, and it is definitely two narrow to completely wrap around the steering wheel.  Size ""C"" would probably have been a better fit.  I used the baseball stitch with an aftermarket carpet thread instead of the supplied thread, but did use the needles included in the package.  As at least one other person noted, there is a different number of holes between the front and rear side, which certainly did not help in how it fit.  Also as others have noted, the cover had unacceptably large gaps in the three areas of the steering wheel with wide spokes. These were so bad that I ended up cutting each section out entirely and re-stitched accordingly.  Consequently, I would call what I currently have is a tri-kini cover.  At least the areas where I hold my hands are covered, and that what is most important to me.",2.0

I bought it july 2014 and august 2015 it quit. Still looks new if that means anything. Guess we buy something cheap we just take our chances. Its a 50 year old car and it sits more than goes but speedometer was broke and was using tack to gage speed. Not the end of the world....Robert,2.0
"I ordered this for my 2000 Chevy s10 because Chevy didn't think it necessary to put a tach in an extremely quiet 4 banger manual for some reason. It seems to be well made and I think it would work properly but not in my truck. Chevy changed the tach signal from 99 to 2000 model so it reads a few thousand short. My redline for the 2.2 should be around 5000 to 5500 rpms but the gage reads 3500 right before my rev limiter. It has a switch to select 4/6/8 cylinder a decent backlight but pretty much worthless because of the short reading. I have it hooked to the tach signal going to my gage cluster in my dash because I read that it will give you the best results in the 2000+ year s10s compared to hooking it up to the distributor.
  Unfortunately I found out other people had this same issue after I had already ordered it. You can buy an adapter for it but it costs more than the tach itself. If you have a Ford or a dodge you should be fine since they don't usually change things that don't need to be changed.",2.0

Installation was pretty easy, although you do need to exercise a little bit of care so as not to rip the material. But it's not that hard. Unfortunately the material was not wide enough to cover the entire grip circumference -- there was a 1/4"" gap, which would have been OK visually but it was uncomfortable on my hands when driving since the edges of the material were kind of sharp (not rounded or eased at all).

"This Superior Contour Sport Grip Slip on Wheel Cover has a foul odor but is surprisinly comfortable, when the weather is hot the wheel cover is not as hot as the outside temperature but I think it could be cooler to the touch if they added some foam to this product something to at least absorb the heat a little more it is awesome for gripping though, it seems well made with stitching that seems tough, also the instructions make it sound like it is easy to install, but this is not entirely true, I had to get my husband to muscle it on near the end as I simply could not stretch it on that last part of the wheel, plus it was too hot to handle after being in the heat to allow it to warm up before installing, and he was having a little trouble stretching it on  and he's a big guy who use to lift weights, I would of loved it even more had it been much more easy to install than it was. New Review of this product proved this product is poor quality, after less than a year this item has started to fall apart on edging, not worth price and sorry I purchased, usually this brand is exceptional quality but this particular item makes this brand look bad, but would recommend other products of this brand, just not this particular model and style, very bad and you can feel the heat through the wheel cover.",2.0

"It took about 4 hours to install this on a 2004 Kia Optima. I was disappointed to find that this product has some deficiencies and I was frustrated that I could not quite get the edges to meet all the way around my steering wheel.
1. The picture for this product clearly shows the text on the box stating ""EXTRA WIDE SUPERSKIN"", however after receiving it apparently the #58-0600B is the medium size cover, not the EXTRA WIDE SUPERSKIN. Only because the leather is overlapped along the edges, is a bit stretchable, and it is very strong, was I able to use waxed lacing (see my comment #2) to pull the lacing very tight to make the gap very small.
2. I began with the standard thread and it was not working well and did not look good. The lacing that is provide is not waxed, it does not look right for this application and it appears a bit cheap. While it seems very strong, it does not allow you to really maintain tension for a tight fit as you stretch and stitch the cover. Only because I had waxed lacing, from another (less expensive) wheel cover, was I able to maintain enough tension to keep this stretched tightly enough to keep the gap very small, however, I could not quite eliminate it all the way around. The manufacturer should provide the proper WAXED lacing for this application.
3. I appreciated that they did provide two needles with the kit and very good detailed instructions that included various stitching methods. I chose to cross stitch using two needles, however, the needles provided did not work well with either type of lacing. The eyes were too small and even after melting the end of the lacing and pulling the molten plastic thread to a small point, it was very difficult to get the lacing through the eyes. Again, I was saved by having similar needles with bigger eyes from prior installations of other wheel covers, including Wheelskins. The better needles saved a great deal of frustration and some time. The manufacturer should provide needles that are easier to use.
4. The leather is not soft or supple to the touch like a Wheelskins brand cover. It is a very pebble grained and a bit rough to the touch. In the manufacturer's defense they don't advertise Superskin as ""soft"" or ""supple"". I have gotten used to it and if I had to market it I would call it ""grippy"".

Overall, for the price, I am barely satisfied, but only because I had better needles and lacing.",2.0
"The listing really needs to list sizes A, B, or C because you get what you get in the mail and that's not good enough. People need to have the option to choose their steering wheel thickness. I had to pay for return shipping for my refund. I may call Amazon and get my money back for the shipping simply for the inconvenience.
The best way to order a leather steering wheel cover is go to eBay and search Wheel Skins. You have unlimited color choices and you're directed through a size selector for your make and model of vehicle. Wheel Skins cost about $50 but there's no hassle and its a superior product.
Lately, I'm not happy with Amazon's model for allowing sellers to throw non matching products up in the Amazon provided listings. Beware when you buy a MacBook pro.",2.0
"So I bought and tried this and was terribly disappointed. The leather looks really cheap. The install was cumbersome but not 4 hours like some claimed...but it does take a good 1.5h maybe 2 if you are slow. I also didn't find the needles to be low quality, or the holes to be too small. That part was fine, it's the quality of the leather and the thread that looks cheap. The stitching just looks incredibly cheap as well. If you have a nice car, and want to give it a even nicer look, this is not for you.",2.0
"This item was less than I expected.  Out of the package, the shaft came in two pieces and had to be screwed together before using.  This is probably the weakness that caused it to break the first time going through the carwash.  An previous propeller (different brand) lasted many years (and many trips through the carwash).  If you want a propeller, spend a little more to get a better one.",2.0
"Sewn seam was crooked and split when I started installing it.  Check it carefully to make sure the seam is centered before putting it on.

Edit:  The replacement is COMPLETELY different than the defective original.  Most visibly, the stitching is hidden.  It's not nearly as tight (though the box says the same size), and half-way through installation was gapping away from the wheel.  I wrestled it back somewhat, but then the skip stitching around the spokes gapped.  I'm going to cut it off, re-sew one of the seams (make it smaller) and try again.  It must be SUPER tight when starting to prevent the end-fold/gapping other people complained about.  Temporarily securing it several places around with tiny zip-ties helps too.  The thread isn't waxed cord, but common multi-fil polyester, like flat yarn.  If you snag it with a needle, it frays.",2.0
"I bought a Superskin cover because the vinyl on my  97 Camry steering wheel was splitting, and I wanted to hold the foam together.  Reading some of the reviews helped. I enlarged the holes before I started (essential), and I used needle-nosed pliers. The instructions were good, and the leather seems sturdy enough. I didn't break the needles. I figured out after starting that I had to keep moving the wheel around to get it in a manageable spot. But wow, is this hard to do! I chose the cross stitch, because I thought it would look better, and hold tighter.  It took me 8 hours to complete the job, and I made plenty of mistakes and ended up with sore hands, neck and shoulders. My hands were not strong enough to pull the two sides of the cover together (or maybe it's not possible). The stitches have to be pulled up one at a time, over and over. It's impossible to see the back of the wheel, and you have to guess how many holes to skip over the wheel spokes. So the finished product is tight, but has about a half-inch gap on the inside of the wheel. I wouldn't do this again, ever.",2.0
"Because a lot of folks make ethnic jokes about products made in China, I find it pretty funny when I see the same thing happen in a product that proudly markets itself as an American made item. It has a typo right on the box, and the product has a strong smell right when you open the box. I had to put it in my own bag, just to not smell it.

To sum it all up:
1. Clearly engineers/shop folks and not English majors
2. Smells like it was made in a factory filled with sweaty skunks
3. I found a competitor product for half the price, 25% wider, not smelly, and guess what? Made in China...sold at Home Depot.",2.0
"The leather was thin and worn out at one end.
The laces provided are very basic and look ugly.

I checked the reviews before ordering and noticed that it took another reviewer took 4 hours to install.  I AGREE!  It is not wide enough.  I did not realize that there was different widths.  The picture shows a smooth texture on the leather.  It is NOT! I am truly disappointed,2.0

"Make sure you measure your wheel's diameter before ordering. This wheel cover is made in 3 sizes and Amazon does not make that clear when ordering. It is shipped in the smallest ""A"" size and my wheel needed the next size larger ""B"" - minimum 1'5/8 diameter. So I sent it back asking for next size up and got nothing for feedback.",2.0
Could not find a stitch on cover anywhere except online. Supplied thread is garbage. The good thread cost more than the wheel cover at the craft store. I would have rather paid extra for adequate thread. Cover looks ok though.,2.0

"Having successfully used a similar product on a sports car int the 60's, I ordered a superskin in spite of reading several of the negative reviews it has received.  The big problem with Superskins is that the manufacturer produces them in different sizes, but Amazon either doesn't understand this or is just confused by it.  Although I thought I had ordered a large cover for my new pick-up, I received one that was too small to use.  Only order this product for vehicles with steering wheels 15"" or less in diameter and with a small grip diameter.  Also, the leather is not ""fine leather"" as advertised, but fair for the price.",2.0
"FINALLY GOT IT FINISHED.  This thing took forever...literally.  Supposed to have 2 needles. I only got one. Got about 1/4 of the way done when that one broke.  I threw it in the corner of the garage for a couple of weeks until I found another ""canvas needle"" at a store.  I think you should remember the word ""canvas"" and picture yourself sewing tough ""canvas"".

First, you are going to need leather garden gloves to push this needle through all of the tight holes in the leather.  Even now with gloves my fingers still hurt.  I'm no Rosie Greer but I've done my share of cross stitch and needle point.  This was difficult.

Second, I spent 4 hours on the first day and only got half way.  On the second day i decided to use every other hole to get it done.  Another 2 hours on second day.  6 hours total not counting the first botched attempt weeks ago.  Other reviews are correct in that it looks loose and bunched up around spokes.

This isn't like the other cover I had years ago which just had strapping wrapped outside the wheel. This involves a stitch into the hole on the backside and then another stitch thru the front hole for the single pass.  Then back to the rear again for another 2 stitch pass.  Finding the holes on the backside often became difficult even when I was rotating the material around the wheel to see better.

The only thing that got me thru was looking forward to this review.

p.s.  I'm not normally a complainer, this is the first negative review I have written on anything of the 100s of things i've bought online.",2.0

"Spacers like this have been around since I was a kid(50s) and I always wondered if they would work. I have an '83 F100 that was lowered by heating the springs. Over the years the springs have weakened causing the camber to be way off. I tried the spacers and even with the truck jacked up and the tension off the spring, the spacers would jump out when twisted to the final notch on the sagging portion, and just fall out from the sections that weren't sagging. After repeated attempts I managed to get a spacer on each side of one spring, but when I let the truck down the camber was just as bad as without the spacer. Although the spacers didn't work for me, I am not saying they won't work for you, and they're not that expensive, so try them if you think you can use them. I am going to try to re-contour the final ramp on the spacers a little bit and see if that will prevent them from jumping out. I bought four packages, and the most I will use are two, so I will sell the other two for half price plus freight. The items shipped very fast with good communication from the seller, so buy with confidence from this vendor.",2.0

Like my title says the tach is cheap. Went to hook it up to my 96 S10 and it needs an $35 adaptor but it doesnt tell you unless you look at a list they include with it.

i chose this tach mainly for it's size and the fine history of Sunpro. I needed a small tach because I planned on installing it on the steering column of my 1970 Mach 1 Mustang and I needed it small enough not to occlude the vison of the speedo and dash gauges. It installed nicely but the tach does not read out accurately and it hangs intermittantly at 4000 rpm sometimes and then falls back when the moter is shut off. I really don't know what the rpm of the engine is as it seem to read about 200-300 rpm lower than the actual rpm.,2.0

"This was too big to be snug on my 14-1/2"" sheering wheel.  Like the other reviewers stated, it smells badly.  I have used similar covers on my previous car (with a larger wheel), and been very happy with them; they each lasted about 5 years.  Though the other covers smelled badly for a week, the odor did fade rapidly thereafter.  My objective is to allow steering without such a tight grip and this style does a great job with this.  It is not painful or uncomfortable - but I don't ""death-grip"" it because I don't need to grip firmly to be able to steer with this style cover.  I have since switched to silicone covers which do not have the odor and still make for light-grip steering.",2.0

"DON'T BUY THIS UNIT; CHEAPLY CONSTRUCTED AND FAILED IN SHORT ORDER.  I ordered this item along with the matching dash gauge and installed both myself.  Installation seemed fairly straight forward however this unit not easily adaptable to shallow tanks.  Once installed it never read over 5/8ths full even when tank was freshly topped up.  That soon became wild swings in the gauge and would only read at all for the first few gallons of use.  Lately it stopped working all together.
Took sender out of tank and found the windings inside the pivot portion had severed and were probably keeping the float from even going into the range where it still worked.  In my estimation they used too fine a wire for the resistance windings and the rubbing action wore through it way too soon.  Would not buy this unit again!!",2.0

Mirrors wobble excessively as you drive down the street.  This makes it difficult to see.  I would not recommend this product.,2.0
"I use these for my desk in my cube but each one (ordered 2) has a wierd deformed spot toward one end of it, because of this distortion it was giving me a headache just out of my peripheral.  Due to this I had to take one of the mirrors down just to ease my headaches.  I still have one up but if I knew they all had this deformed spot I would've either looked elsewhere or done a few flat mirrors.

I guess it is what you get for wanting something cheap.",2.0
Fell off while driving. Had to buy another at O'Reillys auto for $1 more. Would not recommend.,2.0

"Mirror is inexpensive, it gives a good wide view.  Affixing it to something is difficult.  The adhesive tape it came with lasted 3 days before I found it lying on the ground",2.0
Remember it's plastic-chrome.  Mirror will distort easily if pressed.  Bracket is not solid stainless steel.  The threaded ends are pressed on.,2.0
"This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost.

They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available.

To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal.

Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.

Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window.

Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.

I'm sending them back.",2.0
Woulda been nice to know it doesnt come with adhesive,2.0

I drive a passenger car and the outside mirror is not very big.  The mirror takes up a lot of space and the image takes getting used to to know the distance of the other car.  I am at the point of removing the mirror since it has become a hinderance rather than an asset.,2.0
it is a mirror but not very good image. also do not like the smaller size. the good thing is it did fit fit my E450 window anchor and was easy to install.,2.0

"After installing the mirror twice, once with just the set screw and a second time with a shim between the mirror and the mount, I found that I could not eliminate the mirror from vibrating.  Additionally, the image was not sharp.  I subsequently replaced it with a Donnelly mirror, which uses a clamp rather than a set-screw, and the new mirror is sharp and does not vibrate.",2.0

I was hoping for something that would look less than an add on to my mirror.  It functionally does what I need it to do.,2.0
"The glue cannot stick for long, it just dropped off from the mirror when you are driving and gone for ever.",2.0
The product description needs to be updated to indicate only one mirror per order.  Also the mirror is not adjustable which makes is basically worthless if you are trying to cover a blind spot.  There are many other similar items on Amazon that are adjustable.  To bad because I liked the large 3x3 size,2.0
"I don't know much about refraction and reflection, but I do know that the size of these is too small to be of much good.  The one I put on the passenger side -- as per instructions on the package -- was totally worthless, and I took it off.  The one on the driver's side helps a little, and for that reason I give it 2 stars.",2.0
"It works, it may not be the ideal size but it should at least have a packaging image or a quantity somewhere. Usually these kind of things come in pairs and assuming so i only ordered one as it did not specify anywhere the quantity.

"Can't find an acceptable blind spot mirror for my Honda Pilot.  Put one of these (3-1/4 X 3-1/4 in.) on the driver's door...lower outside, where there's nothing to see anyway, and it was great until the cheap plastic on the mirror started coming off on the inside.  Lasted about 4-5 months.  It's the second of these (from local auto store) I've had in a year.  The circular ones just take up too much room (the bigger ones) on the rear view mirror, and the smaller ones are useless.  Still looking for a good solution.

"I've had these for months now, and to be honest, I don't see much improvement in my visibility. You can SORT of see your blind spots, but the problem is that everything looks so tiny and far away. We have another car with different little mirrors on it, and those are much clearer to see through (and adjustable! I wish I could find those again). I find myself barely ever using these little mirrors, because when I have that second to spare to look at the mirror, I need to see everything quickly and clearly, and I end up just using the normal surface area. I wouldn't bother with these again.",2.0
The convex quality of this mirror is not perfectly smooth. What you see in the reflection is wavy curb lines and street stripes. The mounting tape seems sturdy.,2.0
very big not useful as small mirror  it is may be best for a truck or a big vehicle. not fit for acar,2.0
It stuck just fine for about 3 months but as soon as I went through a car wash it fell off.  Too bad because it helped a lot.  But I expect to go through the car wash every once in a while so I won't be using this again.,2.0
"The catch is that the mirrored image you get through this add-on projects a different scale view to your mirror whilst of course taking away space on your mirror from your regular view. So if you have a relatively small external mirror (and not a huge big thing like some SUVs do - it might be OK on those), then this thing obstructs the regular close-by views you are supposed to be getting from your car's mirror and then gives you a differently scaled view of everything else which now appears miles away on this tiny add-on (when it really isn't). Yes it catches the blind spot but can be confusing for all other view angles. I would not give it a safety pick confidence vote...",2.0

"The mirror is exactly what the title says. A 12"" day/night mirror. What it fails to do is work as a good mirror. The connections on the mirror allow the vibrations from the car to vibrate the mirror causing nothing to be clear except at low speeds. The day/night does not shift the view properly. I have tried to stop the vibrations from affecting the view but haven't had luck yet. I would suggest spending the extra money and getting a better mirror.",2.0
The product is made ok but I found it both too small and distracting.  It takes up space in your main mirror and you are seeing two images.  I took it off and ordered the mirror which mounts on top (or botton which I prefer) of your side view mirror.  It is less distracting and doesn't use any of the viewing area on your existing side view mirror.,2.0
This mirror doesn't focus well,2.0
"Great little mirror, ""little"" being the operative word.  Advertised as 10"", on the box it comes in, says ""Approx. 10"".  In fact, even the full side-to-side measurement is not quite 9 1/2, and the reflective face is just barely 9.  If I thought I was buying a 9"" mirror I would have been psyched, but that extra 1/2 inch makes a pretty big difference when you're trying to see what's behind you in the car.",2.0

"I purchased two #11960 towing mirrors from Amazon (one on 9/10/16 & the other on 9/13/16) and am extremely disappointed with the product after using them on three separate trips. The clips fall off easily, the turn ratchet gets stuck in the closed position, the mirrors loosen when traveling or when shutting the doors, and there is excessive noise at normal highway speeds. Additionally, they are very difficult to install each time you need to attach them to the truck mirrors. It often took 15 minutes for each one as the clips continually pop off, causing you to start over.

Unfortunately the return window with Amazon closed last month so I requested a refund directly from CIPA due to poor product & design quality. They were unwilling to provide a refund but did offer a replacement of the product. Therefore, I wasted nearly $60 of our hard-earned money. The problem with these mirrors is that they are poorly designed from the start and the company is aware of the design flaws. My wife and I were completely frustrated once we took the third trip with these mirrors and knew we had to do something else. I noticed that another camper had a set of towing mirrors that appeared to be very well designed. They are the XLR Dual Head Ratchet Series Clip-On Tow Mirrors (30-0083) produced by Prime Products. They are easy to assemble, hold tightly to the truck mirror, do not loosen during travel, and do not generate noise when traveling. You can put them on or take them off in 15 seconds.",2.0
"Awkward to use, and must constantly be adjusted.  One fell off while driving...",2.0
"Doesn't work properly, no matter how much you tight the straps, it will move with the first bump or wind,
the included mirror is useless for towing, it is small, in order to have better view you may need the additional wide angle replacement mirror.

"It's only fair to admit that the product is well made and is exactly what the advertisement says it is, but it is too small to be of any real use. In fact, it actually OBSTRUCTS use of the original mirror far more than it helps. Driving around a busy highway in the dark of night, one needs to be able to make split-second decisions. If I relied on this w/o checking blind spots in other ways, I would have been in several accidents by now. The fault is really mine, I hadn't stopped to think that the images on a convex mirror would HAVE to be bigger than this one provides to be useful. Be sure that 2x2 inches is enough before you buy this. It wasn't for me; I had to take it off three days after buying it. I ended up grabbing the biggest old-fashioned round one that the local auto parts store carried, and that is doing a much better job. What the human eye REALLY needs is large convex mirror like trucks have.

"So this mirror was interesting to say the least. Install and shipping and everything went fine. After the installation was a different story. This particular mirror has some type of weird visual effect replicating vertigo when you look into it.

"The mirror is solid, and provides decent visibility for a towing mirror extension device, and it is solidly secured when installed properly--it doesn't slide around much or rattle in heavy winds. However, the pads/""feet"" that are supposed to be attached to the three posts are awful--they don't stick to anything and fall off easily. Additionally, the straps that secure the whole thing to the mirror make an annoying sound in the wind that I haven't found with some other towing mirrors. May have just been the wind direction, to be fair. But even that aside, I couldn't get past the uselessness of the padded feet and the frustrating adapters that make it time relatively time consuming to install.

"These tow mirrors have a web clamp that hooks on your existing mirror. When they are tightened, the clips tend to snap off and you start over again. In use at highway speeds, they have two problems: 1. They slip down out of position. Dangerous to re adjust while driving, Fail!  2. The web straps make a high pitched sound that is louder than your high end sound system. Fail! I cannot recommend these especially there are other style CIPA tow mirrors that work great. Check out the cipa mirrors that slide on. They are too fine.",2.0
"Bought this for my old Jeep Cherokee because it was a toss up between this mirror and a factory overhead console.  I figured that this mirror would be a nice upgrade - my main purpose behind installing it was to get the outside temp display but the compass, map lights, and electrochromic mirror were also nice touches (and you wouldn't get the EC mirror with the factory overhead console, even if you can find one in a junkyard for a reasonable price.)

So I go to install it and discover that the mirror has the capability of having the map lights wired to the dome light so that they work as auxiliary dome lights.  Additionally there is an optional ""reverse inhibit"" function for the auto-dim.  BUT neither the wires nor the instructions for either are included in with the mirror, and CIPA/MagnaDonnelley wants you to buy another wiring kit for an extortionate price.  Out of the box the map lights only function as map lights, and only when the ignition key is on.  If you just add two more wires then the map lights always function (but the auto-dim, outside temp. display and compass only work with the key on, as it should be) and one more wire connected to the reverse light circuit will enable the ""reverse inhibit"" feature.  In CIPA/MagnaDonnelley's defense they will send you the instructions if you ask for them however.

Here is an OCR of the first page of the instructions, shamelessly stolen from another forum where someone's already been through this...

PROCEDURE TO WIRE MIRROR TO FUNCTION AS COURTESY LAMPS
Applications: CIPA part numbers 36300, 36301, 36400, 36401, 36500, 36501
It is possible to connect mirror to your vehicle in a way that the map lamps will come on with the door courtesy lamps.

DOOR SWITCH CONNECTION
1. You will have to find the circuit that controls the door lamp function.
2. This circuit must go to ground when the door opens which is common on many cars but not all. My understanding is that the Corvette is positive 12 V when door is open. If courtesy lamp circuit is +12 Volts then a relay needs to be wired into the mirror harness.
3. A second power harness needs to be purchased (CIPA Part Number 36100WIRE).
4. The fused wire is stripped from the non fused ground wire. The ground lead is thrown away.
5. The fused lead is then tapped into the courtesy lamp control circuit using a wire T-Tap (Scotch Loc).
6. The wire is routed up around the instrument panel, up the `A' pillar to the mirror.
7. The door control wire is connected to pin position 6 on the connector that plugs into the mirror.

The power harness, T-Tap and wire ties should be purchased through your local retailer or
CIPAUSA.com.
CIPA Part Number 36100WIRE contains:
1 Power Harness (Power and ground wires)
1 T-Tap
5 wire ties

We do not offer a ready made relay to make the mirror work with positive door switch systems.
Refer to form ""How to add a relay to + 12 V courtesy circuit for mirror light courtesy function""
Pin Function
1 Ignition controlled 12 volts
2 Ground
3 Reverse Inhibit (optional use).
4 Temperature wire 1 (PN 36500 and 36501 only)
5 Temperature wire 2 (PN 36500 and 36501 only)
6 Ground when door is open. Door switch for courtesy light function. (Optional)
7 Ignition controlled 12 V or to battery if courtesy light function is desired.

POWER CONNECTION
Pin 7 needs to go to a constant 12 volt source to have the map lamps function in the courtesy mode when the ignition is turned off. The power harness that comes with your mirror kit has a jumper wire between pin 1 and pin 7 to reduce the number of standard hook ups required.
To wire pin 7 to constant 12 volts;
1. Obtain fused power wire PN 36100WIRE from CIPA.
2. Remove terminal from pin location 7 in the connector.
3. Tape over or cut off short jumper wire that goes from pin 1 to pin 7. Leave pin 1 connected to ignition controlled power source.
4. Locate a 12 volt constant power source. Best if power source is on the battery save circuit so if lights are left on they will shut off after 15 minutes when the car is not turned on.
5. The fused wire is stripped from the non fused ground wire. The ground lead is thrown away.
6. The fused lead is then tapped into the power circuit using a wire T-Tap (Scotch Loc).
7. Run the power wire from the source to the mirror following the other installed mirror wiring.
8. Insert the terminal into position 7 of the black connector.
9. Plug connector into mirror.
10. Test courtesy function of mirror.

MY NOTE: the post that I copied this from referenced an eBay source for the harnesses, but they are apparently no longer currently selling them. Searching for the Cipa ""36100Wire"" part gave me sticker shock. I should have to pay $50-60 to hook up a $160 (through Amazon, apparently $300+ list) mirror? I DO NOT THINK SO.

OK, so I get on the interwebs trying to find what the connector on the back is.

[...]

appears to have the correct connectors

I ordered from digi-key a female connector body JST VHR-7N (just because it was cheap and I wanted to verify for future reference that it worked) and the individual female sockets are either SVH-41T-P1.1 or SVH-21T-P1.1 (difference is range of wire gauges accepted)  NOTE: YOU WILL NEED A WEATHERPACK/W-TYPE/EURO STYLE CRIMP TOOL TO PROPERLY INSTALL THESE CONNECTORS (but it's still cheaper than buying the harness that they want you to buy)

I received the parts, verified that they actually work, and now I have it wired up...

Guess what?  I haven't had this mirror in my Jeep for a year yet and already it's continually rebooting as I drive down the road.  I initially thought that it was the connection to power - I had used Scotch-Locks to tap into the adapter harness for my car stereo - but when I replaced the head unit with a newer one I took the opportunity to use soldered splices and heat shrink since I had to rework the adapter harness.  It's still doing it and it's only getting worse.

I really like the mirror when it's working correctly.  It's aggravating that I spent so much time and energy getting it installed and instead of giving me useful information it annoyingly flashes at me as I'm driving down the road.  I'm going to contact Amazon CS and see if they'll trade it out for me as I really do like the mirror... when it's not rebooting constantly.",2.0
"The mirrors worked well for half my first trip.....after that they started to sag.  The mirrors are about half the size of my tacoma's mirrors, so, they work but have a limited field of view.

"I bought this mirror because it stated in the description, that it would replace the original rearview mirror and attach  onto the existing mount. Seemed so easy to simply remove the existing mirror and install this new one onto the same mount. It does NOT fit the OE mirror mount. Now I must remove a perfectly secure mount, buy some glue and attach the new mount, to use it. Not NEARLY as convenient as I was lead to believe.",2.0
I just purchased and installed this mirror based on the many positive reviews I found in this post.  What dissapoints me most is  that the mirror remians in CAL mode even after following the calibration instructions.  It is completely innacurate with directions because of this.  The instructions say drive in a few circles and the CAL mode will dissapear.  This is definitly not the case.  I am going tot try to contact the manufacture to replace the unit.  Not sure how they will stand by thier product.,2.0
"Works OK, but has wavy lines in mirror like it's 100 year old glass. Not very satisfied with it.",2.0
"The day/night lever does not impart enough movement to adequately tilt the mirror head to completely toggle between the two modes. You have to physically tilt the entire head on it's swivel mount an additional amount to achieve complete change of mode.

"I've install these on both a 09 Tacoma and a 04 F-150. Didn't have too much trouble adjusting them on the Tacoma. I did have a little trouble mounting them at the correct angle so that they were actually useful. After that they worked ok. Put them on the Ford and it mounted a little easier. But on my last trip I was having troubles adjusting it to the right angle. While trying to adjust it, it was like there was a dead spot in it. The view too high. Try to lower it a bit then it would go too low. It acted like it was sticking and then it would almost ""click"" to the next spot which was way too low. After trying time and time again to adjust it the mirror finally just fell out and cracked into pieces. It snapped back into place but it's now a mirrored spiderweb. So that was the icing on the cake. Going to go find something better. These looks nice but lesson learned. Don't buy on looks, buy on quality!",2.0
"I have had this for about 4 months, and it worked very well at first. However, now that it's gotten hot and humid, the mirror backing has started to warp and crack, making large black spots across the mirror. It's spreading, so I now have to look for a replacement. It was worth the price for 4 months of use, but I wouldn't count on it for a long term solution!",2.0

Not bad for the price. I used these mirrors for a few months & they did serve thier purpose. My biggest complaint would be the vibration while driving making the viewing area hard to see. A bit scary while changing lanes on the interstate pulling a 30' travel trailer. I ended up purchasing the slide on CIPA mirrors that were made specifically for my vehicle wich are much better.,2.0
"When I first received this it was a great mirror.  The main mounting piece was metal and therefore not easy to break like many non factory rear view mirrors.  It was nice and tight and worked well.

6 month later and the quality has shown.  It became so lose that the mirror would flop around.  The arm that mounts to the back of the mirror is what became lose.  I was bale to get the actual glass mirror out of the plastic housing and found a lose nut on the connecting arm bolt.  That is the part that comes lose.  It looks like it was not installed with locktight, only hand tightened.  Therefore there is a risk of it coming lose at some point.  I cranked that nut down and it works fine.  I had to really work on getting that glass out.  I took a heat gun to the housing in order to soften it so I could pry the glass out.  In doing so it has ruined the look of the plastic housing and its shape is a little deformed.

Until this manufacturer installs the parts with Locktight, I would stay away from it.",2.0
"Mirror was just little scratchy. was not really new. felt like used mirror has be re-packed and shipped.
ok mirror,",2.0
Was looking to put these on my Ford F150...and they are just too small.  I should have read the size closer before ordering.,2.0
I bought this one for the cheap price and I have had it for maybe a months with many problems. It is very shaky while driving and hard to keep in one spot. It seems that no matter where I reflect the mirror within pulling out of my parking spot I have to re adjust it. I have also had the problem that no matter how tight I screw the base in it falls on me. If I could go back I would never have chosen this product but put the money towards a better quality mirror.,2.0
"As others experienced, the mirrored surface was slightly scuffed inside of the package. Simply the movement of the mirror against the plastic packaging scratched it. It's like chromed plastic instead of glass, so that's why its easily marred.  I highly doubt it could withstand the rigors of the environment if stuck on a car door mirror.  More suited for inside applications, like using it as a computer monitor mirror.",2.0
"Even though it's a packed one, seems to be old. It's more like a plastic toy. Better go for high quality products.",2.0
"I'll use it because it was cheap, but yes, VERY cheap quality construction.  Flipper function is very sub-par.  Wiggles and vibrates a lot under normal driving conditions, and adjusting arm needs to be more stiff.

Next time spring for a more expensive replacement.",2.0
"As other reviewers have mentioned, this rearview mirror is not the best at what it does. While you can securely mount it to the windshield (using the included screw), this does nothing to mitigate the mirror vibration as you drive. I'm not exactly sure why since the pivot point attaching the mirror to the arm seems stiff and requires force to move it, but perhaps the arm itself is not dense/heavy enough such that the bumpiness of the road during normal driving just gets magnified.",2.0
This is more less a big blind spot mirror and not what I wanted. I wanted a regular mirror for my desk at work.  This is not it.,2.0
"I received my bottle & it was supposed to come with a sprayer. It didn't. I haven't had a chance to use it yet because I have to go get a spray bottle to pour it into now, but I've used this formula in the last & it works great!",2.0
"Just got home and opened the package.  As others have written, the package it comes in sucks.  It came scratched/scuffed up in the middle.  I'm not too happy about it. It defeats the whole purpose of having a mirror.  The item is not worth enough to go through the trouble of returning.",2.0
you'll have to replace the sticky tape on these before they'll actually stick to your mirrors. I bought two and neither would come close to sticking to my clean mirrors. Dunno why. Had to replace the tape with 3M product and then they stuck fine.,2.0
Tabs would not hold and snapped off when I tried to spread them out. The defrost button has never worked. Poor fit required trimming of the dash.,2.0
Everything is fine about this product except that the latching mechanism is not the same as the stock version. This means you have to make your own modifications so that it will fit properly. This means cutting parts out of the dash.,2.0
threaded inserts in mount  just spin.....mirror won't stay in position.,2.0
"An aerosol delivery method for this product is great in concept. It was working great until I started to put the finishing sprays on my filter, but the it wouldn't spray any more, even though the can still feels like it is more than 75% full.  I tried cleaning the nozzle, but it still wouldn't spray.",2.0
"Nice design and would have worked perfectly, except that one tab was broken on arrival.

The device is somewhat generic and the instructions clearly show various tabs to cut off and which to keep for your car model. I had about 8 to cut off, but of the two that I needed to remain, one was already broken off during shipment.

I didn't want to go through the exchange process (since the car was all apart at this point), so I fashioned a bracket to replace the broken tab. It now looks great and works fine, but was a pain to do.",2.0
"the product is good i have used it many times, however the package arrived damaged and did not have time to resend it. the package was leaking and the problem was its top seal was very bad quality,",2.0
Only plus is the small pocket for your phone if it fits...downside is you have to cut a ton of tabs...including the x x in the middle of the din. Why? if you make a mistake and cut the wrong tab you outta luck...so make sure you don't do that.,2.0
the keychain is absolutely massive. way to big to be used on most keychains.  Really awkward size.  but would be great if it was smaller,2.0

Broke off at the arm attachment point on the second use.,2.0
"I purchased a set of these blades 15 SEP 2016. The silicone blades started separating in OCT 2017.
While they worked, they were great! When they started failing, they did not.
I have since replaced the blades, but still have them in case I can actually get someone to honor the warranty on them.
I assume I need to contact the seller? Silblade's web site says its up to the seller for replacements.",2.0

"Despite amazon garage confirming this Would work with my 05 Tucson, the size of the peg is too slim and falls out of the housing of wiper arm on car.  I ended up just taking the rubber blade out and transplanting it into existing wiper.  Disappointed a workaround was necessary; I could've paid less to do the same thing with something off the shelf from the local auto store.",2.0
"This thing is huge.  What I got in the mail measures more than 3 inches long.  That's just the Chevy emblem, not including the chain.  That's way bigger and heavier than I want on my key chain.  The description reads 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.7 inches, which is just nowhere near the truth.

I do wonder if it varies depending on which vendor you order through on Amazon Marketplace.",2.0
"The search for dash kit for a 1995 Camry showed this item being correct for this car, although the actual specs said it was for 90-93 Camry's. The itme is glued together instead of molded. It also does not allow the factory trim piece to be reinserted.",2.0
"Unfortunately, they chatter on my 2012 Land Rover Defender, something that the Bosch Aero blades didn't do.
Effectively they only remove water on the downward stroke.
In my application, the Bosch Aero is a better, lower profile blade option.
Disappointing.",2.0
"Nice design, cheap made!",2.0
didn't come with adapter to fit my car. 24 inch blade did...go figure,2.0
"I bought these because I was told silicone wipers were usually a lot better than traditional rubber blades. I bought these as my first set. I will not be buying them again, I put them on right before some rain come, I was excited to see how they worked and then was disappointed they were hardly any better than the ones I had replaced. They left large streaks across the windshield and didn't clear the water off very well. After a few uses they got better and work fairly well in decent amounts of rain but anything else they suck. I wouldn't recommend these to a friend or family. I'll just buy $7 blades from now on.",2.0
I had high hopes for these wipers but they wouldn't fit on my Tundra. I double checked the mfgs. website for compatibility and ordered through Amazon. They showed up just in time for a snowstorm and I was in desperate need of wipers. Unfortunately the clips were too thick to mount inside the hoop. The stock mounts are the ones that should have worked as the alternative bracket was WAY too big. I was able to cut down the plastic mount but then they wouldn't stay on the wiper arm.,2.0
"What is so hard about coming up with a blade that doesn't skip, or have a streak right in my center vision. Awesome. They all suck. OEM I'd say is your best bet. Cause all aftermarket brands are sub par at best. Those rainx blades are just as expensive as OEM blades",2.0
looks kind of ugly on a car,2.0
"It is not a full installation kit. Keep on looking if you want to install your radio. What people would need to install a stereo install a video, are factory metal brackets, full installation kit, Amazon uses I believe Metra kits... The price should be around fifteen to twenty dollars, the full kit. The last thing this is needed is the product that is in need to be installed. My stereo system was taken back and forth to the technician about three time. Because I didn't have the right equipment. Please make everyone has all that was mention above.",2.0
Went out on a limb and bought these vs. the rain x latitudes I always get. I assumed they would last longer because of the good reviews and silicone.  Well now I know silicone is only good for me toe things and one of them ain't wiper blades.  These became streaky after less than a month of use.,2.0
Pretty good for 2 years,2.0
"Hard to mount, took a while to fit it, ok product",2.0
I'm giving it two stars because of the fact that they call that slot below the head unit opening a compartment. Other than that i find its nice to use factory mounting whenever i can. Two stars for the useless slot i cant even put my pinky in.,2.0
"I paid a little extra to get this one with the slot.  The slot is too small to fit the phone into and is so deep, if you put the stereo remote in there, you can't reach to get it back out.  I would not suggest getting this one if you think you can use the slot.  It is just a place to attract dust and dirt now.",2.0
Had plastic x's on the openening that were too complicated to cut and had to file down the remaining studs on the sides. It was slightly big as well when inserting into the car.,2.0
Nice quality but ended up not using on my key ring because it's noisy when driving,2.0
"I had the kit for about a year and cleaned the filter about 2-4 times a year depending on when I change my oil.  The pump will eventually go bad, it would be best to have a seperate spray bottle and transfer the fluid into that one.",2.0
While the actual housing is nice to look at- the light output is lacking. They include 55 watt bulbs which are the same wattage as headlight bulbs so obviously the lamp housing is at fault. I don't even turn them on anymore since they're practically useless.,2.0
"This item shipped and was delivered fast. However, two minutes out of the package (before I even got it on my keychain) the inner gold part fell off. It looks like it was held on with a little dot a glue.",2.0
"It fits, but it's not as deep as it should be. It also tapers off.",2.0
it fell off,2.0
"I found the guards hard to install because they are very stiff, curled into a circle and difficult to straighten out.  Leaving them in the sun helps, as did using a hair dryer to soften them.  It remained very hard to curve around fenders etc.  I decided in the end that I had to use epoxy glue to successfully attach them.  Once installed, the thickness is a good, absorbing slight bumps.",2.0
"Bought this one and the 17"".
This one simply smears the water on the windscreen from the very first day I used it and the 17"" one is still squeaking with each stroke.
Guess I'll be returning to the OEM after all.",2.0
"I've actually had multiple problems with theses blades, I have been using one side by side with the lowest quality $3 blade I could buy from walmart, and the $3 blade is doing a better job. The silblade doesn't appear to make very good contact with the windshield and streaks some of the water, I think this would only be a good product if you have a more flat windshield than I do. (1999 Mazda Miata) It also seems to jiggle loose every few weeks, and I do not experience this with the cheaper blades. And yes I do know I installed them properly.

All in all I do not think these blades live up to the premium price and you are better off just buying a $3 wiper every year, but perhaps if you have a a different windshield it may live up to it's claims, but if you drive a Miata, it will not.",2.0
"With a little adjustment, I was able to get it quasi-fit the space left in my 1997 Camry dash after replacing the factory radio.",2.0
"When they work, these blades are great. They clear the window better than most other blades I've seen.

"Dash kit works and fit with little modifications, only problem was where radio slides in were two plastic Xs that were never factory cut, I just broke them out because I didn't feel like returning and re ordering, although this causes the head unit to not be flush with the kit.

"2 months in and they streak and chatter, no matter how I have tensioned the blades they always chatter, they don't wipe very well anymore and felt like they were a cheaper than normal ones,
They were at first great and wiped cleanly and i take care of my wipers too, I always clean the dirt off and make sure they don't wipe dry and now within 2 months they are a meh, they also tend to streak at the edges

"I got it to work, but I wasn't impressed with this product.  I used this installation kit in my '97 Dodge Grand Caravan.  During the installation process I quickly realized that there is absolutely nothing provided to mount the DIN cage to.  The kit itself screws into the dash just fine, but there was nothing to secure the DIN cage to which means the receiver would be sliding around inside the dash.  I ended up screwing the DIN cage into the bottom storage compartment of the installation kit, and then I used wire to tie the sides of the cage to the sides of the kit for added support.  In the end, I got it to work, but it took some extra modification and fabrication.  I've used Metra installation kits in the past that came with mounting brackets.  This didn't come with anything.  If you buy this, be prepared to do some extra work to safely secure your receiver.  Otherwise, you might have a lovely imprint of your receiver's face plate stamped on your forehead if you get in an accident.",2.0

"I have to say, after having these blades recommended to me I REALLY was expecting more but honestly they appear to be no better than any other higher end blade. Mine squeak and they are less then two weeks installed and I've cleaned the windshield too.... Not impressed.",2.0
They don't fit all vehicles.  Check your application carefully,2.0
"Theoretically, it's a great idea.  Silicone blades that will last a lifetime of your car.  The problem is they used standard mounting, i.e. the thin metal strips imbedded into the side of the blades.  After several years of use, your windows are still clean, but the blade falls apart and your window ends up scratched.

I had one blade on my car and one on my wife's car fall apart and both ended up scratched with a big arch on the window.  The problem is the blade will last a long time, but the hardware won't.  So those cheap window wipers you have on you car that fail after 6 month and streak - you replace them before the holder fails.  These keep cleaning you windows while you don't notice until too late that you window is scratched.",2.0
"The blades left streaks and didn't fit my Acura TSX well. One of them was just a tiny bit long and would touch the rubber gasket of the windshield.

"For some reason, after the winter in Colorado, these have started rusting and don't look very sharp any more. Also, the one on the drivers side whistles when driving, which can be annoying with the window down. I'm not real upset since my truck is ugly to begin with but if I ever get bodywork done these will be replaced or refinished. It's rough because I know there aren't a lot of other mirrors of this style on the market, and I'm not too keen on drilling another hole in the door to mount these.

I had to do some slight modification to mine to fit, as I wanted it to fit closer to the truck so I cut one of the arms down slightly. The geometry of the mounting worked out and they looked good.",2.0
"The picture of this item is deceiving.  When I received it, I was quite surprised to find that the octagonal area where the radio is inserted is blocked by two huge X X.  These XX are not shown in the Amazon picture, nor are they shown on the Metra website.  One would think then that what you see is what you get.  Not so.  There is no mention of these XX in the installation instructions.  I e-mailed Metra and they responded that these XX needed to be sawed off.  I cannot see why these XX were not trimmed off at the point of manufacture. There is then quite a bit of sawing to be done.  For an elderly person like me, with arthritis, that will not be so easy.  I would not have bought this item had it been honestly pictured.",2.0

"I bought yellow SilBlade wipers for my CR-V in early 2008, and was looking for replacements nearly 5 years later in late 2012.  Having such longevity, I went with these ""premium"" wipers from the same company.  At first, they worked great.  However, less than a year later they have lost their flexibility and they jitter and jump annoyingly across my windshield every time I use them - unless it rains exceptionally hard. Extremely disappointing, and I now find myself back in the market for something other than the same old six-month disposable options.",2.0
The item didn't work because of the year of my vehicle (2005 Frontier). the ad seemed to imply it would work or at least that's how I interpeted it.  Fortunately someone had a earlier model Frontier that bought it from me so I didn't have to return it (just luck  I guess).  What the manufactuer needs to do is state that 2005 Frontiers and later are not candidagtes for after market cruise controls.,2.0
"I have been trying different brands of wiper blades - saw these on Amazon and decided to give them a try.

From initial use until I replaced them after 7 months I had a problem with severe shuddering/chattering in light rain.  I use Rain-x, so that probably is the cause.  The blades are relatively soft and looked like they would work well if the windshield had a uniform film of water (i.e. no Rain-x windshield water-repellant treatment).

For the record, the wipers that I ended up liking best on my (Rain-x-ed) cars are Bosch Excel+",2.0
"Decide to try one last time ordering thru Amazon for this instead of from Silblade directly.  A mistake.  Seriously.  I need to just give up hoping.  The Silblade wiper are great but each time I order thru Amazon they don't include the proper adapters in the package.  It seems they fall out or something in the way they package them.  Each of the times I've ordered it seems the sets had all been opened and perhaps the adapters had dropped out in shipment prep - so didn't feel like was manufacturer issue since haven't run into it when ordering directly from Silblade.
So... I wound up having to jury-rig the blade in using an adapter that was close (but not the one needed) and am praying it holds since I don't have time in my life to go back and forth with Amazon on this again.

But - the blades themselves work well, no streaks, and make my wife happy as she goes thru the storms - so the WIPER itself as a product is one I would recommend.  Just not thru Amazon.",2.0
"I bought this for my 2005 Jeep. After talking with the Audiovox help line, I found out that it is not designed to work with ""coil pack"" distributorless ignition systems like mine. I wish this info was in the literature so I could have found out before purchase. In fact, the person I talked to said it's only for 1995 and older vehicles. I'm shure it can be adapted for some newer vehicles, but if you have a ""coil pack"" instead of a distributor, don't bother. You'll spend more time trying to find out how to get it to work than it's worth.",2.0

"Bought the 26"" wiper based on previous reviews that it worked with the Odyssey van. Unfortunately, did not work for us. Yes, it wipes well, but only when it's pouring buckets. Cannot use the intermittent wipe function for showers or light rain as it screeches so bad, akin to nails-on-a-chalkboard sound. The upside was the noise was so irritatingly bad, it jerked my husband to attention when he started zoning out so it saved us from a potential accident, I suppose.

Also, the package I got was missing the correct clip to attach to my wiper arm so had to use the one from the old blade.

Sent it back to Amazon who promptly refunded.",2.0

"I bought this product for my 03 Honda Accord. One of the reasons I picked this brand was because of the warranty, 5 years. Well after a couple months the blade wasn't clearing the windshield completely, it would leave a huge streak of water so it was hard to see when it rained. I first tried emailing this company several times but never received a response. So after leaving a message on their customer service number I finally received a call back today from Amanda...I was told it was going to cost me $10.95 for them to ship me out a new blade and then I would have to ship them my old blade. What? Why should I have to pay anything extra for a defective item? Stand behind your product or don't offer a ""5 year warranty"" Plus Amanda was pretty unsympathetic, nothing worse then a company who doesn't care about their customers! I guess I will have to buy a new blade from another manufacturer.

Update: 1/6/12...Received an email from someone at Silblade wanting to know if my problem was resolved? I then responded with the problems I occurred. I was told to email a copy of my receipt from Amazon and she would send me out a new blade at no cost to me. Wow, I was surprised because the first person I spoke with was very unhelpful. I did what she said and I will cross my fingers and hope it shows up.

Update: 1/12/12...Received my wipers from UPS today, thank you Silblade for keeping your promise. I will update my rating from 1 star to 2. I will come back and update in a year and if the blades are still working I will then update my rating to a higher number.",2.0

The blades for the Odyssey work just fine, wipe well, no problem.  On the CRV, they were awful.  I'm not sure if I got a bad set or what, but they don't completely wipe the windshield, leaving a wide strip unwiped.  Plus, they make an awful screeching sound scraping against the glass.

It is most noticeable and annoying at the slower intermittent setting.",2.0
"Amazon ran a buy-one-get-one-free deal on these a few months back and I picked up a pair knowing I would need new wiper blades soon.  They sounded great and the reviews were decent so I thought it was worth trying them out.  These things are terrible.  They squeak, and leave streaks on the windshield and are really annoying unless it is absolutely pouring out and then they seem to work fine.  For light to average rain, they are awful.  I'll be going back to my trusted Rain-X blades very soon.",2.0
"ordered these blades in Feb. About a month later one of the blades started tearing at the end of the blade, away from the body(flaps when the blade moves.  Just got off the phone with Silblade rep, they will honor the warranty with either fax, email or snail mail submission of invoice from amazon, however they charge a 10.95 shipping and handling fee. This makes the savings over just buying a new blade for me at $6.  Not what I would call standing by your product charging the customer 60% of the original price to replace a defective product.  Will not buy this product again. They worked good at first but in no way will they last 5 years.  The other blade has held up but it still squeals unless there is constant rain.

It leaves a film on the window. Especially while it is wiping, there will be a ""quickly disappearing"" fog trail behind the wiper blades. This is somewhat annoying since the last thing you want is for your wipers to be even more of a distraction while you are trying to drive safely in the rain.

Also, the instant there is no rain on the window, it streaks sooooo loudly! I admit when it is raining it does a great job keeping the window clear. I became so anxious of the streaking sound, which reminds me of fingernails on the chalkboard, that I began manually operating my wipers.",2.0

"I had read articles on detailing forums for a while now that this Original California Duster worked pretty well and will not leave scratches on your clear due to the 100% cotton bristles that is treated with some sort of wax.

(Background) I moved to California from Texas for school and to help out my family. My grandfather has had one of these for years, but due to a disability he just can't do what he used to. I now take care of his cars as best as I can with the main being a 2005 Dodge Magnum in Grey. The car already has swirl marks and clear coat defects.

Initially he keeps the duster hung on the wall inside the garage and it obviously needs a little TLC. Since what I skimmed in the forums for care and maintenance was to wash in cold water with a mild detergent (ex. Woolite) that it should be okay. Sadly I don't have any on hand so I am subbing it with a Meguires car wash solution in cold water. Theoretically it should be fine since this soap does not strip the waxes, finish, or sealants on a clear. I will follow up on its performace as soon as I finish rinsing it out and placing out to dry. I plan to keep it out of directs sunlight as well. As precaution I will allow it 36 hours before I check it again.

"I have an another Original California Car Duster that's about six or so years old that I keep in the trunck of my Jaguar.  I recently bought another car, and decided I wanted a duster to keep in the trunk of that car too.  I ordered this one thinking it would be the same as the older one I have.  It's not.  The number of fiber strands has been significantly reduced when compared to the old one.  While it still does the job, it's not as good as the old one.  I was expecting it to be the same quality, given they are calling it the ""Original"" California Car Duster.",3.0
"Nothing ike the real original duster which had at least three times the number of strands in the head.
Just a basic duster with a wooden handle.",3.0
"Let me get to the point, All the positive reviews about this duster are correct! I've had this duster for a couple of weeks, used it on three cars, and it absolutely works wonders. It completely removes the dust on cars and leaves the car looking just like it has been washed. The duster's bristle is soft and thick, doesn't scratch, the paraffin wax helps catch dust, and the duster is large enough to easily clean surfaces. Using the duster is also as simple as it gets, you just swipe the duster over your car, no need to scrub or even rub. It's that simple! I haven't had any problem with the duster leaving wax streaks because I left it on newspaper to air out for 48 hrs per instructions. The dusters instruction also mentioned that there is no need to wash the duster, ""that the dustier it gets the better it cleans"". And from my experience that seems completely accurate. Of course it also states, if you feel the need to wash the duster do so by hand washing it. The duster also comes with its own case, so there is no need to worry about hanging it out in the open. I've been using the duster once every week and it leaves my car looking as if I just washed it. I absolutely love this car duster and would completely recommend it to everyone.

Update***
After carefully examining my car after numerous uses with this duster, I have to admit I am very disappointed by one aspect of this item. The duster won't scratch the car but it will leave SWIRL Marks! I noticed very bad swirl marks on my and went through an extensive test to try figure out what was causing the swirls. I had though it was my Micro fiber cleaning sponge and towels, but after examining everything, and then testing out the duster my conclusion was it was coming from the duster. As a dusting product it is great, but completely horrible if you are trying to maintain a show car finish on your vehicle.",3.0
"this product does what it is supposed to do, but, I am not real happy with the quality of construction.",3.0
"I misread this. Bought it for my motorcycle and thought it was treated with the same carnuba wax as the original California duster. There's no treatment on the mop, and it's meant just for dashboards etc. I think a swiffer works better.",3.0
"I bought the duster hoping to get rid of the dust easier. Yes it did got rid of the dust, but in the same time, if you have a new car, you will see that it created fine scractches on the surface of the paint. Even though it says it will not scractch you car, but you will see the fine scratches under the sun, it was bad. Word of advice, do not use this on your brand new car, if you baby your car like me. IT WILL create fine scratches!",3.0
Loved my old one (lasted 5 ish years) and this one isn't the same. It tends to leave lint even after multiple uses and shakes outside to try and make the lint factor dwindle a bit. Not imperesed.,3.0

Overall it's a good product however make sure you really take the warning it says on the package seriously. When it says do not rest on fabric meaning that should not touch fabric at all. It will leave lint on any fabric it touches. If you're going to store this in your car make sure it does not touch your carpet or your rugs or your seats if they are fabric.,3.0
Dosent lift dust just moves it around. Also leaves a slimey coat on my car.,3.0
"Received item in a clear throw away see through bag not the black heavy plastic bag that I had expected. Item cleans ok but at times I wonder if I received a used duster. Strands seem kind of used. Maybe I received a ""returned"" item.  I am not sure.  Either way, the product is ok.",3.0

Overall its a good product but for first few times it's messy. Leaves greasy marks which eventually go away. There are better products out there. Not a bad choice.,3.0
Not as good as the original that I have.  The fibers seems to come off way more than my old one - leaving a trail of red fibers on whatever you are dusting.,3.0

"Followed directions to the letter and shook the duster out over and over before first use.  Leaves tons of red lint fiber all over my ride, worse than the amount of dust I had.  Took it out of the truck and put the Swiffer back in.  Will try and break it in around the house, but if the paraffin is supposed to hold the dust - why does it not hold it's own red fiber??????

I will change my rating if things improve.  It does have a very strong and sturdy handle.

UPDATE - Did get better at picking up the dust with minor amounts of red lint left behind......Fabric that hold the handle is falling apart however",3.0
"It's a 5 dollar product as an add on...if you can find it elsewhere for less jump on it. It's not sewn very well. I will have to write here again after I use it to let you know how it holds up and what kind of job it does. *** very smelly, hope it picks up as well as avertised",3.0

I was initially shocked by the bald spots and shedding fibers; although I will say that it got better with use.  Still, I managed to find a better version of this at walmart for cheaper that seemed better made.",3.0
"I have the original Cal. Duster,i purchased it at a retail store in original packaging,nine years old and still works good. I wanted a second one so purchased this one from Amazon. Compared to the first duster they are similar,the big difference is the length of the fibers on the new one,very short and sparce ,my original one the fibers are much longer and thicker,i believe this one is a knock off. It does work but not as well as my original",3.0
"I was excited to get this because of the great reviews and being able to keep it in my car for quick dustings.  However, even after following the instructions for getting it ready I found that it leaves red fuzz everywhere when using it.  I have black interior so that gets somewhat annoying.",3.0

"I experienced alot of ""pilling"" left behind on my dashboard.  Its a 2014 and seems to be rubbery (not the hard slick dashboards) so maybe that's why.  The concept is great.  I fit it under  my sit and grab it when needed.  Great on the harder surfaces, but rubbery dashboard leaves it worse than when you started.",3.0
"I purchased this thinking that it would help keep the interior of my car clean. It looks like it would be perfect for cleaning the dash, however, once i started using i noticed that it would leave behind red strands. I thought that maybe continous use would make the strands fall off and not appear, but they did not so now i use a microfiber cloth to clean my interior.",3.0
"First this is the second one I have. The first is years old and works great and is a great product! It is getting pretty dirty so I decided to buy another one to swap out as I clean the first one.

This one came in a box with another purchase so no issues with shipping from Amazon. When I got it, the duster was in a plastic bag, not in the plastic storage case the original one has. The duster may stain fabrics if left on them for long periods of time . This indicated to me that I received a reject product . I removed from the bag and notice the build quality has gone down and the materials are all slightly off. The handle is of different design and the duster is made with a similar material but uses different construction.  I looked at the fibers and noticed the fibers were all slightly thinner and that a portion of the duster was sewn together.  This should not have made it market.

I have since found this exact product with the correct storage case that provide the cleaning care and use instructions in the retail stores on and off base,  like wally world for $8 this is $4 cheaper and the quality is what the California Car Duster is supposed to be.

I will return for a refund. Great customer service so no worries thank you so much Amazon!",3.0
Bought this for my 2013 Evo x gsr. It left red lint all over my dash. If using in the house I'm sure it's fine as you won't notice. But this brush DOES leave red fibers behind,3.0
"This duster works practically the same as the ""Swiffer"" dusters advertised on TV.  The old California Duster model had more fiber to it, and trapped dust better.  This model seems to just move it around somewhat.  It works OK, but the surfaces can still have dust specs on them after you're done.  I was mediumly pleased with this, but recommend a full dusting with a polish is you're wanting to clean up the house and really get rid of these minute particles.",3.0
A little small but I knew the size before purchasing. Nice and classy as ashtrays go. Looks nice on a table as well,3.0

Like the idea of ashes and butts dropping into the container.  Only problem is ashes blow everywhere in the wind.,3.0
Tough to put out cigarrets. With time it gets ashe all over on the top and has no place to hold the cigar/cigarette in place.,3.0
"I only 'like it' because it is rather small and light-weight.  Small because there are two users and neither empties it regularly.  Light-weight because it needs two hands to use.  On the good side, when the flip-lip becomes dislodged, it is easy to repair.  All in all, I get what I paid for.  It has lasted for about 2 years which is impressive.",3.0
I bought this and then quit smoking. Buy it and maybe it will work for you as well. It's useless if you use electronic cigarettes (vaporizers) but if you smoke regular cigarettes it gets the job done. It's not easy to clean if you want to make it look brand new again.,3.0

I'm trying to get away from using disposable cleaning supplies but these work pretty well. I even use them around the house sometimes. They started to dry out a little though after not having them very long.,3.0
"The product pretty much does as it claims. I got it mainly for the glass wipes, and I wish the container was bigger (for some reason I thought it was bigger when I ordered it). But the wipes are good - they clean the windows well, although I do wipe them down after with a papertowel to remove any residue. The interior wipes are good - the cleaning ones work well on all surfaces. Not sure that the protectant ones are all that useful, but I guess we will see over time if they help.",3.0
These work just fine but I personally prefer Meguiar's Natural Shine Protectant better. These do the job but it leaves a bit of a sticky residue (nothing I can't handle); Meguiar's does not and it smells much better than this stuff (this stuff doesn't have a pleasant scent at all).,3.0

I started using the Armor All cleaning wipes to clean my interior while I'm sitting in the car wash.  I decided to try the 3 pack and I'm disappointed in the Glass wipes.  It seems like there's some oily product in the solution that leaves the glass streaky.  I would buy the cleaner and protectant again but not the glass wipes.,3.0
"The glass cleaner leaves my windows streaky. The protector works well on my ""leather"" seats in my Prius. It's just as easy to have paper towels & windex in my car. It's great if you have kids & need to quickly wipe things down & don't want a bunch of cleaners in your car.",3.0
It's ok!!,3.0
"Works well, but dries up fast",3.0
Kinda pricey. I thought the containers would be bigger. Would probably be cheaper to buy each of these individually off of amazon.,3.0
Not very many wipes in each container.,3.0
"Bought this product thinking it would be pretty much all I needed for keeping my interior surfaces and window clean but I was wrong. The glass cleaner says ""no streaks"" but I have them everywhere and it irritates me when I drive. The interior wipes suck and leave white pieces everywhere. On top of all that these are expensive and I have to use so many to clean all my windows and they dry out super quick. If your in a hurry to pick up a girl and want your car to look decent these will do a bang up job but will get it done. Only reason I rated 3 stars instead of 2 is because I love armor all products but this one let me down.",3.0
"The trick to the glass cleaner is to follow it up with a paper towel or clean cloth after you wipe it. Kinda defeats the purpose of the wipe but it still makes my glass cleaner.

Had some issues with the cleaner and protectant as it left uneven marks on my dash.",3.0

I used the glass cleaner on the inside windows of my vehicle. It left a very heavy residue that was extremely hard to remove. Not sure if I received a bad package or what.  Might be good for some people but for me it was not.,3.0
The product works okay but the lids won't stay snapped shut. They all dried out within a month :( I now have 3 cleaning products that are unusable :(,3.0
"I bought this three pack because I wanted to be able to clean the inside of my car with the cleaning wipes, shine it with the protectant wipes and then also clean my windows. Realistically, these are just cleaning wipes and I did not see much of a difference between the cleaning and glass wipes. Also, a big downside for me was that the glass wipes seemed to streak a little bit which is exactly why I was cleaning the windows to begin with. Ultimately if you want to clean your car just buy some Windex and use a roll of paper towels. I only gave them 3 stars because I was able to clean my car but if I could I wouldn't have bought these and saved the money (a little overpriced as well).",3.0
"I bought this when Amazon dropped the price down to $10.  I own a short bed pickup and thought this would be perfect in certain situations.  The two times I went to use it I was scratching my head at what to do and how to hook it up and I'm normally pretty hands on kind of guy...  It may sound easy but it comes with parts that aren't easily figured out and the two times I went to use it I didn't have two hours to figure out how it all went together and latched down.  The instructions were either non existent or just written very horrible, don't remember as it's been like 6 months since I've tried to use it.

Going camping this summer and I'm definitely going to take this thing out again and carefully examine it and will update the review then.",3.0

"Bought this for our Infinity FX35 because our trunk doesn't lock. Since we put our stroller in the trunk, I'm always scared it might fall out if we hit a bump. My boss got a trunk net with his Prius so I thought this would help me calm my nerves with our trunk.

I think it's a bit small. After we set it up it's very small - not like the picture. For our purpose, it served it well but if we were to put smaller items in it it wouldn't. This would work if there's big bulky items. Smaller items would just slide through the bottom since there's a gap (can be seen in the product image).

Just wish this was much bigger.",3.0
"Does not fit Ford Escape 2014 models. Other than that it is a sturdy net, good price. Does not have hooks, so you are left wondering how to attach it to your Fords.",3.0
"I was a little disappointed in this net - the bungee cords on top and bottom stretch nicely, but as you stretch them, the net itself gets very short.  I was hoping to use this across the bed of my truck to keep groceries and other items from sliding forward, but once I stretched it across the bed, the netting part was sitting up off the floor by 6 inches.  Not really all that helpful for me.  I think the description could be much better - sure it can stretch 60"", but it essentially makes the net unusable if you do.  Also, I did not use the attachment points, but I'm not sure they would hold up well if I wanted to.  I think I would only recommend this if you were replacing an existing cargo net in a car trunk and you already had attachment points.  I would not recommend it for a full-size truck.",3.0
"Plenty large for anything I wanted to carry in the 6.5' bed on my pickup; however, it is very stretchy and the holes in the webbing are large, small camping equipment and even sleeping bags may not stay put at highway speeds. Recommended for bulky cargo only.",3.0

"I was looking for a smaller cargo net for the back of my double cab short bed Tacoma. I wanted something that actually had to stretch a little bit to cover the truck bed and the camping gear inside of it. This did work and the price was great, but the plastic hooks this thing comes with are just bad bad bad. I took several of the hooks off since I really only needed 8 contact points, however 6 of the 8 hooks are now bent out of shape and I don't trust they will hold up to many more uses beyond the week long camping trip we just wrapped up. If you need something for an occasional tie-down, or to ensure gear doesn't come out of the back of your truck on the highway then this will work. Just don't expect longevity out of this one.",3.0
"A plastic hook failed the first time I used this product.  The net is fine, but the hook design is weak.  I almost lost items off the motorcycle.",3.0
"The hook ends are fat and flat, a little difficult to get them to ""hook"" on plastic and other points unless you are hooking the hooks through the webbing to secure things down.  Webbing appears to be thick and good material.",3.0
I bought this product for a two week traveling and camping trip in California. I liked the product but felt the description could have been better about how it attaches to the truck bed.  It does not stretch at all but the bungees are very stretchy and don't adjust well. The actual cover is adjustable but this reduces your surface covering area.  It worked well and the price is great.  I liked that it didn't get tangled. It would be nice if the adjustable straps were where the cover attaches to the truck and not across the top and bottom of the actual cover. Also it doesn't really quite look like the picture but I have a short bed truck and this might have made the difference between my experience and the expected product outcome. Good luck shopping!,3.0
"The plastic hooks work, but don't inspire great confidence.  The bungee seems good.  I'd prefer the ""squares"" to be a bit smaller, but it will work to hold larger objects.",3.0
"I purchased these to help out with a move recently from Vermont to Massachusetts.  I have a 2007 GMC Sierra with a 6 1/2 foot bed, and these worked well.  The two rings are really the important thing, and it really is nothing more than a set of long bungee cords with two rings... but they're quite helpful.  If I'd had the full 8' bed, they'd be even more useful, as they're really set up to work with trucks with 6 tie-down points instead of the 4 that mine has.  You can, however, double up and use them that way.  The only problem I've had with them is that one of the cords came free of the hook during use.  Needless to say, that caused some issues.  One other thing -- the locking clips are rather flimsy, and won't work for long.  If all you need is something simple to hold down a tarp, these are where it's at... but realistically, if you can find a metal ring and some bungees of your own, you've got no need of this.",3.0
The Dremel Polishing Wheel is ideal for making metals shine.  Polishing compound is impregnated in the fiber so you don't have to contend with polish flying everywhere. Able to use higher rpms with this item as well. It does tend to leave behind residue bands that if allowed to dry can become extremely difficult to remove later.  Another drawback with this product is they tend to be a one-time use for small projects.  I would recommend using a lamb's wool wheel with the appropriate grit polish sticks for severe tarnish or projects that are larger than the palm of your hand.,3.0

I just finished using a hair drier gun and some pliers in order to pull the fan grill out (convex) because the material used on the back of this fridge is so flimsy it bumps onto the fan and it can cause it to burn out. Off-roaders be ware. This product does a decent job keeping things cool but it is not constructed in a very rough way. Mine just about to burn the other day because with the bumps of the road the back panel crashed onto the fan and prevented from gyrating. A very strong burn odor came out and thats when i decided to do somthing to fix it. Hoonestly i think the fan should be placed on the front or some side because the door opens from the front and thats where you wanna have free access to your goodies and also free flow of air. Being in the back relegates it to enclosed areas at best where the back panel will be blocked and hit by cargo and thats where the grill bends in and screws with the fan :/,3.0
"The product works to a degree but it absolutely does NOT keep the contents 40 degrees cooler than the outside.  Maybe in the right conditions it would but in a hot car in the sun, nope.

I don't like the design of the lid... it doesn't have any way of locking or at least of closing with a pressure seal as most coolers.  and it does not retain temperature for any reasonable length of time if the vehicle is parked with no power going to the fridge",3.0
I don't think this cooler keeps things as cold as it says it does. Yes I put cold things in it so I expected it to keep them cold. I have to put cold packs in it to actually keep it cold. The fan seems to be clicking in the back and it seems to be made very cheap.,3.0

Cons:  the AC adapter for using indoors gets very hot, in fact we are so nervous about it that we don't use it outside the car.

"It works well but has a fan noise that changes throughout the day.  The lid falls as you are loading it. Size is great, can fill with lots of stuff. I use it in the cab of my semi and it fits well.

"I used this during the summer and it worked well enough.

This cooler is higher priced than some, but doesn't seem better made than the nondescript models on store shelves.

For example, the top lid swivels on two little plastic polyps that protrude from each side of the door.
These LPPs fit into corresponding notches in the body of the cooler.

One of the protruding appendages on my cooler is misshaped and fails to hold, so the door tends to lift off my cooler when opened.

The cooler still cools, but the words ""cheap piece of sh...plastic"" flash across my cortex whenever this happens.

Still, I guess it's good enough.",3.0

Others may be even better.

One of the virtues of the 9135 is that I was able to plug it in, read the codes and clear them after getting no farther than page 2 in the Actron book.

It may be that the main difference between the costly readers and the less costly ones lies in the reference material provided in the package, with the consumer-grade models being the most cryptic.

I might have skipped over this for the ScanGuage though. The Scan Guage has built in statistics for analyzing Gas Mileage and such. It also costs $100 more.

This is a great by at $72. Solidly built, easy to use (easier than setting the time on a vcr anyway), and easy to store. I have used it three times in the 2 months I have had it. It has already paid for itself (Shop wants $40 just to plug theirs in).

I purchase the Vector battery charger from Amazon and the invoice said it was sold by DAM Distributors.  I sent in my warranty card to Vector Manufacturing and it came back.

I have had this unit for about six months.  Each time I use it, it does just fine.  However, the first time I used it on a low battery the charger would go to a fault-F02.  After reading the directions again, all I needed to do was bump the charging rate from 2 to 10 and the fault went away and the battery charge just fine.  I really like the ""Recondition Battery"" function on this unit.  Has saved me money.  So why just three stars?  The case.  It is top heavy!  Just a little tap or bump or pull on the cable and over it goes.  The fan unit should be mounted on the top.  NOT ON THE BOTTOM.  When I read how poor the service is with Black and Decker I am scared to use this unit.  But what should I expect from a company that send its manufactering over to China and not keep it here in the U.S of A.  I believe that if I had it to do all over again, I am not sure if I would buy the VEC1093.  Not because of the design of the electronic's, because of the design of the body.",3.0

"I bought this because it is cheap and I was going to take the circuit board out of it for a project. I took the casing apart to check it before using it, and found one of the negative (0V) black wire was detatched from board. The other negative (black) wire was soldered over the positive (red)part of the circuit board.  I resoldered all three wires so that they didn't come close to the circuit board.

I also found the plastic had been melted by a soldering iron during assembly - probably an indication of the speed of assembly and low quality soldering.

Also,the metal side plates (0v) could easily make contact with the center spring (+V)as the plastic was melted away.  I put a piece of plastic insulation between them to prevent a short circuit.

Having done this preventative maintenance I now feel that the converter will function well as intended. I actually decided to use it as a plug-in converter in the end.

So, good value if you check for bad wiring, and correct any problems before use, but possibly a high risk of overheating due to a short circuit if you don't check it.",3.0

"UPDATE.  After three months product works as advertised.  Range is 20 feet.  Unit had to be packed up tight next to two metal dash supports to fit.  This probably shields the signal from the key fob.  My car starts in one second but starter engages for three seconds so there is extra wear on starter when using.

Received packaged in good condition and all related parts included and unit works as advertised.  Instructions are brief and it helps considerably to view the cd paying attention to every word as that is also brief.  I had to replay the cd several times as some very key phrases where not clearly articulated or emphasized. Instruction are generic in nature and wires under my dash were not easy to get to, 97 Chevy lumina, nor looked like the cd's. So there was confusion initially in figuring out were to start.  The test light is a key tool.  After connecting the fused power cords and taping up the constant power source to protect it from arcing under the dash while I worked near it, I connected the power source for the test light to the other end of the fused power cord.  Also, There are several groups or sets or wiring.  This was not emphasized.  Pay particular attention to what wire set is being used as they all use similar color patterns.  The power, accessories, ignition and starter wires are the larger wires, and are not in the plug wire sets I note below.  There is also a smaller power wire that also joins to the constant power source that goes to the 5 pin anti theft plug.  This wasn't in the paper instructions and very briefly notedin the cd. I watched the image and noticed the gage of wire being shown.  There is also a 16 plug wire set and a 5 plug anti theft wire plug.  Installation from start to finish took 6 hours.  The only option installed was the door locks.  That portion of the instructions were well illustrated.  I have a maintenance background and think that someone with average mechanical skills would take more time to install this.  If you are not comfortable working in a tight area, with brief instructions or unsure about cutting into wires in your car, or taking trim or structural parts out to get to wires, then I would not suggest a DIY, but rather bring this kit to a mechanic to install.  Bulldog has installers noted on their web sight.  The web site is good and I was able to find my cars wire color codes easily enough and print those from a computer.  Adobe flash is required to view video content off the web site.  Video content did not work on My iPad or android phone.  If you have a Vat key theft system you need the 791 part mod to bypass your vat.

There were a couple of inaccuracies with the Bulldog webpage wiring installation for my specific vehicle.  For example, one of the wires (i forgot which) was found on this grey connector but the Bulldog webpage said it was on a white connector. Also, that webpage is not very clear.  The locations of some of the wires were not explained very well.  Again, fortunately I had that forum post to fall back on.

"Bought this as a way to get around having 2 different keys for my 97 T-100 as the lock cylinders are starting to fail, and new ones you can't get one key for ignition, doors, and gas cap..
One thing to remember is you still need your key for this to get past your steering wheel lock, which only dawned on me after I started installing this. If anyone has a good way to defeat the steering lock I'd like to hear it, the heads of the tamper proof screws are in a place where I can't get a chisel on them to get them loose.
Anyway, this is pretty painful to install, just difficult to access everything, even with the T-harness (which I would strongly recommend).
At first I thought my T-harness was incorrect, so I tried calling tech support, and each time after about 5 minutes it would transfer me to a voicemail box that was full...lame, just really lame. I email tech support, and got a response about 24 hours later.
In the future, I think I'm going to call tech support *before* I buy something like this, just to see if they answer the phone.
Anyway, turns out the ignition connector was really hidden and the T-harness was correct, yeah, my mistake for looking in the wrong spot for the connector, but would have been easily answered by someone who's installed one before (like, umm tech support?). The wiring chart for my vehicle was correct, and everything works like it should. I would buy some of the splice connectors available here on amazon rather than their method of peeling back insulation, inserting the wire and twist/tape. You can get 25 for like $5 and it will make the job a LOT easier.
The DVD is lame, the youtube video is much better.
I'm a bit conflicted as the product seems to work as it should, the installation manual does give you all the info you need, but the phone tech support being non-existent like that makes me want to not recommend the product.
If you are thinking about installing this just be aware it isn't for the faint of heart, you'll spend a day or two under your steering wheel in all kinds of uncomfortable positions. Your knees and elbows will take a beating, as will your finger tips from trying to get those damn connectors apart (the locking tabs are always painful). The T harness is worth the money IMO. If you've never messed with wiring, this probably isn't the best job to pick as your first.
I ended up locating the unit under my ashtray as there was space behind the plastic cover, and the cables from the ignition/T harness *just* reached). I had to lengthen the ground wire and the door lock wires to reach.
I cut all the unused wires from the back of the connectors.

Its getting cold fast and I need the remote start for my little ones so we don't freeze til death waiting for the car to warm up.

Update: I had this installed about a year ago and I love the remote start.  My remote lock does not work, but it unlocks and starts with no issue and that's mostly what I needed it for.  I have a 2004 dodge durango ST and it did not require any additional bypasses.  the fob stopped working one day but my IT guy opened it up for me and took a look and it worked fine again.  It is a bit slow to react now not sure why, maybe the battery is dying off, but we'll see.

Updating again since after 4 years my starter has stopped working.  It started with the car stopping and restarting after I engaged the start up. Brought maybe I needed a new battery.  The remote stopped communicating all together with the starter so it wouldn't start at all.  Got a replacement battery but still not working.  Thought maybe I needed to reprogram fob to car since battery had been removed but when I you tuned this it said to disconnect wires and all types of stuff.

They also do not mention that if you have an anti-theft system you will likely have a part of this device showing - a copper ring around your ignition switch.  I might recommend professional installation unless you have a full afternoon and a lot of patience.  Seems to work fine now that I've got it in!

UPDATE

A few months later I ended up pulling this out.  I hated how I couldn't get it up in the dash properly to where I couldn't see it and felt safe about it not falling on my feet.  I also had some electrical problems with the vehicle although I can't say for sure that it was related to this device.  I also hated the copper ring around my ignition.",3.0
"Installed it in my 2006 Honda Pilot EX-L with factory DVD entertainment. I also purchased the 791 universal bypass module.  I had to place a key inside this bypass module so it can read the chip that's in the key. That feels a little weird; leaving a key inside a locked car, but that was the only way to get it to work. Also downloaded the wire color chart for my car from the bulldog website, but many of the colors did not match. Installation instruction could have been a little clearer, but at the end was able to figure it out. Took me almost 6 hours to install it. The video was somewhat helpful. If you're not an experienced installer hire a professional. Must have good knowledge of wiring and cable testing. I'm a ""seasoned"" mechanic  and it took me a while to get everything hooked up.
RANGE IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO ADVERTISED DISTANCE.
The max distance is about 200 feet. For Honda Pilot owners: don't by the T-harness. It will not work on Honda Pilots. I had to send back the one I bought. Also if you want to use the original Honda key for the door locks; once you start the car with the remote starter you will not be able to open the doors with the remote. Must use the key at the driver side to open the door. Hold the key in the open position for about 2 or 3 seconds and it will open all the doors. I'm seriously thinking about returning the main remote start unit and upgrade to a higher distance system.",3.0
"This product works, and it does exactly what it states. The only problem is that there are a lot of useless options and the directions are vague at best.

I was given this product as a gift by my wife, being automotively inclined and have a degree in electronics technology I tackled the job myself. I figured if I can wire up and engine and supply communications to a military base, then a small job such as this would be easy...wrong.

The first problem I ran into are the wiring diagrams from the website, a majority of the color codes for the online wiring diagrams were correct. However, a few vital elements such as anything having to deal with something other than the starting circuit, had me running in circles and ripping my car to pieces. Secondly the directions included in the kit are straight forward enough, but it wouldn't hurt to have a couple of testing procedures and troubleshooting tips before you start blowing fuses and circuits. Lastly, if you have a early 90's and later vehicle, their T harness option is hard to find. Hope your ready for Easter wire hunting.

If you are a do-it-yourself kind of person then I suggest paying money to to have this system installed...especially if you own a smaller vehicle such as a sports car where space is limited. There are a lot of extra features that consist of button combination's with system programing. I suggest staying with the basics ( lock/unlock, start/stop, and trunk release), or your going to be forking out extra money and time for vehicle and option specific relays. (provided by bulldog security of course). Not to mention the loads of schematics and diagrams that need to be thumbed through.

Once the system is in and installed it's solid and works for a large area including buildings. Oh and as a little tip, when you get to the part about a ""type C"" locking system, if you blow a fuse your door and switch side is backwards :) Good luck and happy hunting.",3.0
"I have had this remote installed and partially working for about 1 month now.  If you are planning on buying this item, I highly recommend checking out the wiring diagrams on the bulldog website before purchasing.  This may show you how hard your install will be or how many more items you need to purchase to make it work. This is located under ""Vehicle Wiring Diagrams"" at [...]

If you find your car on their and the diagrams don't have special notes or alternate wiring diagrams attached then I suggest buying this and installing it yourself if you are so bold.  I was able to install the starter portion within about 3.5 hours on a Dodge Stratus '98 with no special security bypass requirements.  If you see a lot of additional notes, additional wiring diagrams, and the need for what they call a P791 security bypass, you may want to look into how much additional money you will have to dish out to make this product work.

I'm still having troubles with the parking lights, Horn, and door locks.  The reason I'm having trouble with the parking lights is because the unit that I received does not have a brown wire that I can use for the lights.  The manual references a brown wire that does not exist.  After calling support they stated they had never seen this and I would have to call Customer Service to get another wire harness to fix this.  This is just the first of many questions that the technical support person should have been able to answer.

For example I asked him if the wires went in order according to the order they are listing in the manual so I could figure which one should be the brown wire.  He stated that they are not, but if fact after double checking they are in order.  It appears that my unit has 2 black ground wires.  Now it's up to me to figure out which one should be the brown light wire.  I also asked about which guide I should reference for the resistors used for the door locks and the answer he gave me was way off base and I would have to be an idiot to not follow the special notes on the wiring diagram which spells out the special resistors for the door locks.
Hope this helps your decision process!

"Once installation was complete, the unit worked perfectly. However, the installation was more difficult than it needed to be.

First, the installation instruction referred to a WHITE wire that was to be connected to a bypass module. This part of the instruction was vague in a couple of ways. 1) It did not specify what WHITE wire it was referring to while other areas of the instruction were quite specific (i.e. - BLACK wire with the Blue stripe on the 16-pin harness). 2) It said that the WHITE wire was to be connected to the BLUE wire on the bypass module. However, since there are mutliple different bypass modules available using a variety of color codes, this step created confusion.

Second, when it came time to connect the various plugs to the starter unit, there was no mention of a need to initialize the unit by stepping on the brake pedal and pressing the start button on the remote. Without this information, when I plugged in the unit, it began a repetitive clicking that would not stop. I had to unplug it and call for Technical Assistance to find out what I was missing.

Third, I found the ""unlimited technical support"" to be somewhat limited. When I ran into the aforementioned problems on a Saturday, I tried calling the 800 number only to find that technical assistance was not available on weekends. So I had to pack it in and wait until after work on Monday. Then when I called on Monday, it took over 30 minutes on hold before I actually had a person on the other end of the line. To his credit, the tech knew exactly what the problem was and I was able to finish the install in short order.

Overall, I am happy with the remote starter, but displeased with the quality of the supplied instructions and the limited availability of the technical support.",3.0
"I've had my Swagman for several years now, and it had worked well.  I loaded it w/ 4 bikes behind my camper (behind, not in front - didn't like doing it that way).  The weight and the bounce was too much, and the frame cracked at the base.  I had that welded, and thought I was good.  Then, the tubular shaft bent at the base (just above where it has the 2 holes for the pins.)  Unhappy camper.  It worked well for me for years with a couple of bikes, but when I loaded it w/ four bikes (130 pounds) and added the bumps of a 3000-mile trip, it was too much.",3.0
"Great concept but doesn't work well with a mix of 2 adult and 2 kids bikes. Might work better if bike placement had been a little further apart. However, it did work in allowing us to carry 3 bikes on the rack while pulling PUP camper (1 bike strapped to top of truck.)",3.0
It says that is a 4 bike but is for the racing bikes.  Don't try to put 4 regular bikes on it. It is also very heavy and bulky.  So you need to have a good place to put it that is easy to grab.  I pulled a small Pop up camper with it and had 3 bikes on it.  Very sturdy.  Wish it had better instructions on some of the parts but somewhat easy to figure it out.,3.0
"My Jeep has a 35"" spare tire mounted on the rear and the length of bike carrier wasn't long enough.  The fold down only goes down partially and not far enough for the rear gate to swing open.  The rack is built very well but if you find yourself in the position I am in you would be better served with another unit.",3.0
"Keep in mind I am a first time owner of a rack. I found this rack diffcult to install and the instructions were very poor. The diagrams did not match the unit I received, 4 holes vs. 3 in the actual unit. There was no explanation of how to fold it down to gain access to the trunk. I replaced the hitch pin right away as it seem very easily loosen with no good way to secure it.
It did seem to hold the bikes on ok I didn't feel secure going on long trips till i replaced the hitch pin.

Maybe I was expecting too much but poor instructions always make for a bad first impression in my case.",3.0
"Easy to assemble, and sturdy. the hitch pin provided is good in that it is threaded and the carrier is threaded as well. tightening is accomplished by the end of the hitch pin, but the tiny pin provided is pathetic. I ordered the swagman locking pin also, luckily, and the locking part of the pin - the cap- fits over the standard one, making it locking as well as being able to be tightened. I cannot imagine what would happen if the standard pin loosens on the road with nothing more than the tiny clip provided to retain it.
Over all good, but order the locking pin too, you'll need it.",3.0
"This is a product that is a good alternative for heated gloves.  It allows you to waterproof them, but requires a bit of elbow grease in the application.  The wax smells for a while, and is hard to get used to.  Smells a bit like burning rubber.

The applicator is not very friendly, the product either doesn't come out at all or soaks the glove. I would think a spray would be more convenient.",3.0
"I used this product on a pair of ski gloves that used to be waterproof, however the goretex or what ever was used started leaking around the thumbs.  I put on a good heavy coat of the Nikwax and let it dry overnight.  The next day I went sailing with some freinds, and since it is Seattle, naturally it started to pour down rain.  Admittedly this was kind of a severe trial of the Nikwax since not only were we getting drenched with heavy rain, we were also pulling on the soggy lines to tack the sails.  The gloves held up for about an hour before they started leaking, and they wound up like sponges at the end of the sail - about 3 hours in the pouring rain.  All that having been said, I think the product would work fine if it wern't for the hauling on the wet ropes.",3.0

"This does indeed extend your Load Warrior another 18 inches and is fairly easy to put together. What I was not happy with was the cross bar.

For what I am trying to do, that became useless to me.",3.0

"I had to return the item.  I couldn't get the extension to line up correctly/perfectly with my loadwarrior.  Also, when I was taking it apart to ship it back, two of the bolts were stripped in place (I was careful not to cross thread or over tighten during installation) and I had to use a hacksaw to get it apart.  I was pretty disappointed.

The whole thing (load warrior and extension) fit nicely on my 2013 acura rdx, barely missing the hatchback spoiler.  I had it mounted on Thule crossbars with a 30"" spread.

I guess I would recommend this if you were buying everything at the same time.  I suspect some of my issues were due to the load warrior being 2-3 years old, with some light corrosion causing some fit issues.",3.0

"Because you can't see down into the tank, the only way you'll know if the tank is full--should you choose to use this method--is to keep pouring until there's stagnant fuel above the filter.  Sure, it'll stop flowing when the tank is properly filled, but if you over-poured, you still have to figure out what to do with the fuel left over in the funnel.

Pros:
- It fits well in Coleman appliances and doesn't fall out.
- It has a built-in filter.
- The air vent keep the fuel from glugging as it flows.

Cons:
- You're still pouring directly from those stupid, cumbersome Coleman fuel cans.  Good luck not spilling any as it glugs into the funnel.
- Unless you're checking the fuel level in the tank regularly and manually, you'll overfill the funnel.  Sure, it'll ""stop filling at correct fuel level"" but you won't know that until stagnant fuel rises above the filter.  That means you'll have have to either a) find a way to transfer the fuel in the bottom of the funnel and spout back to the can, or b) suck it up and lose it on the ground when you pull the funnel out of the appliance.
- Using the funnel, I rarely fill a tank without spilling an annoying amount of fuel either from the funnel or from the can itself.
- Since some appliances (like my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coleman-533-Stove/dp/B0009PUQAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coleman 533 Stove</a>) sit so low to the surface (ground, concrete, table, etc.), it's difficult to maneuver a full can of fuel without spilling it.  ""Why don't you just put it on the edge of a table or something?"" you might ask.  Well, I rarely fill a tank without spilling some fuel (leftovers, funnel, spout, or can), which inevitably runs down the side of the appliance and pools under its base.  I can fill it on a raised surface...IF it's a surface that won't get messed up by spilled fuel.

The best way to use this funnel is to pour slowly and manually check the fuel level regularly.  Don't rely on the silly, hyped ""stops filling at correct fuel level"" if you want to avoid spills.

I'll take the funnel when backpacking.  If car camping or fueling at home, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coleman-Fuel-Filler-Assembly/dp/B0009PURJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coleman Fuel Filler Assembly</a>&nbsp;works a lot better and overall results in a lot less spilled fuel.

"I mis-measured my roof racks and these were too small for the fatter bars. I ended up purchasing the Yakima Forklift, which are 2x the cost, but work just fine.",3.0
"Before buying this mount, measure the distance between your bike's fork dropouts to the rear wheel. Then look at the recommended crossbar spacing for your vehicle in the Yakima Q Clip instruction booklet. If the measurements are not similar (ie. rear wheel not centered over the rear crossbar, short roofline and long wheelbase bike), then the rear wheel will hang far behind the rear crossbar and there's a good chance that the rear towers will shift forward when transporting your bike. This can result in roof damage from the shifting clips and the bike's rear wheel contacting and scratching the roof.

The Boa is Yakima's most economical rooftop bike mount and it shows. If you live in a low crime neighborhood and remove your bike and rack when you are away from your car, this mount will probably work just fine for you. Or if you absolutely need to minimize the footprint of the rack when it's off your vehicle.

The Boa pod is mostly made of glass-filled polymer. There is a flimsy plastic cover that is secured by the skewer and covers the heads of the 3 hex mounting bolts. Unfortunately, even when locked, this cover can easily be pried and cracked open by hand revealing the 3 bolt heads. I complained and Yakima responded that they only provide theft deterrence and cannot guarantee against theft. This does not even approach deterrence.

The Boa mount comes with Yakima's universal locking skewer with a polymer lever, stainless rod, and round steel nut. If the skewer is closed and locked but the handle is in the wrong orientation and there's insufficient tension, then it's a simple matter to rotate the handle counterclockwise to loosen the nut and steal your bike. The lever and cam are plastic and will deform and wear with use. When no bike is loaded, the only way to secure the mount is to tighten the nut further and then close and lock the skewer. However, adjusting the nut defeats the purpose of providing a long-throw skewer.

Adding a long tray converts the mount into a Copperhead mount. However, given the security concerns, I returned this mount and purchased a Yakima Steelhead mount instead. The Steelhead has a clamshell clamping design and is mostly metal. It comes with a stainless metal skewer that has a special locking pin and e-clip on the nut. When the skewer is locked, the clamshell cannot open and the skewer nut cannot be removed even if it is not tightened and tensioned against the mount body. As with the Boa, make sure that the skewer lever rests against the crossbar when locked so that it can only be turned clockwise tightening (and not loosening) the nut.

If you don't want to spend much more than the cost of the Boa but want to use your SKS lock cores, consider purchasing a Steelhead body (new or used) and a Rocky Mounts Lariat tray. You will need to drill a hole in the tray to mount the Yakima head. The Rocky Mounts crossbar mount is compatible with Yakima's round bars and comes with all hardware, and their wheel strap is also less expensive than Yakima's.

"I used this spreader to cover crop 12 acres of orchard with clover seed. Spread was 20 feet plus, as promised, no clogging, the massive hopper was great, the lid is a little too tight to get on and off easily, but it works. The mounting plate was key, as it allowed me to improvise a mount to the bike rack of my Jeep. With a lighter cord extension for the power, it all worked. Would be a 5-star except for one big fault: The flow gate opening/closing mechanism is poorly designed. If you only want the gate all the way open with full flow, you will probably do OK, although the control arm and connectors look a little flimsy and don't inspire confidence. If you want to reduce the flow to 1/2, or 1/4 or 1/8, like I did, you can't start with the gate closed, because you have no way of knowing how wide you are opening it. The workaround for me was to simply set the gate, turn on the spreader, pour in the seed, and run back to the driver's seat and go. At 1/8 open, that worked fine for me with minimal waste.",3.0
"The item is well constructed and easy to put together.  The spreader motor plugs into a cigarette lighter on the ATV and the plug-in piece was broken when it arrived.  I needed it right away so I couldn't send it back for repairs so I had to buy parts and fix it myself - $6 and some time.  A little frustrating.

The directions for use suck.  There are no charts to recommend how wide to open the seed gate and how fast to drive.  We use it to spread clover seed and the process is by guess and by golly.  The directions given are ridiculous asking you to drop seed for a given period of time and catch it and then there are ft/second factors and so on.  The directions should come with a rocket scientist.  In the end, we just opened it up and drove.  Took about 10 acres to get it figured out.  Then it worked fine.  Unfortunately, I let a friend use it and the setting got changed so I will get to go through this process again next year.

"This is a nice helmet bag that does what it is supposed to, but I like the one you get with your helmet better (the thin bag with a drawstring). This bag works well for keeping your helmet at home. It will keep scratches away from it (which the thinner bags wont). On the other hand, it is not good for taking it on the road with you. It is too bulky for that.

"If you want a small water feature, this is probably a good buy. The pump is underpowered and, thus, the waterfall has minimal effect. I originally purchased this to combine with a preformed pond liner I already had. I ended up using it, modified on one end, but covered the entire basin with pond liner. So, I guess you might say that I really didn't need the preformed plastic pond liner. I did use the waterfall, and it still is underpowered. I will likely get a larger pump in the near future. Still, If you're new to ponds and don't want to get to involved in the process, this unit is an easy start.",3.0
Easy bolt on. The bottom that the cooler sits on is small. The metal could be thicker. It works fine though.,3.0

"I used this to mount two 5"" lawn mower tires. The bead breaker worked fine, no problem. Also taking these small tires OFF the rim with the tool was quite easy and fast and the tool worked well. However, putting the new tires on the rim was a challenge until I did two things. The first thing was cut a 1/4 wide groove on the inside side of the tire installing end of the tire tool. This allowed it to ride on the edge of the rim and not slide out. The second thing I did was to change the position of the silver locking ""cone"" when I was installing the tires. I removed the cone, installed one of the plastic spaced on threaded rod so it contacted the tire hub first, then placed the installation tool over the plastic spacer. The cone was then placed on top of the spacer and the locking component was then screwed down tight. What this did was trap the installing tool between the tapered cone and the tire. Between that and the groove I cut into the tool, it made the installation a snap. It would have been impossible to mount a 5"" stiff tubeless tire with the tool without the modification to the tool and using in the manner I described. If it came with a groove already cut in the tool and the instructions would have suggested using it the way I described on the very small tires, I would have given it 5 stars.",3.0
"Portable mini tire changer is very good light to medium duty tire changer, but falls a little short when it comes to the wide kart tires I was hoping to use it for. specifically the bead breaker. All other aspects seem fine and lawn tires can be mounted and dismounted with ease. For the average lawn and garden tires it's a good choice, built fairly well, my biggest complaint is the threaded rod is a bit too light for my purpose.",3.0
this would not work on polaris sportsman atv rims. the center hole on polaris rims are to large. the area the rim would rest on the tool is not wide enough to support the rim. it may work with other models. gave it three stars only because it did not fit my needs.,3.0
"With 22 acres of thorn trees, I've struggled with many a flat tire.  ""Slime"" is an acceptable temporary fix, but eventually the tires must be replaced.  After struggling for years with vices/pry bars, I guess I was hoping for more with the mini tire changer.  Its great for breaking the bead and removal of the old tire, but other than providing a stable platform, isn't much help in mounting new tires; be prepared to resort to multiple pry bars and a lot of effort (I found that the ""bead breaker"" attachment is good at initially securing the bead below the rim while mounting).  Also, anything more substantial than a wheel barrow tire isn't going to seal when attempting to pressurize, even with a ratchet strap (DO NOT ignite ether in a small tire to seal).  Save yourself the frustration and use a Slime inner tube (one inch smaller than the rim size diameter reduces the possibility of ""pinch"" damage during the mounting process).",3.0
The best function of this tire changer is the bead breaker.  The mounting dismounting function is cumbersome at best.  A simple pair of flat iron tire tools work just about as easy as this tool.  I ended up using an additional flat iron tire tool to assist starting the old tire off the rim and the new tire on the rim.  The bead breaker does work well breaking tight bead seals.,3.0

"I had a large vertical-shaped dent in my front fender, and with my insurance deductible, I knew I needed a cheaper answer. This dent puller arrived within two weeks (I think amazon should really get it in stock so you can use Prime shipping!), but it came with a huge, thick product catalog from the original company. What a waste of shipping and handling money =(

Anyway, it definitely has a STRONG grip, as long as your dent is the right size. This won't take out little dents. But if they're about the size of a LARGE grapefruit or bigger, it'll work okay. It's not gonna get rid of ever dent and dimple, but it will do what my brother calls a ""40-foot job"" (looks good enough from 40-feet away).",3.0

This item was delivered as promised but is really big and not very useful for pulling smaller dents.  I thought overall it was just OK.,3.0
"I backed my minivan into my gate post and ended up with a large dent (about a foot long) on the side of the van.  At first the dent puller gripped well and pulled the dent out a little (after putting a lot of muscle into it) on either side of the puller.  The dent shrunk to maybe a handswidth, but once the dent was smaller than the dent puller, the dent puller could no longer get a grip on it to pull it out.  I'm not sure if this was because the dent puller couldn't pull out anything smaller than its own circumference, or if it was the odd placement of the remaining dent on the vehicle.  This product made my dent a little smaller, but the dent will still need to be professionally repaired.  That said, it's been months and we still haven't repaired the dent, so maybe the reduction in size of the dent made us more comfortable with delaying professional repair.",3.0
Bought for a autobody man in training. He thought there would be some used for it.,3.0
"This item is quality built and provides a strong suction but it did not pull the dent from my car.
I thought the dent would be a perfect candidate for this puller as it was large, shallow and not creased.
For the price it was worth the shot over what a body shop might have charged for the same procedure.
Now I am left with an item that will be excellent for picking up sheet metal which is probably its intended use, but that is ok.
I give it three stars because I believe the item description should be modified to more accurately describe the pullers purpose, though five stars for its quality.",3.0
"The dent needs to be big for this to work at all, like one made by a kick on a car door.

"Before buying this, I was using tarps to cover my vehicle and keep it clean as I was restoring it. I assumed a true car cover would come with loop holes to fasten with bungees or something beneath the car to keep it in place. All this was, besides being too big for the car (actually I didn't mind this, I think I was sent the wrong size anyway) it was only a giant scratchy sheet with an elastic around the bottom; something that would not stand up well to New England weather/wind/storms. So with a little improvising, and after losing it once in the wind, I ended up cutting some holes in the sides of it and fastening the cover in the same way I had the tarps.

This is a VERY lightweight car cover-think those little paper booties you put over your shoes at an open house.  It is obviously stronger than those but that is what I was reminded of.  I bought this to cover my 2004 Ford Expedition while the vehicle sits in a garage over the winter.  Other people will have access to the garage so I wanted to protect the finish from scratches and scrapes and also to limit visibility inside the vehicle since I will also be storing items inside.

"Two years ago, I bought what I thought was a good car cover for the price-I still believe it is for a short term situation.

I had to degrade my original 4 stars to a 3 star because for the price, it lasted longer than I expected in the Cali sunlight and occasional wind. It never started tearing until it began to flake and rot due to the sun. Now, I am going to have to remove it and replace it with another one because like I said, 2 years of protection for the budget like friendly  price paid is a good deal. Not a 5 star by any means but a 4 for the first year and a half and then down to a 3 after the second year based on value and priced paid.

"This item is NOT sized properly. Following the guide lines from seller. I purchased the size indicated for my Taurus. I purchased first cover locally.

"Feels like the fabric on cloth grocery bags.  I wish there was a front and back stamping on it as it gets confusing which side goes on which.  Maybe some reflective tape can be sewn in as I am always worried that my neighbors may sideswipe my car at night.  I don't have help to put this on, so a built in strap to make it easier to reach the ends (especially on the back of my SUV) would be helpful.",3.0

"This item is rated at 3000 lbs.  At 2000 lbs the roll bar bends sufficiently to hit the top of the lip of the tailgate to prevent rolling of the load.  The leverage is also not there on heavy loads to utilize its functionality. With a load of around 1000 lbs this product works extremely well.  With effort, the load comes off quickly.  Very handy if you are dropping off a load at the dump and don't want to spend an eternity there unloading your full-size pickup truck bed.  However, if you intention is to unload a ton of gravel with this, rent a dump trailer instead.",3.0
Works well But you must have a bed liner so That the tarp can slide. Could not crank out mulch on the bed alone.,3.0
It makes the pastic/vinyl windsreen on my center console look better but it did not live up to many of the rave reviews I read. I'm still cleaning and polishing with it but it takes a lot of elbow gease.,3.0

"The first time I applied on the stereo clear & black plastic case, it was shiny. It looked clear and oxidation seem to be gone. But days later, was back with white oxidation spots. I also used it for the Treadmill console & it worked ok. It gave it some shine and the spots from the big spray was almost gone. I have to re-apply to get the oxidation to disappear again but if it comes back. Then not worth re-applying. Works on some plastics but not all. I think it also depends on how old your plastic is.",3.0
"Its alright, it kinda fits. Definitely not very good at repelling water. Rained today with it on and the water leaks through the material and the car gets wet.",3.0

"Researched this cover on Amazon, and due to reviews and sizing information, purchased the U1 size as recommended. Received the cover today, and tried to install it on my Chevrolet Equinox. This particular cover is NOT a good fit for my 2013. When I attempted to wrap the front & rear of the cover completely under the bumpers, the fit was much too tight on the front of the hood, over the rear window wiper arm, and over both rear tail lights. The cover was so tight, that I was concerned not only for the finish of the car, but that it wouldn't be long before the cover tore due to the tightness (and yes, I did fold in the side mirrors prior to installing). Also, one of the plastic grommets used to tie the cover beneath the car was missing from the hole, and 2 pieces were ultimately located, with the retaining ring piece being cracked so that the grommet will not stay in place.

Due to the sizing problem, I checked the specs on the Equinox and found that it is listed as 187.8 inches in length. So ... it would make sense that a cover designed for up to 186 inches shouldn't fit, especially when trying to wrap it fully under the bumpers/air dam. If I were to purchase another Budge cover for this car, which I won't, I would purchase the next size larger, even though many sites recommend the U1.

The quality of the cover material is very good (better than I had expected), the elastic hem around the bottom of the cover and the grommet areas are well sewn, and except for the broken plastic grommet and the sizing for my car, I would recommend it very highly.

However I will now be researching other covers ... fortunately this cover was well enough priced that I am not going to bother to return it ... will probably give it to Goodwill.",3.0
"Tears easily, transparent when wet, but does an acceptable job for the price.",3.0
"Works well for small loads; they say it's rated for 3000 pounds but that must be some ideal lab test because I have to shovel about 1/2 my loads of compost or sand out before it will go, and I bent the handle cranking on it!  I have a box for my truck that holds 8 yards of chips so it doesn't touch that until it is mostly gone.  You could just get smaller loads and it would work, but that doesn't make a lot of sense...  Nonetheless it is helpful for the leftover amount (hardest part to shovel) and it is beautiful when it does work.",3.0
"Used this product several times to unload leaves and cut grass.  Recently I needed it to unload 2700lbs. of top soil.  The bar was bowing but manufacturer claims 3000lbs, so I kept cranking with difficulty.  Should have known better, tail gate bracket broke in half firing it like a canon ball just missing my head.  So stick to light loads and be careful at full capacity, what ever that weight is.",3.0
It's not waterproof and not that easy to set it up.,3.0
"Seems like it will do the job as an indoor car cover, however, I was shocked at how rough the material is. Im beyond surprised that a company that's been around for so long would produce a fabric that is so rough it feels like it will scratch my paint. This is not my first Budge Lite....the last one I bought was years ago and don't recall it being so coarse.",3.0
"little loose,  next time I would go for a more sturdy cover",3.0
"First treatment is good, but then after several rainstorms it looses its effectiveness.  I was initially very impressed then disappointed.  Good news is that the bottle will last a long time, bad news is if you live in a cold climate and have to scrape your windshield, forget it.",3.0

"Doesn't cover my 2012 camaro like pictured. It will do, as I only use this cover in a heated garage. I would not use it outside in any type of wind. Some areas exposed but I'm ok with it for $22. I'll just wipe the dust off the front fairing that will develop over winter.

Has a front and rear labeled tag on the inside of the cover which is nice. Will do the job I need it to do. Can't justify spending $150+on a cover, I'd rather buy parts or something fun.",3.0
Smaller then I thought,3.0
its really good... but you have to make a hole for the antenna and also it can tear easily,3.0
"I ordered this cover to protect my car from dust storms, so to that end, it shielded against directly getting sandblasted. It's really thin material, though, and doesn't provide much protection beyond that. I wouldn't recommend this if your looking for proper protection, but if you're just looking for something basic to cover your car, then it's ok. As far as sizing is concerned, I have an '08 Jeep Grand Cherokee and it fit just fine.",3.0
"It's been covering my 1984 Cadillac El Dorado since it arrived about one week ago.  It's about 5 inches too short, but I can live with that.  The hood emblem is already beginning to eat into the fabric.  I plan to line both sides with duct tape to keep the holes from enlarging.  This is only a temporary cover and I got it only to block the sun.  Plan to sell the car and I'll include the cover but if they don't have a garage for the car, I'll recommend a better cover.",3.0

I really have no problem with foreign parts,(other than Mexican,I've had bad luck with their junk) my last inflator was Made In  Taiwan and still works flawlessly after 14 years.

My back window no longer lets water bead up on it keeping the window clear even if I don't use the rear window wiper in my SUV. I originally both it to coat my side mirrors of my CRV to help with fogging and icing and in this department it failed miserably, it was no help in preventing icing or fogging but it does repel water when it rain.",3.0
wore out quickly.  not worth the money,3.0
"Generally I like this gauge/inflator, but as other reviewers noted gauge is slightly off as compared to digital (mine reads 3psi less than digital I use to check, but no worries, once you know haw the gauge compares you can make the adjustment in your mind as you go.",3.0

My antenna does not detach or lower into the car. So right now I am just going by the feel of the material. It would have been nice even if they allowed you to make your own small hole since all cars are different.

"Rain-X worked perfectly fine, but when I received the package the box was sticky on the inside and a third of the liquid was missing.

"As other reviewers have stated it is not waterproof.  I bought it because I had to leave my car under some big messy douglas fir trees for a couple of months while traveling.

"As an inexpensive fair-weather car cover, the Budge B-3 Lite is all right. But not great. I go through one of these covers every half-year with my Suzuki Aerio GS sedan. That's removing and re-installing it each day. The elastic around the circumference gives out in 2-3 months time. Then the cover flutters and balloons until I make it snug again by gathering together the front and the rear sections, then securing them with shoestrings. Tacky looking but it works.

Also, important to note that the Budge Lite covers are not waterproof.

I park my car under trees that are always dropping leaves and pine needles and seeds. The birds do their part, too. Luckily the cover is washable and can be tumble-dried safely at a moderately warm setting. And I use a coated cable with a padlock that runs underneath the car and attaches to either side of the cover via plastic eyelets.

By contrast, the ""Classic Accessories OverDrive PolyPro I Mid Size Sedan Car Cover"" does not fit the Aerio, though it says it does.  It leaves very high gaps on both sides of the car.",3.0
We have had other car covers that were much thicker.  It's intended use  is to make snow removal easier as our car sits outside in the winter.

"Its probably good for the price, but it is NOT water proof, not by a long shot.

Beware, if it gets wet, take it off and dry car and dry cover, stagnate moisture can harm paint. P.S the cloth is thin, a 5 year old kid can Hulk Hogan style tear this material, almost paper like.

After reading about the return policy online, I decided to ship my cover back to Budge for repair.  Within two weeks of sending my cover, I received a new one in the mail, free of charge.  Yes, the first one disintegrated but the nice people at Budge decided to replace it for free.  I upped my review to 3/5 stars as companies don't seem to do this a lot anymore, and its honorable that Budge still cares about customer service.

After only 5 months of use in Los Angeles, I returned home to my Jeep Patriot, still covered with the budge protector. As I went to take the cover off, it literately disintegrated in my hands.  I had a hard time getting the cover off my vehicle because it began breaking apart as it was being taken off.  I understand this wasn't a extremely expensive cover to last a lifetime, but I expected it to at least last a couple years through multiple uses.  I give it two stars as it protected my car while I was gone, but did not last as expected.",3.0
The design and fit are good for my Subaru Forester but the material is no better than flimsy and the antenna hole patch is too small to be at all useful.,3.0
"The cover allows breathing. You'll get some moisture, but moisture will evaporate. Trapped moisture is not good for your paint under a hot sun and a waterproof coating could be trouble. This cover's material weakens after 6 months in southern heat and begins to tear like paper.",3.0

"I got this cover because I park my 2003 VW Passat in my driveway and it gets dusty pretty fast. Aside from that, leaves from neighbors' trees get in the trim of the windows, doors and windshield. I also see a lot of yellow spots...until now I don't know if it's from tree pollen or bird poop. I would have liked a waterproof cover but the price is outrageous so I settled for this one. During the rainy season I plan to just keep the car uncovered.

I did not know there was a marking on the front end of the cover which says ""Front."" So after taking it out of the box, lay it out first inside your house to locate the marking. That simple step will make life easier. There's a string included in the bag but I did not even use it because the elastic hem was enough to keep the cover firmly in place. We had a really windy night right after I put the cover on but the next morning the cover was still there.

***UPDATE: 08/15/2013: I really liked how this cover fits on my car but sadly, after only 1 month I began noticing a significant thinning of the material. Eventually, it started shedding powdery lint. The last straw was when it ripped on several spots on the roof area while I was putting it back on the car. I emailed Budge customer service and they were very helpful. I was instructed to send in my invoice along with a cutout of the label/tag. In less than 2 weeks I got the replacement.

"My bike rack manufacturer asks too much money for a tow hitch lock. I read people purchasing tire lug nut locks and modifying the bolt with a longer one. The inside of the lock is concave to fit a lug nut. I had to flatten it out by installing it and tightening down the entire way. This then meant that I had to grind down the perimeter to get it to fit inside the top, outer shell. This took a little doing but fortunately I have a bench grinder. Once modified, everything fit perfectly and my bike rack is safely locked.

Three stars only because it does work but I think the mechanism inside, that you cannot see from the photo, could be manufactured much beefier in the tradition of Master Lock. This is not it. It looks a bit cheap inside and hit just right with a one good sledgehammer shot and that thing is gonna break for sure! Also, why no plastic keyhole cover? It is going to pick up road grime wherever it is used. What would that have cost to make, a nickel?",3.0
ok for price,3.0
Seems well made enough.  But it will not tolerate much of the threaded stud protruding above the nut.  Will not work with my spare tire mount because of that.  Need to think through options to accommodate the limitiations.,3.0
"works but requires frequent application, or at least your fore-knowledge of the weather. otherwise, it does wear off even if it doesn't rain. the major problem with the product is not the science behind it, but that you have to be diligent about frequent re-application.",3.0
works well for using on boat trailer spare tire,3.0
It's a funnel,3.0
"Like others have said, kind of cheap material and I have to drill the hole bigger for the bolt to go through the hole, but better than nothing!",3.0
"Wipers were working well, but I thought this would make us require the wipers less frequently.  Does a good job of sheeting off the rain, but our wipers started jumping.  Maybe works better with certain wiper brands.",3.0
"I've always loved Rain X, but I can never get it to last more than a week or two before the effects wear off.",3.0
"Here is a lock that doesn't really lock anything. It's only a visual deterrent. You can't use a lug wrench, but if you have an adjustable wrench, you can unscrew the whole assembly. I altered the product by welding a finger on the underside that goes into the hole in the center of the rim. Now it's secure. See attached photos.",3.0
"A little loose, but a few washers make it work better.",3.0
NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT- EXPENSIVE AS WELL,3.0
It is fine but not needed.  Just pour the fuel; funnel not necessary.,3.0
Kind of small and hard to work with.,3.0
"I thought I would not have to wipe this stuff off. It requires removing the ""dried phase"". As such, it wasn't anything special!",3.0
Met my expectation.,3.0
tough to buff out,3.0
did not hold tight with the wheel you have enough space to push a pry bar between wheel and lock. will not recommend,3.0
"too short for transmission fluid, you can get a better one for the same price at autozone, but its ok",3.0
"Used on my RV seemed to be okay. Don't know if there is anything better.
Hoping to get a better shine.",3.0
"Measure your lugs BEFORE purchasing.  It wouldn't fit, but I used it on the license plate so not a waste.",3.0
"This is definitely smaller than I imagined. It seems to be good quality however. The reason for the 3 stars is because while walking through Walmart yesterday I saw a funnel just like this but with a bigger opening. I feel like you'd still have to be very careful pouring anything heavy (gallon of milk, 5 quarts of oil, etc.) into this as the opening/top is kind of small.",3.0
"It was smaller than I thought in diameter, which will make it more difficult to use without spilling.",3.0
It serves it purpose but is cheap plastic and the bowls are smaller than I expected. If you have a dog over 40lbs buy the next size up.,3.0
This wax is the best product I've ever used on boat fiberglass. Highly recommend this wax to those who want to keep the shine on boat fiberglass.,3.0
"Initially I looked for a different brand of this type of lock I have used for years but it no longer seems to be available as it fit my trailers well.  Be aware on this Master Lock version that the hole in the outer cover that slides over the lug nut stud is 3/8"" diameter.  I had to drill it out to 1/2"" to work on my trailers.",3.0
"recommended to go with oil change items -- not as big as it looks. they are tiny, we could not use them for changing our oil",3.0
I have used a few different metal polishes and this one works well but not the best! It is a good product!,3.0
"OK,, but did not work for me",3.0
Item as described but doesn't fit snug,3.0
Works well seems a bit flimsy but worked out well.,3.0
"Very tough to get off after Applying it with a DA buffer.

Seemed to work. Used it twice. Was tired of getting the product off the surface of the boat. So I use there pure wax from same company. Easier to wipe off when dry to haze.",3.0
Good,3.0
Funnel just as described I had one previously. Disappointed it was shipped in a soft envelope and had been crushed during shipment. It is usable but has white fold lines in the blue plastic where it had been crushed. Disappointed!!,3.0
"A bit Overpriced, and very small.
Buyer Beware fits here, and I dropped the ball. I have seen these in a few places(stores) for half this price...",3.0
"Used this once on my TTs. never had 2 use it again, but still have it.",3.0
The lock is a little flimsy. It wobbles back and forth. Someone could easily force it off;,3.0
"It's small. When pouring something through it like Gasoline, I need to be careful to not pour too quickly or it will over flow. It does the job but I need to take my time to do it.",3.0
barely did anything.,3.0
"The lip is somewhat small. It's just fine for using to pour automotive additives from small bottles or cans. And probably will catch gas from a small 2.0 or 2.5 gallon gas can with no issues, but not from a large 5 gallon can. I mean, it will take it from a 5 gallon, but chances you are going to splash it all over the place and then get bent out of shape. It will hold itself in your gas tank's fuel line, but I would still steady it with your other free hand. Have fun kids!",3.0
"You'd be surprised how hard it is to put oil in a portable inverter generator without something long and narrow like this. Short and wide funnels just don't work. Works well for draining the oil too. Put the gen up higher than your oil container, hold the wide end (might want to snip off the small hanger hole with some scissor first) up under the oil filler hole and tilt the gen. The oil funnels nicely into a small opening container such as a milk jug that you can cap off.",3.0
had to drill out hole to fit stud and found metal weak. I guess it would detour thief who wasn't trying  real hard..,3.0
"I needed to drill this out to fit the spare tire mount which wasn't too much of a big deal.
I leave this in the toolkit unless we're going for a dayhike or trip around town when I'm RVing.

A prybar should quickly defeat this but if you have multiple layers of protection for your belongings this just helps",3.0
"I like this lock, however I had to drill the hole to make it fit the lug bolt. Drilling the hole marred the finish, making it less attractive. I do like the security of the lock, however the consumer should not have to modify the lock to make it fit.",3.0
"This lock does not fit on any wheel that has a curved surface near the lug bolt.  There was nothing in the description that stated this.  It is good quality, just not useful in the application for which it was purchased.",3.0
"This is ok and it works, I just have no idea how it works for a spare tire rack. There is no lug nut to attach it to.  Worst 7 dollars I have spent in a long while.",3.0
"Didn't remove the fine fogging on my dash screen, what is this good for agan? Says it will remove fine scratches, it didn't in my experience.",3.0
"Smaller funnel than you think you're buying, but still pretty useable. If your hands shake while pouring something, better find a wider mouth funnel....",3.0
Quick delivery. Seems the quality is not that good. Fits loose on spare tire. Had to try different things to make it fit. The lugs were too long and the lock would not go on.,3.0
it works but a little weak don't fit real thight,3.0
price was ok but the quality was questionable.,3.0
"A little flimsy. Does not lock tight, easily pry open with screw driver.",3.0
meh.  it's a funnel.,3.0
Great,3.0
"It works okay but be prepared to spend some time and elbow grease. Did not live up to the rave ""like new results"" of many reviewers.",3.0
not much,3.0
Item seems kinda so-so on design. Giving it a try anyways. Doesn't fit over stud without stud modifications. Transaction was fast and reliable.,3.0
Does the job,3.0
"not as durable as thought, but a deterrent",3.0
"Nice, but good luck getting label off cleanly.  It won't come off without leaving some of the sticky stuff on the funnel - pulling slowly doesn't matter.  See attached picture for idea of what I'm talking about - picture shows condition after using a good amount of packing tape to get most of the sticky stuff off.",3.0
"Not very good quality for a master lock, when you lock it there is a gap in the top that will rattle, l took a piece of foam and put it inside so it wouldn't rattle, but will work.",3.0
Gave it to a friend,3.0
it's ok for short term usage,3.0
"It's a standard funnel, no real savings over one you could get at a store.",3.0
"works fine, i found one at local auto supply for less
don't know what else i can say why make me write more than i need to",3.0
Seams a bit flimsy but might be a enough to stop someone to not mess with it. Had to drill it to fit over studs but not much of a problem.,3.0
kinda small for dumping oil down have to wait until it goes down,3.0
Okay,3.0
good,3.0
It's OK. Did not fit my application. The hole seems kind of small to accommodate many spare tire holders.,3.0
Didn't fit the dimensuobbit said it would for my car,3.0
"Its a funnel, LOL",3.0
"Good device to put fluids in tight spaces on your auto, etc..",3.0
It may OK,3.0
Not empress with this lock.,3.0
"received quick and is what is advertized.  had it on spare tire for 2 months, showing signs of rust spots.  keep it oiled",3.0
"It appears to be good quality and the design is easy to use; however, it does not fit correctly on my 16"" Jeep Liberty wheels, so I can not use. Once installed, there is not enough clearance around the outside perimeter to properly seat the cap, therefore I can not lock :(",3.0
Cheap quality and I think it would be easy for a criminal to break it off if they wanted to. It is a good deterrent though,3.0
Does the trick but guys kind of weird on the lug.,3.0
For the price it offers some security - can be easily removed with a large flat tip screw driver.,3.0
"I'm using this on the spare tire on my boat trailer. lock fits and locks. i just don't see why Master Lock is putting their name on this, the top flops around and can be brought past the back plate allowing a flat head or pry bar to be used to break it. this should stop a opportunist, but if some one wants my tire, they will most likely get it (even if this wasn't flimsy if someone wanted the tire bad enough I'm sure they would find a way)",3.0
As described.,3.0
I wish the top was larger and the bottom was flexable.,3.0
It doesn't retain like the ones GM used in the past. It could be removed without key but would take some time.,3.0
I paid less than $5 including shipping for this so with that in mind it's good value.  However it is smaller than the picture would suggest.  A coke can wouldn't fit in the top.,3.0
Good size for small opening on my generator for oil.,3.0
The funnel was as advertised and the delivery was prompt.,3.0
"The lock is not hard enough, but if seen may be an useful deterrent of theft.",3.0
It worked well to hide the bolt on a spare tire.,3.0
"Overpriced for an 8"" plastic funnel!",3.0
"OK lock, but quality could be better. This version is much more sloppy when in place than the old one I bought 25 years ago.",3.0
Purchased this and the Chrome Cone Wheel lock because I didn't know what would be better.  The Chrome Chrome Wheel Lock work so well that I didn't attempt to use the Master Lock.... anyone want to purchase an extra Tire lock?,3.0
Great chocks.  A bit to heavy to store in the plane.,3.0
Does not fit all tires to lock. It depends on the size of your bolt.,3.0
works as promised,3.0
Kind of cheap but I guess it will keep an honest person honest,3.0
"Flimsy, but it's alright.",3.0
small,3.0
"OK, I guess. I wish the top was wider though. Still good for tight spots. At today's diesel and gasoline prices, every drop counts.",3.0
A bit on the light side unfortunately,3.0
O.K. with product. What I expected.,3.0
"Did not work with my standard lug nut.... Went to Lowes, bought a standard nut.  works now.

Like the Idea of this. Could use a bit of modification.",3.0
Not really impressed but it does the job.,3.0
Serves it's purpose.  It's a bit slow flowing for filling a gas tank from a can but works well for everything else.,3.0
"It's a funnel....... soooooo....... yea.  I used it, then recycled it, because I didn't want to put back in my car.",3.0
It made it easy to gut oil in.,3.0
good,3.0
Way to big for what I needed it for but I can use it for something else,3.0
"It's a funnel.  It's a couple of cones with an extra conic section thrown in for good measure. It does funnel things.  It doesn't do non-funnel things.  It's made of plastic so it's impermeable.  You can turn it over, strap it to your dog, and pretend your dog is a unicorn.

Seriously, what else can you ask for from a funnel?

Maybe a screen or filter?  Well this one doesn't have those sorts of ""high-end"" ""fancy"" features like some of those other highfalutin' cones.  But it does have an extra wide opening with an obvious place to catch your pour so us sloppy proles will keep our messes to ourselves.

I use mine for oil changes.  Using a funnel is a great no-mess way to get that slippery stuff into your engine and nowhere else.",3.0
the threaded stem on your spare tire mount may be a little long for this product. the housing is shallow.,3.0
I had trouble placing the lock on with the center hub cover on.  I had to loosen the lug nut that holds the tire on the mounting bracket enough to get the lock on then had difficulty getting the lock to latch on to the base plate of the lock.,3.0
"I'm really not too impressed with the design of this locking system, but it would deter some thieves who are looking for a quick snatch",3.0
"Looks like it should work, but did not fit the spare tire on my camper!  It is in my tool box should I find a use for it.",3.0

"The elastic strin g inside the cover broke during installation. Still used the cover, but had to use a strap to secure it on the tire.",3.0
"I was going to use this for a Duromax mx4500jE generator.  It turns out that the Duromax
comes with a funnel that fits better than this one.",3.0
It fits good. Great value.,3.0
"This fits very tightly on my 13"" boat wheel.  There is NO drawstring as others mentioned, just elastic.
Just a FYI. I bought an extra one to go on my trailer tire not realizing these covers are not ""split"" to allow installation on a tire that is mounted.  So it is for SPARE TIRES only.  I should have bought the:
ADCO 3973 Black #3 Vinyl Ultra Tyre Gard Wheel Cover  that I already purchased for another trailer for that purpose.",3.0
I have only just installed this device so I can't really give a particular review.  The idea is good and the manufacturer is top notch.,3.0
"This inexpensive funnel is pretty handy for certain jobs.  I use mine for fuel additives such as Seafoam, which is a good product but the container is difficult to pour into most car/truck fuel tanks.  A nice little funnel for the price.",3.0
"Fit well, pretty easy to put on and take off.  Used with Fulton Heavy Duty Spare Tire Carrier.

Metal cover seems a little thin - will have to seem how it holds up to Florida weather.",3.0
"Easy to install and very effective. My neighbor steals stuff and this lock put the end to his game, my baseball bat assisted.",3.0
Tried putting this on my 2007 FJ's spare and it didn't fit. Additionally it seems pretty flimsy. I'm pretty sure I could get it off with a hammer and screwdriver no problem. I suggest looking for something else.,3.0
"I am using the lock on the nut holding the case over my spare tire.  It fits with no problem, but, I can see that it would take very little to break it off.  It does provide some protection and for that, I will leave it on.",3.0
"Strong and well made item for the money. I had to use 2 flat washers (each 3/32"" thick) to enable me to use it on my 2005 Jeep Liberty as the Jeep center cap on the spare wheel prevented the outer casing of the lock from inserting all the way down so that the key could be turned. No big deal, still a good buy!",3.0
"The material doesn't seem to be as resistant as others but, in my opinion it's according to the price, you may need some kind of rubber or seal, because if you just put it, the screw and the lock produce a noise on road that might be a little annoying.",3.0
"Do not loose the keys. This Master Lock double sided key blank is not generally available at hardware stores and locksmiths, at lease in my area, Cleveland, OH.",3.0
"A good funnel, I ordered it because I thought spout could be bent and it would have a bigger funnel.",3.0
My purchase of an excellent gas can alleviates the need for this funnel. It isn't easy to keep track of when I travel.,3.0
"NOTE SIZE OF THIS FUNNEL BEFORE PURCHASING!
it's not for pouring more than say a quart of something into your car gas tank, a gallon would take many minutes and
 wear your arm off..",3.0
"Approximation 2.5-inch diameter top, 5-inch long, 1/2-inch tip. No size listed or comparison reference scale.  Over-priced in my opinion.  Buy at you local store. No price savings here other than saving yourself a trip to the store.",3.0
It's OK...I just wish it was flexible. Other than that is good for what it is. Came in handy during times of need.,3.0
Not as good as 3M products.  Sorry.,3.0
"This is a product to have on your garage. The price is a little high, but is something to have.",3.0
"It arrived as promised looks like the picture.  But, I must not have read well because it is smaller than I hoped.  Hence just the three stars.",3.0
The dimensions of this funnel (length) should be in the description.  It works well to some extent for putting gas into the filler tube on a vehicle...but since the top is so small you would need to pour very slowly to get much gas in.  Probably not worth $4.,3.0
"Dont go by the picture. The stem looks long and slender when
in fact its pretty fat (1/2"")at the tip and only 5"" long. I purchased 2
of them and their useless for my needs. Too cheap to send back. Bad move!",3.0
What can I say? It's a funnel. It works like it's supposed too but is kind of expensive for the quality and what it's for. You can get a similar product locally for about a buck.,3.0
"Nice product, but after putting it on my RAM 2500 I didn't like 2 things: first, the red clashed with the blue truck, I didn't realize it until it was actually installed; second, the emblem is big enough to touch the chrome bumper, so I'm worried about it chafing.
I ended up taking it off.",3.0
"The crome shield is metal. The ""slider"" is PLASTIC. I may have missed that in the description.  Had I known before hand I probably would not have purchased. Seems pretty flimsy to me. Im fully expecting to see this $20 skittering down the road or broken off at the car wash. Hopefully I can mount the shield to a steel slider before it is ruined or lost.",3.0

I ended up buying two Tru-Ryde double lipped seals from another supplier.  Much better quality and they have a ""garter spring"" that keeps the seals tight against the axle.

"I've used Fram oil filters the better part of 40 years and in the olden days they were top quality and used in industry. Today Fram doesn't even make filters, they're contracted out and you know what that means. If you read various blogs, reviews and reports about dissected oil filters of all makes Fram is the one to stay clear of. Just recently I had personal experience with a PH8A Fram Extra Guard with 1,021 miles on it. The engine bearings were making ""loose"" noises on startup in the morning. It seems that anti-drainback valve failure is a common problem with these and also plugging to the point that the pressure relief valve opens and allows unfiltered oil through the engine. There have been reports of the filter media detaching and plugging the oil passage completely so there's no lubrication at all. Take it with a grain of salt but you really ought to read the reviews and comments of others that have had problems with Fram filters. One of the top replies to questions about engine noises is ""are you using a Fram filter?"" I will say one good thing about it, it kept the oil very clean for 1k miles but that filter was very heavy when I removed it and possibly bypassing so be aware.",3.0
It works I was just so confused when I let it out of the container it dried like cardboard. But defiantly absorbs a lot of water.,3.0
It's been working so far but this charger is really really cheesy.  It seems cheap and flimsy but it is doing it's job so far.  I don't expect this to make it over a year but I'm purely speculating.  The price is reflected in this though.,3.0

"Use on our truck that sits outside more then its driven :(
Auto so there is not a worry about over charging.
Just wish that the leads were longer, both for the a/c cord and the battery leads.
Ended up extending the battery leads only due to the a/c lead being so short and wanted the plug accessible thru the grill so that I did not have to leave the hood open for an extension cord.
This is mainly do to where I wanted the unit for placement in the truck.
Thank you",3.0

"I ordered and installed on my pontoon last August.  Worked fine until this February.  Contacted Schumacher about warranty service.  Had to pay $6 of MY money to ship it back to them for examination.  They found it defective and sent me a new unit.  Took about a month.  My beef is that I, the customer, should not be out any expense when it was their product that failed.  I was hoping for a check in the box with the new charger to repay me.  No such luck.",3.0
"It's not a real Chamois since it is made with PVA. It does soak up rather nicely and is very smooth so it won't cause streaks unless you get it dirty. Overall it's okay, nothing special. I bought mine, I see a lot of the reviews are from people that got this product free. It's not nearly as good as the star rating would make you believe, but it is adequate.",3.0

"I have five of the chargers which are used on motorcycles, mowers,  and other occasionally used vehicles.  Schumacher has changed the design of this product. The last one that I bought was the older design.  It failed after only 6 months.  I sent it back after calling Schumacher Customer Service.  It was replaced with another similar charger.  The difference was that the new one weighed only a few ounces compared to the nearly 1 pound weight of the older model.  I am not an engineer,  but the new charger seems to be totally solid-state.  It has been working OK for a month now.  I'm hoping it will provide the trouble-free service I got from the 1st one I bought.",3.0
"Between this, microfiber towels, or even the more traditional chamois, I can't say that this does any better or worse. It claims to dry anything ""faster"" but that's not my experience. I will continue to use it but it's just one more thing that serves only one purpose. In the future, I'm just going to stick with microfiber towels because then at least they have multiple purposes.",3.0
"Didn't notice anything great about this product, but nothing negative either. Heard some good reviews from other people so I decided to give it a try. It's okay.",3.0
"Works however if you are using this product to clean wax or dirty off of vinyl or plastic pieces, you will have to use a toothbrush to actually get it off. I have tried it with all types of rags, microfiber clothes, and towels. Nothing seems to get it out. I had to also use this product multiple times on the same area to get wax out. The wax was very small and thin but nothing worked until I used a tooth brush on the plastic trim",3.0
I bought this product thinking it help me get out the wax on the plastic trim of my truck. It did get some of it out with a lot of labor. For the amount of time I probably could have used a product from Walmart or a local parts store. But I was reading forums and they all recommended it.,3.0
Excellent,3.0
"I purchased this hoping for a chemical solution for removing wax residue from black plastic trim. I didn't notice any improvement after two applications and scrubbing with a toothbrush on satin-textured black plastic. The stains are approximately 6 months old (new car) and I applied the product generously and scrubbed a 1' x 3"" area for about 5 minutes before wiping the excess product off with a towel.

This stuff is great for cleaning the rest of the trim, the finish is superb, it just doesn't seem to affect the wax.

I called Meguiar's customer care line on the back of the bottle and asked the guy that answered if the product was appropriate for removing wax residue. His response, which sounded more like a question, began with: ""Uhm--yeah--I think so. Yeah, it's a cleaner, it should remove wax residue."" That wasn't a confidence inspiring response, so my hopes that I was merely using the product improperly were dashed. I suppose I'm going to pick up some pink erasers.",3.0
"Works OK, was expecting a little bit more. I have an older bass boat with a black stearing wheel and dashboard. Although it improved the appearance somewhat it is certainly far from bringing it back to ""like new"" condition....even after several attempts.",3.0
After reading all of the positive reviews I was hoping that this product would do a better job at cleaning my boat interior than the Spray Nine that I currently use. It just wasn't so. Although this does clean the vinyl fairly decently it took a lot of elbow grease and well in my opinion Spray Nine does as good if not better of a job for about half the price.,3.0
I bought this to keep my truck battery charges because the truck sits for weeks at a time between uses.  I am still trying to figure out how to hook it up to a standard truck battery since the leads on the battery tender are made for marine style battery lugs with the wing nut connections.  Hopefully it will work fine once I get it hooked in.,3.0
"We got a new car that is black, wanted a chamis specifically for this car.  This might be fine for a lot of things, which I have not tried yet. But it does not dry a car like the real thing. It is no longer with the car washing items.  It does feel like one when its wet, it just doesnt work like one, on a car.",3.0
We used this to clean the vinyl seats on our pontoon.  Some of the scuffs were black but it didn't clean it up just lightened up the scuffs.  Need more elbow grease but I ran out.  It did help with the cleaning but not what I thought it would do.  I was hoping it would remove scuffs marks a lot more easily.  Still looking for a good product to clean with.,3.0
It was alright,3.0
"Didn't exactly work by itself. I sprayed it on, scrubbed it in, sprayed some more waited and there was an improvement but not any better than a cleaner degreaser like citrus orange cleaner or whatever. My boat seats are light tan and in good shape. The reason I bought this was I thought it would work better to brighten up the vinyl as it is formulated for cleaning vinyl as opposed to other cleaners. It smells the same as other much cheaper vinyl cleaners I have used for much less money and does about the same thing.
Not bad, but it isn't as easy as spray, wipe and all clean.",3.0
"I bolted it on under my seat on my quad, i keep my seat off when using so as not to blow anything up, i only use when my winch for plow is running slow, so i cant say i love it or anything but is noisy which they say is normal. Works fine so far",3.0

The Schumacher & the Sears chargers look the same in every way EXCEPT for the brand sticker.
Ive had both (2) so called different brands to stop working (with-in 5-10years) but still have a 3rd charger that is still working(in-which was my newest).
I had 2 permanently mounted, 1 in my boat, 1 on my lawnmower & the 3rd one I made removable from my jet-ski.
Over time things I noticed was;
1)one half of the plastic had cracked in half on the one on my lawnmower.
The green LED was on & the red LED would just flash & not charge.
2)the green LED stayed on but would not charge (no steady red light) on the one in my boat.

Normally on any trickle/maintainer charger Ive used (about 10 or so yrs).
Ill leave them hooked up through the cold months (at least 6mths per year),
After a couple of years Id top the fluid back off on the battery that I was charging.

Ive been using the Stanley BC209 (black case) trickle charger since 2012 (now2015).
I like the flashing LED when its charging battery &
a solid light when battery is charged.
This unit is very versatile with its 3 outputs & 3 mounting options.

When the (110/120v) power is dropped out on this charger, the green LED will still stay lit up (its using the power of the battery that its connected to), So keep check on this chargers power (110/120v) supply.
(A timer doesn't work well on this charger to this)

"From page 12 of the instruction manual:
""However, if you were to use this battery charger to charge a large battery, such as a marine deep cycle battery, that was not fully charged, you may lose some of the battery's capacity. This would cause the large battery to be unable to hold a charge and become useless. Therefore, we do not recommend charging a large battery with this unit.""

The charger makes a loud buzz or hum caused by the transformer laminations vibrating.

Have to use with an Astroflight Whattmeter used on charging the batteries on electric models to check the charging status, current and voltage.

A timer was used to turn on the charger for four hours in the morning and four hours at night to conserve electricity.",3.0
Works ok.,3.0
got hard as a rock after one use. Now takes I have to soak it to use again,3.0
"This is the second one of these that I own. I had installed the first one on a Suzuki Forenza 2005 - no problem finding a place to mount it.

The second one was for my Chevy S10 Ext cab pickup truck. That has a V6 engine with almost no extra room under the hood to mount even this small charger near the battery. I ended up locating it near the under hood fuse panel. I mounted it using one of the screws that hold down the air filter cover. I also connected the wires to the positive + wire that comes from the battery - that is on the fuse panel. The ground or black wire I connected to another wire jumper terminal that is attached to the frame & is used to connect to the hood - to be grounded.

So far so good. My S10 is not used for 4-5 months at a time, as it's garaged in our second home down in Florida. I have a guy take it out for a ride around the block a few times so the wheel bearings get some rotation and the tires do get flat spots.

The battery is a maintenance free type, no water fill caps. I'll follow up with results the next time I go back to use the vehicle, or if my guy tells me the car didn't start.",3.0
as expected,3.0
"I've used this unit for about a month with pretty good results.  Does keep the battery up, although the cranking power is a little low in extreme cold.  But it does start everytime.  I use it on a compact utility tractor that is outside covered only by a tarp.",3.0
"It charges batteries fine, but is very noisy (they usually are).  The pictures are a bit misleading in that the battery leads are not removable as they are shown in the second picture.  Be careful with this, I dropped mine from just a couple feet and it cracked the case all the way round.
Another big con, this charger is very inefficient.  It uses a lot of power in its standby mode.
Bottom line, this charger is too heavy and power hungry for small applications, but too weak for car batteries.  This would be good for a 12V motorcycle, but don't expect to carry the charger on the bike comfortably.",3.0
"The wax is easy to apply (hence the spray bottle). It is also easy to wipe off.

The nice smell it has is really noticeable, but not disturbing.

Applied it during the summer time to a boat which was waxed professionally at the beginning of the season. There was no additional shine noticed.",3.0
"It seems to be a good product, I've on used it one time, but it was good enough for me to order more.",3.0
"Not exactly professional grade, in terms of size or quality (application-wise) but gets the job done- after a few uses anyway (needs to be ""worn in"").

I chose this chamois because it has the highest rating on Amazon.

I'm slightly disappointed, but only because I've used professional, commercial grade chamois before (auto detailing exp). This will defineitely tend to grip and tug on the car's surface, especially if you have a less than fantastically clean and non-faded-out clear coat; just say'n.

On an up note, performance does does improve after a few uses, becoming less grippy. Looking back this could of been more quickly accomplished by letting the chamois sit in a bucket of soft water.

In final say, given my exp w/ chamois, I'd say this rates in at a decent 3.8",3.0
"I was really excited about this product when I ordered it, but when I used it to dry my car, it didn't really do that great of a job. I followed the instructions to the tee, but it for sure didn't do what it advertised, which was a completely dry/streak free car with one wipe. Yes this product is pretty good because it absorbs water like crazy, but it still left some streaks around on my car that I had to take a microfiber towel to polish up.",3.0
"I use this product to clean the counters of my bathroom, and it does an OK job at it. This towel gets REALLY dried up after wiping. So dry it becomes flaky and tears at some points. I think it would help to keep it in the container, but it just tears and gets scratchy when you air dry it.",3.0

"Totally like the box and its purpose. It keeps the grease from the balls from getting on everything in the truck box or the back seat storage area of your truck, 3 stars only because I just wish the top locked on better then this does. its come loose as i was putting it away a few times and dropped it on the ground. Although it didn't break it did cause a mess of dirt to be cleaned off the grease. Good thing it didn't fall on the carpet in my back seat that would have been a mess. Still recommend it if you own a Convert-A-Ball kit.",3.0
"It holds the balls fine, but the lid doesn't want to stay snapped on.  Oh, well.  Don't really need the lid to keep everything organized.  It would just look nicer.",3.0
"Box design to store the balls is great. Quality of the box material is fine.

CONS: Lid will not stay on the box!!! you have to use a heavy rubber band, Velcro wrap. etc. to keep lid and box together",3.0
"I just received this, and it does what it is designed for, storage of the hitch balls. The cover lacks retention, and I expect that if I don't secure it with a strap or rubber-bands, it won't stay in place while hidden under a seat.",3.0
"Excellent concept and design. The execution needs some improvement. A friend of mine who had purchased one before me warned me that his rusted to the point that it was not useable. This is not chromed as most balls are. The part that needs work is the receiver pin that mounts on your receiver stinger. Since it is left to the elements it should be chromed. In lieu of that concern, make sure you order the plastic holder, and the small plastic pin cover. Keep the pin covered with a marine rust preventative. This thing isn't cheap and the only reason that I can assume for this shortcoming is that the inventor lives in Arizona, or some place that it never rains. I live in Oregon so the life expectancy of this unit is cut short.  Trailer balls do not normally require this much attention!",3.0
"The storage box for your convert-a-ball set is a great idea. The base were the balls attach seems to be very good quality, but the cover could be better. It doesn't stay on. It's not a ""snap"" cover (where it would click if you slightly push it down), it's just a ""lay on top"" type. Which for me, only works to a certain extent.

But I think for the next person, it would work just fine!!

Overall quality is GOOD.
BUT the cover could be improved. Especially at the price they charge for it!",3.0
"soaks up lots of water.  HOwever, it leaves some streaks.  Works in one direction only unlike a chamois. Remids me of the things you see at Fairs that one itme soaks ou a whole bottle of cola.  Only works in one direction.",3.0
"This doesn't dry as well as I expected from all the reviews. Perhaps I'm using it incorrectly, but it dries very stiff for me and I have to wet it a little before using it, then it doesn't really pick up all the water. I follow this up with microfiber cloths.",3.0

"I bought this for my new truck.  It definitely absorbs much more water than a standard towel, and the plus side is you can ring it out like a sponge.  However, I used it to dry half of the side of my truck and it was already waterlogged.

It's okay, but I would just use regular towels before buying this again.",3.0

"As stated by lots of other reviewers, it leaves some water behind.  It does a good job of getting most of the water, but there are always tiny water trails left behind. A real chamois gets ALL the water.  But then, a real chamois costs twice as much, so once again, you get what you pay for.

"It is advertised to dry very fast, but I think it has a lot of hype around it.  It does dry the car, but it leaves smaller water trails, which I had to use my waffle weave towel to dry.  Not what I expected.",3.0
"Main intended purpose - car drying. Yes, it does a good job of taking most of the water & a lot of water, but, no, it won't dry completely. I need another MF towel to finish up. It sort of helps if you plan to use the quick dry waxes as they need a bit of wetness. There is a lot of concern about trapped particles scratching the paint. Yes, that is very possible. I have old cars and so don't care much. Buy a MF towel if you are concerned. Meguair's water magnet should be a good choice (cheaper w*mart online & ship to store).",3.0
"I purchased this based on the recommendation of a friend. It works well, and if you are very certain your freshly washed car is free from all debris, you will likely not cause any scratching. However, if you pick up some rogue sand granule or some other debris, you could cause clear coat damage.

After watching an episode of Drive Clean and seeing them use microfiber towels in the same manner, I made the switch. It takes a little longer, but the microfiber towel is marginally safer on your precious paint job and if you're auto obsessed, it may be worth the extra time. The microfiber are also easier to clean, just wash and dry and you are on your way. This thing will get mold unless you let it dry out completely and is a pain to wash by hand. I still use it around the house and it works well, it just no longer gets anywhere near my new car.",3.0
"The product keeps the vinyl seats supple, but it doesn't clean very well.",3.0
Don't why people like this so much.  It's not bad.  I like genuine leather chamois so much better because it doesn't leave streaks on glass windows and it cleans up the water and any leftover dirt on the car better.  This product can get moldy because you have to store it damp in the plastic container it comes with.,3.0

After a while I got frustrated with it and went back to my dependable Chamois King.",3.0
"This dries very well (wipe then wring out until just damp again). My issue is that if there is any dirt left on the surface you're drying, the chamois will pick it up and hold tight onto it. I'm not a super freak when it comes to cleaning my cars but once they've been washed, I'd like to get most of the water off before it spots. This will get the water off but it'll also bring your attention to any dirty spots you missed.",3.0

The envelope had started to rip; I think I received all of the parts.  BTW, you can purchase higher wattage H3 lamps at Amazon or at your local auto parts store but if you do, suggest you feed the lights through a relay.  If you don't want the housing to leak, make sure the drain slot is facing downward.  Also, if the light beam appears to point up, towards the sky, remove the glass lens, rotate it 180 degrees, and re-install it.

"I have an old ""Absorber"" from a few years ago. I ordered new ones to replace it when it wears out. I notice that the new product is not as thick as the older one and does not absorb as much. I also noticed that the price hasn't gone down to reflect less product.",3.0
"OK mirror.  Cheaply made but not terrible.  The main problem is the mirror surface.  It seems to be a very thin film stuck to the plastic mirror mount face.  And it's not smooth on the edges.  It's wavy on the edges which distorts the view a bit.

I actually bought this to mount upside down from the photo on the top of my computer monitor at work.  This keeps my team mates from sneaking up on me with their Nerf guns ;)  I can't say how this mirror would work on a boat or jet ski.",3.0
"The clip is a little wide, and so won't fit many boat window frames without an extra piece of wood or something else to keep it secure.",3.0
Ok. Just wanted something to watch for oncoming boats. Would be too small for towing sports. Clamp is a bad design. Had to modify it to work.,3.0

"Item is sharp looking and very functional.  My only complaint is the plastic logo'ed Bully plastic step surface. The plastic is faded to whitish color from suns UV rays.

"Not the best, the image looks funny like the circus mirrors when looking into it, but for the price you can tell if someone fell off the tub or board.",3.0
Smaller than I would like for safe skiing / towing,3.0
It works but flimsy. The mirror is plastic and the mount is cheap.  It does stay in place pretty well for how flimsy it is. For the price it is OK.  Better to have any rear view mirror on a boat then nothing.,3.0
Not well made but works,3.0
Not what I expects as far as mounting. Very flimsy.,3.0
Works but it is made all from PLASTIC.,3.0
It does a fine job of seeing behind me while I am pulling tubers or skies,3.0
Um ... worked ok was expecting better results probably due to method applied,3.0
Mirror appear to be film not actual glass or plex. Mirror seems durable. Mounting bracket is lame and made from plastic. Will have to get creative to mount it where you want.,3.0
first time out it was fine second time it went south with the tarp. Moral to this storry plan on removing it b-4 you tarp.,3.0
its plastic...but considering how many of these I actually go through on my boat...its a perfect fit.  NOT a good way to see detail behind you...but effective to see where your skiers and tubers are.,3.0
Picture  online  made it look like glass but when I got it the product is cheaper quality plastic. We will see how long it lasts in the az heat,3.0
Cant use right now,3.0
"Easy to install, looks good. It's not an exact fit however. You may need to put something around it to stop the rattle.",3.0
Helped a little but my headlight covers were heavily oxidized and this just couldn't clear the lenses.,3.0
Didnt appear to make a difference,3.0
"only slightly works...used for my radio plastic screen to get some scratches out, only evned out the scratches. used on my headlights and only made a minor difference.",3.0
"Purchased for my 2015 silverado. In my opinion it sticks out to far and looks a little odd or out of place. So, after cutting 1 inch off and drilling an extra set of holes so as to let it slide in an extra inch it looks much nicer. I know 1 inch doesn't sound like much  but it does make a significant amount of difference. Probably could have went even a little further, maybe another 1/4 to 1/2 in but as it is it looks much better IMO.",3.0
"The product itself is great. However, it obstructs two of the back-up sensors. I can't have both and that's disappointing.",3.0
"Works good for the extra step getting in and out of my van.. Doesn't look very ""durable"" as a bumper protector.",3.0
"Coarse grit, suitable for fixing yellowed headlights, but leaves somewhat frosted surface.  To get smooth surface a finer grit (possible two finer grits) would be required.",3.0
Doesn't take long for the shaft to start rusting.  When it does start rusting watch out! The entire shaft is covered in rust to the point where it's not even black.,3.0
Ended up getting better results on a motorcycle windscreen and helmet visor using Meguiar's Ultimate polish with a dual action polisher.,3.0
"Realized after buying this,  a lock-bolt with my hitch serves my problem.",3.0
"It took off some of the yellowing, but you really need the sanding kit with polish to take of the years of oxidation. I would spend the money on the kit rather than this. Meguiar's rarely lets me down so this was a shocker.",3.0
"Excellent concept and design. The execution needs some improvement. A friend of mine who had purchased one before me warned me that his rusted to the point that it was not useable. This is not chromed as most balls are. The part that needs work is the receiver pin that mounts on your receiver stinger. Since it is left to the elements it should be chromed. In consideration of that concern, make sure you order the plastic holder, and the small plastic pin cover. Keep the pin covered with a marine rust preventative. This thing isn't cheap and the only reason that I can assume for this shortcoming is that the inventor lives in Arizona, or some place that it never rains. I live in Oregon so the life expectancy of this unit is cut short.  Trailer balls do not normally require this much attention!",3.0
It's okay.  Only gives me an extra few inches of a step.  Would probably be better with a drop hitch.,3.0
"So it does work, but it falls down frequently. fyi, you can only use the cheap round paper plates with it",3.0
"Nice product, but the plastic cover on both end look cheap",3.0
Its okay,3.0
Did not do the job!,3.0
Doesn't really do much.,3.0
"It does what it is supposed to, acts as a step, or a radiator penetrator when someone is tailgating.  Like others have mentioned I was disappointed to notice that quality of workmanship is definitely lacking, as the product is not square.  The right side sits lower than the left.  But for what I paid, I can't complain too much.  If this one ever gets completely destroyed, I might look at one of the high priced ones like weathertech to see if the quality is any better.",3.0
There was still yellow discoloration on the plastic lenses on the headlights can not get rid of it,3.0
"Should have went with the longer one, If your getting this to cover your ass end,get the wider one. For the money the cr 600 will do just fine for the jeep with 3"" lift.",3.0
Have used for over a year now... Works OK... does not keep lens from oxidizing.,3.0
"After several coats, I'm not seeing a difference in the headlight cover. Maybe it's just too far gone for this stuff to help.",3.0
"The hitch step is not what I expected, the details are not there, it is not a finished product with clean finished details,  but rather put together  poorly and with materials not quite upto part, it will work, but nothing to write home about.",3.0
"I guess you get what you pay for.  The hitch step is a nice looking step and the price was great, however when installed on the truck it does not sit level.  One side is unfortunately higher than the other side by almost a full inch.  An inch doesn't sound like much, but over that short span, you can definitely notice.  Other than that issue, it seems to serve it's purpose.",3.0
"Without a reflector, the standard 1157 bulb isn't that bright. I put in a ""super bright LED,"" but that wasn't much brighter. For the price, it's better than nothing. The wire length was perfect to route through my safety hook and into my 4-pin connector on my F150.",3.0
"These trailer plug caps work alright, but they are both identical.  One fits well on the car side where there's only one exposed plug, but the other only fits loosely on the trailer side where there's 3 exposed plugs because it's not formed to match that side.  These 2-packs of weatherproof plug covers should be molded so one fits the car side and one fits the trailer side.",3.0
"fits a little loose, and sometimes the cover pops off.",3.0
"They seem to be ok,  but time will tell.",3.0
one of the end caps has come loose and lost,3.0
"I bought this to protect the rear of my F350. The backup sensors and other options can be damaged if someone bumps into them. For that purpose this product works well, however it is cheaply made and isn't even welded at a 90 angle to the receiver so it's crooked. I would probably buy a better unit if I was to do it again.",3.0
Not perfect but does the job.,3.0
"Kinda seems a little cheaply made, so we will see how long it lasts",3.0
A good additional brake light for the price. Although built really cheap.,3.0
it is what it is,3.0
"This is incredible price for this well made trailer hitch brake light. I bought this for my wife's new Escape and she loves it. The delivery was very quick and the packaging was perfect. I highly recommend this seller. Does not include bolt or tie wrap to insert through hole to hold in place and the hole is at the end of piece so you must have it stick our from hitch. You can drill a hole to match normal hitch because it would hit lamp wiring. After I plugged it in Escape trailer outlet the right rear sensor went on and wouldn't turn off. The turn signals blinked fast, and other electronics acted odd. Had to remove it. I am sure for other vehicles it is fine, but not a 2017 Ford Escape.",3.0
"It is exactly as pictured but it seems to have a slight ""tilt""  towards the left side.  We have noticed this same ""tilt"" on the same unit on other cars. It is very slight so if you are not a perfectionist, this will do the job.",3.0
"Although it seems like it was clearer while cleaning, it looks the same as before when done and completely dry.",3.0
Don't fit well on plug.,3.0
Works ok with headlights . Nothing special.,3.0
"A little cheaper material, but fits well.",3.0
has three lights. left/brake/right. the right turn does not work. will serve it's purpose. i wanted to protect the trailer connection on the truck from dirt and corrosion.,3.0
removed only part of the haze,3.0
"Good idea but just wouldn't stay on, lost both of mine already.",3.0
"The step looks nice, however, the part that fits into the hitch receiver is somewhat smaller and, as a result, the step rattles around inside the receiver even with the pin in place. the step I received does not sit level in the receiver but rather on an angle downward on the right side. It just does not look right when it is in place.",3.0
"Works, though throws al kind of codes on dash (2015 F150)",3.0
good,3.0
Doesn't fit well,3.0
Exactly as I expected,3.0
"My scooter's cluster/dash has been yellowing/fading a lot from sitting outside in the sun constantly. I'd say I started with a medium amount of yellowing, just to where it was starting to get hard to see the gauges, especially on camera (I record when I ride). I tried some of this product onto gauze pads and scrubbed and it took a lot of the yellow off and made it semi-clear again. It's not super clear like a new bike would be, and it doesn't seem to get any better even if I do it 4 times in a row. I'd say it's very acceptable and a big improvement from where it started, but the yellow starts to come back within a couple weeks, so I have to keep up with it. I gotta admit I get lazy about it... I wish it would last longer.

I tried it on my turn signals which have yellowed really bad, and it doesn't seem to work at all on them for some reason.

In my experience on a scale of 1-5, 5 being like new, it does maybe 3.5 for clearing it up. I averaged it down to 3 stars for the yellowing coming back within weeks.",3.0
"Its not as I expected, you have to work too hard to remove the film to clear the lens. In the end I had no alternative except to use very fine paper and then re-polish, took a lot of time. You need a polishing machine.",3.0
Good but doesn't last as long as I thought,3.0
"A little ""lighter"" than I expected. However, it fits and works perfectly. Jus what an ""old guy"" needs to get into the back of the pickup.",3.0
"Decent product; was hoping/expecting there'd b a ""Male"" and a ""Female"" cap; one for the trailer flat-4 connection, and one for the flat-4 vehicle connector, but the two are identical, so one connector remains unprotected.
Would be nice, and logical, to have a matched pair, no?",3.0
"It works but I can't say I'm pleased.  The hitch pin hole is back about 3-inches.  My receiver's hitch pin hole is only 1.5-inches deep and there is no adjustment on this so it sits out of the receiver too far.  Additionally, the power connector wiring is multiple colors and not covered with anything, so it looks cheap.  A simple black wire wrap would have made this look much nicer.

Not bad overall but be sure to check the depth of the hitch pin hole and compare it to the one on your receiver.  Not sure why most of these lights don't list this measurement.",3.0
"Only a brake light, I thought I read in the details or one of the reviews that part of it would blink for turn signals, IT DOESN'T!",3.0
"This light works fine and installs easily in your hitch. I like using it because I want an extra light on my tail, plus it keeps my 4 flat wiring plug from getting filled up with crud/corrosion when the little cap for it inevitably falls off. Rated at three stars because the material is relatively cheap plastic, and also because there is an annoying ""dark""corner in the light. It's not faulty, just the way that the lamp itself is installed inside the fixture. Not a genuine problem, but I'm picky with my car.",3.0
"The light looks good, but it's a 4 pin not a 7",3.0
"So far I have done one application, but the scratches on the headlights returned very quickly. I will edit rating if there seems to be a positive cumulative effect.",3.0
A little thin and weak. wife backed into another hitch and dented it along with twisting it.  Not so neat anymore,3.0
Great looking Bully product but the backup sensors freaked out that I had installed the new hitch tube. Wish it worked but I didn't read all the reviews. Sold it same day. 4stars if I could have used it.,3.0
Sticks out too far from the receiver.,3.0
"I like this light, and with a few changes it would be a 5-Star product.  The light is nice and bright, and if someone is following you at night, the extra light makes it really easy to spot your vehicle.  In my opinion, you can never have enough lights in the back of your vehicle at night.  The more visible you are, the better your chance of being seen before someone rear-ends you!

Some reviewers have commented on how far out the back of your hitch this sticks.  Mine sticks out a little, but not nearly as much as other reviewers have claimed.  I guess it depends a lot on your hitch receiver, but if they put the hole much closer to the face, it wouldn't fit some longer hitch receivers.

Improvement 1:  The wire harness goes out the back of the light, and is bent forward so that it can go out through a small hole in the front bottom of the housing.  Every hitch receiver I have had is open on both ends, so I would rather see the wire go straight back from the light so that it can pass through the back of the receiver and then be fed to the 4 pin coupling.

Improvement 2: Fit it with a spring loaded pins like the ones used when nesting two tubular pipes together (on old style tents, pruning poles, etc.) so that you do not have to use a hitch pin.

Improvement 3: Have an option that uses a 7-pin connector so that it can also have an auxiliary back-up light.",3.0
This step is blocking my sensors on my chevy 2012 and is a little bit bent. Quality is OK for the price. You get for what you pay.,3.0
I bought the Bully to stop parkers from hitting the back of my pick up.  That is does.  Quality is poor.  Plastic step cracked.  Now it is rusting.  Do not purchase this item with the light.  Light housing breaks and it will rust even  faster. I have only had it three months.,3.0
"These only fit the exposed male pins (from the vehicle side) and do not include a cover to fit the sheathed female pins (from the trailer side). Figured since two came to a kit, they would fit both connections, so I ordered two for two trailers and vehicles. Now I have extra covers and my trailer wiring is still exposed. This is a standard Hopkins product, not generic and matches OEM wiring.",3.0
The connection cord is shorter than I expected and there is no weather proofing.  The brake light works great.,3.0
"I had very minor haze creeping down from the corner of my headlight lens. I figured I'd nip it in the bud before it got an worse. This product really didn't do much to help. I could see a very small improvement after a lot of effort, but nothing significant.",3.0
Ok claner,3.0
"Fits great, hooks up and lights up great. But didn't last long. Seems the all plastic construction couldn't take the beating. It didn't help that I backed into a pole I couldn't see at the restaurant I went to the other night. No other damage to my truck, but the ""Bully"" tail and brake light wasn't much of a bully.",3.0
"Quality of the step is okay.  Mounted in the receiver, it is not exactly square to the bumper and yes, I double checked the reciever for square to the bumper.  It's off approximately 1/4"" from square.  This may seem minor but mounted tight to the bumper it is definitely noticeable so I opted to mount it in the middle pin hole to minimize the obviousness of it. The brightness of the chrome is also okay.  It is not as clean bright new chrome looking as the bumper (which is almost 3 years old) which is odd for a brand new piece.",3.0
none,3.0
"This product was satisfactory, doing what it said it would do, for the most part.",3.0
"It half worked on my 2001 Ford Explorer.  I used an electric buffer.  The lights improved but they still look pretty bad. Some of the problem is just cheap plastic, that can never be repaired.  Probably would not pass a Maryland inspection.  After ordering this, there are plenty of sites on line that sell aftermarket lenses for $21. I think this would be a better alternative.",3.0
Good but I got to remember WHERE I put these small snap-on covers.,3.0
"The package describes both an on-vehicle connection AND an on towed device side.  It is NOT both.  Both were the same and the trailer side required modifications to get it to go over the four wire connector.  Inside this cover is a partition which covers the male ground prong.  But trying to put this over the Female ground is impossible ... it's like two elephants butting heads.

Required cutting the famale rubber out of the cover on the trailer side.

It could be that this was a RETURNED item and somebody switched one side.",3.0
"It does the job, but doesn't fit very snugly, both the loop and the cover tend to fall off over time.  I guess it's about the only option, but, I feel like something with more stretch could fit on and stay there.",3.0
This was lighter duty than expected - thinner metal. Also it is already getting some surface rust after only one season. I would not say i am unhappy with it - it does serve it function ok - it is just a little lighter duty than expected.,3.0
"Note that this is primarily a cleaner!  Don't expect it to polish a ""fogged"" headlamp lens.

"I used this to remove light oxidizedation on my headlights. This stuff worked to remove the oxidizedation. It didn't remove some minor small scratches on the plastic lenses. I got it to remove the oxidizedtion & it did, but not removing the minor scratches was a bit of let down. I went over the lenses again to see if it would help, but it didn't.

"Pros:
Easy to use and apply with hand and a applicator sponge
Does a decent job of clearing up headlight, but definitely not the best
Good amount in container that will last for awhile

Cons:
Polish and clarity of headlights last only a few weeks after which cloudiness starts to return
As above, have to reapply every 3 weeks or so to maintain decent clarity
Does not make headlights crystal clear

Better solution: Use automotive clear coat instead
400 grit followed by 600, 1000, and finally 1500 then coat with Clear enamel. Just did it today and lights look almost brand new on 2000 Honda civic",3.0

"A little bit of off label usage here. I bought a subwoofer off a guy and it had a lot of light scratches on the top that I wanted to try and buff out. I suppose its probably some sort of plastic shell I used it on, black in color, semi-gloss finish. It left a nice shine and seems like its a combination of removing some of the scratching and also making it harder to see them because of the nice shiny finish. Its not the miracle scratch remover I was hoping for but it definitely looks better after using it.",3.0

I will update the review if it works on the Ford.",3.0
"This plug is so nice for the vehicle side of the 4 flat wire harness.  Not so much for the trailer side. It would not go into the recess of the trailer side due to a piece of Plastic that keeps the one male plug separated on the vehicle side. I called the company.  Got through right away. Cheers on that part. But that's where it ended. They said they were looking at it in the warehouse while I was on the phone. I was also looking at mine right in front of me. They said theirs was fitting on the trailer side, but mine wasn't. There was absolutely no way that it will fit the trailer side. I don't know if the package was wrong or what, but there is two identical plug covers in the box. It makes sense that they don't fit both sides. I went ahead and bought a separate dust cover for the trailer side. Fit like a dream.",3.0

To be brief; this Meguiar's product is working almost as good as soap and water.

Last I've checked, soap and water might be ""slightly"" less expensive, and more convenient than using Meguiar's products.

I am a bit puzzled as far as why did so many others gave Meguiar's products such great reviews.

"Just like my previously purchased Blue Coral plastic polish, this is meant for not really badly hazed headlights. I found it quickest to clean headlights by using wheel and brake dust cleaner on the plastic lens. You will be amazed how quickly the yellow staining runs off the headlight after spraying it on (keep off the paint). Once you get the yellowing off, the lens will be milky. This is where the PlastX polish ""shines"". Usually two applications will get is as clear as possible (without extensive wet sanding). And if you got to sand, I strongly suggest you check how inexpensive headlight assemblies may be for your car.",3.0
"It is what it is...two covers and some dielectric grease?  Really I feel it's expensive for what it is, but I couldn't find these anywhere and needed one for my boat and one for the truck side.  One thing to keep in mind is these are designed for the male side not female, but will work with either.  I've noticed that mine fills up with water if it's upside down (like in the pic) and it rains....then my prongs are sitting in the water for days and days rendering this pointless...actually worse than orig.  Anyhow I now use this to keep my truck wires from dangling by feeding them thru the chain hole on my hitch",3.0

"Before this product, I was using Meguiar's 2 part plastic polishing kit on almost everything- from CD's, computer monitors, watch screens, gps, etc.  So after one of the bottles (meguiar's 10) ran out, I decided to try this product, as it was advertised as a one step cleaner-polish.  While it did do the job of cleaning things up, I found that the polish portion of PlastX did not necessarily fill in the fine scratches quite as effectively as the standalone Meguiar 10 polish.  Not only that, but the protective coating wore off after a few months, returning the headlights to it's post sanded haze.

So bottom line is, only use this kit if you plan on doing plastic restoration on a continual basis.  Otherwise, I would definitely recommend Meguiar's 10 + Meguiar's 17 as a more potent, long-lasting combo.",3.0

I have many wheel chocks, use them only for DIY car repairs.  Don't use them for trailers, RVs, etc.  I usually have a few chocks in my trunk, most are rubber.  This Camco 44412 was a candidate for the trunk as a smaller option and I liked the bright color.  Unlike any rubber chocks you may have used, this seems to slide around a bit due to the hard surface, the plastic.  That's just the difference between rubber and plastic, no big deal. So you'll have to kick it in with your foot to really 'grip' in between the edge of the tire and the cement when you go to use this or it could slide away from the tire.  (This is the same with the plastic ramps, kick them in with your heel to 'seat' it under the ramp first)  Despite the effort of kicking it in to make it wedge in, I'll give the chocks 4 stars as OK and the chocks appear quite solid. You just have to learn how to set them in based on your tire size, the ground,etc.  Now the bothersome part, about safety.  There is a date on the side of the chock that says to not use after this date, and the date was yeaaaars ago.  Even though it seems solid, I don't want to use plastic that is years past it's normal/stable chemical composition in order to hold THOUSANDS of pounds from rolling even the slightest bit, which could lead to rolling on to you.  Plastic can break and crack especially in cold temps, and I don't want any plastic cracking or breaking at all, period.  So for the sake of safety, and the plastic is years ""expired"", and the fact that I work underneath cars I gave that part a 1 star and just threw it in the trash.  (recycle bin, actually,).  It's completely unbelievable that this product is being sold to thousands of people every day.  If you don't care about a little date on the side of the product, then go ahead, it may be just fine for you, but I'll pass.  So my final rating up to 3.  That being said, the next time I see this in a store I'll look at it and if the date is not years past, then i'll buy a couple.",3.0
"This product did clear the headlights on my car a little but it did not provide crystal clear shine. However, I use this product after each car wash to protect the headlights from UVs. I will try other brand next time.",3.0
I have an 2003 car with those plastic headlight lens and they had become somewhat yellow and hazy in appearance. I bought this in hopes it would clear them up. The product did a ok job it did remove at least some of the yellowing and some of the haze but not all. Can't say for sure if its my fault for letting them go so long or not???.,3.0
Did the job.,3.0

Wish they were just a little higher on the large end. Have a pick up truck with big tires and almost role over it when on a incline of my driveway.  Its okay for now.,3.0
This chock was much lighter duty than I expected.  So far it works fine blocking my boat and truck when at the ramp.  interesting to see how durable this item will be.,3.0
not as good a i like but working don't know how long will last but price was cheap ? ?,3.0
I bought these primarily based on price.  When I got them they were about what I expected.  After a few short uses one already has a crack in it.  For the price and amount that I use them I will probably just get more.  I would not recommend these for heavy use.,3.0
This item will work but I feel they are a bit too small a little bigger would have been perfect.,3.0
I was a little confused thinking that these were sold in pairs - was a little disappointed when only 1 arrived so I had to go back and order a second one. Good quality items.,3.0
...but I also use large rocks along with the chocks because they are smaller than I thought they would be.,3.0

It works I was just so confused when I let it out of the container it dried like cardboard. But defiantly absorbs a lot of water.,3.0
"Manufacture date printed on the top of the tube in dot-matrix is 6/6/17. I was wondering if these would be counterfeit, given that they are 8 dollars per tube less than what appears to be the same product offered elsewhere on Amazon, and the standard size for these tubes is 1/10 gallon, which would be somewhat more in the tube than this.

These appear to be the real deal. They are, however, somewhat dented up, which I would not expect in a 3M product shipped to the retailer in a case. Perhaps these have been repacked and reshipped? Nothing that would prevent them from being used.",3.0

"It's not a real Chamois since it is made with PVA. It does soak up rather nicely and is very smooth so it won't cause streaks unless you get it dirty. Overall it's okay, nothing special.

OK,3.0

Works ok.

Works great. I don't like the very short shelf life.  Must use entire tube within 24 hours after opening.,3.0
"Between this, microfiber towels, or even the more traditional chamois, I can't say that this does any better or worse. It claims to dry anything ""faster"" but that's not my experience. I will continue to use it but it's just one more thing that serves only one purpose. In the future, I'm just going to stick with microfiber towels because then at least they have multiple purposes.",3.0
"Pros:
It's a box fan with feet so easy to place where you want.
Moves a lot of air.

"I'm sure it works as described, but the instructions are nearly impossible to read because they are so small.  As it turns out, you should always purchase the fast cure unless you have a week to wait for the repair to setup.  That's my only complaint is it takes way too long to cure.",3.0
"We got a new car that is black, wanted a chamis specifically for this car.  This might be fine for a lot of things, which I have not tried yet. But it does not dry a car like the real thing.

"Super product, but one should understand that disassembly is virtually impossible.  I had to install a new, through-the transom live well pump on my bass boat, and it was an extremely difficult job to remove the old one sealed with polyurathane.  It took several days of effort to physically scrape and grind to remove the pump.  When I install the new pump, I will seal it with the 3m 4200 sealant.",3.0
"Update, I bought it from somewhere else - before I did, I emailed and asked if they too would send me the fan similarly messed up as I received it from here.  It was the best of the three that I received, still a bit dirty.  I took it apart, balanced the blades with an r.c. propeller balancer and copper tape for weight.  It's not perfect, but it's pretty good, much better than the ones I received from here.  Will upgrade a couple stars for the product itself.

My first review was disapproved, not really sure why, I followed all of the rules, I'll try again:

I returned this fan twice: The first time, the fan was scratched and dirty, appeared as if it was used. So I exchanged it for another which arrived the same way (scratched and dirty). In addition, the blades were badly out of balance and the blades hit the outer case.  I doubt they come straight from the manufacturer in this bad of shape . Looking for another option to circulate air in our 10x14' tent.",3.0
Not what I expected - rubbery feel to it,3.0
"only used for my car's paint once to dry off water but long story short, not a good alternative for microfiber towels because it collects dirt and grime very quickly and may scratch your car's paint",3.0
"Nicely made, but way too expensive.  Plus - the one I received was out of balance, so it had bad vibration at all speeds.  I returned and got a less expensive competitor.  Sorry Fantastic Fan - I have 2 of your ceiling mounted fans in my RV and they are great, but this particular model did not live up to you rep.",3.0

Don't expect miracles but will remove light oxidation with a little elbow grease. Followed all 3 steps on 30 ft class c and was less dull and  shinerer but not what I was hoping for. I was probably had too high expectations. There was enough to finish rv. Took probably  8 hours with 2 of us for all 3 steps. A lot cheaper than the $1000 a shop in Indy wanted.,3.0
Not as good as the red stuff,3.0
got hard as a rock after one use. Now takes I have to soak it to use again,3.0
I have this in my RV. I've mostly used it on the lower setting as it is a bit loud otherwise. It's large and storing it can be tricky. I wish there were a way to hang it easier and the feet could be a bit better. I love the company and it'd be great if they made a smaller version of this that was a bit sturdier and easier to use. Still a good choice given the options.,3.0
Great quality and price is a bit high now that regular big-box hardware stores are carrying it now.  This stuff takes FOREVER to dry but once it does it holds forever.  But once open you better use up soon (in about a week or so).  For a MUCH faster cure get the red one.,3.0
"Not quite quiet and it vibrates quite bad.
Can't tell how much amps it draws from the battery, but somebody else who reviewed the product did some measurements (after using it for a while, I'd say it's about 4 AMPs -- it draws about 50% of my AGM deep cycle Group 31 marine battery in a week, with about two hours of daily use).

Does the job if applied properly.,3.0
- a star for weight minus another for lack of power.  The blades are not focused at the proper angle for power nor is the Casing thin enough to allow air flow.,3.0
"I don't want to get unrealistic about the longevity of this rig as I have just recieved it, but so far it's OK. Just remember that most fans have operating controls on right side as you look at the front of fan. But what's the front of fan. On this one I could not get any breeze from normal operating posit ion.  I turned it off and realized that if I turned the fan around that that's the way the blades are correct. Nothing catastrophic but something you shouldon't know. Also I did not buy this from amazon, from from anotherror vendor that I have no beef with so far.",3.0
Cut right through the oxidization.  I would recommend this product!,3.0
"Not exactly professional grade, in terms of size or quality (application-wise) but gets the job done- after a few uses anyway (needs to be ""worn in"").

I chose this chamois because it has the highest rating on Amazon.

I'm slightly disappointed, but only because I've used professional, commercial grade chamois before (auto detailing exp). This will defineitely tend to grip and tug on the car's surface, especially if you have a less than fantastically clean and non-faded-out clear coat; just say'n.

On an up note, performance does does improve after a few uses, becoming less grippy. Looking back this could of been more quickly accomplished by letting the chamois sit in a bucket of soft water.

In final say, given my exp w/ chamois, I'd say this rates in at a decent 3.8",3.0
Works good but a little pricey.,3.0

"The ""Heavy Duty Oxidation Remover"" included in this kit is a lie.  The rest of it will take time to tell if it works.

This is little more than a gentle polishing compound.  If you do have heavy oxidation, it takes hours of work to cut through it with this product.  I bought a good polishing compound past to do the job.

Ordered this as used and received it with broken 12 volt connector ( the broken box said inspected). I did not have time to send back as I need the fan for a trip. I replaced the connector my self. Over all the product is ok for it's basic use. Low amp draw supply air flow.,3.0
Got first one with crushed tube.  They did send me a replacement.  The replacement arrived with a minor crushed tube but can still be used.  For such long tubular package with such weight the shipping packaging should try to protect the end with some end foam cap as the shipping package will be dropped many times during the transition.,3.0
This sealant is great stuff but the 3 tubes I ordered didn't all come with the application tips. This was frustraiting to say the least.,3.0

"Its good, but there's better products.  I finally got around to using this on a 2006 WW 26ft toyhaluer.  If you're expecting a quick easy job, then do it yourself polishing is not for you.  I've been detailing for many years, so this isn't my first rodeo. Like ""Customer Ed"" said, this is a machine job, not an orbital or hand job.  You need a quality polisher, and good wool pads based on your situation, and the time to be patient.  I use a Makita 9227C 7-Inch Hook and Loop Polisher/Sander for the better part of 10 years now - great machine.

First Meguiars #49 Oxidation Remover will remove most of the oxidation in one pass after you've spread it out and polished till the compound is no longer hazy, provided you've put enough on and spread evenly around and worked small areas like 2x2ft.  However, this will not get 100% out, but does leave a glossy surface - depending on your color, amount of oxidation, etc.  In my case, working on white gel coat, you could see there was still some haziness left after using this product.  Pictures 2,4,5 show some of the hazy areas (not compound residue) left over after using the #49  (the day is completely overcast, so the clouds you're seeing are areas that didn't polish out 100% with the Meguiar's)  I switched over to a 3M Imperial compound and had much better results, 3M spreads better, cuts through the oxidation in one pass leaving no haze behind like the Meguiars did.  The abrasives dissipate fast and you'll be hard pressed to burn through the coat or decal unless you're really trying.  To be fair, #49 didn't have any burn issues either, but I had to use much more material as it didn't spread out very well.  I had the 3M stuff left over from my days working in a fiberglass boat factory.  I would highly recommend a 3M product over this - yes you'll spend more money on it, but doing the work once with quality results is what you want when polishing a large boat/RV.

#45 High Gloss Polish made a negligible difference as the second step in this 3 step process.  Didn't remove any haziness left behind by the #49.  Bottle states that ""Special formula restores vital oils"".  I'm no scientist, so I can't really comment on that.  But the bottle also states ""Especially effective on dark colors"", since I was working on white, could explain why I didn't get much affect from this.

#56 Wax goes on pretty good.  I used a orbital buffer to apply it and microfiber hand work to take it off.  Don't go too thick and it will come off easier once dry, if you go to thick in one area, just come back to it shortly after and reapply to level it out before removal.

I did the front of the trailer about 1.5 years ago and its been rewaxed a couple times since.  The haziness I spoke of earlier is coming back, and more noticeable; I will redo the front polishing with the 3M Marine Compound and Finishing Material.  The wax has done a decent job protecting the front surface though, but will probably look to another wax once this bottle runs out.  Also the #49 did not last the whole job on a 26ft toyhauler, I got about 2/3rds complete before switching to the 3M compound I had left over from my marine industry days.",3.0
"Application was a real headache for me.
The nozzle that came with it did not tighten up when I screwed it on, so under pressure it would occasionally pop off of the tube.
This left me with adhesive all around the spout.
I'm also not a big fan of the metal tube, which continues to dispense when you set it down.

The product itself is premium, though.
Just make sure that you give it plenty of time to cure.",3.0
"I was really excited about this product when I ordered it, but when I used it to dry my car, it didn't really do that great of a job. I followed the instructions to the tee, but it for sure didn't do what it advertised, which was a completely dry/streak free car with one wipe. Yes this product is pretty good because it absorbs water like crazy, but it still left some streaks around on my car that I had to take a microfiber towel to polish up.",3.0
Will need to test function but not happy with how it arrived.  Cig lighter plug was broken.,3.0
great,3.0
"Overall good quality, pretty good wind speed when cranking up the speed; watch out for stripping the twist-away legs underneath, those tiny screws might get loose after repeatedly folding in/ folding out these legs.",3.0
"I could wish this fan was a little quieter, given the near-silence it often operates in. But, I cannot say a single thing against it in terms of function and quality. On the lowest setting, it moves an astonishing volume of air for the miniscule 1A draw on my batteries. The long 12v cord and multiple built-ins for standing (feet) or hanging (handle or window frame tabs) it are thoughtful and useful features. Entirely worth the substantial price.

UPDATE October 2017: I have to knock two stars off: one for motor quality, and the second for crap customer service. I haven't used the fan in over a year because the motor developed a persistent squeak that made the fan very irritating to have in operation. That was after 6 months of modest use throughout the summer, maybe upwards of 500 hours. When I contacted Fan-Tastic, I was informed that no replacement motor part was available, and I would have to buy a whole new fan if I wanted to fix the problem. That is an ABSURD response, given that the Endless Breeze is really just a roof vent fan in a box, and the overall build quality says 'this can be fixed', not 'this is a disposable piece of crap'. They sell replacement motors for all their roof vent fans, so why not this?",3.0
Lot of work rubbing three products in. Ended up ordering 3M one step product which made even the areas just finished with this product look better. (3M Marine Restorer and Wax),3.0
"Yes the fan puts out an impressive breeze, but it's not quiet.  Not only do hear the breeze but the sound of the motor.  Another thing that's not mentioned in any of the previous reviews is vibration.  When set to the fastest speed, I can see the fan vibrating from across the room.  It will eventually shake itself to death.",3.0
"The fan is good, strong, what you would expect from the reviews.  However, if you are buying this to hang on your kennel door, this is not for you. The hangers consist of a piece of plastic with a wood screw through them.  There's not an anchor, so what happens when you hang it on the door? The wood screws strip out the plastic, no more hanger.",3.0
Works but bare wires will eventually get frayed. Should come in a sleeve. I taped it with electrical tape.,3.0
Maybe I got a lemon but I thought it was pretty loud and the breeze was not all that great.  I'll keep it for the really hot nights but expected better reading the other reviews,3.0
"I bought this product and it can get rid of moderate oxidation in gel coat on a boat but it takes a lot of work! I suggest a much more aggressive polish such as meguires heavy oxidation removal polish for moderate oxidation. The hand pads on this kit sucks, I had to purchase an orbital buffer to get any headway. The terry cloths are nice though.",3.0
it helps but its not what it says it is,3.0
nice fan but not worth $66 .00  .  at the end of day it is still just a fan,3.0
"Used on the oxidized dark green gel coat on a 2001 Maxum. Easier to use than the 3M products. Looked good initially.  Lasted OK, but oxidation look started to return after about 2 months of boat being in the water. Ultimately, colored gel coat is hard to maintain.",3.0

I had tried it on my fiberglass RV on a small area to see how it would work and it didn't do a good job.  It made swirl marks on the RV.  I tried the wax on my truck and I liked it on it.

"I use this product to clean the counters of my bathroom, and it does an OK job at it. This towel gets REALLY dried up after wiping. So dry it becomes flaky and tears at some points. I think it would help to keep it in the container, but it just tears and gets scratchy when you air dry it.",3.0
"Much noisier than I had imagined. moves a lot of air but I am not convinced it moves much more than some conventional 12v designs. I also have a fantastic fan in my camper, I chose to have it installed venting up near my campers stove..  It is deafening to be right under while cooking. If I am over in my bed in the cabover it is nice,",3.0
"Received quickly and in good order. Moves okay amount of air, not as quiet as I'd like it to be. The price is too high for what it is but its the best option out there, but that's due to the lack of options. Ive tried the trucker fans and they move just as much air but are really noisy and no multispeed. Would not buy again. No issues with seller or transaction and product is as described.",3.0
kinda cheap but works,3.0
"it's the only fan like it, so they can pretty much charge whatever they want, which is too much for the cheap quality.  though it is advertised as made in the USA, it is made of cheap materials, and poorly crafted.  the fan speed varies by itself, and it isn't very smooth - you can hear it squeaking.  this should only cost $30.",3.0
"I purchased the kit some time ago in anticipation of this years launch, I expected to get 1 each of cleaner, polish and wax, what I received was 1 cleaner and two polish. Good thing I had some rainx wax. The product works as advertised (at least what I received)",3.0
It does the job... when your trailer lights are a few inches shorter than the truck plug. I would have liked to seen those wires bundled together in a weather proof enclosure thou. If you are trailing a boat that part never touches the water but the weather (snow and severe rain) seem to be stronger than these lose wires.,3.0
"A great 3-product package that includes everything you need to get the job done, including an apron.  I knew what to do with the restorer, but then was a bit confused on which product came next, the polish or the wax.  There's really nothing in the package that tells you which one to end with, so I picked the polish.  Either way, it did a good job on my running lights as well as all other parts, but they were the biggest surprise.  They were extremely hazy and cloudy and the restorer made them almost like new. Once I put the wax on them, they looked really good. I was impressed. I'm going to use this product on my car's fenders which are fiberglass as well and see if they get back in shape. This is definitely worth the money, but they need more complete instructions or at least put big numbers on the containers.  Three stars!",3.0
"First one wouldn't work on second use. Returned for replacement. This one works, but on third use already started squeaking. I had to turn it off to sleep. Don't spend $70 on this hunk of junk. I'm trying to find another one. Hard to find quality fans.

"I have wanted one of these for camping for several years now. In the past I've always used one of the cheap ones from Target or Wal Mart, but felt it was time for an upgrade. Maybe I had it really built up in my mind as to what it was going to be, but when it arrived, I plugged it in and my initial reaction was disappointment. I ended up returning it.

Now I will say, on high it moves a LOT of air, way more than my previous O2 cool, but it's fairly loud on that setting. It actually has 4 speed settings as opposed to just high and low on the O2 cool. Of course keep in mind that noise is relative! On high it's still not nearly as loud as running the a/c, but we are looking for something that is almost silent. The O2 cool on low is very quiet, the Fantastic on the lowest setting is about like the O2 cool on high.

So, in the end I'll say that for someone who wants to have a LOT of airflow, this is the fan for you. But if you just need a bit of air moving around and you want nearly silent, I'd just stick with the O2 cool for a quarter of the price.",3.0
"I spent the better part of 4 days using this complete system on 1992 Thompson Fiberglass boat.  I received the boat as a gift and the fiberglass was a little neglected.  The Oxidation remover removed all the oxidation I had on my boat.  It worked pretty well.  I applied the polish and the wax and when I was done, I sat back and admired my work.  It looked pretty good!

After 2 weeks in the water I was already getting organic build up on the hull.  Granted my boat is docked in a ""dirty lake"".  But I was not worried because I properly treated the surface so clean up should be a breeze.  Right?  Wrong.  I had my boat out of the water a few weeks later and tried to clean the hull with no success.  I was expecting the wax to make that job easier but it was as if I never even applied any.

At the end of the season I tried two different fiberglass cleaners and they did not work.  I resorted to an acid based product to remove the organic material.  I will try a different wax this summer.

So:

Polish = : ]
Wax = :I",3.0
"I bought this stuff to polish a boat that was neglected for about 10 years.  It worked OK, but I had WAY better results with basic turtle wax rubbing compound (green bottle).  The polish made the gloss go away that I received from the rubbing compound, which shocked me.  The only thing I used for the entire job was the pure wax.  Mainly that is because they say you shouldn't use any other wax on gel coat, if you have stripped oxidation because the gel coat absorb anything else. (dont know the truth of that, but I took the recommendation)",3.0

"I've always been apprehensive about products that claim they will restore finishes to ""showroom new"".
I purchased a used boat in 2012 and decided to give it a complete detailing before the boating season starts. I attended a boat show and saw these ""polymer based"" products and all the hype behind them and was not convinced. I decided to purchase this ""Restoration System"" because I have used Meguiar's product for my car and have been pretty satisfied with the results.
I used the Oxidation remover/cleaner by hand and with a 6"" buffer and it took some of the rust stains off but did not really ""remove it all"". Used the Oxidation remover for the rest of the boat then used the ""Fiberglass Polish"". After plenty of elbow grease and machine polishing the boat's appearance did improve but nothing like they make is sound to be. I plan to give it another go in a couple of weeks and hope that consistent upkeep will indeed improve the boat's finish. I also plan to apply the wax the next time around.",3.0

Yes it works but when I did it I had the perfect example to test it on.  A ten year old rv that got a lot of sun from the rear.  I followed the directions exactly and it did work but changing buffer pads on an orbital buffer three times per area I was working got old.  After about a hour I was just plain sweaty and beat down.  I put the product away for a week and I accidentally hit same area I was working with some Meguiar's new tech 2 wax that I use on my new camaro.  I was surprised to see after two buffings with the orbital buffer the new tech wax looked better than the 3 step process I bought.  So this stuff I bought here is going on the shelf and I am just buffing the oxidation off with another product.  In summary this product does work but what a pain in the butt it is.  Its much easier to just use a good wax and an orbital buffer.  Apply it once.  Wipe.  Apply again and check.  In my situation that's all that would have been needed. Live and learn I guess.,3.0

"I was hesitant about buying this fan as it's so expensive, but the preponderance of exceptionally good reviews sold me on it.  Everybody was raving about how much air it moved, and moving air is critical to a good night's sleep for me, so I splurged for our RV.

It's... fine.  Honestly on setting 1 or 2 our little clip-on fan (which cost $15) does just as well.  On setting 3 it does a better job but it's LOUD.  Not unbearable, but I could hear it from a few feet away outside the camper.  It's louder than our rooftop A/C.

The integrated window clips are good for putting it in front of our van's vent window, which it's wide enough to mostly fill, and it circulates the air nicely.  I guess for the price and the over-the-top good reviews I was expecting something life changing.  If it had cost half as much I'd be totally satisfied, but at a premium price it just doesn't live up to expectations.",3.0

"The Fan Tastic Vent Corp 01100WH Endless Breeze 12V Volt Fan is an acceptably good product and would probably rate a 4/5 on value... I kinda like it but it's a tad bit expensive.

What you don't know is its power draw and that's a big deal to those of us living inside battery constraints.  I have measured it and I'll share:

low:  15 Watts or 1.25 amps @ 12 VDC
medium:  27 Watts or 2.25 amps
high:  35 Watts or close to 3 amps

"I returned my fan because

1. It had scuff marks along the cable side. The marks were caused by the plug rubbing on the side of the fan. There was no packaging to separate the two. In fact there was no packaging except for the outer box. I was annoyed and assumed that this was a returned product by another customer.

2. Despite #1 I decided I wouldn't worry about the scuffing and would keep the fan if it was really good. On switching it on the first thing I noticed was an unpleasant whining noise from the motor. The air noise was not that bad. But the total noise was unacceptable (I don't like noisy fans and I may notice them more than you). I agree with other reviewers that the fan does move a lot of air.

So I returned the fan and since I wasn't sure if it was new decided to give it another try and get a replacement. Amazon had the new fan to me within a day or two. Guess what! The exact same situation: scuff marks for the same reason and the same old whine. My take is that this is a premium priced product but not of premium quality.

I still don't know if the plug packaging is meant to be isolated from the fan case. Someone enlighten me please.",3.0
"Very nice fan. But on a boat it tips very easy, the feet break. Runs very well. Should have wall or bulkhead mounting. No where to hang and position on a boat.

Be careful with this product and always make sure you have one ball attached to ensure that the retaining ball bearings to not fall out while it is in storage. I took a look at the other day and one of the ball bearings that acts as a retainer is missing. I will be contacting Reese for a replacement. The concerning thing is that I had not even used the hitch ball once when I noticed this problem.",3.0
After receiving and was able to inspect the design I'm not so sure as to how long it will take rust and or debris to settle in and around the release pin making it more difficult to change from one ball size to another.

ITS OKAY BUT THERES BETTER !,3.0
"Very convenient to have! It's incredibly easy to change between sizes. All you need is a coin or screwdriver.

The chrome coating comes off easily though, and there is a good deal of rust after having it attached for a few months even without using a trailer (though I realize the trailer hitch isn't meant to be permanently attached and should not have left it on when not using it). The rust is purely aesthetic though as the hitch works just fine.

Note that if you live in an area where crime is high, it is easy for something to steal the interchangeable ball if left on the hitch (has not happened to me, but would be possible). With a trailer attached it's firmly secured though.

Definitely worth buying if you intend to use different trailer hitch sizes!

EDIT:  Not very long after using it I ran into the same problem most people have; the ball gets stuck and can't be changed.  The problem is rusting of the small ball bearings.  I found that soaking the entire piece in concentrated CLR (or something fairly strongly acidic) loosened things up enough that a few strong whacks from a hammer freed the ball.  Scrubbing the exposed ball bearings with CLR helped quite a bit.  After I rinsed everything with water I sprayed it with a good deal of WD-40 and added a few drops of 3-in-1 oil to each ball bearing.  Seems to be working much better now!",3.0

"I purchased this based on the recommendation of a friend. It works well, and if you are very certain your freshly washed car is free from all debris, you will likely not cause any scratching. However, if you pick up some rogue sand granule or some other debris, you could cause clear coat damage.

After watching an episode of Drive Clean and seeing them use microfiber towels in the same manner, I made the switch. It takes a little longer, but the microfiber towel is marginally safer on your precious paint job and if you're auto obsessed, it may be worth the extra time. The microfiber are also easier to clean, just wash and dry and you are on your way. This thing will get mold unless you let it dry out completely and is a pain to wash by hand. I still use it around the house and it works well, it just no longer gets anywhere near my new car.",3.0
Don't why people like this so much.  It's not bad.  I like genuine leather chamois so much better because it doesn't leave streaks on glass windows and it cleans up the water and any leftover dirt on the car better.

"These hold pretty well once they are cinched down but but there is no ratchet to them.

What makes them hard to use is the fact that a level binder has that one sweet spot, which is easy to find with a length of chain, because you can adjust the binder one link at a time until you find it. With the webbing, you're forever searching for that sweet spot. It's either too tight or two loose. It took me fifteen minutes to get them just right on my trailer. Also, the length is odd. They're not very long, but if the distance between tie down points isn't far enough apart, the sleeve to lock down the buckle is too close to the buckle to do its job. Lastly, the extra material to prevent chafing is not sufficiently protective when the strap twists off the horizontal, nor do I think it's enough material to be effective. For my trailer, I prefer the ratcheting type of binder or strap.",3.0

"I purchased this system in SS about 5 years ago.  I primarily use the 2"" ball, but have used the 2-5/16.  I went out today to switch the ball from 2"" to 2-5/16 and COULD NOT drive the pin out.  It would not budge using a 1/4"" punch and small sledge.  It was like it was welded in solid.  Granted the ball had been on for sometime, but I would have never expected this from a SS part.  The O rings on each end of the pin are supposed to seal from moisture, but obviously condensation inside created rust.  Also the nut was seized on the shank and wouldn't budge with a 1/2 impact.  Finally gave up and cut it off the ball mount.  I live in Oklahoma so we do get a moderate amount of rain.  The review is just to emphasize the importance of keeping the pin coated with a rust preventative, and better still remove it when not in use if you don't pull a trailer regularly.  If not for the rust issue which caused me to replace the shank and the 2"" ball I would have rated 5 stars because it is a strong handy system.",3.0
"I was a little disappointed to find that 3 of the parts are not stainless (nut, lock washer, and cotter pin) so they are all rusty/corroded now. The balls and shank are great and have no issues with them being corroded.",3.0
"A good idea very poorly executed in all aspects.  The round shank lends itself to putting all the twisting stress on the pin holding the ball on.  Lets face it with a 10,000 pound rating on the 2 5/16, a lot of tongue weight makes a lot of twisting on the ball.  I don't load them with grease as they get switched out and would make a mess in my truck and hands.  The shank is soft stainless and the twisting egged the hole a bit.  The displaced metal made the other balls impossible to get on and off so I had to grind down the bulges on the shank.  The nut is of a different grade of steel and has rusted fast on the shank and I cannot get it to loosen or tighten so it spins a bit now.  The plastic case you can get for them is lame.  The lid will not stay on.  I have seen the ones with the hex shank but they dropped the ball on the metal and do not offer stainless, a deal breaker for me. It could just be done so much better and it has been poor for years and years.",3.0

They bolt in to the top hole with no modification, but still leave the bottom hole from the factory mirrors exposed. These have some give to them, in case you rub up against a dock. So far, they haven't broken off yet. They're also slightly larger and more convex, so you can see behind you better when towing. They're also adjustable, unlike the stock mirrors. They don't exactly fit with the stock cover for the WaveRunner, and stuffing them into the pockets makes me nervous about breaking something.

Would be nice if adjustment was closer to one of the ends so you could ratchet it from the side of the bed but that would be a more expensive design.

Update
A few months after i got this cargo bar it broke. It works well for light weight items but thats it. I transport paint in the bed of my truck and i had some five gallon buckets slide into the bar.

"Meh.  I'll admit I was influenced by those who recommended this mirror as a viable substitute for a baby/child rear-facing auto mirror.  That was a mistake.  Although it ""works"" as a substitute, I found two reasons why I just couldn't bring myself to live with it; It's too big and it doesn't magnify.

My previous rear-facing mirror (unfortunately discontinued) was about the size of a standard smartphone.  This one is almost four times that size.  On a boat, I could see why this doesn't present an issue and, most likely, is a benefit.  In a car (and keep in mind we drive a large SUV), the size of this mirror takes up so much area that it is no doubt a significant obstruction, getting in the way of safe driving.

My previous rear-facing mirror would magnify, allowing me to clearly see my child in his/her car seat.  This mirror lacks that feature, which allows me to see the entire car.  Again, I'm certain that this is ideal on a boat but, for an automobile, it's simply too much viewing area within the mirror.  Highly distracting and not ideal for use as a child's rear-facing mirror.

My critiques aside, the quality of this product is impressive.  It is very well made and the suction cup stuck firmly to just about any surface I tried it on (excluding my dashboard, which is porous). I'm certain it would face the elements and serve a boat owner well, just not in my truck.

CONS:
 Very large (too large for realistic use in an automobile)
 Doesn't Magnify (which is probably ideal for boat use)

PROS:
 Well made

Tip for mounting-  don't hold the mirror itself, hold the mount and press on.  This relieves the stress off the glass.
My issue is- after 4 weeks, I uncovered my boat and found the mirror cracked in half.  Heat/cold was not an issue, nor the middle glass it was attached to.  I don't want a screw mount style because it scratches.  I'm purchasing a another one because it's the right size for the center console.  If it stays together great, it the bracket breaks, I have a back up.  If the glass breaks  CIPA is getting back!",3.0

"I got this to mount on my windshield so I can easily see my daughter in the backseat. It has fallen off a few times, but seems like it only happens when its around 0 degrees outside. It's a great mirror that you can actually see, as opposed to the blurry fabric ones",3.0
"I thought it would have good suction since it made for boats.  I'm using it on a UTV with a glass windshield.  It is holding, but you don't get the feeling you can bet $50 it will hold for several years.  Maybe buy this if you can't find something better",3.0
"Good CIPA's Suction Cup Marine Mirror easily attaches to any clean, smooth, non-porous surface to provide added safety and situational awareness. It requires no tools to install, no holes to drill, and it won't scratch your boat. Once mounted, the flexible arm lets you fine-tune the mirror's placement. The mirror head measures at 4 by 8 inches, and contains convex glass for wide angle viewing. When it comes to boating, being safe is just as important as having fun.",3.0
"Must be VERY careful in adjusting the ""ball and socket"", which is under the rubber cover. I had to loosen the 2 bolts that held it in, so it would move easier. I had read a lot about the ""pot metal ""arm"" breaking off. The ball will be in a position that will not let it move, due to an angle on the arm. If it does not move easy, look at it close and see if it is the arm angle that is causing it to bind, if so change the position of the ball.

I also had to put a slight amount of silicon grease on the suction to make it hold",3.0

Purchased to change oil in my 2007 Honda Element and 2007 Jeep JK. Worked fine for the Element but the JK would not accept the extraction hose beyond a certain point (hit an obstruction before reaching the oil). Maybe a smaller diameter tube would work? Returned it. Remember: it is always a good idea to pull your drain plug every few oil changes even when using one of these extractors. Drain plugs are magnetic and catch any metal bits floating around in your oil.,3.0
I got this to  change the oil in my diesel generator.  Black tube look fine and went into dipstick unfortunately It didn't go to the bottom of the oil pan. I only got 1/2 cup of oil out.  The pump itself seems good quality and worked fine so I will try it on my cars next.  Does seem it is going to take quite a bit longer to drain all the oil out compared to the drain plug so we'll see.,3.0
"The pump does not seal completely on top of the storage container, which causes it to lose vacuum rather quickly.  It almost seems like the handle for the container is obstructing the pump, making it not seal properly.

"This unit works OK.  The concept is GREAT.  It gets 3 stars as follows:  The pump is a total pain in the butt to hold onto the bulbous tank fitting.  Yes, I know I could put some jelly or lube or soap or something around the ring to help it seal better, but I shouldn't have to.  I have seen competitors' models that have a threaded attachment for the pump handle.  The good about the current setup on this item is if the handle gets knocked around, it just falls off.  If the unit had a threaded fitting, and it gets knocked around, the handle would most likely break off at the threads or worse, rending the device most likely inoperable.  Also, in order to get the fluids out of several generators, air compressors, and lawnmowers, I had to remove the smaller diameter hose from this unit.  It sucks just fine now using the larger diameter hose.  Again, it should have worked just fine out of the box.  I should not have to modify a brand new product.  I like the stability of the bulbous design.  I like the ability to pour the oil right back out the hole it came in once the siphon tube is removed.  If I had it to do all over again, tho, I would buy something different.  It DOES work, but it could be better.",3.0

My truck has a dip stick tube that will not allow the hose to slide down to the bottom of the pan.  This system will not work for me.,3.0
Slow but it works.,3.0
"Make sure that the oil is warm because it is a huge factor in how fast the oil
is removed from the pan. It will do the job intended but I had to constantly monitor and
pump addition strokes to kept the flow moving otherwise it would come to a halt. The number
of strokes indicated in the instructions were off. I had to double the number to insure initial oil movement.
The pump seems somewhat weak in suction and the overall unit durability a question mark...only
time will tell if this unit holds up. It did remove approximately 4.5 gallons of oil from the pan in several of my vehicles in about
1 and a half hours for each of my vehicles.  I also removed oil from my mower which was an easy job
and saved my back from lifting and moving the mower  around to get to the under drain plug.
The 3 is because of the somewhat weak pumping I experienced and durabiliy question...otherwise the design concept
is on target.",3.0
"This is the first ever oil extractor i have ever used. The instructions say that it only takes 15-20 pumps to get a steady flow but this was not the case for me. My oil would flow for a couple of minutes but it would not last. It took me about 2 hours to extract 5 liters of 5w-40 oil from my GTI. I had to continuously pump the handle to extract oil towards the end. Perhaps my oil was cold but i had been driving my car all day and let the engine cool for an hour. Oh well, it gets the job done and it saves me money on labor. I enjoy working on my car but i wish it worked a bit faster.",3.0
"works but its slow, the advantage is that you don't have to replace oil pan plug",3.0
"Tube blows off from pressure build up - extremely slow if the oil isn't warm enough

Purchased an automatic pump for a few bucks more and did the job in less than half the time.",3.0
Works great but bottom support that it sits on fell off right away,3.0
"Works OK, but does not hold enough fluid.  Only used once-don't know how it will hold up long term.",3.0
Not too bad but the pump attached to the top of the reservoir kept coming off as I tried pumping it.  The fit was lose and I had to hold the pump to the reservoir.  I think if the the extractor hose was a little larger it would make it a lot easier for oil to be extracted.  I followed the directions to tee warming the engine up prior to extracting oil but it still took about 45 mins to completely empty 2 1/2 quarts.,3.0
"This extractor did it's job, but it took FOREVER to extract 4 quarts of oil out of my Sea Doo",3.0
"Very slow to extract fluids.  It does the job, just not very fast.",3.0
"Needs a better system for connecting pump to unit, can't be pumped with one hand while holding
Extraction tip.",3.0
"clean oil change, but slow to pump.  I had to continuously pump to extract oil.",3.0
"I am rating this with a three star because it did not work out as I had hoped. I drained the oil from my 92 Mercedes, all 8 liters of it, but I had to continuously pump the extractor every few seconds to keep a suction. The directions clearly say not to do this, but if I didn't, the fluid actually went backwards into the engine from lack of suction.

I probably wouldn't buy this again, but if you do, expect that you might have to sit down for a few hours and pump the fluids out of your vehicle until it is empty.",3.0
I uesd the Oil Extractor one week after having my oil changed at a dealer and the oil looked black so I hope my truck is fine.,3.0
It is super slow but gets the job done.  It creates a vacuum that you pump and walk away to let it do its thing.  I like that I can see the fluid as it comes out so that you get an idea of when it is reaching the end.,3.0
"I'm not going to say this item doesn't work, It would be good for things smaller jobs, versus automobiles, That is, if you plan on doing a complete oil change, and not just taking out a small amount of oil if you put too much in.
The problem I have with this, that needs to be redesigned is, the pump does not screw on to the top of the canister, All you do is push the pump on top. The problem with this is, when you pump anything out of it, the pump comes off the top of the canister. You have to hold the pump down with one hand, while you pump with the other.
Why would they not make this so you can screw the pump on top making it a bit more stable. If you wanted to do an oil change with this,it would take forever.
I seldom if ever give a bad review, but the design of this put me over the edge.",3.0
"I was really hoping this extractor would help save time, but it didn't really work as well as I had hoped. I have had this for a couple years now, and only used it twice.  The suction was adequete, and it did extract some oil, but I don't think it got it all out.",3.0
Works pretty well but it will take you a good hour or two to extract all the oil by yourself. Really would work best with two people; one to pump and one to maneuver the suction stick.,3.0
"I purchased this product to use on draining the oil from my ski boat.  The process of extracting the oil took about 50 minutes and numerous times I had to get the suction going again.  It saved me a ton of money if the boat shop would have changed my oil.  I tried it on my 2002 Chevy Avalanche and something at the bottom of the dipstick tube is blocking the tubing from getting into the oil pan. Overall, decent product.",3.0
"Used this one and the pumping handle started bending and I am not sure how much longer its gonna last.
Worked very well in taking the oil out of my waverunner.",3.0
"It took a very long time to get the first quart out of the boat...it helps if you lower the tank to the same level as the oil.....we found out pumping up hill into the boat....the pump just could not hold a vacuum.  We added a little vasoline to the seal and it helped.  After we had 2-3 quarts in the tank...increased the vacuum and the last couple of quarts went faster.  We took several breaks in the 90 degree heat to get the oil out.  The pump and line just ""set"" on a black rubber o-ring....can not screw on and seal....bad design.",3.0
"The advantages are it's compact size, with sufficient capacity for most jobs.
Stowing it away when not in use is easy.....being small enough to be unobtrusive.
It works well for lighter viscosity fluids (eg: brake, power steering fluid etc), but
it's narrow (essentially quarter inch final section hose) just doesn't cut it for oil changes.
Yes, it does work, but the narrow tube together with the moderate vacuum pressures it
develops work together to making an oil change take hours rather than minutes.
Doing as instructed: ie that of running the engine to heat up the oil is a must, but it still takes
too long a time to do the job.",3.0
"Upon receiving this product, my concern was whether or not it would work. It seemed more like a toy. After draining the oil from three cars (VW, Toyota, & Lexus), I learned that it does the job but is quite slow. You pump a few times, wait several minutes, pump more, wait more, etc. until you have most of the oil out of the bottom of the pan.

If this product were $29.95, I would have given it a higher rating. There is nothing in it that justifies this high price. You can probably rig up an electric sump with parts from Harbor Freight for not much more than this costs.",3.0
"product works,but takes forever to get the oil out....its a good workout though otherwise it is ok just thought it would be faster",3.0
"I don't doubt that this product works as advertised, *if* you can feed the suction hose down through the dipstick tube.  I've tried it on two cars so far and it binds up around 6 inches from the oil pan.",3.0
It works but the drain tube is too small in diameter and it takes forever to pump the oil out thru the dipstick.,3.0
"I had a Pela 6000 extractor before; it worked great and lasted many years, until I left it in an unheated garage one winter and after that it would not hold a vacuum.

This is the same product, but does not seem to be assembled as well. The parts don't fit together as well and it requires more pumping.

It's not terrible, but not as good as I hoped. I probably just got unlucky, receiving the one in a hundred that's not quite as good as the others.",3.0
"Great for changing things like power steering fluid, diff fluid, but so-so for oil.  Changing oil requires constant pumping, and the pump portion is not attached to the oil container, forcing you to use two hands to pump (letting the hose move around in the process).  You have to get your oil hot before it will flow very well, so plan on changing it after a drive. The probe has to be barely off the bottom of the oil pan and you have to keep checking it.

I tried changing my oil cold and ended up just draining from the pan.  My car is probably not the best candidate for this unit as I use 20w50 oil (thick!).  I do have a cartridge type oil filter accesible from the top.  If you had to crawl under your car to remove the oil filter I think I would just drain the car conventionally.

It does work, and it is handy to have but what you make up for in convenience you lose in time.

I would buy again but not necessarily for changing oil.",3.0
"I got this to remove oil from my 2006 VW Jetta TDI. It removes it, but not as I thought it would. It takes about 20 minutes to remove 4.5 liters of hot/warm oil. I need to begin suction 2-3 times to empty the oil from the car. Bottom line, it gets the job done.",3.0
thinner than expected but still works like it should. Currently using for lining cupboards whee dishes and glasses slip too easily.  Cheaper in dollars stores tho.,3.0
"Slip stop works with items sitting ON it, but does not keep the lining itself from slipping",3.0
"It's a lot thinner than I expected, but it does an adequate job.",3.0
"Works well on some surfaces, but not well on others.  Slides around used as a drawer liner in the RV.  But is excellent when used between bowls, plates, pots and pans to keep them clattering and shifting as you're going down the road.",3.0
Worked fine in our motor home.,3.0
it works for a few days then it slides around with the area rug.  this would work better as contact paper in a cupboard.,3.0
"This mirror is nice for the price, if you can loosen the adjustment screw. It was in there so tight it broke when we tried to loosen it. Needless to say, we were able to fix it and still use it. Our's just might have been faulty. Otherwise, nice mirror.",3.0
Hard for me to adjust on my boat,3.0
"Good mirror - but know think about what you want it for and where it will be going.  I wanted a mirror that would mount under the windshield on the co-captain's side of the boat.  This is not it.  It is designed to mount above the windshield, which I am OK with but the angle it must be mounted at in order to see what is behind you from the captain's chair is very difficult.  I would only recommend this mirror to someone that wants to put it right in front of them.",3.0
I bought this mirror for my husband's birthday.  We have an older boat and it did not fit our mirror.  We are afraid to tighten it to much because it seems like it will crack the mirror.  I don't recommend this for an older boat.,3.0
The mirror itself has good image quality and is solid in build. However I found when trying to use the mounting system on a round rail it would not hold in position reliably. The clamp is clearly intended for use on a square or flat surface. The center pane shows a good view of what is behind you and the left pane is angled down providing some visibility of anything on the water's surface. The right pane however points up and is pretty useless unless you are checking for airplanes. Would get an extra star if the outside panes could be configured for your preference.,3.0
"Dont's overtighten the mount, cheap plastic that strips out way too easy,.",3.0
This looks like a great mirror. I had hoped to clamp it to the side rail on my pontoon to help me see boats passing on my right. However the mounting bracket will not rotate 90 degrees to allow this mounting application.,3.0
Ok but attachment to window screen is bad,3.0
"I have only used it for a few days skiing. So far, so good. The coverage is impressive. You can see the skier almost tot the apex of the turn. the trick is getting the small side mirrors angled wide and also so that the horizons in all 3 mirrors line up. My only complaint so far is that the instructions (or total lack of) stink. The box picture shows the mirror mounted below the windshield frame. I tried this, but it makes a big blind spot for the driver. I flipped it over and it is much better.",3.0
"Would recommend for speed or deck boats with a large or square thick-edged windshield. Does not fit Bennington.
Not for pontoon boats.",3.0
"Was a bit hard to push the mirror bracket on my window frame, and when I flip the window open to walk into the bow of my Malibu the bracket hangs up on the windshield.  The mirror itself is great, just the bracket that holds it onto the window frame I take issue with",3.0
I don't like the new style slip in case. the old style was a better unit and didn't have to be glued to hold a rifle. the new style slips out when the rifle is removed,3.0
no fleece lining,3.0
"The sleeve inside the case has tape attached, to hold it in the boot. I don't use it because my scope and front sight snag on it. Also, after 4 days of riding to and fro to my tree stands, holes wore in the sleeve where the scope rubs. Kolpin used to line with a fleece like product. I much prefer my old Kolpin to this one. It does keep the rifle mud and water free, but you WILL NOT get it apart quietly, when you get to your hunt site.",3.0

"Fit well, as advertised.  Small distortion at top of shield, but livable.",3.0
"This shield has ""waves"" in it. Meaning when I look thru the shield it distorts the view. It makes it very difficult to not get dizzy. I took it off my helmet after about 10 min. Dizzy and vomity are bad things on a motorcycle It does block the wind.
It doesn't fit all half helmets.",3.0
"A little disspointed in the quality, even looks cheap on the plastic parts where it connects to your helmet.  But you get what you pay for, and this was so cheap but it gets the job done.  Flips up and down too easily.",3.0
"Fit & function is as advertised, but the optical quality is lacking. The shield tends to blur/distort vision, especially when using with sun glasses.",3.0
Had problems with keeping it's prime. It was just too small for my trailer. I ended upgrading to the Lincoln Lubrication 1134 Heavy Duty Pistol Grip. Thats a 5 star gun!,3.0

"I bought this to pump up bicycle tires.  It serves its purpose, but it isn't great quality.  It feels as though it could break if not carefully taken care of.  I have a feeling it won't last very long.  The last hand pump that I had lasted 15 years and was much sturdier.",3.0
I received the snowbroom in very good condition and in a timely matter. The only problem was I ordered 2 and only got one. But I was given a refund for the second one. I haven't used it yet. But I like the fact that it has an extendable handle so it is going to be much easier to reach the middle of the roof and windows. I do think that the bristles could of been a bit stronger. All in all this as a great snowbroom. I hope that I get to use it soon and that it works well. SJR,3.0
"So far so good. Hubby bought 2 of these so we could have an extra to keep in the house, as we have a similar snowbrush for our vehicle. We were disappointed because the picture of the item showed red and black for the brush and when we received it, it was a lime green and grey/black.",3.0
Good product. Only reason I gave 3 stars and not 4 or 5 is because the broom part itself is not that wide or long. It takes a little long (in my opinion) to clear the snow off my car since the broom is so small. If it were wider and longer it could handle more snow and would take less time.,3.0
I just wished it would be a little wider brush wise.  I was desperate and just got it.  It serves the purpose.,3.0

"You get what you pay for. After a year of home use the threads in the adapter have worn out ""popping"" off the valve when it gets under pressure.",3.0
"worked well, but only lasted about a year until it broke.",3.0

"I have had two of these so far.  Both broke where the threaded plastic piece connects the Al tube to the head.
I replaced the broken part with a hardwood dowel and held it with epoxy and screws.

"Have a twenty year old version of this that was better designed. These newer ones (or the particular one received) can come apart into two pieces very easily, whereas the twenty-year old Club never does this.  Also, even when the Club is extended and fully locked, we noticed that no matter which make or different style/shape of car steering wheel that it does work on, this current Club Lock design can technically be moved a little around the steering wheel. While the lock itself does not come out or off, the OLD CLUB version seems to really lock it in place. It seems to have to do with this newer lock design that allows the two ends to constantly move. Wish they kept the CLUB design AS-IS. Technically, it works, but the older CLUB lock seems to be a safer and sturdier design.  Also, this does not work with certain newer cars that have steering wheels where the open spaces are not wide enough, or sometimes it's just a huge plastic body within the steering wheel.  Test it first.",3.0
It seems to work. I still have my car but the plastic coating began to peal off before long.,3.0

Works okay just keeping in ATV for emergency small enough,3.0
It didn't last very long,3.0
Replaced the original--due to rusting and plastic cover falling off. This one automatically locks when the shaft is extended.,3.0
There's nothing wrong with this pump.  It works as advertised.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it's so much more awkward for my elderly mother to use.  We purchased for her to be able to pump up the tires on our boys bikes so they can ride when they go to stay at Grandma's.  We should have just splurged and gotten her the more-expensive yet much-easier-to-maneuver hand pump.,3.0

"I have one of these that must be 20 years old and the trigger just broke.  This is a great size for the little spray jobs and the gun is okay for the bucks but it has a couple of drawbacks.  I've never figured out how to completely break it down for cleaning but a good soaking in brush cleaner (spend the bucks for a gallon of brush cleaner - works much better than other solvents) and blowing it out and spraying solvent through it works well enough.

The spray pattern on this gun (at least the one I bought a long time ago) is basically conical shaped, either a small cone or a large cone but it will atomize nicely with about 30-40 psi.  I usually spray oil based urethane varnish and rarely need to add thinner.  Since I've bought this siphon feed gun, I've gone completely to gravity feed, you waste less product. I replaced this gun with a Devilbliss HVLP touch up gun (but twice the $$.)

Bottom line is if you can deal with siphon feed and shopping in the 40 buck price range, this is an okay buy.  Caveat: my model of this was made in Taiwan and the quality of it might be better, the same or worse than the current product.",3.0
good pump while it worked (almost a year) and for as cheap as it is it's still not a bad buy.,3.0

"We have used a lot of these DH6500 guns over the years in our business and I really like the way they spray. They are reasonably priced and spray just as good as a Binks or Devilbis gun without the $200 + price tag. Rather than trying to periodically rebuild more pricey guns, we buy these and throw them away when they begin to give trouble. The reason I am giving only 3 stars is because Campbell Hausfeld decided to cut corners and redesign the siphon tube so you can no longer rotate the siphon tube for flat or overhead spraying. This makes these guns nearly unusable for our applications. They had a great product and they should've stuck with it.",3.0
Fragile,3.0
"For what you pay for this gun it works fairly well. But if you think that you can do the same type work that you do with a top of the line gun, you will be unhappy with it. I used it to repaint farm equipment and it did ok for it. I don't think you would want to use it to repaint a car.",3.0

"I had bought of these about 20 years ago when it was a better quality gun but a lot more expensive.  MY old one had cracked seals and didn't work that great anymore so I figured I couldn't go wrong for under $30 now.  When I got it I could clearly see why it was cheaper.  It was made in China and wasn't as ""durable"" I would say as the original.  I mixed my paint tested it out, on a piece of cardboard and it laid out a nice beautiful pattern.  I got it adjusted and started painting my tractor and about 2 minutes later the trigger fails off because the bolts had been overtightened on the hinge and it broke.  I had already mixed my paint so i couldn't stop.  I found a nail and stuck in through the trigger to hold it on and finished painting.  I called Campbell Hausefeld, sent them the reciept and they said they would send me some new bolts.  I haven't gotten them yet and that was 2 weeks ago so I am glad I didn't need them in a hurry.  You get what you pay for.  I would have gladly paid $60-80 for the quality of the original instead of this turd.  We will see if it lasts beyond the 2nd use.",3.0
"This appears to be a well made inexpensive gun.  Unfortunately the product description does NOT explain that this gun will not work with a true HVLP turbine system rather, this is an HVLP ""conversion"" gun meant to be used with a conventional compressor unit.

I outsmarted myself by assuming that since my HVLP turbine is of the same Campbell Hausfeld brand this gun would make a good upgrade. Not so.

I gave it 3 stars as it is likely a good value IF your air source is a compressor rather than a turbine.

So....I wasted a little time but the peerless Amazon returns system worked as usual;painless and efficient.",3.0

"For an occasional use this may be a good buy, but not for heavy use which have done in fixing bikes (free). The pump will fill a typical 20'' x 2.125 tube (in tire) with about 17 full pumps, though the hose should be about 5'' longer to easly reach tires when the bike is upside down.

However, after less than 2 weeks 9maybe 500 pumps)  the one way valve (which is in the hose where it connect to the pump body) stopped working right, so that after building some pressure the air would come back up the tube. I called the company and to their  credit then sent a new pump as a free replacement, but after about 3 weeks the pump barrel came  off, somewhat ruining the threads. Fixing it with threading it with tape around the threads would be temporary, so i put the barrel of the old pump on it.

That has worked well, but recently the pump rod  guide at the top of the body,  that contains the spring, broke, though it does not much affect functionality. This is all within the space of 1 month.

So for the occasional user this could work well, but not for more regular use. If you want to lengthen the hose, oxygen tubing and 2 small hose clamps can work. Hope thus helps.",3.0
"The value is high on this pump at a price of about $15 but after receiving it, I realized I preferred one with a gauge and a sturdy system. As this would be a one-time purchase and not replacing it for decades, I opted to send it back and upgrade to a better system that had the features I thought would be of greater value for the long haul.  So, yes, 5 stars for the value this pump offers at Amazon's price but overall, 3 stars as there are much better ones out there that will cost you under $30 that have features that might come in handy in the future.",3.0

The product itself is fine. It is a lot less annoying to take on and off than I thought it would be. There has been an increase in car thief in my neighborhood. The club gives me more piece of mind. When it arrived in the mail the bubble plastic was open on one end. I noticed that some of the paint was chipped before I took it out the plastic container. I was a little annoyed but not enough to send it back.,3.0
"This worked fine with my Cruiser bike (thick, mountain-bike type tires) as long as it lasted, but a single drop from about 3 feet was all it took to break the nozzle attachment and render it unusable.

Pro:
attaches tightly w/o damagin the Schrader nozzle I've used it on
Con::
-takes a good many pumps, almost as many as you'd need w/ a small portable pump, to get the tires ideally inflated, even on thick tires like mine
-as noted, not sturdy.",3.0
Some others come with three keys but those are the more advanced keys with the holes drilled in them.  Bought as replacement for when I get down to one key left,3.0
"I just got my first ever brand-new car.  It's a Civic and I'm slightly worried that someone might want to steal it so I figured why not get The Club?  Yes, I'm aware a dedicated or professional thief can defeat The Club, but if I can deter ANY car thieves, then I'm better off, right?

So I went to my local Auto Parts chain outlet and stood looking at the options.  Decided against a ""brake pedal"" lock.  Figured I'm more likely to actually follow through with a steering wheel lock.

At my Auto Parts store they had two versions of The Club... the yellow double hooks version and this red ""original"" club, both ""Club"" brand.

The yellow double hooks version package stated that it had a $500 guarantee.  The red Original version's package said it had a $1800 guarantee.

The double hooks look like they'd be more of a hindrance to a thief, so I was really quite puzzled why it had less than a third of the Original's guarantee.  The yellow double hooks version also cost $20 at my Auto Parts Store whereas this red Original one cost $40.

I truly don't know whether there is something ""wrong"" or ""weaker"" about the yellow one or if the price and guarantee differences are nothing but a marketing gimmick but I decided to go with the Original.  (Probably heavily influenced by The Club commercials saturating tv when I was a kid in the 80's.)

The Club goes on and off my steering wheel just fine, as advertised.  The lock part DOES look/feel cheaply made.  The keys (2 included) feel pretty cheaply made, just slightly better than ""stamped out of sheet metal"" feel, but they are working.  There is a serial number engraved on the keys but it is very unclear and confusing whether or not it's possible to acquire additional spare keys if you need any.  I can't say yet whether The Club's an effective theft deterrent.  I guess you'd have to ask me in ten years.

But the guarantee is a HUGE JOKE!
It turns out that it only pays toward your theft deductible!  If you happen to be using The Club on a vehicle that does not have theft coverage then the ""guarantee"" is completely worthless!
If you have a $500 theft deductible then regardless of the ""up to $1800"" guarantee: you will only be reimbursed that $500.
As others have mentioned the ""guarantee"" is only good for one year.  What the heck is up with that???
You are required to ""register"" The Club with ONLY ONE vehicle and you have to do it within 5 days of purchase, yet they don't have a procedure for registering online.  You are forced to fill out a teeny tiny registration form that has teeny tiny writing on it and teeny tiny spaces for you to fill in.
You are REQUIRED to use the original registration form that was included in The Club's packaging, but guess what?  Mine was taped to the inside of the package and when I went to remove it it tore!  The tape was right on the section I needed to fill out, so that's the part of the page that tore!  If you go online to try to download a replacement all you will find is instructions to phone the company.  I did as instructed.  It was on a Wednesday about 11 am and I got a recording that said I needed to call back during their business hours!  If they're not open on a Wednesday at 11 am when the hell ARE they open?  Why the heck did they put tape RIGHT on the part of the precious, irreplaceable registration form that you need to fill out?
They REQUIRE your ORIGINAL register receipt, so: too bad if you prefer to keep your own receipts.
They also want ALL KINDS of information that is totally irrelevant  to auto security:  they want to know how much your annual household income is, your age, gender, profession...  It's almost like they plan on selling your information to marketers who will then send you spam and junk mail, and phone you during dinner!
To top it all off the registration form is riddled with spelling errors.  I know that's not the biggest deal on Earth but they've had 30 years to spell check this thing and yet the spelling looks like they got some English as a Second Language student to write it.

I called my insurance and found out that they don't even give a discount for use of a device like The Club.

Okay, so long story not exactly short:  I will use The Club on my little Honda and hope to deter the little punks who look up on the Internet ""How to Hot Wire A Civic"" but I recognize that The Club is NOT invincible.  I also really do not like the company ""Winner"" that makes these just because of how onerous a joke the whole ""registration"" and ""guarantee"" are.",3.0
"This pump works, but it's not the best. Pretty cheap but you get what you pay for. If I had to decide again, I would have spent a little more money for a nicer pump. It's worth the investment.",3.0
"We bought this Club to replace a 10 year old model where the lock cylinder had popped out. This new kind has an ordinary-looking flat key, whereas the old Club had a unique, round brass-looking key that conveyed a higher degree of security and innovation. The new key seems thin and cheaply made, and I hope it doesn't break off in the lock one day.

The plastic has a very strong smell, at least when used here in Arizona's hot summer temperatures. Hopefully those odors will go away soon.

There was some resistance getting it to open and close one day, but hopefully that was just a one-time fluke. Otherwise I'll have to get out the WD40 which id disappointing on a product less than a month old.

Bottom line is that I would have liked to see a little more attention to detail on this ""Rolls Royce"" steering wheel theft protection product. Doesn't seem product innovation has brought much good to the Club during the past 10 years.",3.0

If you have a road bike, you definitely want something that can get 100-120psi.  But at $10, you get your money's worth.  I bought this while deployed in Afghanistan, so I wasn't buying this for long term use.  This pump is made in China.",3.0
"it's not worth what i paid for it...made in china, of course, and at most it should be selling for $3! i'm keeping it cause it fits in the space i have it in, but i can't help feeling RIPPED-OFF!!",3.0
The numbers are large and it works as described. I had some issues just finding a nice spot to stick it on as the unit was fairly large. The light indicators works ok. Still no replacement for the car's OEM clock but for the price it's unbeatable.,3.0
"For the price I paid, I really could have just gone to a store and gotten a much nicer one.",3.0
"This clock is perfect at keeping time...I've had it several weeks now.  However, it is NOT easy to read at every angle.  I have a mini van and my clock went bad and it would cost a lot of money to fix, so I installed this little sucker.  Keep in mind if you are in a truck/van, your clock is lower than eye level, and I cannot see this little thing.  The light is perfect...you must buy one with a light if you are installing it in a car.  I left it in the van, however, it's simply not functional for me.  Do not get this if you need to see it lower than eye level.",3.0
"This digital clock works for the purpose I bought it for.  I was able to mount it using the screws rather than the tape because the tape just doesn't work as well.  I like that it is easy to remove from the mounting bracket to change the battery.  I like that it is illuminated at the touch of a button.  The only negative is that it doesn't keep time accurately, but it is close enough to still be of some value.

In conclusion, if you need a very percise time keeping clock, this isn't the one for you. If you don't mind having to resent it periodically, then you will like it.",3.0
"I bought this mainly to pump up pool side toys, however, the pump did not come with any attachment to accomodate the valve on the toys.

The end of the pump hose has a ""quick release"" designed for innertube valves only and the typical ""sports equipment"" needle does not attach to the hose.

If I only needed it for a bicycyle, then I would give it 5 starts but it is not adaptable for me my needs.",3.0
"This pump seems to work a lot better than the one I had as a kid.  It works quickly and without problems.

Update 4/9/2014:  After a lot of regular use, the tubing on the pump broke on me a few months back.  The wrapping around the tube shifted and did not restrict the stretching like it should have so it got a small hole in it.  Before the hole it worked great and I could probably replace the tube, but for the cost, it's probably better to just replace the whole thing.  I would suggest if you have this type of pump, regularly inspect the tube casing to make sure it is evenly spread where it needs to be or maybe even reinforce it before it gets too late.",3.0
"Product works as described.  Not built for constant use.  Purchased for junior high experiment and inflated pressurized devices up to half the maximum recommended psi.  However, after about 30 inflations, it broke in several places.  Would buy again, but not for this purpose.",3.0
"So, the pump is not bad, but it's not great. If you just need it to inflate a ball or or some schrader valve then it will probably get the job done. Don't buy this pump expecting to put on a presta adapter and inflate some new bike tires; it won't work.

The pump is solid, but the valve head feels very cheaply made. Keep your expectations low and you won't be disappointed.",3.0
"This might be a good option, although I wouldn't recommend it if you are actually planning to pump up to 50+ psi, despite the 70 psi rating.  I'm using it to get bike tires to 30psi.  I found that it leaks air through the top and the clamp has a tendency to pop off.  When I used it, I lost a lot of air initially and had to replace that air before adding any.  I was able to get from 20 psi, unintentionally down to 10 psi, then up to 30 psi with some effort, so it works, just not very efficiently.",3.0
"This is just the pump for bikes. It has no inserts to fill basketballs, soccer balls etc. Just note before you get this. if you intend to use it for stuff other than bikes then you'll need the inserts separately.",3.0
"Because this pump is small it is easy to get a lot of pressure. the fold-able foot pegs are also nice. Does the job

"Oh well, it seems like it was made in the 70s.  Very classic.  I just wished I bought one that told you how much psi was in the tire you are pumpin.  Oh, it does not have a pin for pumping up balls but the picture on the package shows balls to pump up, wtf?",3.0
"It comes quick, but the picture obviously looks better than the real product, so I have a little bit of dissappointment. Hope it can run a little long life.",3.0
"Realistically these are more a  ""better than nothing"" item for an older car than an effective theft deterrent. A halfway prepared car thief isn't going to bother with it. They will just cut the steering wheel and pull it off. I bought one for an older car that had no protection. This might slow down a thief who forgot their hacksaw.",3.0
"I won't if this works until someone tries to steal my SUV.  Until that time, which I hope never comes, The Club should deter a thief because of the time needed to remove it or cut the steering wheel.
What I know so far:
(1)  The unit weighs more than others listed on Amazon, and has a larger diameter than others I looked at locally.
(2)  The plastic coating was covered with an oily substance, and it reeked. It was easily removed using two household wipes.
(3)  Each of the three keys with it work.
(4)  The directions are well written and easy to follow.
(5)  No problems putting it on, or removing it from the steering wheel.
(6)  Registration requires that you cut out a form from the instruction sheet, complete it, and mail it with a sales receipt.
Minus one star for the bad smelling oil, which is not explained in the directions. Minus a second star for no online registration. I'll update this review if I learn the reason for the smelly oil substance or see anything adverse.

12/3/2014 - it can be installed to the back of the steering wheel so it's not resting on top of the air bag.  This positions the lock away from you, but it's still easy to unlock and lessens the chance of damaging the center of the steering wheel.",3.0

"I have purchased two pairs of these gloves in total.  They are quite warm when compared to other gloves I have worn, but they are somewhat lacking in durability.  I am a livestock farmer, and as such my gloves are exposed to wire and other protrusions on a consistent basis.  There are many points at which the secondary leather splits for greater mobility (at the knuckles, etc.).  This is actually a detriment as the primary leather is quite thin, and once it is worn, the waterproofing material soon follows.  The knuckle guard is an amusing feature, and somewhat useful in certain applications.  Yet after heavy use when this piece is still in near pristine condition (and grossly overbuilt) and I have multiple holes forming at the knuckles, secondary leather stitching is falling apart, etc., I must question the logic of the engineer who designed this product.  On a side note, the tips resist wear/puncture amazingly well, and I must say they are quite comfortable!  Once my current pair degrades, I will most likely switch back to a buffalo skin glove with an inner glove for insulation.  Not waterproof and slightly less insulating, but somewhat cheaper per unit and longevity is increased.",3.0
Ironclad Tundra I do like these gloves they do keep your hands warm as your working. If you are standing still not as great. I have worn them in about 20 to 40 degree weather and they have worked well.  In wet conditions the grip is not as great as I expected. I tested the gloves in a bucket of water and the gloves failed the test. I have yet to use them in heavy rain conditions after that. They make work alright in light rain conditions for awhile but I do believe you will get wet. I am finding out your best bet in staying dry is the atlas 460 pvc lined gloves. Pvc is about the only thing that will truly keep the water out.  You will  sweat  in these gloves are well lined I would suggest planning on having a fan to dry them out overnight for the next days work. . Liner does pull out a little when your hands are wet.  A little bulky hard to use with small controls. As I started using them in wet conditions the gloves didn't really have good grip and traction I thought they would.  I liked the knuckle padding helps to protect my hands in the conditions I work in. I think these are decent gloves but I will not buy another pair.,3.0
The dryer is good for getting water out of hard to get at places. However it keeps blowing water back onto places you have already dried and you must go over it and over it. You don't save time and you end up with lots of water spots that you have to polish out. Save your money and do it by hand. Use you leaf blower.,3.0

"It actually has some good air 'force', but drying a car with this device would take a VERY long time.  I tried it on my very small sports car (911), and quickly gave up and went for a towel.  It would help if your car had a perfectly waxed finish, where the water easily rolled off.  Otherwise, it would have taken about 25-30 minutes to get the surface of the car dry in my 65 degree garage.  On the other hand, it is useful for drying the wheels, brake rotors and brake calipers; and for blowing water out of the cracks and crevices - anywhere a towel can't go.  I wouldn't mind having one around for what it can do; but for the limited utility it provides, it just wasn't worth the money and garage space.  I returned it.",3.0
"Though it seems so blow enough air. It doesn't do a very good job, I had to go over areas on the bike quite a few times to get the area dry. It left the bike with a lot of water spots. I had to later go over with a rag to get ride of them.",3.0

"Can't expect much for the price, but my cutting wheel was screwed on off center, which while annoying doesn't really affect the tools usability.  It still marks better than my crown tools knife type marking gauge.  It does help to add a nylon washer to get the blade to spin.  Also, I used a counter sink so that the cutting wheel sits in the gauge face for storage.",3.0
"I have used this tool to mark cut lines for mortise and tenon joints, dovetail joints and guidelines for bracket/drawer slide mounting.  It takes a little practice to hold the tool firmly in a consistent manner so that the lines are scribed consistently.  I expect that any tool of this general design will have this issue.

This is a useful marking tool, easy to set and makes nice clean marks.

It might be nice to have measurements built into this tool rather than having to set the distance against a ruler, but it is very easy to set relative to an existing mark whose distance you want to duplicate.

The set screw does need to be firmly tighted and checked periodically to make sure that your distance setting has not changed during use.

I have found the need to frequently check that the screw securing the cutting blade is tight.  Once loose, the scribe marks are not accurate as the blade can wobble quite a bit with only a little play under the screw head.

On some of the more expensive marking guages I notice a recess in the guide wheel into which the cutter can be positioned for storage, but that is not a feature of this tool.  That seems like a good idea, but the lack of this feature has not caused me any problems.",3.0
"This is not a Veritas or TiteMark quality tool, but for $10 it is well worth it.  Sharpen the wheel cutter, and clean the locking wheel/bolt and it will work quite well.  You'll also need to shim/washer the cutter, to allow it to rotate freely.  Can't ask to much for $10, but after you fettle it some, it works.  It you want a quality wheel marker, buy the Veritas or Titemark, if you're cheap like me, buy this one and fix it up.",3.0

"The wheel that actually makes the marks is held on by a single screw with no washer or bearing. As the wheel is drawn across the wood to mark it, the wheel rotates and unscrews itself, introducing wobble and skewing the mark line. If you only draw the wheel across the wood in a direction which tightens the screw, this works okay, but the design could be improved.",3.0

"Every woodworking shop where tenons may be cut or dimensions transferred needs a tool like this.
However, they need one that the screw in the end which holds the circular knife blade on the shaft will stay tightened.  Dimensions marked on the shaft would help, too, but for the price this one is good enough.
I just hope they will put a little thread dope on that screw in the future.  If it comes loose and isn't noticed things can get way out of line very quickly.",3.0

"The screw that holds the scoring wheel on the end fell out after a few uses, and I realized that the threads were stripped. I tapped the hole for a slightly larger machine screw and drilled out the scoring wheel to accommodate it. While I was at it, I sharpened the scoring wheel with a file. From the factory it comes with a scored and rounded edge. (But then again, what tool doesn't require some sharpening before use?) The gauge works well now. I like the way it fits in my hand, and the fence tightens positively in place.",3.0

cons, The cutter was straight from being parted off on the lathe took an 45 min with a 300 and 600 dimond stone to get the edge to cut insted of dent the wood. The lock knob thread is loose in the head and will likely strip out.

"The marking gauge came to me as a gift and was generally as described.

The locking nut tightens and loosens easily, and the brass fence moves along the rod easily.

I only have two gripes, the first is cosmetic. I would have expected the brass to be a little bit better polished. It's mainly just dulled (my guess would be from spending a lot of time in the package).

My second gripe is with the carbide wheel that comes affixed to the tool. The carbide wheel is not perfectly circular. This creates an issue as the wheel is turned a bit while you are scribing. One part of the carbide wheel rides farther away from the fence than another. I can scribe two different lines about 1/16"" apart without moving the fence.

Easily replaced with a new disc, but I'd rather have the one that comes with the thing just work when I get it.",3.0
"I think it is a good buy for the money.  The only problem with it is the blade.  It came dull (I think the edge was actually rolled over from the manufacturing process).  The blade was denting the wood rather than cutting it.  Since the blade is conical on one side I couldn't sharpen it myself.  I gave it to a friend and he sharpened it on his lathe.  He gave me an electrical standoff, like those used in circuit boards, that I could attach the blade to and chuck up in my drill so that I may sharpen it myself in the future.  Also I stripped either the little screw that came with it to hold on the blade or the first couple of threads in the mating hole.  This was easily remedied with a new, longer screw.  In summary, a good value tool, but not ready to go out of the box.",3.0
"I received this booster seat and a $200 plus dollar highchair as a shower gift, but recently sold the expensive highchair via consignment and use this booster seat exclusively for my 21 month old son and 7 month old daughter. It accomodates both children with ease and one of the best things about it is that my son cannot wiggle out of the straps to stand up in the seat (like he did with the highchair). It's other ""plusses"" are that it's transportable and cleans easily (the expensive highchair had a cloth seat cover that had to be washed and air-dryed which I surmise was designed by someone without children). The only negative about this great little booster chair is the little placemat - the designs on it are not color fast and come off on the tray when it is washed. I just placed an order for a second one of these booster chairs, so I can feed both of my babies at the same time.",3.0

So now, there is a BIG gap between my daughter and our table.  I won't use the tray b/c it is just too small (I guess another drawback).  If you are going to buy this booster, just make sure it fits under your table.",3.0
"It's an OK seat. Basically, I found 4 major flaws:

1. The upper height adjustment would not stay in place due to low quality bendable plastic.

2. You need 3 hands to change reclining positions - 2 hands to push each button on each side and another hand to push or pull the back of the seat.

3. The newer model has a full-sized cushion (top and bottom) but it cannot be securely fastened to the seat, causing the baby (6 months) to slump.

4. Only in the most up-right position is the tray level. The tray is tilted in the other 2 reclined positions.

For $30, I don't think it's worth it. But since I haven't found a more suitable booster seat for my child, I'm going to keep this one for the time being. I could always return it later.",3.0
"This chair functions wonderfully, a great replacement/substitution for a high chair. Remember that it is plastic, so be careful assembling and don't 'force' it into position.

We were fortunate and observed our daughter placing the small rubber piece into her mouth and were able to retreive it before she tried to swallow it.

"Great creeper, slides over cables and other crap on my garage floor, but the only thing I don't like about it is those cut out grooves in the body, they trap dirt and nuts and bolts and sometimes tools, which I really hate.. So spare yourself the extra cash and buy the solid body one, its a great product, it supports good weight too.",3.0
"First, the good: The creeper seems to be very well made.  The plastic looks quite sturdy and it has a good heft to it.  Looking it over it looks quite substantial.

Now, the bad: The ad says that this creeper is 43 inches long.  Well it is, but it also isn't.  The creeper is 43 inches long from the outside of one wheel well to the outside of the other.  However, the center part of the creeper, the place where you can actually lay your body, is only 36 3/8 inches long.

I purchased this creeper because at 6'4"" my 35 inch long Craftsman left either my head or my fanny scraping the floor.  I saw the 43 inches length mentioned in the ad and thought I'd found the answer.  The Bone-ster is a bit longer than my Craftsman, but only 1 3/8 inch longer in measurement of the actual useable length.

I'm glad the company brought out this product as it seems much, much better than the rest of the creepers out there.  I wish, though, that they would bring out a tall man's version of this, something with at least 40 or 42 inches of actual, useable length.  Would I pay another $50 or $60 for such a creeper?  You better believe it.

If you're 5'8"" or 5'9"" or even 6'1"", this is a fantastic creeper that is well worth the price.  If you're 6'2"" or taller and if you're feeling your present creeper is too short, things are not really going to be better with the Bone-ster.  Can I fit on it?  Yes, just absolutely barely without a 1/4"" to spare.  But it's a royal PITA to have to adjust myself just so.  Another 4 or 6 inches of plastic would really help.

So please understand what I'm saying: Very nice creeper, but not ideal for tall people.  If Dale Adams ever brings out a 40 inch version (The Long Bone? The Femur?), it's going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread.",3.0
"Bought this a month or so ago. Good quality and rolls easily on the floor. The opportunity is there to make this almost perfect as creepers go, but they chose to not put a padded headrest on this model. I'm 6'2/230 lbs and it's long enough but I don't like it not having the headrest. I'm putting a piece of foam under my head when I use it. I don't think you should have to do this! They need to retrofit this model and get it right. I would have paid a few more dollars to get it. I would have given it 5 stars if the headrest was there.",3.0

"This works, but the ""easily unloads your 2000 lbs load in 30 seconds"" isn't totally true when you add in needing to set up the ideal conditions needed as well the load capasity being less than you may expect.  I got this when my brother ask if I'd help him get a bunch of fill dirt for his yard.  It did help with emptying the truck bed more quickly, but it isn't making things as easy as if you'd added a hydraulic dump (as they may try to make you think it is).

This is pretty much a 4 foot wide woven ""tarp"" that gets wound up on a pipe on the end of the tail gate to ""conveyor belt"" things to your tail gate.  The crank handle is just a flat bar that slides in a slot cut in the pipe (which easily falls out of the slot when you're not holding it) and has a bolt with a plastic sleeve as the actual ""handle"".  I have a plastic bed liner where this tarp rides fine on it, but if you have a spray-in liner I'm not sure if it would work well since they are like ""sandpaper"" and the woven tarp would likely snag on it (see their ""double mat"" for use with this if you have such).

When I used it, I'm almost sure now that I overloaded it, so my tail gate now has indentations where the brackets for the pipe were (despite the rubber in them to cushion it).  Also the mount brackets have pulled off of the tail gate when first starting to pull the load off of the truck (because it was easier for the pipe to move toward the load instead of the load move to the pipe), so I've had to have someone help hold them down as I start winding it.  Perhaps the overloading seems like my wrong-doing, but they do say ""helps you with hauling, rock, dirt, & much more"" even showing that in the ad pictures (they have more pictures with the 3000lbs model&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Load-Handler-Cargo-Unloader-3000-Lb-Capacity-Commercial-Grade/dp/B0000AXCSP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Load Handler Cargo Unloader - 3000-Lb. Capacity, Commercial Grade</a>).  A full size truck like mine can easily end up with ~4000 lbs load and how do you know just by eyeballing it what the weight is?  Running some math now, to keep a load of dirt under 2000 lbs even with pretty dry soil (that is said to be about 75lbs per cubic yard with wet soil being over 100lbs), in a 8 X 4 foot bed you need to get only a 10 inch high load and that is about 1/2 the height of most beds.  I can understand it being hard to engineer something for a full bed load, but if it's to be used for such things as they say & show who wants to only get 1/2 what they could in each trip?  The pictures do show the peak of the load just at the bed height with very little on the sides, but is that what you're likely to get when at the nursery?

I found it helpful to use a typical tarp on top of this units ""tarp"" to try to have an easier way to gather the dirt from the corners, funnel the dirt into a wheel barrow while unloading, cover the load while on the road, and keep the dirt out of this units woven fabric.  Also before winding it, I first need to dig out the area between the wheel wells & cab on each side throwing that dirt onto the tail gate (partly to help weigh it down).  If I don't do that, any dirt that's between the cab and those wheel wells makes it seem like the load is hitting a wall where it's impossible to wind this up.  Again, the pictures show the perfect pile centered in the truck (with almost nothing going into those sides), but after you've driven very far (going over some bumps etc) it will probably have shifted to the sides making you have to dig them out.  I also need to dig out behind the wheel wells some because dirt falling toward the sides has caught my tarp in the trucks tailgate cables.

Also when preparing to get a load, I extend this units tarp so it comes off the pipe down the tail gate, across the full bed, then back up the bed wall along the cab.  That makes it so as the load is being pulled toward the back and some dirt falls toward the cab, an extra couple feet of tarp will catch that dirt and bring it along with the rest. Someone else also suggested putting ""folds' in the tarp as you lay it out so you can pull part of the load off, then more.  That may work somewhat, but I doubt you'd have enough tarp to do many folds.",3.0
This blanket has been great for our winter travels.  The only downside is that it cannot be machine washed.  Didn't think to check that before buying.  It is great for the family mini van.,3.0
"I bought this for transporting a large musical instrument over long drives in the winter.  So far it seems to have worked.  My gripes so far are: 1. small.  at least for the instrument.  I got a second one, but for most folks using this for the ""regular"" reasons, it should be ok.  A little larger would still be nice though.  2. the plug fell apart.  I was able to reassemble it, but it shouldn't have twisted apart on the third use.  3. no temp control.  It would be nice for the ability to set it on different temps, but this one heats to one temp only.  It isn't too hot or anything, but sometimes I'd like to be able to regulate it more.  4. it heats quicker when it is folded up.  When it isn't, it may take a long time.

"I bought this deer alert for my motorcycle, we ride alot of forested asphalt and dirt roads in the western us. 2 yrs ago I hit a deer with my bike , so i was looking for a deterent of hitting deer again. I settled on this alert because it makes noise at any speed and you can tell if it is working. just got back from riding one week in N Calif and noticed deer along the road and back in the fields perk up and watch me as i went by,the other bikes in the group recieved no such special attention, other animals also seem to notice and flee. the sound the device makes resembles a wounded creature of somekind. I basically think the device gets the animal to notice you and watch opposed to not noticing you and just running where ever they may please and in your path. Glad I now own one.",3.0

"Living up north surrounded by woods, my husband and I are terrified of driving at night. After we narrowly escaped hitting a family of deer a few months back, I decided to look into a product to help ourselves and the poor animals. This product had good reviews, was all natural, and was ""easy to install"", so I purchased it. Now since we've had the deer alert on our car, we have since had no troubles, however, as I titled this review, the installation couldn't be any farther from easy. Upon opening the alert, we were met with a foot of wires and an instruction booklet with two options for installation. The first consisted of about 5 steps that involved running the wires through your firewall into your car, and, "" connect wire from the switch to any chassis ground"" and also to attach the wires to a fused source of a +12V which, if you don't have one, it's recommended  to purchase a 1/4 amp fuse? Now maybe I'm just not a mechanic, but these instructions might as well had been in Swedish! The only other option was to have an actual mechanic install it for you. Now I don't know a mechanic so I took it down to my auto shop, where they were able to put it together, but it did cost me labor. So while I do enjoy that we've been deer free since installing the product, I was a little bit upset that it requires you to make an additional purchase, be it from buying the amp they suggest or having someone else put it together for you. Just a heads up for anybody as clueless to auto parts as I am!",3.0

"Bought one of these in December 2012 (local brick&mortar, not Amazon). Found it toasty and comfortable (it did leave a lot of blue fuzz on my cloth seats that was hard to remove without sticky lint gloves or the like).

Noticed this winter it didn't seem as warm as I remembered. Sure enough, its (single) zigzaggy strand of heat wire had broken in one spot, ending it completely as a heated blanket (one could still use it as a plain blanket that sheds blue fuzz). I had tried to treat it gently, roll not fold, etc., but I guess three winters were about what it could take.

When it worked, I never felt that it was so warm as to endanger me, so the timed-off feature seemed a bit overcautious. On longer drives, I would repeatedly notice myself getting chilly, then think ""oh, yeah, push the button again.""

"On the 1st night of having this installed, I had a couple dogs that were crossing the road literally stop in the middle of the road to turn and look at me, if it weren't for me having my brights and driving lights on, I would have hit them for sure.  On the 2nd night, I had some deer that were standing on the side of the road turn and look at me, I saw them in plenty of time due to my brights and driving lights, then as I got closer to them, they ran right out in front of me.  About a week later, I had another batch of deer wait until I got closer then stop grazing and run in front of me.

I've come to the conclusion the following:

1:  The noise of this thing is loud enough to be heard for quite a distance, but the deer are too stupid to know that it means to run away, instead, they wait until you're up close and run right into your path.

2:  I think it attracts deer, especially the stupid ones.

3:  Dogs interpret this noise as ""come out from wherever you are and chase me down the road"", or in the case of night one.  Stop in the middle of the road and stare at me.

4:  If you really want to avoid hitting deer / animals, get one or both of these instead:

Connecting them to the Hi-Beams dosen't seem much better to me. I ran a wire to an inside switch because I sure wouldn't want them running in a town or even at a traffic light.  My personal opinion is that they don't work anyhow.  I believe that deer whistles of both types have been professionally tested & the results indicated that they don't work.

The blanket would have been much more useful to me if it gave me a quick boost of heat the instant it was on, to save me from those first chilly 10 minutes; or if it did not have a timer, I could plug it into a jump-starter (while sleeping in the car or a tent) for keeping me warm on a cold night; but the timer makes that difficult.

"I bought this product primarily because of the claims that unlike other products it conforms to the shape of your windshield, thus making for more productive ice removal. Well, don't believe it. At the low temperatures at which you'll be using this product, it doesn't bend much. I found that it doesn't really do any better than any other ice scraper. The relatively soft plastic is also a detriment. If you want a good ice scraper, go for the harder acrylic type. When scraping ice, the harder the better.",3.0
"I live in the South and while I didn't really need a 'monster scraper' it looked great and got good reviews so I bought it.  Since the majority of what we experience is a light frost and not a heavy icing of our windows, a lot of the functionality of the IceDozer is wasted.  Not only do I not need the ice breaking ribs on the bottom... they actually make it harder to scrape off the frost.  What happens is as you scrape, it makes about 20 small scrapes at about 1mm each.  There doesn't seem to be enough flex to fully engage the flat portion of the blade, so while it is wide, I have to make just as many passes as I did with our old scraper which was half the width.  We did have two ice storms this winter and for the real ice that formed, this thing was a beast.  It knocked it out in no time.

Bottom line... If you need to scrape off thick ice, this thing is the king of scrapers.  However, if you want to scrape lighter frost, you might want to look elsewhere.",3.0
"The Icedozer works pretty well on flat windshields, for example my Jeep. It's performance isn't as impressive on curved windshields, it only scrapes off thin slivers of ice due to the flatness of the blade.

We only got to try it twice this past winter on two different vehicles and two different conditions. The first time it performed admirably since the ice build up was thin. The ""smashing"" motion worked to create a break point and while ""dozing"" the ice crumbled and came off in sections easily.

However, with the thicker ice (~3-4 mm) the smashing motion did not seem to do much and while scraping/dozing, especially on a curved windshield, the scraper did not perform any better then a standard ice scraper.",3.0
I received this as a gift.  It works really well on my car as I can reach the window with no problems.  It is hard to use on my truck though because of the angle of the grip.

"I got one last year, and the blade had chips in it by the end of the year. It still works well but there are gaps that don't get scraped in one swipe. Also the handle isn't very long, so if you are shorter than me (6'2"") you might not be able to scrape your whole windshield.",3.0

Knowing shovels would not be adequate, I purchased 15 IceDozers in hope for more efficient workmen.  I came to realize my men were coming to work with sore backs, blistered hands and shattered egos.  My start up is now losing money because of this faulty product, it should really only be recommended for small houses.

If you still wish to try your luck with this product, there is a modification that can increase your productivity.  I found that taping/gluing a broom handle to the IceDozer will allow you more leverage while while scraping.  None the less, be sure to know an accurate square footage estimate of the property you will be working on.  I would not use this on a house larger than 3,000 square feet, or 4,500 if you are using the broom handle modification.",3.0
"Just a note that in the video demo, obviously the ice covered windshield has been warmed up from the inside, as the ice is pushed off in one big sheet on the IceDozer side, which only happens if the defroster has been running for a while. In real life, banging the ""teeth"" into thin hard ice on a cold car doesn't do much to tenderize it. Works better on side windows where you can lean into the handle over the blade, and push with the other handle, but you can't do that on the windshield and back window, so it's essentially like a regular old ice scraper. Have only had a couple chances to use it this winter, but I am a little disappointed so far.",3.0
"I appreciated being able to throw my body weight behind the IceDozer. Unfortunately, this item is not very good at removing a thin coating of ice. It just slides over the thin stuff without removing much of it It's great at removing ice that's thick-enough to have an edge that the Dozer can bite into.

"Tool was awesome! Definitely helped with the engine work I needed done. Only thing was, the tool looled like it had a gouge in it, like it was dropped before packaging.

"Used this to facilitate the changing of the timing belt on a 2008 Honda Pilot.  It got the job done but here is my criticism of the product.  Basically the part fits in the harmonic balancer fly wheel with a lot a slop or free play.

So to the manufacturer, why is the tolerance of this so far on the loose side?",3.0

I used this to remove crank pulley on my 2003 civic. I am giving 3 stars because these tool won't fit correct and it drops on the floor. I rented  one from the local auto store prior to this and that was also loose. I guess they makes all these like that.,3.0
I needed this tool to remove the balancer for some top end work I was doing and noticed it was smaller than the 50mm it stamps on the package and the tool itself. Its more like 47.5 mm or 48mm. So it had play when trying to remove the bolt and again when torqueing down. However it got the job done but it was a pain trying to keep the tool in place without it wanting to fall out. Get it.,3.0

After a little welding, was able to get it to work for us.",3.0
"Works to get the job done but does not fit very snug allowing it to fall out easily. It did allow me to get the bolt out but you will need a 1/2"" breaker bar for it, 24"". And for the crank bolt, it was a 19 mm and you will need a deep socket for the most part.",3.0

"This was recommended as the way hold the crank pulley still while you yank the gigantic bolt out of the crank pulley on a Honda Pilot. It didn't work as advertised, and was pretty wobbly. It was quite difficult to use with only two hands.

I ended up pulling all of the spark plug leads and using a breaker bar and the 'starter bump method' to get the bolt out.",3.0
"I used this tool for a 2002 rsx type-s and have a few issues with it. firstly, the bore down the center is too small to fit over the large diameter washer on the crank pulley bolt. This means that when you go to insert it into the crank pulley the hex portion of the tool doesn't make good contact (only about 4-5mm depth). Secondly, the hex portion itself seems to be a bit undersized (measured at ~49mm) and there seems to be 1-2mm worth of slop in the tool when I insert it into the pulley.

Now luckily I have access to a milling machine so I was able to bore out the center a bit wider so that it would fit over the washer. The tools original center bore was 38mm diameter, I added a 43mm (7.5mm deep) counter bore to the end of the tool which cleared the washer with plenty to spare. Oh and for the record the over sized crank washer is 40mm in diameter, much too large to fit through the original bore.",3.0
Worked out for the vehicle it was purchased for,3.0
"Used this on a 2001 Honda Civic EX.  It did the job, but it was a very loose fit in the crank pulley. It kept falling out of the pulley and I had to rig it to stay in.  I imagine that there is a better tool out there, none-the-less, it allowed the use of a torque wrench to install the crank pulley onto the shaft, as opposed to using an impact wrench like an amateur.",3.0
"I did a timing belt replacement on a 05 Acura TL. This tool does fit in the crank pully but its a bit loose so it moves slightly as you tighten down on the bolt. As a result of a stubborn bolt and a 4 foot cheater bar flexing too much I went the route of the bump start method which worked on the third try.
This tool is needed when you re-install the bolt to the required torque.",3.0
The tool is of quality.  The design could be better.  The handle with the square key way to insert the breaker bar could be longer.  I was not able to get enough leverage to break he crankshaft bolt loose.  I resorted to the old trick of using the starter motor to break the bolt loose so the tool was of no use at that point.,3.0
"got the job done, but this tool seams a bit loose in the crank shaft pulley, it does not appear to have stripped the pulley holder, but not the best fit for 2013 Honda Accord V6 crank unscrewing which you need ~ 1,000 lbs/in torque",3.0
"I purchased this tool to aid in the replacement of the timing belt and related components on my 2003 Honda Accord V-6.
I had read that the pulley was a real bear to loosen thus I opted to order this tool. As it turned out the tool was not needed. The pulley was loosened without the need of the tool. So I have a brand new unused tool that assume would work well for it`s assigned duty. Does anyone need this specific tool? I have an unused one.

It is not perfectly fit on my 2001 Acura MDX I use some tricks and manage to use anyways this done my job.,3.0
"Title says it all. It works ok, don't care much for how far out the piece that the breaker bar goes in is though. It tend to make this tool fall out of the socket a lot, and when you're trying to loosen a bolt that has 181ftlb of torque and ten years of use with a tool that slips, it makes for a good reason to do a little cussing.

If you have the transmission off like I did for this job, go with a ring gear holder, it'll make life a lot easier.",3.0
I cant brag about this tool by no means cause it will take more than one person to do a simple job like remove a crank pulley. The depth of the crank pulley on most hondas is not deep enough for this tool to set firmly inside without falling due to gravity. It was necessary to remove my crank in order to change my timing belt so a job that looks easy turned into an all day event. The concept of the tool is on point but maybe add magnets to help hold in place or change the design to prevent the tool from falling out on its own. VERY FRUSTRATING!!!!!,3.0
Hope to use this in near future. Needed this tool to break free the crank shaft nut to replace timing belt.,3.0
"The socket does not fit well enough in the pulley hole to stay securely engaged while torque is being applied.  It got the job done but only after several faled attempts when it would fall out of the hole in the pulley.  Possibly if another person were available to help by holding the attached breaker bar it would have got the job done quicker, but it did finally engage and hold long enough to break the bolt loose.  The socket is very robust and I did not sense any problem with flexing or other undesirable traits while resisting a torque of around 400 lb-ft.  I gave it three stars primarily because of the sloppy fit.",3.0
"This tool works like a charm....
For the Tool: 1/2"" breaker bar with cheater pipe, backed up on the floor with blocks of wood and worn brake pads
For the Bolt: 19mm socket with 3/4"" drive, 16"" extension with 3/4"" breaker bar 3' cheater pipe and a jack stand

It was loose in one solid pull :), but alas there is a Drawback in that this tool CONTAINS LEAD and needs to be handled accordingly. Usage of gloves or frequent washing of hands is advised.

"The tool helped with the removal of the harmonic balancer bolt on a 1997 Honda Civic.  It didn't help when attempted to remove the harmonic balancer bolt on a Honda Accord (not a snug fit on 2001 Honda Accord) or a Honda Odyssey.  The angled wrench adapter provided sufficient clearance for a wrench or breaker bar; but caused the tool to fall off the harmonic balancer, while the breaker bar rested on the floor or suspension arm.",3.0
"Tool helped. Only after it had to wedge itself in the hexagon. This product should have been larger so it didn't need to wedge itself in the hexagon and that is why I gave it 3 out of 5.

I used this and a long 10 ft pole and 2 breaker bars. Good Luck

This tool is fine for occasional use.  It falls out if you don't hold it in place until you have your breaker bar braced against the car frame or the floor and pressure on the tool.  If you are going to be doing this work on a regular basis spend the extra money to get the Honda tool.,3.0
"Invaluable for replacing the timing belt on Hondas, Previous effort with my civic was a nightmare. I had to find someone with a powerful enough impact gun after mine failed to get the crank pulley bolt loose. Recently did my sons Acura and this tool was the perfect key. Couple breaker bars and extensions, Jack stand as fulcrum point and a piece of pipe and the bolt broke loose nicely. The only way to go!",3.0

"Got this wrench to remove the crankshaft pulley bolt from a Honda Civic (regular tools and an impact wrench running 90 PSI wouldn't do the trick) Altough it slipped out of the pulley a number of times, I was finally able to to get it locked in place and removed the bolt # I used a breaker bar and a 3 foot extention butted against the concrete garage floor attached to this tool along with another breaker bar with a long extention, another pipe extender and an impact socket leveraged off of a jackstand attached to the bolt. It sounded like a gunshot when the bolt finally broke loose. New timing belt, tensioner pulley and water pump were installed and the Civic is back on the road. This is a stop gap tool to use in an emergency but not the best choice if you are going to change Honda timing belts often. OK for the home mechanic but not professional grade. I worked for me but you will have to have patience to make it work for you. Incidentally, use an impact socket on the bolt, on the first try, I broke a 1/2 inch drive SK regular twelve point socket!",3.0

"After years of using these filters on and off with various older cars, here is the bottom line.  I currently have one in my 2012 Chrysler 300C Hemi.  Runs great, as this engine does not have a MAF sensor, only a IAT (intake air temperature) which is not anywhere near as sensitive as a MAF.  I do clean the IAT once in a while with MAF sensor spray cleaner.  A few small blasts, and it's done.  Now moving on, I tried K&N panels filters in my
wife's 2011 Jaguar XF, which has two air filters under hood directed into the engine.  They do use MAF sensors.  After about four months after install, the car would have stumbling idle when sitting still.  Never happened before.  The MAF's showed no visible sign of oil build up, but something was wrong.  So I cleaned the MAF's with spray, and installed OEM Jaguar paper filters.  No more problems, and the idle is smooth as silk.  Bottom line:  I will avoid these K&N filters if the vehicle has a MAF sensor.  Not worth the hassle.  No MAF, OK.  MAF sensor, no way.",3.0

Honestly, the truck seems to respond pretty much the same as with the factory filter.

Haven't noticed much of a difference.,3.0
"Increased mileage is probably in your imagination.
Dont take my word for it ask an automotive engineer
 I've had K&N filters before.  I know how modern EFI systems, as opposed to carbs, work.  The only performance increase will be in full throttle acceleration, in most cars.
If you never put the pedal to the metal, you will see no benefit because the engine computer meters the fuel to the actual air flow AFTER the filter as measured by the MAF {Mass Air Sensor}.. and verifies mixture by sampling the O2 sensors in the exhaust.
Caveat:  you must bear in mind that the MAF gets dirty over tens of thousands of miles.  The oil coating used in K&N will make that worse.  When the MAF gets dirty, you may see some mileage increase because the computer thinks there is less air flow and injects less fuel... never much because the computer will trim the mixture based on O2 sampling.",3.0
"I bought this filter for 2 reasons, the first being that it is cleanable and re usable, the second being that it was supposed to give better performance and mileage.

it is what i expected nothing to write about,3.0
"Product photo is deceiving, think burger advertisements; rather, take a look at some of the buyer images. Since it folds up, the basket is somewhat flimsy, there are pronounced concave creases at the top opening at the width edges, it is not rigid. Also, the lid is ineffective and, quite frankly, in the way. You'll see big gaps between the closed lid and the troubled width at the top. How does this reduce odors? It would be nice if this lid came off with a Velcro strip.

Although the weighed bottom seems effective, the ""grip"" strips do not attach to carpeted floor mats. Not sure what material, other than customer installed Velcro, they were designed for.

The side pouch, while handy, is very tight. I found it difficult to force a travel-pack of handy wipes into it.

Finally, this trash can has a large footprint, it will take up some space in your vehicle. Maybe a fine  trade-off for families, but for the solo driver, you may want to opt for the smaller version.",3.0

So you need to make sure you are not through that out along with anything else that is in it. I actually put Velcro in the bottom of mine and attached it to the weight itself.

This is definitely leak proof as well, but make sure you are not putting anything sticky in it. If you do, it is fine, but you will need to make sure you are wiping it out otherwise it will get all over the weight as well.",3.0

The attic fan motor was a good replacement but there was one difference. The older 20 year old version did not have oil holes. The new one did (that's great) but the hole were upside down and oil would not go to bearings. Maybe rotating the cover would solve the problem.,4.0
"Its a fan motor.  Works fine if you have a standard attic fan with a 1/2"" shaft.",4.0
"A pain to install, but so far, so good.",4.0
"Great product - is working right now in my attic.  Be careful though, this is the short shaft version,  I actually needed the longer shaft version but was able to barely make this one fit, and it might wear out sooner because of the way I had to modify that.  If you need a longer shaft take a look at motor #PD144, it has a 4"" long shaft with similar mounting characteristics.",4.0
"As advertised, Easy to install, works as expected.",4.0
"I ordered this in the Amazon-recommended set with a fan and a thermostat and, though I had to drill a whole in the original mounting bracket because the old motor had 4 mounting bolts while this one has only 3, the installation was quick and easy.

Slightly noisy.,4.0
"This fan was very simple to install without instructions, although instructions were included. The fan fits perfectly for the original Lomanco fan I had. The 3 mounting brackets perfectly matched screw holes used by the ""triangle"" shape mount of the original fan. As far as noise, I would say it is roughly the same as the original fan before its bearing wore out. It has been on constantly for the last 2 months without incident.",4.0
Pretty good fit.  Shaft is shorter than previous which made installation somewhat interesting.  Works great.,4.0
I used this as a direct replacement for a similar model. The motor/housing was the same but the shaft was a bit longer. Required some minor mounting changes but all in all please and will recommend without reservation. Good motor!,4.0

"This had the same part number as the motor on a non-Lomanco attic fan that I was looking to replace, and since it also looked identical to the one I needed to replace, I went ahead and ordered it.  Turns out that there was a minor difference in that the shaft is slightly shorter than the original one in my fan.  This made clearance between the fan blades and the mounting brackets a little close, but it was workable.",4.0
"Perfect replacement for original.  Come with extra brackets and easy to install instructions.  The only draw back was that while the delivery was on time, it took a long time to process, but all in all a great replacement at a better price than from supplier",4.0
Great replacement motor. No issues.,4.0
"Perfect Fit. Now we will see how long it lasts....The first one lasted about a year and a half. It's easy enough to replace, fit is good, wires are long enough, it just seems to be the bearings holding up to the environment that it's in. Hot and Humid. I'd say oil ports for the bearings wouild help, but then I have to remember to oil it",4.0

great product,4.0
"Works fine (for how long who knows). If using a prior belly band mount, you may find the motor is a bit loose in the band. Take a few wood shims and insert them inside the band. Also pay attention to the position of the coax cable to be sure you mount the motor in the same position. Otherwise the cord will not reach where it did before and you will spend another joyous hour in the attic redoing the whole job (as I did).  Also  check the shaft length versus the existing motor. This one was a bit shorter than my old one, but it fit after I bent the fan blades slightly.  I wish someone made better quality motors (bearing always fail) for this  application. they don't seem to last more than a year or two. Will give up replacing after this one fails. Just not worth the trouble.",4.0

Distributors were saying full shipments were being sent back to china due to quality issues and lead times were months out.  When our Broan failed after 1 year, we needed something.  This fit the bill.  However.... the shaft is MUCH shorter than Broan's, so the fan blade BARELY fit (needed to bend the blades slightly to not have it hit).",4.0

"The blower motor on the overhead gas furnace in my shop had seized up (it was 21 years in service) and I needed a replacement with exact specifications.

"I was looking for a replacement motor for a Ventamatic Model F0510B2536. This Lomanco unit is close.
The units are electrically identical. Both have body diameter of 5 inches (this is probably the most important physical dimension, for the purposes of mounting).
Ventamatic motor thickness is around 2 and 1/4 inches while the Lomanco is 2 inches (thinner but still installed OK; the rotors are also different in thickness, so the the original rotor with longer shaft is not interchangeable with new motor...I gave it a try, but it will not work).
The shaft diameter of both is 1/2 inch, so old fan blade fit; the clearance to the motor body is very close, but still adequate; hand bent the fan blades a little, just to be sure.
The biggest difference is the exposed shaft length. The original is 2 and 3/8 inches; the Lomanco is listed 1.75 inches on Amazon webpage. (confirmed it is shorter, but did not measure before installing unit).
Motor came on when tested. I may update this review after it has had a chance to run this summer.",4.0
"Just one small problem , does not come with metal sheathing for wires. Had to scrounge old metal wire covering from old motor . thank god I had not discarded it.",4.0
"I choose this motor as an exact replacement for an attic fan installed to vent pipe smoke from a den room.  The old one (Lomanco) lasted many more years than expected considering the amount of smoke that passed through it.
Mounting this motor was much different than the old one therefore I had to re-configure installation in the fan.  Service was good and the product was as expected.
Would recommend this to a friend.",4.0
"I had to read the instructions a couple times & think about them for a few minutes -- it was my first attic fan replacement.

My attic space is hard to work in, no floor, so I removed the whole fan assembly from my attic - not just the motor - and did the replacement on a work table in my hallway.  It was easy to swap the motors.

When I remounted the fan in the attic, I added some vibration dampeners -- Spenco insoles -- to the wooden fan frame.  That cut vibration and noise.",4.0
"The fan works great, however it does make a small vibration sound. It has been tightened and still makes sound, so it may be that the excisting outer casing is older and that could be causing the vibration. The fan makes a big difference in the air circulation, and works much better than the previous fan.",4.0
My order was processed quickly and the fan motor was delivered in a timely manner.  The motor fit perfectly into the band after the old motor was removed and did not require the new brackets.  Since the motor is mounted up in a vent it is difficult to lubricate to maintain the bearings.  A motor with sealed bearings would be better for a longer useful life.,4.0
I installed this fan motor as a replacement for my attic ventilator motor that had seized up.  The existing unit was not a Lomanco but the size and rating of the fan matched what I had.  The installation worked out fine and the fan has been operating for about two months now.,4.0
"received it very fast and installed it very late (lol) and it is working just fine, a little oil on it would be better.",4.0

"Took about an hour all told to replace the fan motor and thermostat.  Existing brackets shifted a bit during install so that blade hit housing, but a little bolt loosening and jigging realigned it.

Purchased this part for attic fan last year.  It was easy to install and It has been performing  as expected.,4.0
"Having been in my house for a little over a year, I had discovered the existing ventilation fan hadn't been operating.  Ordered this replacement, along with the Duostat (thermostat/humidistat).  I am happy with how the setup works to clear the attic space of moisture.  I have the humidity setting at 55%.  However, the low hum of the motor can be maddening.  The benefit far outweighs this irritant, but I would recommend buffering the noise or adding extra insulation to kill the noise.",4.0
Replaced the motor on the roof fan for the 2nd time. The last one lasted about 7 years. Too bad their is no way to lubricate them.,4.0
"I was happy to find a replacement motor for my Lomanco power roof vent. This replaced an orginal fan motor from 1986.  I would give it 5 stars except for the ""unniversal"" mounting brackets.  They were somewhat difficult to align while placing the unit in the existing space. I replaced the fan and the thermostat at the same time as the motor.  I probably didn't have to but I didn't want any problems relating to an old fan that may not have fit the shaft of the new motor.  This was much better than replacing the entire vent from the roof exterior. All itmes were shipped promptly. Overall, the hardest part of the install was the odd position I had to be in while mounting the motor and connecting the wriing to the new thermo/humidistat.",4.0

I replaced two non functioning power ventilation fans in the attic of 1976 home (original, still good, roof). Ordered these fan as replacements based on make and model, only spent a few minutes double checking description. Reused blades from old fans. The universal mounting hardware that was included worked perfectly on first try. When I triggered the individual temperature switches both fans started as expected. First fan runs very quietly, second one has slight humming noise (sounds like electrical noise, not balance problem). I would say that for the price I got a good deal.",4.0
"I'm no mechanic, but was able to easily replace the motor in our attic power vent with this new one in about an hour.  Fit was perfect, and no problems were encountered.  Only shortcoming is the overall design of the motor, which uses bushings instead of bearings, and thus will have a shorter life than a better-built motor that would probably cost a lot more.",4.0
"Received it in a very short time. I am happy with purchase. The only problem was the fan motor shaft was about 1/2"" shorter than the one I was replacing. I had to do some customizing to make it fit. But it was relatively easy.",4.0
The motor I was replacing didn't have a direct replacement part.  This motor had the right specs and fit perfect into the mounting brackets.,4.0
"The old attic fan motor died and I initially bought a new motor from a large box store with the thought to reuse the blades I already had.  BUT, the set screw was so tight into the motor rod that it was impossible to release it.  My advice, don't bother.  Buy the motor and new blades together. There is no instruction sheet enclosed so KEEP YOUR OLD ONE onhand so that you know which way the blades are facing).  My old attic fan was attached using a belt bracket that went around the motor so the installation of this one was easy. You will need two people to install it, one to hold up the fan while the other one tights the screws.

It's simple to rewire it, turned on the power and the fan went round and round.  Hopefully it'll last at least 5 yrs.  (the number of years my 1st one lasted.

"My home is 18 years old.  Therefore it was no surprise the motor siezed up.  The replacement motor is different and does require different brackets.  However, it bolted right up to the original mounting locations.

The instructions were not clear.  Swapping the fan blade was straight forward.  However, the instructions did not clearly show HOW the brackets are to be attached.  This meant a trail and error approach.

"A keeper that keeps things in place. This cargo bar is not as fancy as a racheting one, but instead is simpler andore secure to use. This cargo bar relies on plain old applied force to stay in place. Each end of the bar has an articulated hard rubber pad attached to an 8"" or so piece of allthread which itself is stemmed into each end of the bar.

Rough sizing is made by expanding the bar to the approximate width of your cargo area and snapping in the detents provided. Fine adjustments are then made by threading out some of the stem until the bar fits somewhat snug. Final adjustment is made by twisting the bar in the direction indicated on the label to tighten. Once tightened, the cargo bar is very secure. To loosen, simply twist the bar in the opposit direction.

The advantages of this style cargo bar over a racheting model is the ease of use from either side of you cargo area, and it's rigidity.
The racheting model I had by the same manufacturer extended the bar quickly, but by design the rachet was in centered across the width of my truck bed, which made it awkward to keep in place while extending and tensioning the bar.

The rachet model uses a sproket in the handle that follows a slotted raceway in the side that extends. The sproket teeth are very fine for a heavy duty item and fail to connect adequetly with ghe extension bar, pooping out of the race and loosing grip when overtensioned, which is easy to do. When a load shifts, the bar on the rachet model flexes because it is thinner gauge than the screw type one and as a result, the rachet looses tension and pops loose.
This is the third screw type cargo bar I've had and have yet to break one( the previous two were stolen and gifted with the older truck, respectively). Buy this cargo bar and avoid the racheting one. You will be much happier with this one.",4.0

"Had a ratchet-type cargo bar from  an Amazon vendor, but lost it.  Came back intending to buy the same bar again.  However, after reading the reviews re. pros and cons of  ratchet vs. screw-type, I opted for the screw.  Having used it for a while now, I agree with the reviewers who recommended the screw-type.  The ratchet was bulkier, heavier and tended to pinch my fingers while making adjustments.  Otherwise, it worked fine.",4.0

"These seem solid enough and they work well for the application I bought them for.  My only concern is that the screw ends ""seem"" to be a bit flimsy.  I say ""seem"" because in practice they have been rock solid and they work well.  I say they ""seem"" flimsy because they don't come straight out of the bar ends but they come out at a slight angle.  Even so... So far so good.  They have been working like a champ since I bought them.  You cant beat them for the price.",4.0
I purchased a ratchet type keeper a few years ago and it is difficult to get tight so I finally decided to try this one and it works great. You simply pull the bar out to where it almost touches the truck bed walls and then twist\rotate the bar CCW until it is as tight as you want it. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I see one design flaw. They should have placed a visible indicator such as a line where the rough adjusting expansion is so as you extend the bar you can easily see where the clips on the bar are to properly align in the holes.,4.0

"As long as you buy a decent sized Master Lock, you'll get a decent lock. The smaller the lock, the cheaper the quality. It's been this way with TSA approved luggage locks and such, so I was quite prepared to find this lock equally as poorly made.

I'm confident that no one will be walking away with the unit now that this lock is in place. My only concern is about durability, for which I took a star off. I fear that without some sort of rubber cap on the bottom, it'll only be a few seasons before this lock is corroded and useless - time will tell though.",4.0

It has performed very well in the amount of time I have had it. Even in the winter environment, it has not corroded. There have been a few times where I had trouble getting the pin to pull open, but it eventually opened after tugging on it a few more times. I removed one star for this problem.

"Have not had to use them yet, but these just seem too light in weight.  Are they made of aluminum wire as opposed to copper?  Don't know.  Not the heft of other heavy-duty jumper cables.  Once they're put to the test, I'll report back.",4.0
"These are solid, heavy, well built cables. I noticed I was able to charge my battery quicker with these. I use the battery in my running car to charge a deep cycle battery while camping and these seemed to transfer more energy, or maybe it is just the strong connections....either way they work. I might try going down one more gauge to see how well they work. But no complaints.",4.0
"I purchased these only because I couldn't find the set that has served me faithfuly for a decade or so. What can you say about jumper cables, they either work or they don't work? These seem to be well made and tanble free, I have seen better clamps but these will work just fime.  With 48 hours of receiving these I found where  where my wife had placed my beloved old ones, which are now secured under lock and key and out of her well meaning desire to put stuff away for me. The new ones will remain in my car, no  telling when I may get to be the best man at a wedding or something. In short they are great for emergencies.",4.0
I've had the lock for over a week now and it's been working well and no rust yet.,4.0

"It was much lighter and cheaper than I expected, but it has done its job several times now.  I don't expect it to last forever, but I needed one in a pinch and this works just fine.",4.0
"I read the other reviews when I purchased these, and decided that I didn't need hardcore heavy duty cables for my little Protege.  When my battery died, they fired up my car on the first try.

Two weeks later we tried to jump a V8 jeep with these cables and it took about ten minutes of letting the cars sit together before the jeep would start.  I don't know the exact physics of this (whether it was the cable or the battery), but when the jeep died again we had better luck with a more intense set of cables.

Since the jeep isn't mine, I'm quite happy with this purchase.  They're cheap and they'll get my car started in emergencies.

Got the job done.",4.0
"Product is great, arrived in nice packing and brand new condition. Useful and i would recommend this product to my friend.",4.0
"Pretty sturdy cables, gets the job done. Luckily, I don't have to jump my battery a lot, so I only got light-duty cables.",4.0
"Good, cheap cables.  I knocked off a star for the rubber handles being open at the back.  They worked fine to jump my car.",4.0
Well made cable and good material. Better if the handle is larger to cover the copper wire. A good cable to own,4.0
"These cables are lighter than I expected, but seem to do the job.  I had one opportunity to use them and they worked just fine.  I just wonder how they will hold up over time.",4.0

The polisher works great but I thought a Milwaukee would be made in the US.,4.0
"I've owned many Milwaukee tools over the years and they've always been great and hard to kill.  The problem I have with the 5540 11 amp polisher is the trigger, I got pinched the very first time I used it. Milwaukee decided to save money on this on by not using their signature long trigger.  The short trigger has a slight opening at the top and will pinch your finger unless you press it at the bottom.  I would of returned the tool if I was using it for production but I'm just using it for polishing my cars.",4.0
"arrived in great shape. arrived earlier then quoted. works great.decent price. I like this heat gun, and would recommend it to a friend.",4.0

We used it for the camper roof and it did its job OK. Where it really came in handy was thawing the exposed portion of our well pipe which froze during the awful winter of 2014. It is safe and effective!,4.0
A very basic but serviceable heat gun with two heat settings and three additional nozzle attachments make this unit a solid performer.  I particularly like its light weight which makes it easy to wield; if I have a complaint its that the overall size is just a bit large and can make working in confines a bit difficult.  Still and all a very good unit with a reasonable price,4.0

"Just got my wagner heat gun kit, and am quite pleased with my purchase. having said that heres my cretic.....
1 - THE CASE - the case is my least impresive component in this package as it is not a blow molded case and not sterdy. the locking mechanism is not so reliable, its made of thin plastic and will not stay intact when being transported, this is boddersome.
2 - THE GUN - The gun is the HT1000 model very light and on testing it proved to be very quiet. It heats up quickly and on my first use of it which was on a shrink kit for an electrical mains it work ok but i felt it could of been a bit hotter, got the job done though with a little patience.
3 - ACCESSARIES - The nozels are of a good build quality..... very useful addition to the kit........and now i saved the best fo last....THE SCRAPER HANDLE AND ATTACHMENTS......EXCELLENT BUILD QUALITY WITH FIVE SCRAPER TIPS.....this is a great bonus and makes up for the other short commings of this kit. the product manual is very good and all in all this kit is a great value for money product am giving it 4 stars because of the flimsy kit.",4.0

"I bought this generator from Home Depot about 5 years ago.  The longest single use I got out of it was for a week with hurricane Isabelle-it paid for itself.  Other than that I probably run it 30 hours a year.  I use it to power a 1.5 hp well pump, a refrigerator and the blower on my propane hot water heater.  We can shower, flush and eat-the important things in life!  These three things max it out but get us by. It could have a better wheel/handle design-it's hard to move around.  I had to replace the carbureator (water got in and froze up-my fault) and a low oil pressure switch-which collects sludge and just needed to be cleaned.  The filler cap/gas gauge was useless and the low idle mechanism is screwy.  I added a screw-on oil filter, which it didn't come with, although later models do.  It runs like a champ.  If it meets your needs I'd buy it.  I'm presently on backorder for a 10,000 ($1800) watt, 18 hp Honda engine generator.  My suggestion to anyone buying a generator is-get the chart that comes with  generators and figure out in advance what you want to power and buy accordingly.  Good Luck!

Update-11/25/12.  Even champs can let you down.  Based on my info. above I must have bought this in 1998 which makes it 14 years old.  I've been using this, lately, in conjunction with a 10KW generator so that I only used the Generac at night, when there was a power outage, to run the refrigerator since it better on gas.  During Sandy (no power for four days) my Generac died-engine runs great but no electricity.  I brought it into a shop and was told the stator was fried and it would cost more to repair it than it was worth-that assessment costs me $50.

Update-3/15/13.  After running an ad on CL, to see if anyone was interested in the parts, I received a helpful response.  There was a local guy, Strasburg, VA, that worked on generators on the side.  He checked it out and determined that the coil was fried.  He was able to double dip (varnish insulation-I was told) a new coil and replace the ""iffy"" control panel, used, for $300.  So, I'm back  in business.  I thought it was a decent deal considering that a new generator, of this size, costs around $600.  I've checked the voltages (120/240) and it works fine.

It pays to have a backup generator when you consider how miserable life in the country can be without power.  With wood heat that's not the issue but no indoor plumbing when the well isn't working is no fun.  Think about the cost of replacing your freezer/refrigerator food and $300 is good insurance over a number of years.",4.0
"I purchaced this generator as a back up unit for my home and for camping. It is fairly quiet and real easy on fuel. There is plenty of power for running the AC and anything else at the same time in my camper. Unfortunatly it is very, very hard to get started in cool weather. I have to remove the air filter and use starting fluid to get in running if it is below 50 degrees. The unit has only about 8 hours on it so far and I hope this will get better as it breaks in. It comes with a extra air filter and spark plug (which I tried changing) but didn't make it better.
  If it was a better starter out in cold weather I would give it 5 stars on its capability and price. This seems to be a complaint I have read before.  That's a big down fall.

Update 11/03: After having this generator for 2 seasons I would like to add that starting has been getting better. I called the factory on the inital problem and they refered me to a local servicer. I didn't bring it in though because he couldn't gaurentee free service and had a 45 day wait to get to it. I don't have to go to extremes to start it anymore but I do have to hold the throttle closed for the first 2 pulls and it will usually start within a couple more even at temps down to zero. Running Mobil one oil seems to have helped too. Overall I am happy with my purchase and haven't had any other problems in about 100 hours of use.

Update 9/08 Generator runs great after around 600+ hours. Starts without fuss now in 2 pulls even after sitting all winter. This is the Generac motor not B&S that I see on some new models. Runs perfect and no oil consumption. Did 2 oil changes otherwise 0 maintenance.",4.0
"Starts first pull every time. We bought this Generator to power a Trailer (& house during rotating blackouts). Since the 5th Wheel only requires 30 Amp service, this Generac powers everything at once: A/C, Water Heater, Refrigerator . . .
Although it is quieter than our lawn mower, it's still a bit noisy when run all night. We also looked at Honda Generators. In general, they were quieter, but MUCH more expensive. (Would have been 5 stars if it were as quiet as a $1600 Generator).",4.0
"For the price, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better oil drain pan that isn't an open design.

This 10 quart oil drain pan will easily hold all the oil from two cars, which is perfect because it allows me to do both cars at once before transporting the oil for recycling.

When transporting, you have to be very careful. This isn't exactly the most sturdy design, but it seals well enough as long as it isn't flying around your trunk. I haven't had any issues with oil spilling out, but based on the material, I could see that as an issue.

The major design flaw is the size of the mouth for catching the oil. The diameter of the mouth isn't wide enough to catch the stream of oil that shoots out at an angle (which is the bulk of the oil) AND the oil that drips straight down at the same time. Some spilling is inevitable, so you need to be sure to have plenty of cardboard or newspaper down on the garage floor. You have to constantly reposition the pan in order to minimize spills.

Honestly, I wish I had thrown out a few more bucks and bought a better pan. But this gets the job done, so I'm not going to complain too much.",4.0
very useful everytime you change your oil but I wish the opening is bigger,4.0
love it. we are going to use it for a pond. its the drainage point. we are just too lazy to begin,4.0
"Not much special to say about this except that it holds enough oil to satisfy a full oil change on the majority of cars out there.  The only thing I do not like about the pan is that there is no easy to pour spout, so you do need to be aware when emptying the pan into a container.  None-the-less, it is an inexpensive, yet valuable tool for DIY'ers out there looking to save money on oil changes.",4.0
It will do the job. Low profile,4.0
"Good pan, shipped quickly. It's not light and flimsy like some I've seen. Only problem I have with it is it doesn't have the pour spout as pictured. The pour spout is actually smaller.",4.0

"I purchased 10 packs of these (20 total pads) for use on outdoor wooden stairs leading into our home. The stairs are old and the wood is not smooth so I did not attempt to use the adhesive. Thus, I cannot comment on its effectiveness. Instead, I used four wood screws and washers (one in each corner of each pad) and screwed them into the wood. They've worked wonderfully.

Installation was completed about four weeks ago, so I'm not entirely sure of the long-term resilience. However, they've had many feet traveling on them in cold, rain and ice and they've made the trek MUCH safer.",4.0

The problem is that with woodwork, most of the time, you are working on smaller, intricate surfaces, as compared to the big flat panels on a car. Consquently a 2400 RMP polisher is not what the doctor ordered. Unfortunately 2400 RPMs is where mile deep gloss arrives. So what to do. I just ordered the Milwaukee variable speed 11 amp polisher. The speed range is 0-2800 with a pre set dial for fixing a setting, so I can slow it down for the delicate areas, and still maintain the option of cranking it up for the larger flat surfaces. I also purchased the hook and loop backing pad. That is where this Porter Cable wool pad comes in. It is difficult to tell just how much nap their is on a pad when ordering from a picture online. My old favorite is a super plush 7 inch tie on lambswool bonnet. By the time you wrap it around a backing pad, it makes for a larger edge than you would normally need for the intracacies of wood projects. That is where these Porter Cable hook and loop pads come in. The texture is very fine and smooth. Very thick and dense as well. The nap is only about 1/2"" deep. That makes it very manageable for tight spaces. It is good for getting a lot of control when working up close to an ajoining surface. Using this pad on a random orbit sander is ok for a gentle rubbing effect. If you are planning on building a solid layer of finish, and polishing it to a deep gloss that is glasslike by using compounds, you will need a regular polisher. The nice thing about these Porter Cable polishing pads, is that they work with either type of machine, as long as they have a hook and loop backing pad.
  All in all these Porter Cable pads, with their tight yet silky smooth nap, fill a niche for polishing that is very helpful. Hope this helps.",4.0

"This works well, Only design flaw is at the connection at the fitting that joins the flexible ""hose"" to the actual body of the oiler, If it is not on tightly and perfectly aligned it will leak. I fixed mine with some permatex, Othewise this work and does what I need it to do....fill my hard to get to transfer case with trans fluid!

It's fine.  The word industrial is a bit silly for this item.  The negatives are the tip is glued to the flex spout and the bottom is press fit so it will be leaking I'm sure.  Says it's made in USA.,4.0
"Works well. The handle is sensitive enough to allow one drop at a time, a few drops, or a steady stream.

I'm not sure why but I think it might be the ball oilers themselves rather than this oilier. I mention this because I'd gone thru a few other oil cans thinking it was their tips being wrong size or defective. The tip on this one looks good, small tip, precise opening and it works on more oilers than the others I've used. It may not be the solution to the problem but I guess it will do. Otherwise it seems to be better quality than most others. I give it four starts only because it leaks.",4.0

"Great product except one thing.  When you screw on the handle/spout assembly, the flex tube doesn't quite point right in front of you, it's off to one side.  It's not the kind that is easily orient-able.  If you have it point right in front of you, the top ends up being loose and not screwed in tight.  Overall it's still useable.  There's a probably a fix to it that I haven't seen yet, but hey it works.",4.0
No leaking problems yet so maybe 5 stars. fast delivery.,4.0

Good oil can. It works. Others I bought from Harbor Freight did not work. Not as good as the ones I bought from Sears 20 years ago.,4.0
Love it but it has a tendency to weep the homemade penetrating oil that's in it long after I've put the can back on the shelf.  Other than that I love this thing.,4.0
"This was a hard to find item.  The previous unit was over 30 years old and needed to be replaced.  This one, a little less quality, than my original does ""weep"" fluid after using it even if the stem is move vertical to the base.  So, you get a small ring on your workbench.  Not a problem, just a nit.  I would buy again.",4.0
Probably one of the better oil dispensers that I have come across,4.0

"The V100 is a great buy. It was easy to set up and calibrate, and gives consistently accurate readings. It stays securely attached to my windshield. The overall design is well thought out.
I have tried many conventional compasses for my car, and they have never seem to work right. This one fills my needs, and at a very reasonable price.",4.0
Compass worked wonderfully for my trip around New England this summer. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is for want of a backlight for night driving. Remember to moisten the suction cups before adhering to the window. I forgot the first time and it popped off 10 minutes later. Never came off again the whole trip after I moistened them.  Worth the money.,4.0
"I recently purchased a PNI V100 Digital Compass for my father for Father's Day. I found that the compass is so sensitive that it reads more accurately that my GPS unit that cost me several hundred dollars. I have since bought one for myself as well.  For the price and if all you need to know is which direction you are heading, this compass can't be beat!",4.0
"I've always wanted a compass in my car but could never find one at a reasonable price that worked -- until now.  All you do is insert a couple of AAA batteries, stick the compass on your windshield with its suction cup cradle and then calibrate it.  The calibration is very simple -- you press the calibrate button and drive your car in a circle -- it literally takes less than a minute.  After that the compass works perfectly, showing the direction the car is headed with large LCD letters -- N,NE,E,SE,S,SW,W or NW.  The compass automatically shuts off after a couple of minutes if the car doesn't move, saving the batteries. My only complaint is that the LCD face doesn't illuminate, so it's hard to see at night.  But other than that, this compass really does the trick.  You can't beat it for the price.",4.0
"I bought a kayak and wanted to add some deck rigging and other accessories to it, there are 2 ways to accomplish this. One is with screws and the other is rivets. I like the concept of rivets and think they will hold stronger and longer then the screws but in order to attach them I needed a rivet gun.

I've never used a rivet gun so I was standing in the aisle of my local hardware store and asked a sales guy which rivet gun would be good for beginners, he picked this one up and said this is the most popular model they have so he would recommend it. I got it and left the store.

From an ease of use standpoint, it doesn't get any easier to figure out. Simply drill a hole, pop a rivet in, slide the riveter over it and squeeze a few times. The rivet tightens and pops off.

Now I'm only giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I did have a difficult time with the rivets. I could squeeze but it took a lot of force to get the rivet to pop off. It would be 5 stars if they had a ratchet system or some other way of making it easier to squeeze. But for what it is, it's basic and easy to understand how to operate. I successfully added 14 rivets to my kayak and now have bungee deck rigging securely in place with no concern it would pop off.

I would recommend this, as a beginner i had no issues with it.",4.0
nice variety of sizes.,4.0
Nice buy but all the rivets are 1/8 with various lengths.  Probably my fault for not reading more carefully but I wish there were a greater variety of diameters  and head sizes.  4 Stars because the rivets are good but not 5 stars for the reasons above,4.0
"No problem with purchasing, delivery or quality. Just that Arrow Rivets gives you a box of 2 types of rivets, Aluminum and steel ,that look exactly the same, and if the flimsy cardboard liner falls out of box the only way to tell what is what is if you have a magnet with you!! As soon as you open box tape the paper information board down before it falls out.",4.0
"Good for rivetting needs. The quality of the metal is good and is easy to put in to the tool and apply. Overall, this is above average.",4.0
"This rivet gun pulls aluminum rivets fairly well.  However this weekend I tried to pull some monel rivets with little success.  I was able to get them tight, but the gun just would not grab well enough to actually pop the pop rivet (strength or not).

It's a decent gun that will pull soft metals, but not hard ones (no matter how much force you put on it).",4.0
"This product is made well and does a good job. The swivel head is worth the extra few bucks as it makes positioning the rivet so much easier
However I do not recall it taking so much force to use a pop riveter.
I would love it if they would produce a model about 3 inches longer to improve the leverage as with slight arthritis in my hands it takes more effort than it should.",4.0
No pop rivets in the package.,4.0
"This is a very good product, work pretty good in all applications",4.0
Had never had reason to use this item in the past. Good quality & easy to use.  Seems pricey.  Would recommend to anyone who has need.,4.0
"I had the same problem that many of your mentioned. After close examination, I found that there is a 3/16 nut inside the front handle that has a tendency to loosen. When it loosens, the riveter feels like it is slipping and it takes more and more pumps to get the rivet to pop. Eventually you pump and pump and it does not function anymore. You can get at the nut with a 1/4 inch drive deep socket if you pry the spring arm aside. Tighten up the nut and you should be back in business.  Good luck.",4.0
Works just fine. No problems with installation,4.0

I'm willing to pay a bit extra for less disruption and less work to replace these, so even if the price-per-year were the same, I'd still get these genuine APC ones.

"Bought this to replace the battery in my APC power supply. Arrived quickly and fit perfectly. Quality is a 5, price is a 3. Not sure why this is so much more than other batteries of this type but I guess I didn't want to take a chance on an aftermarket battery. Although they are probably all pretty much the same.
Note for other users: My PC started to shut down every time my HP printer kicked on. After much research I found out the printer was on the same circuit as my PC/Power supply setup and every time the printer kicked on the amp draw was enough to shut down the PC (printer was not on the power supply) I have since put the printer on another outlet and circuit. Go figure,",4.0

"The APC RBC2 replacement battery was exactly as ordered and works well, but the shipping method was substandard.  The battery was sent in a cardboard box inside a USPS envelope.  There was no packing material to protect the battery either in the box or in the envelope.  I was just lucky that the battery was undamaged and had not leaked, which could have caused injuries or environmental problems.",4.0
My APC back up unit started to chirp and then shut down.  Checked online and saw that it was a dying battery.  Went to their site for a replacement battery and was kinda surprised at the cost.  Then I saw this one on Amazon and the positive reviews so I ordered one.  Good price and free shipping.  It arrived quickly and was a perfect replacement for my unit. Very happy to have everything back to normal at a good price,4.0

If you lose power regularly you are better off charging the battery for 8 hours before putting a load on the UPS.",4.0
I have an older UPS that uses this battery. Price was lowest I could find for a OEM battery and both the UPS and battery work for me.,4.0
APC cheaped it out on their free spent battery return. they used to include a postage paid mailer and you used the same box the new battery came in. nice touch. made the premium price they charge worth it. not so much now.,4.0
I replaced the battery in my UPS with this new battery.  The battery charged and the UPS alarm reset and the UPS works flawlessly now.,4.0
"I got this battery to go into my 10-year-old CS500, aka BK500.  The old battery, though it could light a test light, made the red ""replace battery"" light come on whenever I turned the unit on.  This happened after an outage where I just ran the pack dry.

This new one went right in, and no more light.  I use this lower-wattage APC UPS for my DVR, as it can't supply my high-end gaming computer (I have an APC XS1500 for that).",4.0
"Here is the main reason to buy this genuine APC replacement rather than the knock off:  the new battery comes with instructions for printing a free UPS label so you can recycle your old APC battery.  It costs a little more money to be green, but we only have one planet.  I can't say yet whether there are other benefits (i.e., whether the genuine battery will last longer or work better than a knock off brand), but mine has worked fine so far.  And the Amazon price is far better than APC's.  As for those that received seemingly refurbished batteries rather than new ones, that wasn't my experience.  Mine seemed new.",4.0
"Exact replacement for the original battery.  I know several other folks mentioned that their battery appeared used and/or old, but the one I received appears brand new and its form/fit/finish is just like OEM. The only reason not to rate a 5 is that it came with only minimal charge on it - which is not a show-killer but it is unusual.",4.0
I had been thinking of replacing the original unit.  Learned of battery replacement option.  Received in less than a week.  Easy to install.  And free return of old battery for recycling an added bonus.,4.0
"Good original manufacturer's battery with APC expected quality and longevity.
Cheapest price around.
Fast and inexpensive shipping.",4.0
"I just received an APC RBC2 battery (not purchased from Amazon), and I found that, instead of an ""ARS"" label with pre-paid freight to the recycle depot, APC is providing a ""recycling guide""; a sheet that tells how to dispose of the battery properly. The APC part is now distinguished from generic batteries by the included installation instructions, the safety insulator on the positive post, and the attached pull tabs that facilitate removal.",4.0
The key item in my decision to use APC as opposed to an off-brand is that they include a return shipping label for recycling of the spent battery. If you price the cost of taking the old battery to a recycling dealer then the APC compares equally to the off-brands. And you get the APC warranty.,4.0
"I bought two of these to replace aging battery cartridges that were no longer holding a charge.  Each original was over 3 years old.  The nice thing about this unit is that it comes with a prepaid return label so that the old cartridge can be recycled at no cost to the buyer.

However, if you'd like to save some money, you can consider generic units.  I found that the ""Batteries Plus"" chain stores will also accept spent batteries (and entire UPS systems) for recycling at no charge.",4.0
"Its just fine - it is the correct replacement battery branded by the UPS manufacturer.

It comes with a pre-paid UPS label to return the old battery for recycling (I don't know if it is a legal requirement for the vendor to do this, but, since it is a lead battery, recycling it is a priority, so this is very convenient).

And it has worked for about six weeks now without any problems.",4.0
"This battery is a bit high priced compared to competitors, but I needed it shipped same day, so I bought from amazon.  Working fine.",4.0

"I would like to disagree with the other review.  I was skeptical of using this product but after reading all the positive feedbacks on eBay, I bought it.  So far, I've used it on my black iPod Nano, PSP, black RAZR, and I am offering services at my school to remove scratches.  It works PERFECTLY!!  It may seem like a small tube but it really is enough for 8-10 applications, even more for small scratches.  The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because you really have to apply it real hard and rub for about 30 seconds unless you are cleaning the iPod Nano which would take about 2 minutes and it will look all shiny and brand new again.  Get it and try it for yourself.",4.0
Great to use --only thing that is missing is a head rest which we are adding.,4.0
It rolls over things smoothly but it is large and awkward.,4.0

"This is a good product. Rolls much eazier than other creepers, My son says it rolls too eazy.
Sure beats a piece of plywood and those little wheel creepers.",4.0
"In general I am pleased with the way it works, substantially as advertized. Easily the best creeper I have ever owned. However, the molded soft-rubber head pad leaves a little to be desired, namely comfort. It has a cute little bulldog image molded into it in high relief that produce raised ridges that are not comfortable to lie your head on. It would be better if the image were in much lower relief. As it is, it feels like rocks under my scalp. Also there have been times when I wish that I could raise or lower the whole pad to relieve neck strain. I mostly use the head pad as a butt traction pad by using the creeper the other way round. Another small item is the lack of a molded-in loop with which to hang the device on a hook for storage.",4.0
"Really enjoy using this Creeper after I got it. Much more durable than the cheap ones made in other countries. Only wish the head-rest was a little bigger with more cushion to it. Other than that, the unit performs great when working on my cars. I'm 6'3"" and weigh 275, and I can fit on it with no problems. The big wheels make all the difference when rolling around and under a car. Well built and Made in America!",4.0
"This works great because of the big wheels it can roll over cords and other things that a small wheeled creeper would hangup on.

I bought this creeper to make it easier to install a new cat-back exhaust system on my truck.  I found the Bone creeper to work and move well in the garage with the large wheels and low ground clearance.  The bed of the creeper is comfortable as far as laying on a creeper is concerned.  I would recommend buying it for garage work on flat surfaces to get the best clearance under the vehicle rather than the Rough Rider model designed for outside work.,4.0
"I have an old creeper from a local auto store that I've been wanting to replace for years.  Unfortunately, with my 30-year old exposed aggregate driveway I need large wheels to not get hung up on large rocks or deep holes.

The Bone with its 5"" tall and 1"" wide wheels practically glides over the surface.  Unlike other reviews, I felt the headrest was comfortable and the Bone easy to get on and off.  The raised corners to hide the casters does cut into your peripheral view a bit, but it is worth the trade-off.  The quality of the unit, including the hardware, is top-notch.  I expect I'll never wear this thing out.",4.0
"The Good-- Made in USA, large casters, easy to clean, durable, low to the ground.
The Bad-- very uncomfortable head rest (hard ribbed pattern- picture on Amazon doesn't show this), hip ""bone"" area not wide enough (doesn't allow legs to straighten out, knees must remain up- I'm 5'10""). If these two problems were corrected (wider at leg area and smooth/softer headrest), this would probably be one of the best/most desirable creepers available.

Update:
After using this creeper for awhile, I am happier with it. As far as the moulded black head rest thing- I just put my head at the opposite end of the creeper. Not being very wide at the caster towers doesn't seem to bother me as much now either, so I have changed my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars.",4.0
"This is a very nice creeper.
I am using it daily.
The only flaw I have found is that,
I am 6'3"" and it is a little too short for me.
I have that trouble with our 1995 Dodge Avenger,
I rub the headliner.
The 1991 Saturn we had was even worse.
If you are average height,
it would be ideal.
I work in a garage for concrete trucks.
We always have stones on the floor.
The Bone's large wheels don't get stuck
on them like your average creeper.
I like how it will roll over droplight cords,
but is not like they are not there.
You have to push it over.",4.0
Rolls better than anything I have ever used. Now i can fetch a tool without a major effort to roll out and get it. The only problem is that it rolls so easy that if something needs lots of torque the creeper rolls when i try to apply it.,4.0
"I've not had any of the problems experienced by the earlier reviewer. I've used the original pad 2-3 times a year on two cars without problem. I moisten, but don't wash the pad. Used now for 3 years.  Leaves a nice finish and almost effortless to use.",4.0

This is foam so that is normal.  If you polish you vehicle often enough this is all the speed you will need.  Always wash pad after use and let dry so you will need more than one if you are doing more than one vehicle..  Have done three vehicles with no problems washing pad after each vehicle.
Recommend if used as I suggested.

"FYI When Pad gets soaked with compound / glaze and running at high speed  YOU MUST TURN OFF POLISHER BEFORE REMOVING FROM THE SURFACE THE PAD IS ON !!! Or the Dual Action Random Orbital will be spinning out of control wobbling like crazy and the foam come FLYING APART. Until then every thing was going just fine. Should really get a few so one can be washed and dried out and use the next pad that is ready to go. Will try a hook and loop foam pad to see if it is more stable.and doesn't fly apart. Too easy to forget that off part of job, Should have a trigger and button. Just squeeze trigger and let go to get it to shutdown.",4.0

I use this pad for application and not polishing per the advice of the manufacturer's dealership and it works very well.  I was advised to confins use to one car or atleast to cars with similar colors -i.e. black and dark blue so as not to contaminate the pad.  Never go from black to white,4.0
"I purchased this product, it arrived at my residence, on time and as promised, it was well packed and it fit my needs as expected.",4.0
"Polishes well but doesn't last very long if you are working with anything other than flat surfaces. Hard rubber pad cuts into the foam and eventually separates.

"These pads last a long time provided you rinse them out. Don't let polish or compoound stay on the pads and then store them.

Keep at least two of these and you can finish a detail job in no time. Wax on, wax off.",4.0
I use this pad with 6 inch bonnets and it works good. I have seperate ones for application and removal.,4.0
"I used this polishing pad for the first time this weekend.  I waxed both a Suburban and a large enclosed motorcycle trailer.  The pad worked very well and produced a swirl free shine.  I washed the pad after both applications.  I noticed after the second washing that the glue seemed to be affected by the process.  The pad is not ready to fall of but, it will surely not last for several uses.  Over though,... I lke them and I will continue to buy them even at $12 a pop.",4.0
"I have tried several pads for this orbital buffer. Especially those sold by Griot's garage and I have to say that these original P/C pads work the best for me. They are soft enough, yet firm enough and much thicker than the other pads. One drawback is that they do not last any longer, but then they are cheaper than the hook and loop pads anyway.",4.0
If only it were 4 wheel drive. Or if I had a flat surface to put it on. Works well outside. Wheel bearings are excellent. I had no problem unintentionally rolling completely out from under the vehicle. A simple wheel lock would be a great addition.,4.0

I could have rated it a 5-star product except that it is rather heavy.,4.0
"Runs smoothly, and I got it to work on trash trucks (our yard isn't even on parts of it as well). The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is the creeper with myself cant fit under the majority of the truck axles (barely make it under the rockwell/mack axles at least). Could use a better width head area with a cushioned pad in my opinion.",4.0
kinda hard for a fat guy to get out of. VERY comfortable to lay in it though,4.0
"It works good, a little hard for an old man to get out of.  It rolls very nice. i like the low profile.",4.0
"Well packaged, easy to assemble. The wheels are a major asset for ""roll ease."" I was surprised that the wheels used lock washers to attach to the creeper instead of ny-locs. But other than that , it works fine for me. I am an owner/operator of a class 8 diesel truck and do a lot of my own maintenance.",4.0
"I bought my creeper several years ago because I was tired of grinding to a halt when I hit small stones or sand on my garage floor.  With this creeper, I can roll over air hoses without any trouble.  If anything, the wheels are too good!  Several times I've given myself a gentle push and gone shooting underneath the entire length of my car. I'm 210 pounds and this creeper supports me without an issue.

The next support of the bone is good, although for long-term use you might want to use a small rolled up towel for a bit more comfort.

The product is made of a heavy duty plastic and oils and fluids wipe right off it without leaving a mark.

I love the fact that the entire Bone is made in the USA - that's one of the reasons I bought it.  The initial quality is very good and after several years of home use I'm still pleased with the longevity.

The only reason I've not given this product a 5-star is because of the 'pods' that house the wheels.  There have been a few times when I've been working in a very tight space with my arms up around shoulder height and the pods have been in the way.  This meant I had to contort around them, which is quite uncomfortable.  The next day I've had bruises on my shoulders because of being pressed against the pods for an hour.

Otherwise, I'd highly recommend the Bone.  I'd certainly buy another, but it's unlikely I'll ever need to as it's built so well.",4.0
"I bought this creeper to use on rough concrete and packed gravel. I do have to say that it works pretty well for the terrain. The design looks kind of goofy, bit it really is as good as it gets. The tires are bigger, but you are lower slung which helps out under trailers. It gets pretty tight sliding under a truck rear end. The creeper seems good quality so far. It has a pretty big footprint compared to other creepers ive used, but it hasent proved to be a problem. I would recommend this product.",4.0
"The construction and durability of the body are excellent, but they are definitly ""over-selling"" the wheels. The bearings for the wheels and the mounting is good but the ""wide floatation type tread doesn't sink into soft surfaces"" is not accurate. The wheels could definitly be wider and/or pneumatic, and that would guarantee it would not sink into soft surfaces.

Also, the headrest is a complete and total joke. The company seems to be more concerned with getting their logo onto the product, rather than making a functional and comfortable headrest. I wish that this is something that the company would change, or even offer a ""real"" headrest as an option, if you are reading this Dale Adams, fix this problem!",4.0
Rolls easily on hard packed roadbase or dirt even over the occasional loose rock on concrete or pavement. If the wheels were wider you could roll on softer dirt if needed.,4.0
"Seems tough and durable.  The large diameter wheels do very well on rough asphalt.  It could be lighter and for >$100, it should have an adjustable head rest.",4.0
"I will say that I am surprised that such a well built product is being manufactured in the U.S.!  I figured with all the tax breaks to outsource everything, companies would be foolish to do that...but I am glad to see that DAE is not worried about those types of things!  They appear to be more focused on building a relatively nice creeper!  This thing is comfortable, sturdy, easy to maneuver, and can roll over just about anything!  Required minor installation of the casters, but that became an activity that my four year old could do!

My only complaint is that the ""neck padding"" is extremely hard and painful!  As the item is pictured on Amazon, it just looks like a soft rubber pad, but IT'S NOT!  It is a very hard rubber bone design that becomes painful after about 5 seconds of resting my head or neck on it!  Basically, it is completely useless for what it was designed for!  The only options are to either flip the thing around and place a different pad on the blank end, or roll up a soft towel and hope it stays in place while you are working!  I mean for this amount of money this thing costs...I almost expected the thing to lift me off the ground and stand me back up, but a decent neck pad would have sufficed!

Minus one star for the neck rest disaster, other than that...very nice!",4.0

"Got this for use in my crawlspace. The floor is very rough and littered with small stones, old screws and bits of wire from the scummy previous owners of my house.  It rolls great on the rough floor and usually goes right over all the debris. Occasionally it will get stuck on something though, but I didn't expect anything to work perfectly in this situation.

Good construction and very solidly built wheels.",4.0
"This creeper is excellent in durability, and function when it comes to outside work, I am a Diesel Technician, I usually work outside in all kinds of enviroments, this is the only creeper that gets around in rough suraces anything else you are better off with a piece of cardboard.  This is my second one I owned, my first lasted my three years until someone ran it over with a forklift.

However there is a trade off, it is not the most comfortable creeper.  As the entire surface is hard plastic and not ergonomic is tough on the body anly one small paded section for your head, and is not enough padding.

"I use this for outdoor automotive work and foundation repair under my house.  The black body is stiff and strong, quite comfortable too. It is an excellent design. My only complaint is that the casters bring down the overall performance of the creeper.  The ads say, ""Wide, flotation-type tread,"" but these solid tires don't have any tread at all. The are hard plastic, and mostly flat.  As a result they don't ""float"" over surface irregularities like a rounded pneumatic or low-density tire would.  On pavement, the creeper gets hung up on air hoses, tools, etc. because of the rigid tires. On dirt, the creeper tends to sink into the ground, again because of the rigid tires.  I weigh 160 lbs.

I may end up buying a better set of casters, but for [the money] I expected a top-notch product right out of the box.  This is probably the best creeper for outdoor work, but it would be unstoppable if Pegasus had selected better casters.",4.0
the park zone works as described.  you must have an electrical outlet nearby in order to use the power cord supplied.  i also purchased the standard model that operates on batteries alone for another member of my family and this seems a little easier to deal with - no cumbersome cord (black plastic model) and also about 12$ less expensive.,4.0

"I've had this product for a couple years and it worked well for that period of time.  I have a wraught iron railing to a staircase that I have to avoid hitting when pulling my car in the garage and we had to make some adjustments to the device in order for it to work.  Luckily I have a son-in-law who is very inventive.  We were able to use a longer telephone cord, run along the railing, to attach the sensor onto the railing as the railing was getting in the way of the sensor if placed on the wall as intended.  The railing causes an optical illusion and determining the car's front end distance was very difficult.  This product works well with the adjustments we made.  It did only work for a couple years, tho, and I need to purchase another.  Hoping the next one lasts longer!",4.0
"The ""Park-Zone"" has kept us from not stoping in time and hitting the deepfreeze which in turn would in turn hit the wall causing dammage to both.

"This model is a much improved product from the previous PZ-1100.  The problem with the PZ-1100 was that it was battery operated and that you couldn't park within 1-2 feet of the device or it wouldn't stop you accurately.

The new PZ-1500 is great that you don't have to use the batteries.  Just plug it in and it is ready to go.  It still has a little problem with parking too close and keeping the distance accurate.  We park 6 inches from the wall and it has trouble with that short of distance.  It still works, but it turns red about 3 inches before I would like it to.  I'm not going to complain as it works MUCH better than the previous model.  I think it would work great if you set it about 12 inches to your car.",4.0

"I tried this unit for about two weeks, and had to switch it to another location.  Okay value at $23; but rather like the ceiling mounted laser idea.

PRO
Easy to install. Easy to use.  Pretty accurate (+/-2inches).
Comes with a AC power adapter that I wasn't planning on using.

CON
Needs plenty of space around echo locator or their ""ultrasonic transducer"" (Also ping'g is audible and may by annoying if you're sitting in front of the sensor).  I have it next to a garage/home entry door with a little traffic.  This is a major problem, i.e., unit does not like things left in front of unit- like a bike or box.  In fact, shoe-high boxes or other items placed unwittingly in the sensing range or left under the subject car may throw off the accuracy of this device.  Unit is suppose to revert to ""Default-Mode to check against such nuisances"".  It definitely does not like much people traffic in front of unit.

Batteries were suppose to last a year.  I was in fact planning on running just on batteries; but, they can drained unexpectedly (<1wk) probably due to a mix-up of the four modes- Home, Away, Park, and Default.  Caution- current is spec'd at 60ma average.  (Don't know how that works out to a year.)  Luckily, it came with a AC power adapter.
Area around transducer needs to be clear by roughly 2x2ft in front of unit.

Conclusion:
I had to buy one of those laser systems for greater reliability at a comparable price. Also like the fact that it's more accurate.  Almost guaranteed of a AC outlet on the ceiling.

"I had plans for this unit prior to purchasing it.  While I'm using the park zone as it was intended to be used, I also added a slight modification.  With some additional electronics, I used the ParkZone to actually control an authentic (retired) Traffic Light that I have in my garage.

Prior to actually breaking open the box, I did thoroughly test this unit.  I found it to be accurate around 70-80% of the time.  Almost always, the green and yellow light would toggle back and forth before I hit the distance that would cause the yellow light to stay on.  From that point, the lights would react as they are supposed to.

I also find that you have to drive very slow in order for the ParkZone to work properly.  The times I drove in a little too fast, I would typically get no response at all.

After adding my modifications, I find the accuracy and response of the unit to be exactly the same as before I made the changes.

My final conclusion is that while this unit does what it says, it's not quite as accurate as one would wish for.  In my book, it's not a fail safe approach to that perfect parking spot.  Therefore, I also use my trusty old nail in the wall as a back up to verify my position in the garage.  But there is something to be said for being the only one in the neighbor hood (maybe even state) who has a working traffic light hanging in his garage.  :0)

Happy parking!",4.0
"This is a handy little 3-color traffic light that hangs on the back wall of the garage and guides you into your parking spot by showing a green, then yellow, and finally RED signal. You can select the right distance from the wall for YOUR car, which makes it a much better choice than similar items that use the same fixed distance for all vehicles.

Once in a while the little devil seems to have trouble making up its mind about where you are as you approach, so I have deducted one star from its score.  In spite of this criticism I have just purchased a second unit for my ""other"" car. There's nothing better on the market that I've seen, and you'll get lots of approving nods from the other gadget geeks in the neighborhood.",4.0

Pro: It does exactly what it supposed to do.

Can anyone tell me how to set up the park-zone. I have one and the batteries went dead. can't seem to get it set up again.,4.0
"I have poor depth perception and am simply crappy at judging how close to the wall I am when pulling into the garage. Before installing the Park Zone device, I had tried a few other strategies to prevent bumper bumpage in my tiny garage. A tennis ball hanging from a string did not work, as my dog is a tennis ball freak and was constantly jumping up and chomping on it; parking ramps did not work as I would miss them with my wheels and bump the wall anyway. So I gave Park Zone a try after seeing it plugged on a home improvement show I like called Michael Holigan's Your New Home. With the help of my wife, who did not need the device really, as she can park within a gnat's...distance from the wall by sight, we installed the device in a few minutes. I then got behind the wheel and tested it out. Perfect! Within a gnat's...distance from the wall when the light turned from green to red. Why do I give it only four out of five stars? Because it is battery-powered, and not solar-powered as I would prefer. I realize that little sun gets into my garage, but I would be happy to mount a solar panel on top of the garage.",4.0
"These work quite well, but I would average the 4 AA batteries lasting 3-4 months.  These sensors will constantly ping your garage if the car isn't parked.

"harder to use than a traditional tire gauge. I've had trouble making tight seals with its built in rubber nozzle gasket, and overall therefore readings have varied. I'd just as soon buy a regular gauge next time, though this one does indeed *look* slick.",4.0
"Received this as a gift a few years ago to replace the plethora of traditional ""stick"" type pressure gauges floating around the glove box, garage, etc.
This Accutire gauge offers a faster tire pressure read due to two things. First is obtaining a good ""seal"" between the gauge and the valve stem. The Accutire obtains a good seal far more quickly. The quality of the Accutire's head is far superior to the head of the stick-type gauges (... the manufacturer can spend a little more for a better head). Also the size of the Accutire allows you to hold it more firmly and position it more securely on the valve stem. Second is reading what the gauge tells you. With the old stick-type gauge, you have to ponder, ""Is that 33 psi or 32? Wait, how many tick marks are covered up inside the stick? Oh, It's actually 35 or 34 psi. Well I guess it's 34."" Clearly, not a problem with the Accutire; the digital display tells you immediately.
The case that the Accutire comes in is pretty nice. Mine is a silver-metallic plastic with a solid feel (your mileage may vary). With the case, the Accutire is very easy to find in your glove compartment (vs. fishing for those old stick-type gauges).
The real testament is that with multiple cars and just a single Accutire gauge, while each car still has a stick-type gauge in the glove box, I will go to the car with the Accupressure to use it on the other cars.",4.0
"I got this for my Dad last Father's Day and he fell in love with it. This is the same man who for all his life relied on a pinch and a kick to test his tire pressure. He found it easy to use, very accurate and likes the long-lasting battery feature.",4.0
"This thing is pretty cool.  I have not had any problems with it so far.  The display is east to read which is nice.  Seems to work better and a lot more accurate then those old sliding types.

"This is a good, easy to use digital tire gauge.  I think a better value is the Accutire MS4020-GB, which does just as good of a job for the non-commercial driver at a better value.
This is a good quality product, and I would recommend it for someone who needs to measure tire-pressure that is no higher than 99psi.  If you need to measure tire pressure between 99 and 150 psi, look to the MS4020-GB.",4.0
Does anyone know what the battery numbers are for the replaceable batteries. Mine are dead and I have lost the manual. Thanks,4.0
"I have owned the Accutire MS-4000 gauge for over 3 years and I have always had a problem seating it properly on the valve stem...you can hear the air leak out each time I used it...sometimes a LOT of air. But I read some of the reviews stating how they solved this problem and I realized that I simply wasn't taking the extra second to make sure the gauge is lined up flat against the valve stem. Now that I take that extra second to align the accutire just before I press it on the valve, it works perfectly with no air hissing out of the tire. Who would have thought I needed instructions on how to use a tire gauge (I can't admit this to my wife...I would never hear the end of it).

After 3 years of light use the batteries are still fine, which is a little miracle in itself.

I recently compared my readings with a car dealership's gauge and mine reads 1.5 pounds under the dealer's. I don't know whose is correct (if either) but other gauges are probably as far off as mine. I wish I could buy one that truly is accurate, but how would you know if it is? So I follow the tire manufacturers pressure range and when I get close to the minimum I add some air. I may be 1 or 2 lbs off, but I don't think you can get one that you are certain is more accurate. (You would think a company called ""Accutire"" would make accurate gauges, but I guess not.)

I am glad I bought it. When it dies I will get another one.",4.0

The only shortfall is the dispaly, some times it might not come up as fast you would expect. Still overall a good product.",4.0
"Great product, easy to use, and accurrate. Hard to read in the sun. Otherwise no problems.",4.0
Without a doubt the best tire gauge I've purchased.  The display is bright enough for those with poor vision to see well enough to read.  I like the fact that the reading will stay displayed for several seconds after it's been removed from the tire stem.  I could only ask for the size of the display to be a little larger.,4.0
"Actually, I am UNable to rate this item BECAUSE I was unable to make it work properly, BECAUSE its accompanying INSTRUCTION sheet failed to tell me to FIRST remove the protective label covering the display window, in order to be able to see the tire pressure being registered on that display window:---> That simple situation set off e-mails to the supplier (unanswered); a rating e-mail to Amazon resulting in an extremely fast response from the supplier; a speedy phone call from the supplier; return of the item to the supplier; and a very quick and satisfactory refund by the supplier.  All of this could have been prevented had the INSTRUCTIONS alerted me to the presence of the virtually undetectable protective overlay covering the display---which masked what the gauge was actually doing.  In all fairness, I must assume the gauge was actually working the whole time.  All of this was eventually reported by me to the supplier.",4.0
"Product works great!!!  Used it up against Sam's club mechanic and it passed with flying colors.  Would purchase it again.  Try it, you'll like it.",4.0

The gauge takes some finesse to seat the tire gauge gasket to the valve stem without repeatedly letting air out of the tire.,4.0
"Gauge worked very well, I would recommend it.  As far as accuracy is concerned.  It reads within 1.0 psi of my other good quality tire gauge.  I expected them to read the same, but I guess that shows you it is hard to get gauges which are highly accurate.  However, the gauges are very consistant relative to each other; i.e. one is always one psi more than the other.  The protective case is a very nice touch too.",4.0
"Easy to read-great storage case-however, must hold on tire stem a little longer than standard pressure gauges to get reading",4.0
I have found this tire pressure gauge easy to use and to read.  The unit is made of high quality materials and comes with a nice case to keep it from getting damaged in your glove compartment.,4.0
"I've had 3 of these and have given 2 as gifts.  They're inexpensive, but as others have mentioned, they suffer from an inadequate seal.  Old fashion analog gauges have a good rubber seal on the inside that the MS-4000GB lacks.  In fact there is no rubber at all.  Because you're pressing plastic (the gauge) against metal (the tire air stem), you must hold it perfectly flush or air will escape, making a reading difficult to get.  To me, this is the only thing wrong with this great tire gauge.  I've looked everywhere and haven't found a better digital gauge.

Accutire should have used a good rubber contact, but my guess is because rubber wears out faster than plastic, they wouldn't have to worry about as many warranty returns.

HOW TO IMPROVE IT:

Get something called ""rubber tape"".  You may need to buy this online or you might be able to find it at your local hardware or electronics store.  I used ""3M Scotch linerless rubber splicing tape"".  The thickness is important.  I used .03 in. (.761mm).  I wouldn't go any thicker.  Get something thinner if you can.  You don't want to make it any higher than the gauge's white airhole center nipple.

All you need to do is cut it to the diameter of the inside of the gauge's mouth, then cut out a small hole for the air hole.  It doesn't have to be perfect, but the inside hole should be more perfect than the outside.

After performing this simple modification, my gauge was about 5 times easier to use and gave perfect readings.  No more fiddling to get an airtight fit.

When the rubber wears out, just replace with new rubber tape!

I only recently came up with this idea, so the 2 I've given as gifts have probably gotten little use because of this ""flaw"".  I highly recommend modifying the gauge before giving them away.",4.0
"Correct tire pressure (as per the recommendations of your auto and tire manufacturers) benefit you in several ways:

1. You get better Gas Mileage using properly inflated tires

2. You're vehicle will give you a smoother, more comfortable ride

3. You'll have better control, handling and be less likely to have a blow out (underinflation can lead to an accident). In Short: You'll be safer.

So obviously, I like to check my tire pressure about once every other week, and before any trip of an hour or more (or any trip that involves high speed driving on an expressway for that matter). So obviously I was searching for a tire gauge.

I read all the reviews before purchasing this digital Tire Gauge. I liked the idea of a Digital Tire Gauge with a backlit LCD Display that I could carry with me in my car. It's compact size means it can go right in the glove compartment. The fact it's DIGITAL means greater accuracey. Traditional, cheap gauges are difficult to use and read - with this you get a clear reading without any squinting to guess whereabout the needle is. The backlit display means you can read it easily, even in the dead of night on a country road. Further more a lifetime lithium battery, and the promise of reliabillity and a 5 year warranty also influenced me to buy this.

To most of those ends, this product works very well. It appears to give accurate readings (I haven't used it enough yet to really tell you how accurate it is, but the company claims it's very accurate and this appears to be so). The backlit display is nice and bright and easy to read. There's a clip for ease of carrying. It's got a nice look to it as well. It's also extremely simple, no on or off switch just put it to the tire nozzle and you get your reading then it shuts itself off. Nice right?

Well while overall, Im pleased, I do have a few complaints. First the company sucks. There is no phone number or website where you can contact the manufacturer if you have a problem. Also that amazing lifetime lithium battery... well if that sounds too good to be true then you'd be right! When you read the manual it clearly says the lithium batter should last a very long time, but will eventually die - at which point they will replace it, but you have to mail it to them! And you cant call them, they don't give you a number! So basically you send them the gauge and pray you get it back... I don't like that deal much. Also they don't tell you there's also 2 other button cell watch batteries that are in the unit. These will need to be replaced every now and then but only are necessary for the backlight display. The unit works fine without them, but the backlight is really handy in the dark, so you'll likely want to replace them.

The body of the unit is also inherently flawed. The battery compartment is attached via a VERY tiny screw. Good luck getting it off, even my eyeglass repair kit screw driver was too big! What's more the middle section is little more than an alluminum sleve. This comes right off without any effort and to get it back on you must take out the screw on the battery compartment. This is hard to explain unless I could show you... but you'll see what I mean if you buy one :) I simply solved this with a few drops of super glue... problem gone!

The last little gripe is that it can be a wee bit difficult to get a good seal. It's not a huge deal, but occasionally I seem to have to try a few times before I can get a good reading because it doesnt always seal perfectly the first time.

A few minor complaints... but that's ok. It didn't cost a fortune, and it does serve it's purpose. If it were made by a better and more commited company, didn't have that little design flaw with the body sleve, and could get an improved valve stem this product would probably get a very solid 5 stars. Water proffing would be a blessing too as sometimes I worry about getting this thing wet.",4.0
"This is a good tire gauge. We've had it about a month and so far it works fine -- seals properly and gives consistent, accurate digital readings that are easy to read. It comes in a hard case for protection, too, which is nice.",4.0
"This product was purchased in the Fall of 2002...
Of the ten or so units on the display rack, two of the units' LCD readout turned on by itself when I squeezed the handle.  The reading was 00.0.  The units may have been dropped by other customers.  Who knows.
Having checked all of the open box units (the newer shipments were sealed in plastic blister packages), I bought the one without the abnormal symptons.  For comparison, I also bought a store brand Mastercraft Canadian Tire LCD digital unit for the same non-discounted price.  Thank goodness for their generous refund policy at this store.
Tests were conducted on one cold tire.  After 3 readings, the Accutire consistently read 30 psig (which was the recommended tire pressure for my car).  The Canadian Tire unit consistently read 30.5 psig.  The cheapest spring loaded stick-type tire gage consistently read 32 psig.
I can safely declare that either one of the Accutire and Canadian Tire gages are correct within 0.5 psig as specified.  The stick-type gage is way off.
Pros;
1)  Accurate to within 0.5 psig which is acceptable for safe and economical driving.
2)  [cost less]
3)  5 year warranty.
4)  Aside from the occasional cleaning of the tip, and as long as you don't drop it; it's maintenance free.
5)  Low temperature tolerable lithium battery.
6)  For my hands, the unit has an ergonomically comfortable rubber-coated grip.
7)  Air tight seal on all valves tested everytime.
Cons;
1)  A bit chunky in size for compact storage inside the car.
2)  It's an electronic equipment, so be delicate with it.
3)  Not designed to be water resistant.
The unit has sat inside the car through one 2002 frosty southern Ontario winter, and several hot and humid 2003 summer days.  No problems so far.

"I bought this product ending July and for the 2 months I've had it, it's been great at providing shade from the sun to the rear seating area. The suction pads that holds the screen have stayed intact since I first installed it, another plus for this product. Not only does it shield the baby from direct sunlight, I've noticed that the interior of the car is much cooler than when I wasn't using it during the daytime.

Overall I will recommend this product, since it does what it's intended for, at a reasonable price.",4.0
"This car shade works well. I haven't had any problems. It is easy to put up/take down. Makes a big difference in keeping the back seat shaded and cooler.

"I purchased this so that baby could quit crying when the sun hit his eyes every morning.  It decreases the glare quite a bit.

I did not have the problems installing it that others have had.  I did install it in the evening, and it did take a little doing.  I followed the instructions, and the suction cups took several tries to stay in place.  Once on there solidly, they have stayed on great.

My only complaint is that in my Accord, I couldn't get the suction cups to stay on at the very top, so there is a line of sun that still comes in if the sun is at the right angle.

It is a little distracting at night for the driver, as it distorts cars behind you.  Looks like everyone has their brights on...not that it hurts the eyes, but it looks fuzzy.  I use my side mirrors much more.

It works well, although it makes the cars in back seem a little blurry (but definitely see-able), and at times the suction cups do come off, but that's only when it's really hot out. Overall, I would buy this product again if I needed to.",4.0
"I have been searching for a shade to stick to the back window and cover my kids' faces. This one is my favorite so far! The only thing is I wish it was a little bit bigger to fit to the edges all the way but it covers a very decent area. It sticks to the windows very well, which was hard for me with some other shades because of those defroster lines. I like that the bottom doesn't have to stick to the window either, because mine always fell down.",4.0
Works like a charm on my FJ Cruiser. Handily recommend for the side windows. I use it to keep my dog cool in the summer heat when parked.,4.0
"This shade did not fit the entire back glass like I had hoped.  Even though it covers most of the area, the sun still seems to find the spots where it is not covered.  Regardless, I am happy with this purchase.  It does shield my daughter's face from the sun and prevents her from squinting.  I would defintely recommend to others.",4.0
"So far this sunshade is working for us. It does restrict vision a bit. The anchors worked out well for us, we have a Buick. I recommend this sunshade, especially if your infant is in a rear facing seat.",4.0
"The sunshade is perfect for my baby.  It keeps her eyes from bright light.  THe only problem I see is that the car's rear glass is larger than this sunshade.  Some rays still go through the sides.  However, it still does the job of shading my baby well.",4.0
I like this car shade and would recommend it. I have a few issues though first the suction cups don't always stick and it was hard fitting to my window but after I figured it out it works great and we love it!,4.0
"A rear window sunshade is a must have if you have a child who's still rear-facing but no longer in an infant seat (ie. no carseat sun canopy). It keeps the sun out of my son's eyes and I have also found that it keeps the backseat cooler in my Honda Civic so he's not roasting in the car. The color is actually black (not white as advertised), but this hasn't really bothered me. It makes your back window a little blurry, but I can still see just fine and a blurry window beats the heck out of an unhappy baby!

PS The suction cups at the top have never fallen off the window but if yours do I've heard that super glue on the suction cups works great and you can just scrape it off when you don't need it up any more.",4.0
"I love this sun shade.  I am on my 2nd one by choice, the 1st one lasted over a year but has faded in the sun over time.  I think its a great way to attempt to keep the sun out of the back of the car whether driving or parked.  My only issue would be, because its universal, I drive a Maxima and would like if it was a bit longer on either side to better cover each of the 3 back seats.  The sun shoes through on either side about 4"" and I have 3 children, so 1 may always have the sun on them.",4.0
"My 7 months old baby is much cooler in my car now. The back is always nicer than the front and the view isn't blocked.
I added sunshades to the side windows for fewer degrees of heat and they also work great.
The shade helps at night with the other car lights.
I love it!
The only con is that the corners aren't completly extended. They wrickle a little, but I don't mind.",4.0
"This sun shade really helps. Our son cries when the sun is in his face too much in the car, so having the screen up makes the car experience much more pleasant for all of us. The screen doesn't cover the entire rear window though (thus 4 stars). It's pretty easy to see through for visibility.",4.0
"This shade definitely helps keep the sun out of my son's eyes while in our Camaro.  The hatch window is huge!  The shades suctions nicely to the very top of the hatch window, and the 'buckles' on the other end fit nicely between the seat back and the ""hump"" created by the gas tank.  If you use the shade properly (i.e. keep it snug!) it is very easy to see through. If you let the shade hang loosely, forget it, it's like a black window shade.",4.0
"The picture here is deceptive - the shade is not white, it is black on both sides.  Even with it being black though I still am able to see through it fairly well, and it does a good job of keeping the sun out of the baby's eyes the majority of the time.  It does not cover the entire back window area (I have a 2006 Subaru Impreza) but there is just a small uncovered space on either side.  It took a few tries to get the suction cups to stay up - I did have to clean the window area where the suction cups go before they would stick.",4.0

This works great!  Noise is not a problem.  But it is much bigger than I expected.  I bought it so I would never have to buy another cell phone charger for my car.  The last one never fits the new one.  But I didn't expect it to be so big.  It will work for TVs.  No matter, I like it.",4.0
This product worth alot.  I have no issues in charging my electronic stuff in the car. Nothing bad to say about this Inverter. Go for it !!!,4.0
"This is a great product, now I can recharge my MP4 and my Cel at the same time, most people complains about the noise of the fan, I consider that is normal in that kind of products.",4.0
"This is quite a nice unit for the money.  Mine came with two cords - the cigarette lighter cord shown in the picture and a cord with alligator clips for connecting directly to the battery.  It has an automatic short circuit detector and shutdown, a low battery voltage alarm and low voltage shutdown so you won't wreck your car battery, and automatic overload detection and shutdown.  It has two outlets, a power switch, and an automotive type fuse, and an attractive metal case.  Fairly impressive for the price.

I've only had this for a week so I can't speak about its reliability. I can confirm the fan noise, but I looked around a bit and that seems to be a common complaint about all the small inverters. The outlets have a ground pin, but users should not be deceived -- unless the unit itself is grounded (to a ground stake) the only ground is the chassis of the car.  That's true for all of these units.",4.0
"Good product, the only thing I detected, was a noice of the fan.....I pluged in two devices, and I have not problems.",4.0
"I have read all other reviews from the people who had purchased this product before I did. There were numerous notes about the noise this product makes when running and yes, there is a fan noise while this is in use. But I believe the usefulness of this item far outweighs the inconvenience of the fan noise. I only used it once so far to run a heated blanket for a road trip and it did the job as expected. The size can be a little burden but you can keep it underneath the driver's or the passenger seat. I only used it for about a month now so I can't comment on the life expectancy as others have commented about this product stopped running after few months.",4.0
This has been a excellent product for me.  I've used it over and over with excellent results. I would recommend it.,4.0
"This is my 2nd Jensen JP30 300 watt power inverter.  The only problem I had with mine was the the rubber on the 12v plug started to tear apart exposing the internal wires.  That happened after 3 years of very hard use.  I've plugged a laptop, tv, speakers, and a dvd player into it.  Works great!",4.0
"This power inverter worked great during a 1400 mile round trip, family vacation road trip over Christmas. It powered everything we plugged into it: cell phones, laptop & iPods. Only complaint would be the slightly noisy fan. Wasn't too noticeable, since I was able to place it in the armrest compartment. Other than that, would definitely recommend. The size is perfect and seems well built.",4.0
Will this product work when the engine is off?  My jeep has extra plug in outlets with continuous power access with the engine off.  I want to use my laptop in my car on my lunch break.  Will the battery hold up for this draw amount? with the engine off?  Thanks for your response.  Sylvia :o),4.0
"This product worked fine, there was a little fan noise but tightening the case screws fixed that.",4.0
"This powerful yet inexpensive inverter is very well made. With its 300 Watt continuous capability you can successfully power up various devices in your car. Modified sine wave is suitable since most of the modern electronic devices have switching supply anyway. Only direct electrical motor devices may have some problem with this.
The only drawback in my opinion is that the fan is always running what creates a certain sound. It would be essential to run the fan only in case of large power consumption and a significant temperature raise. The similar ""smart fan"" feature has been employed almost everywhere these days. The unneeded noise in the car caused by this fan is just a little annoyance and forced me to give this excellent unit only 4 stars.
Otherwise, this is a highly recommended buy.",4.0
"This is Inexspesi\/e, worked well and has good features for the money. Amazon was easy to buy this Jensen Electric/Auto Charging Product from & it was deli\/ered quickly without problems!!",4.0
"After doing a good deal of looking around for a power inverter, to be used in our van, I settled on this one. While it was not true sine wave technology it was not priced that way either. I chose the JP30 because of the dual outlets which will let my two children have their own to charge or play what they want while we are driving; That way I won't have to listen to them argue.  So far it has worked flawlessly and the price was as good as it gets.",4.0

"Drove to Myrtle Beach with TV/DVD, Play Station and Guitar Hero with no problems.  Inverter worked well.",4.0
"We've had this unit for about a year, and we recently bought one for my wife's father.  Good unit that we used during Hurricane Ike when we were without electricity for almost 3 weeks.  We ran a light, small TV, and fan without a problem using the cigarette plug and starting the car (Tahoe) from time to time to recharge the battery. We also use it on roadtrips so kids can play DVDs and we can recharge phones that don't have car chargers.  Some reviewers complained about fan noise-level, but we don't find that to be an issue.  Our only issue was that the cigarette lighter plug is plastic and it broke one time when trying to remote it from car lighter.  The screwoff tip broke part of the threaded plastic wall inside it.  I superglued the plug together and haven't had an issue since.  All in all, I think this unit is a good value.",4.0
"So far, the converter has worked fine.  It's only had about a week of use.  This is my 4th converter in a year...1st of this brand though.  The reason for the 4 stars as opposed to 5 is that the fan is noisy...the noisiest of the 4 I've had.  Also, the outlets are close together and I can't plug a phone charger and computer in at the same time. (This is mostly the fault of the phone chargers though; they are too wide.)",4.0
"This unit is perfect for my mobile ac power needs. Recharging my laptop while I drive is a snap. This is the answer for running my sons electronic video games that don't have the typical car charger. Unfortunatly, I do need to report that the cooling fan is a bit noisy. In most vehicles road noise drowns out the fan. But if you have a quite vehicle or you are stopped you can hear the fan clearly and it can be a bit irritating. Overall a great unit.",4.0
"The power inverter is great, my family used on our summer road trip with my laptop and speakers for watching video's. The only downfall was a little noise from the cooling fan. Buy it you'll like it.",4.0

"I read some of the reviews and wanted to let you know that for the money I purchased 2 for my son and my brother in Jersey. I took a trip to stonemountain park in GA, my son played his playstation 2 game fine. The only problem I had was with the S600 Mercedes the inverter didn't cut off when the key was out and in the on position-so when I went to use some of the keyless devices like truck open/close I found they didn't close. I found the inverter was still on and just cut it off everything worked fine after that-so remember to cut it off when car is not running. It fit the lighter better than previous adapters I've purchased with other vehicles.",4.0
"The Wagner 276124 HVLP conversion gun is by far the best one that I've encountered, and based on the feedback found on several woodworking forums, I'm not alone in my opinion.

Likes... construction, quality of materials. Dislikes... for a rookie like me, the user manual is skimpy, at best, with nothing to give you a clue about what PSI the regulator valve on the grip handle should be set or start out as.

With a bit of trial & error, I finally got it to spray decently.

If you plan to spray varnishes & paints with varying viscosities, I would highly recommend that you seek out the # 0295267 HVLP maintenance kit(low CFM), consisting of the #2 & #4 projectors (most commonly used) check valve seals, cup gasket, replacement check valve assembly, needle packing, gun wrench and air plug. These parts are nice to have on hand in case you discover at the start of a job, that your spray gun doesn't want to play anymore, plus getting the extra projectors is less expensive this way, than buying them individually.",4.0
"I got this when I had a flat away from home and had forgotten to bring my patch kit and spare tire. I was near a Walmart and this was the only patch kit they had. I was not optimistic at all but was too stingy to buy new levers and a new tube so instead I bought this kit and re-used my punctured tube. And that actually worked extremely well. These patches are just like stickers, you simply roughen up the tube and then stick the patch on the puncture. I did not have a leak in that area of the tube again. Now I keep using this kit until I run out of patches. The levers are nothing special, if you want really nice levers get the Park tool ones in blue. But I cannot complain about the levers either, they are not broken yet. That other tool is very basic too but if you can get this set for cheap I can recommend it. And I ride my bikes a lot and have tried other patch kits.",4.0
"I like this kit because of the patches. No messy rubber cement. The patches just adhere to the tube after its cleaned. Some other reviewers indicate that they don't stick, but I've never had a problem with mine.

"My hood latch broke on my F-150 & I had a dead battery.  So dead that even the power locks & dome light didn't work.  So I fig i'd try this charger instead of calling a mechanic out to my house which would be expensive.  Needless to say, I didn't have high hopes.  Especially after seeing all the negative reviews here.  But I fig i didn't have much to lose so I bought it & hooked up between my corvette & F-150.  After a few min, the lights on the dash inside my truck flickered off & on but when I turned the key...nothing except a clicking sound.  Which is what I expected.  But after charging for 10 min, still no green light on the charger.  So I was a lil worried.  Almost unplugged it & put it back in the box but I thought maybe, just maybe, it needs more time.  Sure enuff, 5 min later, the green light lit up & the engine was trying to turn over.  After another 10 min, wah-lah, my truck started right up.  So it does work IF you're patient.  You also have to make sure the key is turned to ACC on the dead car.  I mistakenly had mine at the ON position for 5 min.  So I would definitely recommend this if you have the time or are in a jam like I was.

Update: I will add that I had to charge my battery again the next day so be aware that, just like jumper cables, this is only a temporary fix if your battery is really old or dead like mine was.  And you'll likely still have to replace it soon after you get it charged.",4.0

I love the technology have not used it yet!,4.0
"I purchased this item about a year and a half ago when I left a light on in my F-350 pickup and the battery was very dead.  No lights, no clicking when trying to start it.  Nothing.  I was pulled all the way into the garage where the front of the truck was against a wall.  The grill comes up with the hood so there wasn't sufficient room to open the hood and I couldn't put it in neutral to push it back without power.

After plugging this in and letting it do it's thing for 10 minutes (the green light came on) nothing appeared to have changed.  I unplugged it from the donor vehicle and plugged it in again.  I repeated this procedure (unplugging it when the green light came on and plugging it in again) for an hour until it finally had enough power to start.  It was a pain to use but it got the job done.

Yesterday I had the same problem but I had replaced the battery with a larger one with more cranking amps.  It took me 2 1/2 hours to get enough of a charge to start it.  The truck battery measured 12.1 volts after it started and I was able to back it out.  I was then able to use a charger to get it up to 12.6 volts.  If I had been able use jumper cables or connect a charger rather than use this device I certainly would have, but under the circumstances it was my only option.",4.0

I figure I won't need much charge to light up the dash and get the car running, should I run my battery down.  However, a friend brought up one caveat, which is that with keyless ignition, one can't always go power plug to power plug.  So I got a set of these http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00065L2D8/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_19 to go with this device.  They are a nice set of light duty battery clips - perfect for the little battery in my Prius.",4.0
This is ok if you have access to another car that is not dead. I live on my own and don't have people to help me so this did not work for my personal life.

If you're in a hurry and feel confident in knowing what you are doing, jumper cables are the way to go.  However if you want something that's safe, easy and are willing to allow a few extra minutes, the Easy Quick Jumper is not a bad alternative and works extremely well.",4.0
"The shipping of this generator was good. The shipper was ABF Trucking. Their local agent coordinated with me before delivery, which took place two days early.
  The generator was shipped with the portability kit in the same box. The instructions for assembly were clear and understandable, but did not help me attach the foot brackets to the generator frame. The frame was drilled but not tapped, so I could not get the screws that were provided started. I used a 1/4-20 tap to thread the holes. Assembly time was about two hours.
  After following the preparation instructions, putting fuel in the tank and oil in the engine, and reading the starting instructions on the top of the fuel tank, I pulled the starting cord once, and the engine started. This generator provides enough electricity to run my water pump (1 HP), start my oil burner and run the circulating pumps, run the refrigerator, TV, and provide 1500 watts of lighting. It still had capacity left over, since it handled the startup load of the water pump very well. At $679 this generator is a great backup power source for the average size household. A voltmeter and loadmeter on the control panel would be nice, but at this price I think that is too much to ask.",4.0
"I have used this generator for a few small jobs so far. Worked great. Very easy to start. Large fuel tank. Plenty of amp  capacity for startup amperage. Manual could be a little clearer on wiring the plug (inc) for 220v. Shipping sucked, took forever. ABF lost it, then found it, so I said, leave it where it is, I'll come and get it.

"I purchased the Porter-Cable BSI550-W 5,500 Watt Generator with 10 HP Engine because I had to have portable power for residential construction. I bought it so I could run 13 - 15 amp circular saws and a 15 amp, 5 h.p. electric air compressor. It would not kick the compressor on when the air was at 100 lbs. so a serviceman set the rpm at 3700 rpm instead of the factory set 3600 rpm, which generates at 140 volts, no load. It runs great and runs super good. The negative side is having to idle it above the recommeded rpm and the extremely loud noise it makes even with the quiet muffler that it came with. There is also a loud rattling sound in the lower part of the 10 hp B and S engine. I don't know if that's a defect that can be fixed or something that you have to live with. It seems to come from the engine connecting rod to the piston. Other than that it is a great generator for the price. A person who uses it occasionally might not even be bothered by the rattling noise.",4.0
"I needed a powerful but sealed power-pack (sealed battery + converter)  for poolside use, to power a large 110-volt karaoke machine for five hours a day.  The Xatrex 1500 is the only power-pack I've found that meets this requirement.

It was a pleasant surprise to find that the wheels have rubber rather than (noisy) plastic treads.

The first 1500 stopped working with a bang after two hours.  When I phoned the Xantrex company, the technician I soon was talking to quickly concluded that my 1500 had malfunctioned and recommended that I return it.  I was pleased with this candor.  The second 1500 has worked for about a month now.

Not obvious is that the 1500 has a small storage cabinet, in which I store an extension cord.

Both 1500s arrived undamaged.  A disclaimer is that I bought my 1500s from costo-dot-comm, which is relevant because perhaps Costco uses different packaging for shipping.

The ""large karaoke machine"" is a MegaStar CM-K1100, and its average draw has been 30-something watts.

Power pack delivered as advertised. Be aware that if your looking for a long lasting high power output this is not the power pack you need. I have a limousine and I use it for night runs that power the TV laser lights fog machine and scanner. Works great for 3 Hours or so depending on how much I use the fog and scanner. Power pack would run TV and laser lights all not long. but Fog and Scanner drains power pack in 3 Hrs. Fog 800-Watt out put scanner 400-Watt out put. I use Fog just a few times during night runs. and Scanner about 1HR.Be aware of what your trying to use this power pack for and us simple math to understand your time of use before expiring.

"We purchased this primarily to operate a Rinnai tankless natural gas water heater so that when the power goes out, we can still have hot water. The Rinnai requires 70 watts of power during operation and the Xantrex 802-1500 seemed to deliver this without any problem. After ~15 minutes of operating the water heater, the unit was down to about 3/4 of a charge, so obviously, this is not a long term solution. However, for temporary power disruptions and for relatively short duration operation of low power appliances, this seems to be performing as advertised.",4.0
I was a little concerned about the mixed reviews that this item has received. I plugged a small space heater into it and it powered it just fine for a couple of hours.

I'm using mine to temporarily power up my refrigerators in the event we have a power outage in the near future (read the news and you'll see what I mean).  It's a temporary solution until I decide to invest in a solar power or gas powered generator.

I'll come back with an update if there are any issues.",4.0
"We've been using a couple of these units for the past 5 years.  They work perfectly for camping because of their portability.  They're also versatile.  When they're not being used for camping, I store them in the garage with their 5-amp float chargers attached so that we have a source of power in an emergency.  Last winter during a snow storm we lost power for several hours.  During the outage we used our battery boxes to power two christmas tree light-sets and a couple of lamps.

Each unit includes a 12V 63AH battery-set consisting of three 12V 21AH SLA AGM batteries.  Each unit can be augmented with an additional 63AH battery-set for a toal of 126AH or 1512 watt-hour available as 120VAC via a 1350 watt continuous-use inverter.  The inverter is capable of providing 1500 watts for no more than 10 minutes, and 3000 watts for a short period (start-up current).  We recharge them in the woods with an 80 watt PV solar panel, which can't keep up with our use while camping, but it does slow their discharge rate down a bit.

This year I had to replace the batteries because they weren't holding much of a charge.  The capacity of SLA batteries is a function of time and after 5 years have roughly 40% of their original capacity.  Replacement 12V 17-21AH batteries cost from $40.00 to $50.00 each.

Here's a link to a Powersonic 12V 21AH SLA battey.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Powersonic-PSH-12180FR-12-Volt-21-Amp-Hour-Sealed-Lead-Acid-Battery-with-Nut-Bolt-Connector-and-Flame-retardent-case/dp/B0002ILK0O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Powersonic PSH-12180FR - 12 Volt/21 Amp Hour Sealed Lead Acid Battery with Nut-Bolt Connector and Flame retardent case.</a>

Next year I'm going to add 63AH battery-boxes to each of them to boost their capacity.  This will give us 3024 watt-hours of portable power! (cue Tim Allen)

The reason why I gave it 4 stars vs. 5 is because the handle and wheels are a bit winkey.",4.0
"I bought one of these units a year ago and have been somewhat pleased. The basic cart worked well enough but when I put much of a load on it, it would cut out. Then I added 4 of the 18 amp hour sealed batteries that they recommend in their directions and am very happy with the results. I even pulled out my monster Kirby vacuum cleaner (the kind with powered wheels) and vacuumed my whole 2bdrm condo. I bought a couple solar panels and a charge controller and wired them up during a practice power outage (I shutoff all the circuits in my fuse box except my refrigerator) and went through a day without power. I highly recommend this for anyone who's serious about preparing for power interruptions.
The directions recommend sealed batteries since you can roll the cart around without smelling battery acid or spilling it on your carpet. If you're really serious about this stuff though, you might even want to pickup a few serious deep cycle batteries and put them in a stationary location and use a cable to connect it to the cart.
I did notice one slight drawback. The inverter seems to kick out some noise if I use it to power my ancient boom box from the 80's. You might need to get a pure sign wave inverter if you're going to power sensitive electronic equipment.
If the price of this cart is too much, you can make a stationary version of this with a couple sealed deep cycle batteries, a charger for it (that shuts off automatically, like the one that comes with the cart) and a good sized inverter. You could throw it all in one of those plastic boxes that can buy at any big box store.",4.0
"I decided to purchase this product after experiencing a prolonged black out while shaving my face around 5 am. ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH. I have tested this generator to determine its capacity to deliver the next time I would need it. It will function well if used to operate small low powered decvices, radio, tv, computer, shavers, light fixtures, charging cell phones, etc. however it is not up to snuff for larger appliances such as a refrigerator or freezer. Recharge every 3-4 months to keep charge level full this take 1-2 minutes and recharge immediately after using. A fantastic product for times when everything in your house goes out out except your flash light.",4.0
"Xantrex has changed the battery capacity of the Xantrex XPower Powerpack 1500. The unit delivered to me now has 51 AH (Amp Hour)'s of battery storage instead of the 60 AH listed in the Amazon product description or 63 AH listed in the downloadable product manual. The smaller battery capacity will shorten the charge time but will also shorten the time things will run when plugged into the unit.

Also note that the inverters output is 1350 watts continuous, 1500 watts  burst for 10 minutes and 3000 watts maximum AC surge.",4.0
I used this thing for powering up some lights on an independent film and it worked out great. Four hours of non-stop filming and it still had enough juice to jump start my brothers car. I can't say enough good things about this  inverter.,4.0
"It is now summer of 2008 and we have finally had a couple of long power failures. Imagine my shock when the 'low power' warning buzzer on the unit came on after an hour; the unit was fully charged and we were only running a lamp with a 60 watt bulb! I subsequently tested it rigorously and, while it could power much bigger load items (like our fridge) than our little 400 watt version, it barely even lasted an hour. Meanwhile, our stupid little 400 watt version went three hours when tested on lamps and fans and such. I tested the 1500 on the exact same lamps and fans and it always conked out early. Luckily, the company rep has been very nice and they are replacing it under the one year warranty, but I will have to pay the (60 pound) shipping to them (and box this cumbersome beast up). They'll pay for the shipping of the new one to me. I'm not happy. Stay tuned and I'll let you know how the new one fares--you can be sure I'll be testing it right away. If it's the same deal as this I'll be requesting a refund and will not be at all happy about shipping it back. I may need to bring Amazon into the mix if that happens.

Original review follows (oh, and to answer the question asked of the original review, I ordered it from Amazon, who packed it so well. Now I'm worried about what shape the new one will arrive in!)

I had purchased a 400 watt portable power device (same manufacturer; Xantrex) about a year previous and was very pleased at its ability to power a fan and lamp for several hours during power failures. Then I started thinking about keeeping a fridge going during a summer power failure (we live in the woods; trees fall, lines snap)and found this bad boy on sale. It arrived double boxed--the store box nestled inside a shipping box with custom made foam dividers--in perfect shape. It was also fully charged. I've only used it for a few tests to see if it worked, and it functions well. The hand truck that supports it and makes it easy to move around is very well made (excellent tires!) and was easy to assemble. The charging unit is itself a pretty high end device that can be used to recharge a dead car battery! I like the freedom and security this gives us, the price was right, it looks pretty cool and it should have all the power we need to keep things going while the guys in the trucks get the power back up.",4.0

"Got tired of local gas stations with broken air pumps, so I got this little dude. It works surprisingly well, although very slowly. It took about 3 minutes per tire to inflate from 26 to 32 psi on my car. If it were faster, it would be a five-star product.",4.0

"... when the battery is very very low, this charger refuses to charge it! Instead, I had to use an external automotive battery charger to bring the battery back up from ""really low"" to where this unit would accept it. This was quite unexpected! I thought this charger/inverter would happily charge any battery that could be charged. Some very generic off-the-shelf automotive unit had no problem bringing back the 130AH deep cycle marine battery I had hooked up to this thing.  I expected more from Tripp Lite, a respected name in power & charging.",4.0
"The unit waked up with the green LED's after utility and battery power were applied. The issue I had was what power should be applied first...utility (115vac) or battery (12vdc).

More information will be needed from the manufacturer to determine if the unit is operating efficiently with the Duracell 31DTMAGM battery being used.",4.0
"I have used or been familiar with Tripp-Lite products for many years, from revolving emergency lights to surge-suppressing power strips to this fine product and others. I have never once been disappointed. I have not yet exercised it to its maximum capacity but would recommend it for anyone.

P.S. I saw a post somewhere in which a gentleman referred to the output voltage being low. As a point of information, the voltage reading will not always indicate like typical line voltage because of the pseudo-sine wave output and depending on the meter that is used (digital dual-slope integration vs analog vs cheap vs technical level of experience) to acquire the reading.",4.0
"I put one of these in my 18-Wheeler and am very happy with it. I use it to charge my batteries when at a 'sure-power' station, and at home, and it provides 120volt power when not plugged in to an outlet. Having constant 120v power in my truck is fantastic, and I run a bunch of ham-radio gear (HF and VHF) off this thing as well. Although not completely pure sine-wave, there are NO 'birdies' or noise issues from any of my radios on any band, so thats great, but this thing is definitely NOT pure Sine-wave. I have a couple of laptop and cell-phone chargers that do not like the power this thing provides, and will refuse to operate when plugged into it. As far as 'Power', All i can say is 'WoW'! It definitely has no issue with providing power, and a lot of it. Microwave, computers, 1/2"" drills, I have even used a big shop-vac with it. The battery conditioning cycles it does when plugged in have definitely extended the life of my truck batteries, so that is good too. I installed a 250-AMP leese-neville alternator on my truck to go with this thing, and the alternator barely gets warm when using A 900watt microwave.",4.0
"Great inverter, no problems.  It's not pure sinewave, but it powers everything I've put on it except microwaves.  Electronics, tv, xbox all work fine.  I ran a large water pump that will trip out my 2000W Honda.  I use 4 deep cycles with heavy gauge (double 4/0) cable to get the full output.  Anything less and it's just a bigger 2000W inverter.

One drawback is that it's not efficient for light load.  If it's on, it's always trickling some current out of the batteries.  Six to eight amps.  There's an adjustable power sensor on it that drops the voltage off if theres not enough load and is supposed to be more efficient.  I've never gotten it to work well and the Xantrex's do this automatically.  My minifridge could be left to run over the weekend on those on a single deep cycle.  This one will drain four deep cycles in 36 - 48 hours.",4.0

Pros :However it runs my 19"" lcd tv fine,fans seem less powerful than an outlet but not a big deal. Flourescent lights work great and yes brewed my coffee with it and never broke a sweat (just make sure the vehicle is running when you do because it might sense a low battery and shut off)I run 2 batteries with mine and they are charged with solar power for back up power at home.

I bought another unit from Amazon immediately when this one failed (2day shipping, I now have 2 ) and the second one has ran, again flawlessly, for 4 months. I have a use for the second unit in another building. For the price, this is a good unit.
We use this unit 24/7 to power a 40' travel trailer we live in (@ 6000ft) while building a home. Of course we have to be power conscious, but it serves our needs.
I have  had Trace, Heart, and Magnum inverter/chargers. All were bullet proof!!, but a lot more expensive, which is why I chose to try this one. I added the remote monitor to this unit so I don't have to open the compartment to check the state of charge of the batteries.

"Good, stylish charger; can use cell phone or electronics while the item is being charged. There is a slight humming noise due to the fan, but while you are driving (especially on the highway) it is not that noticeable. Be sure to have the switch to the unit in the ""OFF"" position before plugging into the cigarette lighter. Plug in, then wait 15 seconds for the unit to warm up. Make sure that your car is actually running since idling the car will not be sufficient to power up the unit. Not doing so will result in the unit beeping and the red light flashing from time to time. Wait for the green light. Now you can use your normal household plug. Be sure to turn off the unit before turning off your car engine, since it might force your radio to stay on even though the key has been taken out of the ignition.

"Put this in my 2000 Honda Civic yesterday. The instructions don't cover single DIN installation, just ISO installation (whatever that is). With the mounting sleeve that came with the receiver, I didn't need to use *any* of the included plastic side brackets at all, so I left those off. All I needed to do was insert the mounting sleeve and bend a few of the metal tabs on the sleeve to keep it securely in place.

The instructions also say that you need to trim off a number of tabs and leave four of them, two on top and two on bottom. After much finagling, I determined that *none* of the tabs around the exterior of the main piece are needed, as the metal factory brackets keep the unit in place quite securely. I do recommend that you carefully use an X-Acto knife or Dremel tool or something sharp to shave off the tabs on the top (the tabs that the instruction manual says to leave on), as if there is any remaining bits of those tabs protruding upward, they will make the top part of the kit protrude down a little. (The perfectionist part of me wants to fix that, but it was a beast getting the radio out and I don't really want to do it again!)

Otherwise, this kit works perfectly and looks good. I like the matte finish, even though it doesn't quite mesh with the interior of my Honda--at least it doesn't clash. The pocket underneath the radio is shorter in height than the factory pocket, but it is deeper, so my iPhone fits in there even better than with the factory one.",4.0

"I don't understand how this thing works, but it works.  I took my giant shovel and my SnowMover Heavy Duty Snoplow and used one on one half of my snow covered deck, and one on the other half of my deck.  It only took half the time to push the snow off my deck with the SnowMover than it did with the big shovel.  My regular big shovel kept getting stuck. But the SnowMover snowplow just glided smoothly as I pushed. I did break the SnowMover snowplow the first time I used it.  I hit a chunk of ice and the handel detached on one side from the bottom part, and as I pulled back the other side popped as well. It happened real quick, one minute I was plowing and then the next, I heard the pop, and as I jerked to a stop, I heard a second pop.

I think they really need to re-think the way the handle attaches to the shovel part.  I'm not good at explaining, but the yellow handle connects to the shovel by there being a hole on each side of the handle and it fits down through the top of the shovel base and is held into place with two strange screws.  I say strange because I don't know what these type of screws are called that have a plastic wrapping on them.  But the holes that hold the screw in place if that hole gets cracked there is nothing you can do with the Snowplow because it is plastic.  In my case both of the holes on each side cracked.  I think the makers should use some type of metal to hold the handle and bottom together.

I contacted the seller through Amazon and I was sent a new SnowMover Snowplow right away, and I sent them the broken one.

After receiving the replacement plow, two pretty good snow storms hit back to back.  I watched out my window as many of my neighbors cleaned off their cars and taking a very long time to do it.  I waited until they were all done and I went out and took the SnowMover plow and systematically removed the snow from my car in no time at all.  I was able to clean off my entire car with little effort.

I'm cautious about breaking this one.  I really like it though, but I think you have to be careful to not snag it on anything because it seems pretty easy to that.  And I don't know if that is a good thing or bad thing.  I do however believe that the manufacturer needs to come up with a better way to attach the handle so it isn't easily broken.

And though it seems a little fragile than it should be, I really like this gadget.",4.0
"I purchased the SnowMover from Amazon last year(2008.) the SnowMover works well to remove snow from the hood, roof and windows.  However, the non-bristled edge has little effect on removing hard ice on the windows.  The SnowMover is handy to keep in the trunk.  In addition, I wish the SnowMover extended more than 42 inches long.  The other day I made quick work of the snow built up on my car with a long handled push broom, even as I was concerned about the hard bristles.  Luckily, the ice layer(underneath the snow) prevented the broom from scratching the car finish.  Otherwise, I would not have used it.  But, it was so very easy with the long handle of the push broom to make quick work of the snow on roof and hood and trunk. And the surface area of a push broom is much wider, as well.  If the manufacturer would make the SnowMover extend longer with a bit wider bristle surface, I would give it 5 stars plus.  The Snowmover is extremely lightweight and I love that aspect of it, so it could handle longer extension and wider surface area very well without adding much weight.  And the SnowMover is durable if used as designed.  But, remember, you will need to keep a good ice scraper in your automobile, in addition to the Snow Mover.",4.0

The problem here,  the handle is designed to move - you push it in to dispense soap to the cleaning head . Most people buy this for the extra reach. It would be better if you could lock the handle.",4.0
I like my Auto Wash Stick.  I have washed my car two times since receiving it.  I am 74 years old.,4.0
"I received my Auto Wash Stick after the temperature dropped to the 20s and 30s. I finally got a day that was 39 degrees so I washed my pickup truck. It was great! I did not have to put my hands in the bucket of soapy water. By sucking up the soapy water into the wand, I reduced the time it took to wash my truck because I did not have to reload so many times. I would recommend this item to anyone.",4.0
"It cleans well in places that can be hard to reach otherwise.  The curve that people are talking about flattens with slight pressure, and is not an issue except at the extreme range of the handle.  The fluid in the handle is not all that useful.  Sponge on a stick is what it is and it works pretty well  at medium distances.",4.0
works wonderful has reach loads up with was very easy to use makes the job fast. Amazon got it right made it easy for me.,4.0
"Soak it,wet it, wash it .... easily cleans the car by using this product and a bucket of water and soap. Now that is summer, very useful and functional in cleaning cars.",4.0
"The Auto Wash Stick is perfect for doing my RV and I also find it useful washing the roof of my cars. I did experience the slide action becoming stiff, to the point that one of the O-rings moved out of place, pinched, and tore.  HomeRight sent me replacement O-rings straightaway without fuss.  Installing new O-rings is a bit tricky, sticking the plunger back in the tube, but liquid soap solved that problem for me.  And this is the first problem ever.  I have probably used my Wash Stick for over 10 years.  What's to complain about something like that, particularly at this price point?",4.0
I use it for washing the top of my car. Now I do not need a step ladder. I can reach all of the hard to reach places.,4.0
"I use this for my cars and home windows. It does the job as stated. If it had a foot or two of telescopic pole, it would be perfect.",4.0
"This useful auto wash tool makes things like washing the roof of your truck easy within reach.  Handy Soap storage is convenient as well.
The only improvement that could be made is that the head to be more flexible",4.0
"Having used it twice I can say this, it's easy on my back, which is why I bought it. It does an OK job though. The mitt doesnt fit real well but it does the job. When sucking soluton into the barrel it will leak out on its own so in a sense once you've filled it up you have a 4ft long wash stick.",4.0
"I find it useful for washing hard to reach places like the roof, back window, windshield and bed cover on my tacoma truck. I can wash all those places from one side of the truck. I like washing the places I can reach with my hand using just a sheepskin mitt because I usually run water on the spots while I'm wiping to help wash away the gritty dirt. I find that the water that the stick holds doesn't go a long way. Too bad they don't make it so you can attach a garden hose directly to it and keep the water running. I like it better than a flow through brush that I bought before. The brush bristles would miss thin areas in between them so you would see streaks of dirt after making a couple of passes with it.",4.0
"The backing for the mitt has a slight curve and fairly soft flex that does a surprisingly good job on and around door trim.  Uses more washing solution than hand washing, but that is the only negative.",4.0
"This is a fine tool for wintertime car washing.  No stooping, no stretching, and keep your hands out of the wash bucket - with this little wand, I can wash across the roofline of my car from either side - wash the car in 10-15 minutes in my driveway and save $$$ - also, better for car finish than commercial car washes.

It sucks soapy water from your wash bucket into the wand handle fairly well, and feeds it out as needed, so you don't have to go back to the bucket so much.

A good product.",4.0
"Overall, the HomeRight Auto Wash Stick works well on flat surfaces but if your car has wheel well mouldings, fender flares, spoilers, air dams, roof racks, or just about anything not flat, I find it hard to get those areas. And many places can't be gotten to no matter what. It earns a 4 star because where it can be used it works pretty good. If your car is an easy car to wash then perhaps you will really like it. Mine is a hard one to wash so when I get done, I let it dry then go back and wash the areas I missed by hand. Even with that, it's still easier and quicker than washing the whole thing with a sponge. Plus the long handle makes it easier to do the roof without stretching or reaching and the lower areas without stooping. It feels a little light duty and I worry how long it will last, but if it holds up well I would probably buy another.",4.0
"we've had this product probably for 24 months now.  it's as basic as it gets & works well.  i'm not sure why the other folks seem to have problems with the product moving.  i find if you pull in straight, it works perfectly. the only time it might move, and this has been quite rare in my experience, is when you pull in & as you drive on to the parking guide/mat, you turn the wheel----------the end result here is that the mat does move (duh....).  by & large, this product is ingenious in its simplicity & effective in daily usage.  it sure beats those who nail or screw 2x4s into their garage floor.  we routinely move ours to sweep or vacuum the garage floor.",4.0
"Was looking for way to park our cars in a garage that is tight for space.  Thought of hanging a tennis ball from the ceiling, but found in the past that my head hit the ball more often than the windshield of the car.

  The Racor Parking Guide provides a simple solution.

11/19/2006  Since having these for some time, found that the problem of sliding around the garage floor is a major pain.. back to the tennis ball",4.0
"This product works great if you keep an eye on it.  I have an explorer, and the mat tends to slide forward a little every time you park.  I've already customized the front wall in my garage with my bumper, so be careful...adjust it every few weeks.  otherwise, it's indispensible.  couldn't park without it.",4.0
"Works well, however, the smooth surface on the bottom allows it to slip easily.  Would give 5 stars if there were rough texture on the bottom to provide friction and reduce slipping.",4.0
"The parking guides that I received (I ordered 2) have been through a winter in Wyoming.  These arrived with adhesive strips on the back of them so they could be secured to the garage floor.  I didn't use the strips, however, as I felt it was more important to be able to move them out of the way so I could clean the garage floor from time to time.  So in my case, I just pulled my vehicle in to the garage and positioned it where I wanted it to be, then I laid the guide on the floor next to the driver's front tire, backed up a couple of feet, then slid the guide into place.  If you are aligned correctly when you pull into the garage, the large bar on the guide is readily detectable when you drive over it, cuing you to stop.  It works pretty well, although I occasionally miss the stop altogether, which is hardly the fault of the guide.  My wife pulls into the garage at a higher rate of speed than I do, and she sometimes drives over both bars without noticing the first one.  Since I did not secure the guides to the garage floor, they do tend to move a little just from driving on them and stopping.  The guide has an approach apron that minimizes movement, however.  No problem, you just re-position it and start over.",4.0
"Just as other reviewers have mentioned, the adhesive came undone really quickly. Within a week roughly. I used duct tape to tape it to the floor since then and it works fine",4.0
"Have to stick down the leading edge or it will curl - thats the only hitch.  Great product, easy to use, no more tripping on 2x6.  Bought a second one for other car.",4.0
Works as expected. Be careful not to bump and move after you place,4.0
Easy to use.  Should prevent my daughter from running into the garage wall again.,4.0
like it,4.0
Excellent,4.0
Perfect for a small garage. It sticks to the floor and stops you in the same place every time. No more guessing if the car is in far enough to close the garage door.,4.0
"I bought this product because in the past, I would have to get in and out of my car every time I came home to make sure that I was in not to far and sticking out not too much.  Now I just drive into my garage, pull up slowing until I feel my wheel go over the bump, and I am in perfectly every time.  What a time saver.  No more in and out of my car to make sure I am  in enough to avoid the garage door hitting my car.  I would highly recommend this product.",4.0
"First, why are there two different items pictured? -1*

I got the rounded bump one, in case others are wondering.  It works as it should.  It had sticky tape on the bottom.  I cleaned the spot on the garage floor and then applied.  It hasn't moved in over a month.  If it starts to move I would just put a couple dabs of liquid nails under it.",4.0
No mess no fuss!!! Makes parking in the garage a mear bag of shells!!!  One doesn't need two to make it work.,4.0
"The product arrived timely and the free shipping was excellent. I park my 90 Porsche Carrera in a tight space so this takes the guesswork out of deciding when and where to stop  each day I come home.
Only down side is that it did move (about 3 inches) fortunately I marked the location so was able to easily relocate it to the correct spot.",4.0
This product is hard to find in stores although listed on may websites such as Home Depot.  It is worth the price and has stopped me from hitting stored items in my garage.  Two things to make it better would be a larger bump on the end so it is harder for go past the end and a non-skid bottom for it to stay in place better.  But it really does the trick as is.,4.0
"I read the reviews before purchasing this product. The other reviews are right in that it does shift over time, especially if the wheel is moved while on top of it. Since I knew this going in the product works as planned. I marked lines for 1 of the corners and move it every once in a while to reposition it. I didn't use sticky tape and it only moves a small amount over a few weeks time. If you buy this just expect to correct it time-to-time.",4.0
"Its simple and it works. i have a small garage for two of my cars. My wife always hits something while parking a car as length of the garage is just little more than length of our cars. Placing these mats at correct position saves me dents and scratches on my cars. I bought two of them.

I gave four stars because these mats moves when car tire turns a little while parking. But I learned to make my tires straight before getting on this mat.",4.0
"Being a little olde school, I'd been looking for this sized ""club"" for a number of years before it occurred to me to check with the source...Amazon.
It's the right size for a truck and locks itself as you extend it unlike its predecessors. I chose free shipping and had it in five days.",4.0
"After somebody tried to steal my pickup truck twice in a month, a police officer told me to be aware that the bad people was coming back for my truck... He recommended buying The Club although he was very specific not to buy the kind they sell at Wal-Mart. He told me to look around for a Club made specifically for trucks like mine, a GMC 2006. I was glad to find it at AMAZON and I don't regret it, maybe it is twice as expensive but it's worth the price... I still have my truck...

Update: 5 years in a row... I still have my Club... I still have my truck... 1/10/2012",4.0
Love the added piece of mind this gives you works real well,4.0
"I have owned this club for two or three years and all of a sudden I can't get the key all they way in to unlock it, took me over an out to finally unlock it, I won't put it back on, afreaid of no getting it off the next time.",4.0
Not as long as the first version but still a good deterrent.,4.0
"Purchased for an Expedition and I wish I had gone with the shorter arm version.  I prefer to get these clubs wedged up in to the windshield so that there is very little potential movement of the steering wheel and this arm is a few inches too long for that usage.  I did, however, figure out a way to get it wedged between the driver's seat cushion and the center console and there is almost no movement possible in the wheel.  I only use when we park in wide open places, but it does what it's supposed to do.",4.0
"good quality, its nice they gave us 3 keys for it",4.0
worked fine,4.0
"well i have had this for about a year and still have not had my truck stolen, so it must be working",4.0
"We used this on our Penske when we moved cross country and it really helped us feel secure about all of our worldly belongings.  I'm not sure if we needed ths SUV size... we were still using one of the lower extension settings, but at any rate glad I bought it.  It came with three keys, perfect for scatterbrains.",4.0
I was looking for an extra large steering wheel club and this one works well on my full sized F-250.  Easy to install and remove and a bright red color so it's easy to see.,4.0
"Seems simple enough to describe it as beefy, decently constructed, and seems like it will fit any vehicle even though it's advertised as being for trucks. I've never owned one before, so don't have a wealth of experience to draw on. At this point I don't know why I'd ever mess around with anything different. Considering getting a second one for the other vehicle.
Cons are that when first taken out of the package it smells really bad, like a toxic plastic. It has a warning on it about being a carcinogen and washing your hands after handling. It was bad enough that I couldn't leave it in my car for the first week. It'd give me a headache. I left it out on the porch for a few days and it seemed to dissipate.
My truck has not been stolen or messed with in the three weeks I've had it.",4.0
"Well I received the product before the promised delivery time. Build quality is very robust. Lock is quite good. But I agree with other people that is only a deterrent to prevent auto theft, as the steering can be cut open. Adding some other deterrents and preventive measures can help in preventing autuo theft.",4.0
"First of all, the gloves I received were different from the picture here. The palm is entirely smooth, no stitching. So until they break in a bit, the palms tend to bulge OUT when closing your fist. These run SMALL due to the thick foam/gel/whatever construction. Order a size LARGER that normal! Like another reviewer stated, these are NOT for small hands. The padding is so thick that you would compromise the strength of your grip just overcoming the padding. They are great for LARGE handled tools (jackhammers, hammer drills, etc.), but forget it for anything else. They are just too thick for any kind of tactile feel.",4.0
Good product...works as designed,4.0
Compact size and works fine.,4.0
Well... I bought this duster with a bit of skepticism... having just bought a new car!  It works very well when you literally have a light dusting to remove... which is what I was looking for... for in between car washes!,4.0
"Somewhat skeptical, I ordered this car duster expecting it to be more hype than practical but it does a pretty good job!  Be aware that it works best on dry dust.  Once your car gets a sprinkling of rain or the dew settles on it, you'll be better off washing the old fashioned way.",4.0
"This product works rather well. I seem to have an OCD concerning car care so naturally I'd like to save a little time and money while trying to stay 'spotless'. This duster does the trick. Do read the directions though. The wax from the duster will streak at first especially on windows. Also, the duster doesn't pick up things like water spots from the dew the night before. But for things like pollen, road dust, and small bugs it works great.

EDIT: It's now been nearly 7 years since I first wrote this review. I wanted to add that I am still using the same duster! The vinyl sheath that it comes in has split down the side but the duster is still going strong. I've never washed it but since I kept my cars pretty clean anyway it never was badly soiled. Occasionally fibers will fall out or get stuck on trim pieces but, I would say it is 95% intact after all these years. I probably use it a few times a month on average now but about twice a week for the first year or two that I owned it.",4.0
"Works great second one , user my old one on boat",4.0
Good item,4.0
It does what its supposed to do but also sheds  hundreds of tiny red fibers all over the place. I need another duster to take them off now lol,4.0
It is shedding red threads even after multiple uses.,4.0
"Worked great.

Cleans up the dust off the car very well,4.0
"I used one of these water-blades at a school car wash and was sold. The parent that brought the water-blade said he had received it as a gift and was really happy with it, used it a lot. It does not remove all the water, you still have some small amounts that will require a towel, but this is a small amount. We used it on 20-30 cars at the car wash to pre-dry the cars before the kids finished the job and it worked great! Purchased one for myself, so I guess that's a good recommendation.",4.0
Works great for quick dusting.,4.0
"I have a black Dodge Challenger and this thing really works for me.  Basically it's a dust mop for your car.  Normally I wash my car every weekend, but now it looks like I can go every two weeks.  So far so good.",4.0
"works but does leave small red fibers at 1st, has to be broken in.",4.0
it seems smaller and less mop to it than what they used to be.,4.0
"Had my doubts, but got a new car, and had problems with water spots after a wash.  The first time I used the California Car Duster Water Blade, I was sold.

Still need to catch a few drops with the Chamois, but reduces drying time by 1/2.",4.0
"This device removes 90% of the water more effeciently than any other product I've yet used.  The problem is it does not do a very good job on those sections of the auto which have curved surfaces.  On those surfaces
you will need to use whatever it was that you had been using.  I'm certain that over time one will grow more proficient with this tool and clear perhaps 95% of the standing water, leaving only a small amount of water to be removed by conventional means.  All in all I am happy with this product.",4.0

This is the only Duster that I will ever own. It is of very good quality and will get every dust particle off your newly washed and waxed vehicle without marring the finish. The only concern I have was that I  did not realize just how heavy this Duster was when I was using it for extended periods of time. This is the reason I rated it a 4 star instead of a 5 star, that, and the fact I could not give it a 4 1/2 star.  It does cover a lot of surface in a short time because of its size. The mop head itself is 13"" long and and when you add the handle to it, it makes the whole Duster 24"" long. It does come with a nice plastic bag to store the Duster in when not in use. .As far as I am concerned this Duster is the best I have found anywhere.
Yes, I would recommend this California Duster to anyone. I would also buy it again if I needed too!",4.0
Works well,4.0
As described.,4.0

"I love this mop.  Er, sorry, ""car duster.""  Even though we are east of the 100th meridian, there is still a lot of dust settles in and around by garage.  So, I saw this thing and thought ... hey, if it works in California, it ought to work here.

It does.  I'm happy",4.0
"This duster did leave lint at the start, but after some use is working fine.",4.0

"The desert gets really dusty, so having this product to swipe over my car (especially windows) helps me save money on car washes. I wish the package had included a bigger cover to store the brush in. It's awkward putting it back into the same cover it came in, once you start accumulating dirt.",4.0
It's a car duster but it works for motorcycle too,4.0
"As others here have said, Ca dusters are not what they used to be.  Wood handle or plastic, the main problem is how few threads there now are in the standard size.  I bought this big one to try to compensate for that and seem to be successful.  It is big and hard to sweep nicely across one's car.  I may shorten the handle.  I'd rather simply have the old, smaller one with the one side packed with dense strings.  Yes, this did arrive with to much oil/wax but that is good in the long run.  Mine is wrapped in news paper to absorb a bit of it.",4.0
works as stated,4.0
"Works real quick for dusting tile floors.
With the fine dust we get down here in Florida, it works great.",4.0

"The product had an unusual amount of an oily stuff on it. Had to clean the inside of the bag with soap and water. The duster itself was wet but we put in on newspaper, rolling it daily for a week or so till it felt ready to use. There was a lot of oily stuff on it also. Once it dried it worked as expected and has become a great product.",4.0
I have a black car and it really shows the dust.  This duster removes it all.  Glad of purchase.,4.0

"I do enjoy this although I also worry about whether or not this is truly safe for the paint finish. I do see some very meticulous owners of some pricey cars use these so there's that, but I still worry.",4.0
"I use this on my big rig and it works great, except it broke at the plastic pivot after about 6 months. But I just ordered another one cuz i like it so much. The plastic hardware should be made out of metal.",4.0
I wish this was as big as the car version. The mop handle is normal length (like a broom) but the mop head is only ~ 2/3 the size of the car duster sadly. These makes a great floor mop. If only I could figure out a way to jury rig the car version one onto the handle.,4.0

"I was already familiar with the product line because I have the hand duster, which is terrific for dusting in the house.  I purchased this item for dusting our cars and for reaching the corners of our ceilings in the house.  This duster is fairly heavy, and it appears that if I use it to dust in the corners of house, I'm going to get a workout, because the item is heavy.  Men should find this no problem.  There is a terrific amount of dusting capacity for use on your car, however.  Amazon has run this item as low as $15 with super saver shipping.",4.0

"Any time you touch paint with ANYTHING it will scratch. Period.  Understand this....

Ive used the california duster for 10 years, two different ones.  It is a minimally destrcutve way for taking dust off the paint.  HOWEVER, it will increase 'microscratchung'.  Dust and particles trapped on the threads are subsequently dragged over the paint.  These leave ultrafint scratches in the surface.  (Your eyes see thses as 'swirls' or 'microswirls'- they are random scraches that, due to the otics of your eye and light source seem to arrnage in circular patterns)

By regular application of wax or polymer sealants you can minimize these, but again- ANYTHING touching the paint will cause these.  (by 'anything', I mean fibers with dust particles, freshly laundered towels with miniscule hard water deposts in the thread....etc)

Here's the deal- I use this knowing it can cause scrathes- why?  It is one of the most minimal interventions you can use to get dust off...",4.0
This duster works great. I just do a dusting in the morning before I leave to work. Love it. Bought my first California Duster back in the 90's.,4.0

We decided to buy the California Car Duster for my wife's new car.  Her car is black and as most people know any dust on a black car is very noticeable.  The duster works well at removing the dust but it does leave behind tiny red fibers on the exterior of the car and windows.  I have been told after a while all the red fibers in the duster will no longer show up on the car.  We will continue to use it periodically to see if there is no residue left behind.  If there were no fibers left behind this product would get a 5 star but in my opinion I would rather see dust than red.,4.0
We live off a dirt road. My car is always dirty and dusty. Does a decent job of cleaning the windows off.,4.0

"The California Duster really works!  I have a white car, so dust shows really easily.  I don't have the time or resources to wash my car often, so using the California Duster has really been a boon for me to get the dust off and keep my car looking spiffy.

The only con with this product is the included vinyl storage bag.  It is an el cheapo bag and seemed to start leaking plasticizer oil about a month after I got it.  I ended up tossing that bag and am using a plastic grocery bag to wrap the duster for storage.  For a well-built and durable product, it's a shame that the manufacturer couldn't include a bag of similar quality.",4.0
I hate the wax residue it leaves on the car in the beginning! But after awhile it goes away!,4.0
Gotta leave it face down on the newspapers for a few days and it still will let you down a bit but ones it gets some use and dirties itself up a bit it turns into a solid product.,4.0

It works great with out scratching,4.0
This actually works.  Just by sweeping the car daily with this duster which only takes a minute my BMW 435i continues to be shiny without the carwash.  I don't know how this duster compares to other brand since this is the only one I've tried so far but I am happy with this one and won't look for other brand.  Just one little complain is that I wish the duster bag for storage to be little bigger.  Only 3/4 of the duster in length wise  fits in the bag.,4.0
I loved it for my cream colored car but I don't think it is as good on my new BLACK car.  When you think about it black cars are really hard to keep clean.  I still use it and it does work fine.,4.0

"This is a great tool for when you wash your vehicle, and afterwards when you need to dust it off during the pollen drop in the spring of the year. Let me tell you if you do not get the pollen off before it rains, then you can not use it, because the pollen will be stuck on the car to tight.",4.0
works fine,4.0
It's a lot bigger than i thought it would be. It gets the job done but its a bit heavy for me. My husband doesn't think it's heavy but for a woman it can be a tad heavy to use with one hand.,4.0

"I love California dusters for keeping my car clean between washes.  For some reason this last one I received leaves a little bit of of a waxy residue on the car, but I'm guessing it'll disappear after I've picked up a bit more dust.  This wooden handle model is very nice; my last one was plastic but still lasted for years.  A few quick sweeps keeps saves me a fortune in car washes.  Definitely a must for anyone that likes keeping their car clean but doesn't want to hit the car wash all the time.",4.0
A bit big.  Well constructed.  Case is worthless in my opinion.,4.0
"like this very much. it does a pretty decent job in getting dust off the car. It does leave somewhat of a wax residue, but it's really good for those quick clean-up jobs when you have a lot of dust on the job. good for in-between car washes.

"Great! Easier to use and does what it says.

If only the plastic bag was extra durable. I can tell it won't last too long.",4.0

Good,4.0
"Only because with my second use the handle fell off. Gorilla glued it back on, but had to pound down the staples first. I was a one star, but these dusters work so good I'm upping it up to 4. I haven't read any other buyers with this problem, so it must be a one in a million.",4.0
"It is effective, but does leave smudges from the wax on glass that's slightly annoying, along with red fibers are left behind - I've only used it about 5 or 6 times, maybe that'll stop happening after a while.",4.0
"Works great, but does start to actually get heavy (when dusting large surface areas) because of the wooden handle as other reviewers have reported. Returned for same item with plastic handle.",4.0
"I ordered the more expensive one with the wood handle wanting a more classic look.  However, the handle looked like it was made in China.  I was shocked at how rough and splintery it was - like it was turned with a very, very dull chisel.  I am surprised they would ship one looking as it did. The brush itself works very well and am happy to have it for that reason.",4.0

"Pretty good, although it does leave very small red fibers on the car. Hardly noticeable but, I recommend not brushing to hard with it. Just do lite, short strokes.",4.0
This has great reach and a heavy duty handle. The 'strings' are flimsy and shedding a bit right now. It looks like that will stop at some point though. It does do a good job. I like that it helps me reach the middle of my car since I am so short!,4.0
People were complaining about streaks but this works just as good as my 10 year old model it replaced. The handle feels a little cheaper but I haven't had any issues. Then again my car is white and maybe any streaking is harder to see. Just be sure to leave it out on some newspaper for a few days for best results.,4.0

"Am one of the most cynical consumers on the planet, but this duster really does work.  I bought the model with the wooden handle because it is more old fashioned, but the wood does make the device a bit heavy, especially since one is supposed to only glide the device lightly over the  car.  Yes, I would buy it again, and will recommend to others.",4.0
"Works well.  Doesn't always pick up the dust because of static, but I have yet to find a product that works perfectly for picking up dust.  I like to put it out the car window and shake it to get off any dust clinging to it before using it again in my car.  There is some sort of oil on the product; I like to keep mine in a plastic bag just so the oil doesn't get on anything else.",4.0
Use it to clean my car in India. It is pretty duststy hence cars need to be cleaned daily. This + the dust ends up eroding the  wax surface.  I normally dust the car down after I reach home and again early morning after my workout before the staff start cleaning the car. It is less effort for them and actually the car needs less washing especially if you have polished it.,4.0
Like this duster.,4.0
This is just what I needed for my car during the spring pollen season. It cleaned off the pollen and with a few shakes was good for the next use.,4.0
"Works like a charm, I can tell they have made adjustments in the quality of the product from my last one. I lost my old one, I know that's nuts but it's gone. It lasted me 8 years and I used it in the car and my home. It was dirty and worked awesome. I hope this one holds up as well. So far the only reason I don't give it 5 is the slight quality drop.
Buy it, you will want 2, one for the house, one for the car. Toss that swiffer in the trash, money sucking turd is blown away by this.",4.0

ok,4.0
"replacing the last one I lost, they work for dusting interior, I need to get a chain or something, I keep losing them out of my car door",4.0
"I've owned my Mini Duster for three years and find it is perfect for small places and tight spots. My only complaint is that the mop head fibers could be just a tiny bit longer. I believe if that were the case, it would perform better at lifting dust from areas that are like ""fake"" honeycomb (like in the attached picture.) The fibers on the standard are too thick for that type job. Otherwise, this is a superb product and I will be buying another very soon.",4.0
works great just hard to clean,4.0
"I love California dusters and would highly recommend them to anyone.  This one is smaller than one i had owned, and sadly  lost, in the past. Don't ever wash it, just shake it out. It doesn't get as gross as you'd think.",4.0

- Works pretty darned well. Still IF there is 'moisture' on the surface (like dew or on humid days) not as much - then it just pushes some of the dust around. When dry air - works really well.,4.0

"I have a California Duster for my car.  It is great!  Especially to use on a clean car in the Spring.  I brought 2 of these small ones to use around the house.  They pick up dust much like a Swiffer.  I use one on a baby grand piano.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that it is leaving a little lint around at the moment. I have a feeling it is because it is new but, I will have to see.",4.0
"Love this duster! The ONE complaint I have is that I have black interior, and the duster definitely leaves bits of red on the dash board after I use it. It cleans really well though and fits in my glove box. I keep the baggie it came in over it, it has a (nice enough) chemical smell to it so I didn't know if it's treated with something or not. Don't want it staining any fabric. Anyways, the duster works great and I just blow away any red bits. It hasn't really been an issue. I also love how the shape of the duster makes it so that I can dust the deep sides of my middle console. Like the space between my seat and where the console reaches the floor (if that makes sense)

I am happy with my purchase and I'd recommend it, despite the red stuff! It's not that much anyways but just know it's definitely there!",4.0
"Works great for keeping the interior clean, lives in my glove box, fast delivery, worth the price.",4.0
"I've owned this for several years now and it does a really nice job of keeping my dash clean and dust free. The soft fibers are treated with wax to give the dash a nice shine and to collect dust without leaving a greasy feeling behind and it won't scratch the surface of your dash. You can use this on shutters, blinds, and appliances, but I only use it in my car. To clean it, just shake the dust off outdoors after each use and keep on using it. I do like that it comes with a plastic sleeve case to store it in and the compact size makes it easy to store it in the glove compartment for quick cleanings.

My only complaint is that every time I use it, small red fibers fall off and get left behind on the surface, so the quality could be improved a bit. The fiber trail is terrible on the first few uses, but does get better with subsequent uses, though it will still leave some fibers behind.",4.0
I use these mini dusters to actually dust around the house. The California Car dusters are a little better quality than some brands.  Over the years though I'm noticing a slight decline in quality in all brands. This is about the best I've found.,4.0

"I like the product and it works. it didn't seem like it had a lot of paraffin on the mop part (smell test), but it did pick up the dust and cleaned it well. At first there was a minimal amount of red fibers that shed, but now it is nearly insignificant. Overall a non-issue. The supplied cover works fine, but it doesn't really fit all that well with the product... I dust off at red lights and I clean and then spray dressing on it to keep the plastic looking matte shiny and black.",4.0
Excellent car duster. I leave it in my glove box and it is great to remove excess dust. Make sure to follow the instructions upon first use as otherwise it will leave red strings behind.,4.0
Picks up dust effectively and is small enough to fit in glove box. Works good for a quick dust job between regular car cleanings.,4.0
"If you've even used a large California Duster on the outside of your car, then you know what to expect.  This is best used for the inside a car or the house due to it's small size (about the same surface area as a clothes iron).  When new it may leave a waxy residue and some lint.  That's normal.  Just ""season"" it with a few dustings, and both things will go away.  These things work better the dirtier they get.  So don't wash it - that will actually ruin its effectiveness.  Just be sure to shake it out before and after each use.  That's al the maintenance these things every require.

A note of caution - some of these dusters sold online from unknown vendors can be fakes.  They may look similar, but are cheep knock-offs of The Original California Duster than may not work as well.  So be careful with what you're buying and from whom.  I can certify that this item purchased from Amazon was the real thing that came with a storage case and instructions as it's supposed to.  You can always trust Amazon.  Unlike a Swiffer refill that loses effectiveness when not new and must be replaced, this will not simply push around dust.  It'll collect everything and gets better the dirtier it gets.  Pick up one for yourself.",4.0
I got this to use in my new car to keep the inside dusted but I liked it so much I brought it in to use in my house.  Makes dusting quick and easy.,4.0
"These are great dusters and very gentle. They are apparently supposed to get better with use. We'll see how that goes. 4 stars for now. 5 if it lives up to the hype over time. Also, the seller who filled our order only gave us one case, despite ordering three dusters.",4.0

Performs well.  I originally purchased this mini duster for my car but I have been using it around the apartment instead.  Works great!,4.0
"This is a nice little product for dusting my dash and console area in my new vehicle. The only problem I have with this little guy is the fact that it leaves behind little tiny bits of red particles from the duster fibers. To me, that is very annoying, and actually defeats the purpose of having the duster in the first place. Maybe because it's still relatively new, I'm not sure. Hopefully over time, these little fiber bits will go away the more I use the duster. Time will tell. Otherwise, it's a cool little product. FYI, AFTER I received this duster in the mail, I started seeing these things ALL OVER the place in my local big box auto shops, Wal Mart, etc...so save yourself some time and shipping costs and get one there. Just sayin'.....",4.0
"I have owned the full-sized version for years for fast dusting of my street rod at car shows. Yellow draws EVERY insect and bit of dust in the area. I was so satisfied with the larger one that I bought this smaller version to store and carry in my black Goldwing Trike.  The smaller one moves dust around, but isn't nearly as effective at picking it up as the older, larger one.  Maybe a different coating?  Maybe less coating on it nowadays??  This small one is OK if you're not very picky, but not half of what the older ones were.",4.0
When they say mini they mean mini me!!  The photos of this product are little deceiving I thought it would have been a little bigger/longer but that shouldn't detract from how effective this product works.  This product may streak the first couple of uses so I wouldn't recommend running it across plastic or glass at first.  The duster I purchased shed like crazy when I first used it. I don't know if that is common or not but it has since stop shedding over several uses.  Overall I am satisfied with the purchased and you will be too!,4.0

As usual, I started my search on Amazon and came up with the Blomus 12cm cover ashtray.

The item arrived in one piece, lid attached.  It's a nice size and looks like it will last a while. His covered deck keeps it from getting soaked during a rainstorm, which is a good thing.  Wet cigarette remains smell awful and I don't think that this ashtray will keep out water.  All in all, I am happy with my purchase.  This seems like a real value to me.",4.0

"These wipes are great to keep in your car. A can to clean the vinyl, a can to protect it and a can to clean the glass.

It sure beats keeping a roll of paper towels and a bottle of surface cleaner and glass cleaner in your car. I tuck these in the center console and just pull them out when I'm in a drive-thru or at a long red light.

The regular price is a little higher than what you might pay at an auto parts store, so you need to keep an eye out for price drops, but you get 75 towels all-together, so they'll last a long time. It's nice if you have Amazon Prime and can get the free shipping. Otherwise, you might get a better deal elsewhere.

I've bought similar wipes in the past and the problem I've always had is that they tend to dry up after a few months. I've only had these for a few weeks, so I can't attest to the longevity yet, but so far, they've stayed quite moist. If I still have some wipes left after a few months, I'll update my review with the results.",4.0
"All three of them tend to leave streaks behind if you aren't careful. The first time I used the protectant wipes it was in the evening.

"The armor all auto care cleaning pack came a bit dry upon first use. I was using the glass cleaning wipes and noticed that after lightly using it in a small area, the wipe was relatively drier than expected. I was able to clean the windshield as a side window before the wipe was completely dry, and this was the most effective way to leaving no streaks on the car. I tried using one wipe around the entire car, and this only left streams and leftover material from the wipe itself. However, when I used two wipes conservatively, I was able to clean the mirrors and windows thoroughly. The cleaning and shine protectant wipes were also relatively dry, but I was able to use them on the dash and the hood of the car. These wipes seem to offer a great way to safely wipe down your vehicle temporarily to battle against road grime and dust before you have to take it in for a car wash.

Overall, I thought that the wipes were a decent value, but I may have gotten a package that was already subjected to heat or on the older side.",4.0

It's meant to fit a moto helmet, but you could put a lot of different things. I personally carry groceries. You could fit a basketball too. The hooks are both good and bad. It's good because they're plastic, which means, they won't scratch your fairing, but bad because they're not secured too tightly -- when the net is tense you don't have to worry, but when not tense, the hooks can come off, so be careful if you have a thin bike and there's a lot of slack.",4.0

Was hoping this net would fit my needs for holding onto a tool bag on my quad and it did not disappoint. I used it on the the Hatfield and McCoy rock house trail and did not disappoint.,4.0
These cargo nets are well made and worked well for securing my cargo on the bike.  They are a good product and the only issue they have is that the hooks are plastic and a little big/wide so would not fit in all the usual nooks and crannies I usually use for securing on the motorcycle.  I will be sure to buy the ones with the thinner metal(coated) hooks next time anyway though.,4.0
I have a Kinkajou bottle cutter and I use these with my dremel tool to smooth out the edges after i cut them. It works great but I wish they were a little more durable and lasted longer.,4.0
Good quality.,4.0
would buy again,4.0
"We bought the Koolatron Kooler a year ago and find it very useful to keep food and drinks cool while traveling.

To use this effectively both the cooler and the items to be placed in it should be cool to begin with.  The empty unit will cool about 10 degrees an hour to about 40 degrees lower than the ambient temperature around it, and maintain it's pre-cooled contents at that temperature as long as it powered on.  Warm items placed in a warm cooler take much longer to cool, (the manual says up to 12 hours or longer).

We purchased the optional AC power adapter, so the night before we leave on a trip we plug the unit in and pre-cool it.  The morning we are leaving we load it with a few soda and water bottles that have been cooled in the refrigerator.  We also put in 2-4 plastic food containers that have been chilled in the refrigerator.  One or more of those we fill with ice.  The more space that is filled with cool/cold items the better the cooling process for everything else (less infiltration of warm air every time the unit is opened, less warm air to cool).

On our trip we then have cool soda and water to drink, and ice to use with the soda in a cup kept in the cup holder.  If we add a room temperature soda or bottle of water the presence of the other cool/cold items filling the rest of the unit together with the action of the unit will cool that within an hour or two.

The plastic boxes are mostly for use with ""doggie bag"" contents from restaurant meals.  Assuming an ambient temperature around the unit of 75 degrees, if the other contents were already cooled to the 35 degree temperature produced by the 40 degree cooling capacity of the unit, a room temperature container of food will be below 45-50 degrees within a couple of hours .  We usually have dinner left overs for lunch the next day, certainly within two days.

The unit fits nicely in our sedan behind the drivers seat (assuming there is no passenger in the back seat that needs that leg room) and is easily reached from the front passenger seat over the console between the bucket seats.

At night we take the unit into our motel room and plug it in with the optional AC power adapter.  The unit cannot be left plugged in to the cigarette lighter in the car for more than 4 hours or it will run the car battery down.

There is an optional battery saver adapter that will shut off the unit if it overtaxes the car battery. (Buying that is the reason I have returned to this item on Amazon a year later.) That will allow us to leave the unit plugged in when we leave the car for an indeterminant period of time that could be more than 3-4 hours.  But after 4 hours or so the unit will shut off to protect the car battery and the contents will start to warm.  So, if it is in a warm place we still can't be gone much longer than 4-5 hours if we want to keep food edible.

Finally, I keep an ordinary indoor/outdoor thermometer in the unit so that I can tell what the temperature in the unit is and am comfortable that food has not been subjected to temperatures that would make it unsafe to eat. (I think the manufacturer should build that in to the unit.)",4.0
"THIS NEEDS GOOD CIRCULATION TO WORK PROPERLY! As long as it has that it is a decent cooler. My husband uses it in his 18 wheeler and was experiencing many of the issues mentioned.  We created a very simple platform for it to sit on so it could have air circulating underneath. We took two 1x2s that came out if our dishwasher packaging, laid them on their sides as far apart as the cooler is wide and stapled a piece of leftover foam board insulationto them. We placed the cooler on that and it works much better. It is still more effective if your stuff, especially drinks, is already cool, but it does a reasonable job of cooling things down.",4.0
We bought this cooler because my wife was gong on a girls weekend and needing to store breast milk. There was not enough room in the fridge and with travel in the car.  We have only used it during that time but worked great.  We only stored breast milk in it but kept it cold and there was a few crystals in it too.  The handle does seem a little flimsy and I worry about breaking it. I would classify it as a medium-small size cooler.  For a few things it works great.,4.0
it works fine prefect for a summer trip.,4.0
Good,4.0
"Had the product about six months and have used it enough to get aquianted with it. I agree that it works great if you remember what it is, a cooler to keep items cool (or warm) not to make items cool (or warm). Do not put a warm six pack in this and expect for this to get it to an enjoyable temp in any sort of reasonable time, but take a cold six pack from the fridge and throw it in there and without using messy ice it will keep them nice and cold as long as power is applied.

It is quiet and in our minivan you can't hear it. I often have to put my hand over the fan to check if it's running. Even bringing it into the hotel room and plugging it in, you can hear it at night but its no louder than a hard drive fan and is not intrusive.

It's annoying that you have to buy an adapter but considering that this is a good sized electric cooler that is not much more than a comparable conventional cooler I'll let that one slide. Overall decent product, again, if you remember what it's designed to do.",4.0
The Koolatron P-20 worked exactly as described and did a great job for our drive from NH to FL and back.  The food stayed as cold as a refrigerator would of kept it inside our car. Of course this was during February/March.  We will see how it does on our boat this summer.  My only complaint is regarding the fan.  On the outside I quickly learned you need to watch that you don't touch the area where the fan is because the plastic grate won't protect your finger from getting hit by the fan.  The plastic grate should be replaced with more solid grate that won't bend when you put your hand on it.,4.0
Works awesome,4.0
Good price on electric cooler large enough to hold drinks and some grocery items while traveling.  Used once on 2 week trip.  Works great for our needs.  Kept drinks cold for several hours in a hot car.  Highly recommend the power adapter to use in hotel room at night to keep it cold.,4.0
Perfect size. Just make sure you give the cooling unit (inside) a little space or your food may freeze,4.0
"Took a road trip doing some 4 wheeling in the desert. If you pre-cool the cooler and the items you put in, this thing will keep them cold. We enjoyed some very decedent treats over a 2 day trip, and this item has become a must have on our future outings.",4.0
Works great. Keeps things cold and fits the car without taking up a lot of space.,4.0
"Fridge very small for the prize, you can hardly fit anything in it Other than that it is ok. Do not let it run over night when it is attached to your car. My car died. That is why I give four stars and because it is very small.  The food did stay cool, no complaints about that.",4.0
My husband uses this over the road through the week and it does a great job of keeping his drinks and lunch meat cold.,4.0
"Works fine...  From reading past reviews on this I must say, anybody purchasing this be sure to leave the vent clearly exposed for air circulation or risk fan motor overheating...",4.0
Seems to work fine.. the summer will tell :),4.0
"We bought this cooler for several long, cross country car trips we had planned with the kids. It does a good job of keeping drinks and snacks cool. Cools drinks down to about 40 degrees or so. Make sure to plug it in at least 24 hours ahead of time in your house so that it has time to cool down.

So far we have used this cooler for about 60 or 70 hours of drive time and it has worked perfectly. Today I pulled it out and found that it STOPPED WORKING!! It would heat up but the cooling fan did not turn. Boy was I furious, as we have barely used this only a couple of times. I started looking into the warranty, and then the engineer/mechanic in me said take it apart and see if it can be repaired. So that's what I did.

Using a #2 square bit, took the two screws out of the bottom and popped off the rear cover. Easily found the problem once the rear cover was removed. The power connector to the cooling fan had been jarred loose. I reconnected the connector, wrapped it in a little electrical tape so it woudnt come lose again, and now the cooler works like new again.

So in conclusion, my cooler needed a very minor repair. It's a 5 star product, but I will give it 4 stars for the hassle of fixing it. Most people would just have thrown it away or attempted a warranty repair with the manufacturer, so I am glad that I took the rear cover off to see that it was a very simple fix of just plugging the small fan connector back in.",4.0
"I'm please with this cooler. I take it with me on my truck and it keeps my food and drinks cold. However I had a problem with the cigarette plug, the tip melted and o was concerned if it was safe to use.  I contacted the company and they sent me out a replacement cord within a week.",4.0
Performed very well on two trips. The only downside is that it is a bit bulky to use in a mid-sized SUV.,4.0
not as cold as I would like but works good,4.0
Loved it!  I have celiac disease and needed a small fridge to put my food in on a 4 day road trip.  Fit perfectly in our small SUV and kept food cold even when we stopped for an hour or two and it was off with our engine.  We even bought a second for the back of our car.  Must buy the multi purpose adaptor separately.  Then you don't have to transfer out the food every time you stop for the night.,4.0
Worked great on a long road trip.  Only problem was when hotel employee accidentally turned switch to 'heat' and we didn't notice.  Pop cans exploded and cool foods cooked.  Just be careful with switch.  Size was good for two people.  Maybe larger size would work better for larger families. At least we found out the heating feature works well.  Very well.,4.0
Works well in car and on AC. Wish it didn't take so long. To cool down.,4.0
"As a cooler, it does well. Basically it's a cooler that you don't need to hassle with ice packs. And it will keep things cool as long as you have a power source. Nice for long drives.

But remember, this is a cooler -- not a refrigerator. It uses thermoelectric cooling which is very inefficient and limited in its ability to reduce temperature. You will only be able to cool about 30-40 degrees lower than ambient temperature.

If you need to keep things frozen, the Koolatron P-20 is not what you want.

For what it is, it's a nice product. It's reasonably inexpensive, solidly built, and has decent performance as long as you keep in mind the limitations of thermoelectric cooling.

One additional note - the manual and web site quote the power consumption of the P-20 at 4A / 48W.  I measured it at 4.5A / 54W.",4.0
"I love this cooler when it's working, but I am trying to replace the fan motor and it's $50 ($29 part + $21 S&H) through Koolatron. That's ridiculous! Luckily, they sell the same motor on ebay for about $21. I'm quite pleased with this Koolatron cooler, but the weakness is obviously the shotty fan motor.",4.0
"It seems to work well enough.  However, the fan does run constantly when the unit is plugged in.  That fact warms up the inside of the car if the A/C is not running.  For our particular car, it is too bulky and if on the rear seat instead of the floor, it falls over easily.",4.0
Works as advertised. I recommend starting with cold contents if possible. Remember to unplug at all stops.,4.0
"Having used this for a couple of weeks. I find it useful, but not amazing. The insulation is actually a bit thin, I am sure that is a compromise between storage volume and fitting between the seats of the van.
I put recording thermometers inside and outside the cooler to see how it handles temperatures. There is a 1 hour lag before the temperature in the cooler starts to rise after the exterior temperature starts to rise. I ran the cooler overnight in the car with nothing in the cooler. The exterior temperature dropped from 100 to 82F and the cooler (while running all the time) dropped from 78 to 48F. It maintained an interior temperature of 48F with the outside temp at 80F. So the cooler can in fact maintain an interior temperature of 28 to 32 cooler than the outside.",4.0
Bought this for our small Sprinter van motorhome.  It sits between our bucket  seats so is easy to get cold drinks out while driving.  Also works as a small table when needed.  Interrior holds two liter bottles and wine bottles.  Our regular fridge is quite small so this works as a second fridge.  Plus you can carry into a hotel room.  Be sure you get the AC adapter. I would have given it 5 stars but it doesnt get as cold just using the 12 volt,4.0
This is excellent for travel. We used on a 3 week trip both the car and room and it worked great.,4.0
It will cool about 20 degrees below the ambient temperature. It does take a long time to get there though.,4.0
It works well.  But not cold enough.,4.0
A tough little cooler. this cooler will cool to only 40 degrees cooler than the outside air. Uses about 10Watts/hr. My 1ft x 2ft solar cell was able to keep up with its demand but only in full sunlight. No moving parts (but for a small fan) and well made.,4.0
took a bit to realize how the heat vs cold works.. some things shouldn't be heated and i learned quickly i had originally plugged the chord in upside down which caused the heat on instead of cool. keeps things cool so far so i can keep drinks and snacks in the car when it's warm out. also put my fridge worthy groceries in it when i don't go home right after getting groceries.,4.0
The kooler is perfect size for setting between my bucket seats in the second row of my GMC Acadia.  My son forgot to disconnect it when they were done with the car for the day and the next morning the car battery was dead.  Not a fun thing to have happen on vacation.....So we have had to learn to either bring it in for the night or unplug it.  Strongly recommend you purchase the Koolatron Multi-purpose adapter so you can bring it in at night.,4.0
"We took a 3 week road trip & this cooler worked great. We bought an adapter so we could take it up to our room at night & plug it in. It kept everything nice & cool for the next day. It didn't quite fit behind our seats (Ford Explorer) on the floor, but it did just fine sitting right on the back seat. My only changes to it would be...change the direction the cooler opens, it was difficult to reach in when its plugged in & the door opens from behind. For its size I wished it had a little more room (width wise), but then it wouldn't be classified as being able to fit behind some car seats.
We had it on warm only once & that was when we were checking it out before we left. It takes a little longer to cool than it does to warm. We liked how you only had to plug 1 cord in one way for cool & turn it over & plug it in for warm (very clever).",4.0
"When we got this, it worked very well when traveling.
Afterwards when we back, I set it up next to our bed For my wife to usefor her snacks & drinks(she is bedridden) where we ran it constantly. It needed defrosting from time to time, but otherwise ran flawlessly for about 8 months before the cooling element died.
I am disappointed that it died, but also realize that it wasn't designed for constant use, so I don't have any real complaint.",4.0
It has worked liked I had hoped. It keeps the items very cold. I haven't tried it with the AC power cord yet but don't expect any problems.,4.0
"Fits perfectly in our Odyssey, between the middle row seats.",4.0

"I used it on a vacation and it worked well.  I have not used it for heating items, yet.",4.0
"Works great, especially to keep everything cold when travelling. Will get things cold if filled the night before a trip. Fits in my pickup behind the front seat conveniently. Runs very quiet, but the fan never turns off if the unit is plugged in.",4.0
"A storage compartment for excess wires and power converter would have been a good improvement to the cooler. A switch for hot and cold setting would be more helpful and reliable. instead of the ""reverse plug method"" other than that the product worked great. it kept my perishables from perishing.",4.0
You do have to cool it and the things you are putting in it otherwise it takes a while for them to cool. I purchased the power cord to go with it so that I could plug it in at night when I was in the hotel.,4.0
"I received a factory second instead of the new product that was advertised

Update:  I received a replacement unit from Amazon and the new unit is ""NEW"" and works perfectly on both hot and cold cycles.  Looking forward to using it on an upcoming trip.  Gave four stars because of the initial ""factory second"" shipment.",4.0
"This is a great cooler, make sure you buy the A/C adapter to plug into your hotel room when overnighting. Read the instructions and make sure you have the Blue arrow plugged in correctly. I freeze several small water bottles and use as coolant. Not rated 5 because the inside fan is about 3/4 up cooler, so be careful not to let water level get into fan. The cord is plenty long, but somewhat flimsy. I have a Jeep Grand Cherokee and plug into adapter by tailgate but cooler is between seats. Kooler only runs when car or AC is on.",4.0
"I used this in the back of my Highlander (there is an ""outlet"" close to the back hatch.  I did not hear the fan.  The items were not super cold, but it worked fine.  It holds quite a bit of food. Be sure you have the plug in correct... otherwise you'll have heat instead of cool.",4.0
"I like the cooler/heater very much.  Wish it cooled a little faster.  Also, disappointed that according to directions keeping the warmer function should only be kept on warm for an hour or less.",4.0
"Works okay but the power cord is having to be replaced after one year of use. Not as much storage space as I thought, but that could be an error on my part.",4.0
"We have used our Koolatron on trips across the country twice as well as for carting perishables from home to a week's vacation at the beach. We have even used it for an occasional party at home.  It is easy to carry in and out of our hotel rooms so we can keep things cold if there is no fridge available overnight.
We have always used it on COLD, never intentionally on HOT. We did once, however, lose the contents of the Koolatron when we accidentally plugged it for HOT and wanted COLD.  This is one complaint we have: it is pretty easy to make this mistake but one is not likely to do it twice unless, like some men in my family, one is color-blind.
The other problem is one that started about a year  or more after we bought it. There is a loose wire somewhere, either in the Koolatron or in the multipurpose adapter cord since the cord needs to be positioned exactly right for the Koolatron to work.  It is easy to move the cord out-of-position in a traveling car full of luggage, bags, etc.  One has to listen carefully to try to hear the (quiet) motor, or feel the slight exhaust ""breeze""  to be sure it is on.  Avoiding those 2 problems make it a helpful tool for comfortable traveling, especially for anyone with special dietary needs.",4.0
First one quit after 2-3 weeks but replacement has been great. Would definitely recommend Koolatron products. Wish I would have purchased a larger size.,4.0
"took a month long trip and this cooler did a great job of keeping things cool. Sometimes a little too cool. When we got to the northern climate and the nights were cool this did freeze my water bottles and milk. learned not to leave it hooked up overnight in the van.
It did deplete my battery during one overnight stay and had to get a jump the next morning. I will get the ac adapter but I think it is a little overpriced. after all it is just a converter from ac to dc. overall it is a good product and I would recommend it for travel use anytime.",4.0
"My husband and I bought the Koolatron for a recent 12 day road trip. The capacity was ok. Mostly for drinks, but don't try and put much else in there. The cooler kept things cool not cold. I am happy with the purchase for future adventures, but still had to bring a traditional cooler to keep cold items cold in.",4.0
"On the advice of a friend, we purchased this cooler for a long car trip. After reading the reviews, I made certain that I pre-chilled the cooler for 24 hours as well as the food. After 13 hours in the car (plugged in, of course), the food was still cold even though we opened the cooler a number of times and stopped occasionally. My one complaint is the need to purchase the AC adapter separately since the cooler works best if chilled prior to use.",4.0
"I bought this for a trip in the Southwest USA that would last for 15 days during the summer. Admittedly, it was in a car with air conditioning, but it performed well throughout the trip. My wife drove from Santa Barbara to New Orleans via Tucson,  El Paso, San Antonio, and Houston and we drove back via Dallas, Albuquerque, the Grand Canyon, and Bakersfield and it performed well throughout. Keep in mind we brought it into our hotel room each night and kept it plugged in, and then plugged it into our car as we were driving. Your mileage may vary depending on how long you can keep electricity going to it. This meant that the AC adapter was absolutely essential, so we could keep it going in our hotel rooms. However, in doing this, we even found ice chips in it at one point, so if you keep it going it can definitely keep things cold. We had cold water to drink all the way across the desert and back and never bought a single bit of ice. We also at most of our lunches from it as well. For me, that's a total win. But be sure to get the AC adapter, as that is essential.",4.0
It's narrow shape makes this unit better for fitting behind the front seats. Fold down handle is well designed for travel.,4.0
"It fits well in the vehicle, provides nice space for beverages, and kept things cool for our trip (9 hours).  We did pay attention to other reviews and made sure to unplug it whenever we turned the car off to ensure we didn't drain the battery.  My husband did accidentally ""heat"" the cooler before one trip so I suppose if I had any recommendation, it would be to make it clearer that you have to pay attention to which direction you plug the cord in (red on top = heating; blue on top = chilling).

UPDATE May 2016: The cooler died on us after 3 years. Not bad considering the affordable price. We are looking for another one and are considering just reordering one of these considering the convenient size.",4.0
"I purchased this cooler to store my young daughter's insulin when it is hot outside and we are at soccer practice or wherever. She has type 1 diabetes and insulin breaks down (goes bad)  over 90 degrees although i've had it spoil in the mid to high 80's. We live in Southeast Texas so it gets very hot.  I've now actually used it for other things as well and, so far, have been pleasantly surprised.

Size:  I initially was just looking for a small one to store medicine, but I couldn't really find a size I liked so for the price I purchased this one. I'm glad I got the bigger size.  We have a weekend place about an hour away. If I bring food back/forth, I usually do a small cooler. This weekend I used this cooler instead. It was perfect. I was surprised to fit 1 gallon of milk, a jug of OJ, a package of steaks, a regular sized sour cream, 2 bags of grated cheese and a can of biscuits (plus 2 vials of insulin). The cooler fits nicely in several places in my Tahoe: behind driver or front passenger seats, in between 2nd row captains chairs, between 2nd row captain chair and 3rd row seat or that tiny space between 3rd row seat and rear door/hatch. It is still easy to carry when full and has a nice handle that folds down flat.

Function:  Example 1: 2 hour soccer practice with outside temp of high 80's. I plugged in the cooler and put in her insulin and a bottle of water (pre refrigerated about 15 min earlier).  Turned off the truck. After practice I was amazed at how cool it was inside the cooler. My daughter was happy to have a cold bottle of water and I was happy to have no worries about her insulin temp.  Example 2:  trip to 2nd house with 1 hour stop. Outside temp was only mid 70's but it was very sunny so inside my black Tahoe I'd guess it was at least 80.  Had the food described above, no ice.  Arrived at house about 2 1/2 hours later. Then I forgot to take the cooler inside before I spent over 2 hours talking to neighbors. Husband moved cooler to house porch, now unplugged, and it sat there for another 15-20 minutes. I thought for sure my meat would be warm but when we took it all out it was as cold as it was when I out it in there.

It is now so nice to not have to remember to grab ice and cooler on hot days out with my daughter or have my food get watered down with melted ice when traveling.

Other comments:
- I have not measured the temp yet but plan to buy a thermometer to keep inside for reference.
- as another reviewer has mentioned, the grill covering the fan does bend in easily and stops the fan. I make sure when packing a truck load that nothing is pressing against the fan grill.
-  I've not tried the warm function. There is no hot/cold switch. Hot/cold is determined by how the plug I'd inserted. Plug has blue dot and red dot which you line up with an arrow when attaching the plug. I'm a little worried I'll not pay attention and insert it for hot when plugging in. I store the power cord inside the cooler when not in use.
- I've never had it running with my truck off for more than about 2 hours. Have not had an issue with my truck battery.

Shore up the fan cover and provide a built in thermometer (I'll pay more) for 5 stars.",4.0

"The Koolatron works very well. It cools drinks as expected and works quietly. My only complaint, thus far, is that I wish the product had an on/off switch. As it stands, it's either plugged in and working...or not. In order to change from cooling to heating, the plug must be reversed. Its a bit inconvenient to have to reach to the back seat to unplug it or change it from cool to heat or vice versa. A relatively simple addition of a switch would make the product nearly perfect.",4.0

"We took this cooler on our 17 day road trip.  It plugged into the back outlet on our van and easily fit between the seats.  Because we were skeptical, we put a indoor/outdoor thermostat in it to make sure it worked consistently.  The temp directly under the lid was warmer than the rest of the cooler so we learned to stack the things that need to keep the coolest on the bottom and things like water bottles near the top. We tried to open the cooler as little as possible while driving to maximize the efficiency. Because our van outlets do not run when the engine is off, we would ice the cooler on the days it would have to sit a few hours (we packed ziploc bags and used hotel ice).  We were able to pack lunch meat, cheese, jelly and other lunch goods for the whole trip without any concerns.  We also purchased the adapter so we could plug the cooler into a regular outlet in the hotel room (in case there wasn't a frig or to cool it down before we headed out on the road.  Since many of our road trip restaurant meals cost $80-$100, this cooler paid for itself by enabling us to brown bag many lunches while on the road.  Our only issue was not realizing how easy it was to accidentally plug in the cord the wrong way and heat instead of cool.  This happened twice on our trip, but we caught it before anything was ruined.  The cord has a blue dot and a red dot on either side of the plug, but both were nearly rubbed off by the time we got home.  There is a raised letter on each side as well.  That's just not as easy to see.  Even still, we are glad we bought this cooler and will definitely get much use out of it.",4.0
"This item worked well for a cross country trip. With the additional adapter ( sold seperately) I was able to take the cooler into the hotel room and plug it in for continued use.

Great for sandwich making stuff, sodas, and the all important beer after a long day on the road.",4.0
"Although the one I received was greatly reduced in price because it was an ""open box"" item, it worked fine, but it didn't come with any instructions or manual, and the cooling thingy (I don't know what it's called) seems a little loose. We took it with us on a five week road trip, used it in the car and in hotel rooms (with AC adapter), and kept a thermometer in it to check the temp. It stayed between 30-40 degrees. It fit nicely behind the passenger seat in our Camry, but would also fit nicely between the front seats of a minivan.",4.0
This is my second Koolatron cooler. I purchased this one for its smaller size. Have been on two trips where unit has run for several days. Works great and keeps items cool. It is very portable.,4.0
"The only downside to this cooler, that is perfect for travel, is the exorbitant price increase recently.  Up until a month ago, the 110volt adaptor was included in Amazon's price of $110.00  Surely it couldn't have gone up 30% overnight.  Shame on you.",4.0
This is a very nice product but still would like to see a few more functional improvments.  The unit works very well and seems to do what the product says it can do.  Worked great for a two week road trip and was used every day without a problem.  With that said I can see a few areas that this product could be improved.  First is the electrical cable and storage.  The plug to adjust the hot / cold setting does not work well for the cable to be used on the storage area.  It is just a bit too long and does not allow you to wrap the cord on the storage area and keep things nice and neat.  The Fan area is a very thin plastic and if the unit is pushed against anything the plastic cover runs into the fan and makes a bad noise.  This to me is a weakness that should be fixed.  It is a nice device and worked great for the entire two week road trip.,4.0
"I purchased the Koolatron 18 Quart in the interest of hauling food with me on trips.  I have found that this little rig works like a charm, keeping everything very cool.  It is relatively quiet, too.  The 18 quart version is rather modest sized, i.e., you can't keep a weeks worth of groceries in it, but large enough to store the things I need for a couple of days at a time.

My one complaint, as stated in another review, the A/C adaptor is not included.  If one leaves the cooler running off the car battery all night, the battery is dead in the morning.  Thus, one must plug it into an A/C outlet overnight.  So know that you will need to spend another $35 on an A/C adaptor to have a complete system that works well.",4.0
"Item arrived in good time. Planning 3000 mi. trip. Will be put to the test. Have used it as recommended in instructions and worked fine. Fan very quiet, nice fit behind seat, filled with 24 cans of pop that had been refriged and they stayed cold after 2hr. drive, and still cold in morning after sitting overnight with power off. I give this cooler a A+ on function, have not tried the heat mode yet, maybe next winter.",4.0
"I have used this on two trips, one 800 miles and one over 3000.  I pre-cooled it overnight and filled it with cold items such as a half-gallon of milk, vegies, yoghurt, etc.  I like the way the fan is protected from being crowded and thus overheating.  It had ample room for our needs.  It is easy to carry, and to plug in in the vehicle and in motel rooms.  For the latter I purchased the Wagan AC Power Adapter&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagan-5-Amp-AC-to-12V-DC-Power-Adapter/dp/B000P7O5DG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagan 5 Amp AC to 12V DC Power Adapter</a>.  This does get uncomfortably hot---tho not dangerously so---so I restricted it's use to the bathroom where I could put it on tile instead of carpet.  Excess moisture did not accumulate on contents.  Another nice feature is the clever way the cord wraps up so it doesn't catch on things like doorknobs.  BEST OF ALL ---we were not schlubbing ice in, nor sloshing water around, nor emptying the cooler daily so it could be refilled, and everything maintained temperature nicely.  I've since purchased another as a gift.  Change I would make?  Product is not noisy but I wish it were quieter still.",4.0
Fits right behind back seat of vehicle while still allowing the person up front to have a fair amount of legroom. The previous cooler I had like this was too wide and smashed the front passenger. Keeps cold foods cold and hot foods hot. Can't really ask for more than that.,4.0
"My husband and I are over-the-road truck drivers. We keep this cooler in the top bunk which is the hottest part of the truck yet it still does a great job of keeping things cool. The size is perfect for 1/2 gallon cartons or cans of pop stacked two high. My only gripe is a design flaw which does not protect the fan. There is no reinforcement around the fan (such as styrofoam as in our other cooler) so if something happens to fall against the fan side of the unit, the fan is prevented from spinning thus burning up the motor. Even holding onto on the fan side in order to move the cooler is enough to stop the fan from turning. Other than that, we are very happy with it.",4.0
"I use this for keeping my coffee warm while on the road. I will usually get 3 large containers and keep 2 in the cooler using the heat to keep them hot.

I noticed that the containers are wet along with the holders I put inside to hold the containers in place.  Not sure why it does this but it does keep the coffee hot for several hours even if you unplug it after a half hour.

Other than the moister it works like I wanted.",4.0
"Before a recent road trip we decided to invest in a portable fridge/cooler, which we could use to help us save money on buying milk and other items for our 2 year old. After researching a number of coolers I decided to go with the Koolatron Compact Cooler based on the other reviews.

Before embarking on our trip, I pre-cooled the cooler as instructed in the owner's manual. One thing to keep in mind is that the cooler does NOT come with an adapter, which will allow you to cool the unit outside of a vehicle. I purchased the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/5-Amp-AC-to-12V-DC-Power-Adapter/dp/B000P7O5DG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">5 Amp AC to 12V DC Power Adapter</a>&nbsp;and had great success pre-cooling the cooler. The adapter never got really hot even after over 12 hours of being plugged in.

I filled the cooler to the max and plugged it in our car. Our road trip lasted over 12 hours and all the items in the cooler remained icy cold. On the trip back home the cooler was empty, so I didn't pre-cool the cooler. However, after making a few stops I had a few items to put in the cooler. After having the cooler plugged in the car for a few hours, without pre-cooling, I felt that the items kept cool enough and eventually became icy cold.

The bottom line here is that you probably want to pre-cool the cooler ahead of time, but if you have something already cold you can get away without having to pre-cool. If you are throwing in some items like cans of soda, which are room temperature you definitely want to pre-cool.

I only had two minor issues with the cooler, which prevented me from awarding it with 5 stars.

1. As previously mentioned, the cooler does not come with an adapter (AC), which will allow you to power the unit outside of a vehicle. The owner's manual specifically mentions that you should pre-cool the unit, but if you were to buy the cooler before reading reviews you would not know this bit of information ahead of time. I think Koolatron would be better off increasing the price of the cooler and including the adapter, since most people are going to need to buy this accessory.

2. The fridge is somewhat noisy or at least the fan is anyway. When you are riding in a car the sound is somewhat negligible, but if you are staying in a hotel overnight the sound of the fan spinning may keep you up. I was able to get around this by plugging in the fridge inside the bathroom and closing the door, which muffled the noise to the point where it was not noticeable.

Despite the two minor issues I mentioned, I am very happy with the purchase and I would make the same decision if I had to do it all over again.",4.0
"I fly several times a year to do cooking demos for aquaculture associations.  This cooler fits exactly under the airplane seats so the flight attendants don't fuss.  Even when full of fish, it's easy enough to handle by attaching to my rollaround suitcase in the airport. For several years I used an Igloo brand, which has since been discontinued.  I'm happy with the Koolatron brand so far. Adaptor is a must when travelling, for the car and hotel room.  As everyone here has stated, cold food/drink to start with really helps.",4.0
"We bought it to use on our sailboat so that we did not have to open the Ice Chest on Hot Days to remove luncheon meat  or a drink. We use it with the AC/DC converter so that we use it mostly in port. (Don't like to use batteries when under sail.)

My wife feels that it works fine providing you cool it down well before using it.",4.0
"Fit perfectly behind the front seat of our Cadillac. Cooler did an excellent job of working for our 3 week vacation.  Our only disappointment was the directions not specifying that the blue and red dots on the plugs lining up with the arrow decides whether the cooler runs cold or hot. Also, make sure your food is already hot or cold, and the cooler has been running for at least 30 minutes, before placing in cooler.",4.0
"This combination cooler/heater is just what I was looking for!  Actually, I'll probably never use it as a cooler.  Moderately filled, it can heat things up to 150F (measured) in a few short hours.

The only thing keeping me from giving it a full five stars are a few design and manufacturing issues.  I don't really care for the pigtail power receptacle dangling from the unit.  A built-in port would've been nicer, but I can live with it.  Overall plastic forming and construction is good, but there was excessive adhesive that had oozed out from the heatsink area.  These issues don't mean this thing won't do its job.  But it's possibly something the QC person should take a look at to bring this product to the next level.

Regardless, I'm happy with it.  So far it's holding up to a fair amount of abuse (including being checked in with with luggage for cross country flights).  Would I order another if I needed one?  Definitely yes.",4.0
"I keep this in the trunk of my car all the time.  We have the large size of this cooler and use it on trips -- no messy ice to deal with.  We live in a small town so when we go for ""big"" grocery shopping trips it's a 45 minute drive and I usually stop at 2 or 3 places.  This little cooler keeps my cool stuff cool while I'm rinning around without taking up the whole trunk.",4.0
"We purchased this unit for a road trip from Oregon to S. Calif. We wanted to be able to buy sandwiches, snacks and bottled water in the morning and eat on the road, or keep things cold overnight.  This fridge worked great, we used it every day of our three week trip, and could take it into the hotel to keep our bottled water and snacks cold at night.  We also purchased the additional AC power cord.  The unit is small, lightweight, and the noise is minimal for a fridge. The only down side is that it doesn't cycle on and off like a regular fridge so things at the bottom and toward the compresser would freeze overnight. We just put the water there, no problem.  Would highly recommend this unit! We have used it several times since the purchase.",4.0
"Product seems well made and arrived in good order. The only thing that I have found bad about it is the fan makes some pretty loud noise. I think it may bother me when I have it in a motel room (I also bought the AC adapter).
I have some experience with this type cooler and the others I have used did not have as loud of fan.
On the plus side: It fits where I wanted it behind my drivers seat, so my front seat passenger can reach back and open it easily. Quality feel to it and it is not too heavy.
The instructions say only use in heat mode 'up to 45 minutes' if that makes a difference to anyone.",4.0
"There's an outside fan and an inside condenser fan.  The inner fan is like a squeeky wheel that can get on your nerves.  I think there may be a problem with mine as I can't imagine that it should make that much noise.  Other than that, it works great and is very portable.",4.0
"I ordered, as a package, both the P20 Cooler, along with the Koolatron Muti-Purpose Adapter 110VAC to 12VDC, March 10, 1907 I checked to see both item were in stock, both were.

The Cooler arrived promptly on March 16, 2007. However, the 110VAC Adapter was back-ordered. With the Adapter on back-order, there was no way to check the Cooler's function. There was no way to pre-cool the unit, since the recommended time was about 12 hours, and it is not to be powered by vehicle battery for longer than 4 hours without the engine running. Furthermore there was no way to keep the contents cool at night while in the motel room, unless one wanted to let the engine run all night. So for the first 2 months the Cooler was useless!

The Adapter finally arrived on May 10, 2007, a full two months after the original order was placed. (This slow delivery is the reason for the 4-stars.) With the Adapter it was finally possible to test out the unit.

The unit was completely empty, outside air temp. was about 80 degrees. I was impressed by the cool-down time; a little over an hour to reach 40 degrees. Certainly the unit was not pre-cooled enough to fill with food, but the fact that it reached 40 degrees so quickly was encouraging. The adapter is somewhat cumbersome, but is easy enough to use and connect.

I have used the unit on several trips and have found it quite adequate, provided items are cold when they are introduced to it. Warm items take forever to cool down; twelve hours is not usually long enough. While the product may be cool-er it certainly is not cold. Extra frozen ice packs and/or freezer containers filled with frozen water help a great deal. They add extra cold air to the inside of the unit while frozen. Even thawed, they are still maintained at about 40 degrees. They fill up empty space within the unit, a REAL Killer: Each time the unit opens any empty space fills with warm air. This unit, being a top-loader, is a little better than others that are front-loaders. Since cold air tends to sink, more cold air stays in the unit when opened. Front-loaders spill ALL their cold air as soon as the door opens.

The unit is well constructed, and seems to perform quite well within its design capabilities. A few things to remember:
  1. The unit is a COLD PRESERVER, NOT a REFRIGERATOR. Put it in cold it will come out warmer but still cold. Put in warm? Well, let's hope it is canned when you put it in.
  2. The unit is a small heat-pump, (removing heat from the air to cool the inside of the unit) and it will do just that no matter what the outside air temp. is. This unit cools to 40 degree below the outside air temp. and if it is 32 degrees outside, it will cool to 40 degree BELOW that.
There is no thermostatic control, while it is plugged in, it is cooling.
The unit is insulated, but not real well, so it does no better job keeping cold out, than it does keeping it in. Water still freezes at 32 degrees, F. Transporting the filled unit in a trunk or other unheated space, in cold weather, is not the best idea. If you do, a least unplug it! If you are transporting medication which must be refrigerated, but not frozen, keep the unit in a heated area, so the unit can cool properly.
  3. A small indoor/outdoor thermometer is a great idea. They are reasonable in price. They allow you to monitor both inside and outside temp. without opening the lid. Small units can be mounted outside on the top or side with double-stick tape, with the outdoor sensor inside. Ideally this would have been installed by the manufacturer, but it is a simple fix.",4.0
used it on my 04 Altima with a kenwood stereo. Perfect fit and looks awsome!

"I bought this becasue my Ford constantly pops it's Check Engine light. Considering the visit to the dealer is around 3/4 of a bill each time, I figured this would equal two trips to the dealer.
It does a nice job of reading the codes and resetting. It also does a nice job of monitoring the sensors. What it will not tell you is exactly how to fix your problem in many cases. I am an ex-service manager (from the pre-techno era) and reasonably accomplished mechanic. Even I have to do research after collecting the code. Determine WHY you have a particular sensor reading. Different things can trip the same sensor.
This is a well built tool to help you in your diagnosis. It is not the automatic answer machine some people may assume it to be.
I think this tool should sell for under a bill. That detracts one star.",4.0

"I purchased this Acton scanner 2 years ago when our older vehicle was repeatedly showing its MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp). I was able to clear the code immediately. When the MIL illuminated again later, I was able to track down the problem (O2 sensor heater trouble)and correct it by reseating the connector. Later, I used the scanner to diagnose which cylinder was misfiring. By tapping on that cylinder's fuel injector, I was able to correct the misfiring. Again, the Acton cleared the MIL display.
My mechanic uses a more sophisticated (and much more expensive) OBD scanner in his day to day work, but for someone who does occasional maintenance on his own car, this tool is worth the $89 investment. If you paid more, you paid too much.",4.0

"I would have given this five stars, but mine was dead on arrival (DOA).  Operating these devices is very simple.  You just plug it into the OBDII receptacle under your dash and it should instantly display the opening menu.  Mine did not, so rather than return it, I removed the four assembly screws and opened it up.  I was looking for a cold solder or disconnected wire.  What I found was that the processor chip was simply not seated in its socket.  I gently pressed it in and closed the case.  Problem solved.

This unit is a good value overall.  Of all the code readers to choose from, this one has the ideal features for a home user and it is hard to beat for around $65.  Don't let the fact that mine was DOA deter you.  These things are very simple devices, and an unseated component is one of the more common causes for this sort of out-of-the-box failure for any electronic device.

"Bought the reader a month ago, use it regularly as I'm still fighting trouble codes on my 2000 VW

"I use my 98 Honda accord very lightly to drive to the train station five days a week.  Two years before I spent $1200 to take care of check engine light problem and passed the inspection only to get the check engine light back in few days.  For this year inspection the repair shop adviced to spend another $1000 to take care of the problem.  With this product I reset all the codes, confirmed the light is coming back after about 25 miles of drive by testing twice.  So I reset the codes, drive to the inspection station which is about 10 miles and passed the inspection.  My repair shop told me the ODB systems were not matured till 2000 and the cars from 96 - 99 probably have lot of false alarms.  In my case the car is old and have 150000 miles it has a blue book value of $3500. I don't want to spend thousands of dollars every two years on a car that don't have that much value.

If you need just a basic scanner, this is it.  I think the only difference to the next model up, is the next model is battery powered to keep the code onscreen when it is unplugged from the OBD connector.

"Overall I like the Actron CP9135. Easy to use, fast access to the codes that your car is producing, and let's you know if you're ready for the emissions test. Of course now that I have it, I'm sorta wishing I had a model that allowed the next level of diagnostics - either allowing real time monitoring (CP9145) of the conditions or a snap shot (CP9175) capability which provide more background for diagnosing the problem. I guess it's all detective work - and the code itself is part of the puzzle - but more information is better. Still - for the money the Actron CP9135 does a nice job of getting to the codes, and erasing them if need be. So for basic capabilities - this is a good unit. For more advanced diagnostics, take a look at some of the higher end units.",4.0

However, auto shops don't make much money on deleting codes so they had to change parts unnecessarily.

He doesn't know that you already know what the problem is! His diagnosis should be at the very least related to or exactly what the scanner is telling you. Iv'e read the average cost of a scan when you bring your car in is around sixty dollars, so it will pay for itself in less than three uses!

"If you buy this charger, I suggest immediately investing a coulple of bucks on some decent quality metal clamps to replace the flimsy plastic ones.  Other than that one weak spot, the unit is brilliant.  With the desulfating function, I have brought several starter batteries back from the brink after months of sitting undercharged.  The charger is a little quick to throw a fault code if the battery is very weak, but a few tries at the lowest setting, with a desulfate cycle thrown in between them usually does the trick.  Of course, overly discharging a lead acid battery is highly destructive to the battery anyway, but this charger is the closest thing you will find out there to a miracle cure.  It is also very well suited to maintaining a perfect charge on banks of RV batteries during winter storage.  It comes on and tops off the batteries only when it detects the need, so there is no danger of overcharging and boiling off electrolite.",4.0
"Compared to earlier generation chargers that used transformers, there is no comparison.  Switching power supplies are vastly lighter, cheaper and more powerful.  They are what you want.

The main downside of this charger is slightly cheap parts, the noise of the fan, and sometimes being ""too smart"" for its own good.  For example a totally discharged battery will not charge on it, you have to give it a boost with an old charger so that it generates enough voltage for the Vector to accept that it's there.",4.0

As advertised,4.0
"Pros:
- This rubbing compound does a great job working through tough oxidized paint
- The tub gives you a lot of product, easily enough for 4 - 6 complete car jobs
- Works great with hand application and rotary buffer

Cons:
- If you let any compound dry on any car panels or glass for too long, it takes a lot of elbow grease to remove. Because the polish is red, it leaves very noticeable splatter
- Compound is a paste, so it does dry much faster than its liquid equivalents

Overall, this product is a great value. You can't beat the price and it does its job well so long as you cover up any parts of the car you aren't working on and you are quick to clean up after any splatter as it happens. It's also important to know that this rubbing compound will not give you a mirror finish. It's made gritty enough to help remove oxidation, deeper clear coat scratches, and overspray. You should be sure to follow this up with a finer polishing compound in order to restore your car paint back to factory condition.",4.0

Since the cassette player is broken in my pickup I thought I'd buy this instead of a new radio so that I could play my ipod in the truck.  The volume is a little lower over the radio than I would like but other than that it has worked great for the last month.,4.0
"This is a good product but a little on the flimsy side. The button to switch voltage moves easily and you can accidentally move it while in operation and potentially damage whatever electronic device you're using it for. It does come with a nice selection of interface plugs and variations of voltage settings. If it stops working, unscrew the plug-in section to reveal the fuse. You can change the fuse if it blows and it will work again.",4.0

I made a fishing friend a super minnow keeper with one of these. He lamented replacing D-Cell batteries in his aerator to keep minnows fresh on his pontoon boat.

"I like the multiple selection of adapters. There are no worries while traveling using rental vehicle.

I purchased this item for a DVD Player for my car.  It was advertised to have various tips so it would fit most any component and also had voltage settings.  Some of the reviews talk about blowing fuses and would not work.  Well the reason for the problems is the tip has to be installed properly.  If it is installed backward it creates a direct ground. That blows a fuse.  The center pin has to be positive and the outside has to be negative.  It is not marked so I used a volt meter to assure which was which.  It works great.,4.0

"I bought this item to use with the installation of a trunk release solenoid. The wiring diagram that is provided with this item for a trunk release is different than what the wiring in the keyless entry system showed. I went with the latter and the solenoid works fine.

"I installed the bulldog remote starter RS82 on my sons 1993 Toyota Corolla. There was not a T-harness available so I had to install it the long way. The wiring schemes on bulldog's site were pretty accurate and very helpful. The video was ok but was very basic, I think they could spend more time on parts of it to make it more understandable for the newbie like me. It took about 7 hours to install it on this car, taking into consideration I only set it up with the starter and did not have to hook up a bypass or door locks it seemed to be a long drawn out process. I could do it faster now that I know what I'm doing though.
A concern I had is that when you call the 'free' technical help line you do not really get any help so if you are taking on this project, just know you are on your own and will not get help. After it was all done I had accidently broken the hood pin switch so I sent Bulldog sales an email to order the part AND pay for it, I still have not gotten a reply so I tried calling and got another voicemail.
Summary, the product works as it should (will find out if there are long term effects or not) and I'm happy with it thus far. NO tech support available which means work on this at your own risk level. I'm a pretty handy guy and will take on most anything, but going forward I will most likely hire to have this done - they earn every penny!",4.0
I bought this to replace another brand that never worked. I found it to be not that hard to install compaired to the other one (DEI-BOA). As a basic start/stop the car unit it seems to work fine.,4.0
"I got one of these units for Christmas ended up having to order the security bypass unit in order to get around the transponder key security.  I also purchased the T-Harness for my car (highly recommended).

I like that you can install none, some, or all of the optional features to make the installation much easier.  I initially just installed the basic remote starter using the T-Harness, and then there are just a couple of additional connections (ground, and brake switch) that need to be connected.
AFter about a week or so, I decided to install the parking light confirmation which just involved locating the right wire, and connecting one of the wires from the unit to it.

I am not a mechanic, and I just started doing a few things on my own with my vehicle.  This took me about 5 hours to install start to finish (including removing and re-installing dash/trim panels), but someone with more experience with these types of installations could probably do it much faster.
I find the range to be okay -- enough to start it in the driveway or perhaps from a store if I'm in a close parking space.",4.0
"I am not a mechanic or an electrician, but I am knowledgable in both subjects. I installed two of these units myself and they work great. They are VERY difficult to install yourself. Most cars require you buy additional security bypass units, so call the manufacturer and make sure you have all the parts before you start the project.",4.0
I only works at close range.,4.0
Has worked great for me up until a month ago I installed it on a 97 Chevy Silverado for some reason I started having issues with it not wanting to start I'm sure it may be a fuse but have not had time to look at it other than that I would recommend it. I do like that it only runs for 15 minutes then shuts off. Because I have caught myself accidentally starting it with bending around with the remote in my pocket.,4.0
"Installed within 4 hours. Used the diagram they had on the website. Went smoothly.
The only issue I had, was the range. As most people say. I had about 10 feet.

First thing is remove the crap battery they give you, and grab a fresh one. Second, extend the short antenna wire they have, and bring it up around the windshield.

This extended the range greatly, not sure how far, but I can start it about 200 feet away, through multiple concrete walls.

For under 40 dollars, it's well worth it. But it probably won't start your car, while your inside a store waiting in line.",4.0
"Wasn't too complicated to install in my vehicle.
The box says you can start your car from 400 ft away but the antenna range is very poor (its possible I don't have it in a good spot), I have to stand at about a 20ft radius around my car to be able to start it.",4.0
"I have a 03 Wrangler and the install was not bad at all.. I did have a question about the wiring and I called the 800 number, got somebody right away and he was actually helpful. Like other have said the distance isn't great - about 7 parking spots away - but I saw somebody said that if you extend the antenna wire it works better.. I'm going to try that... Overall, I'd buy again.",4.0

Good product. My last one lasted about a year before it went all screwy. It seems this version has the starter issue fixed. Worth the money and time in my opinion,4.0
"Basic remote starter. No bells and whistles, but it does what it's supposed to. The Bulldog website gives you the information you need to install it. The only downside is the wire length... Too short for me to mount the module where I wanted to. Range is more than adequate and the starter doesn't over crank. I would buy it again.",4.0
"This was a piece of cake to install! Took about an hour due to a hard-to-reach connection.  Worked the first time, if your familiar with wiring and electrical its a breeze! Just be sure you have all the correct relays if your vehicle requires them!  If you have no idea about wiring and electrical it's still pretty easy.  The DVD and instructions are more than enough information on how to instal.  I don't know why others said it was hard, its not hard at all! Installed on a '00 F250.",4.0
I installed to the units and they both worked just fine just pay attention to the instructions and you should have no problems if you are mechanically inclinedI am buying one now for my new car and the tech support is very knowledgeable but pay attention to the hours of operation so you don't get stuck in a bind on times when they're closed,4.0
"I performed this installation in my 2004 Jeep TJ in 4 hours start to finish. This included online research at bulldogsecurities.com for the vehicle specific wiring colors. My jeep was a bit easier than some cars and trucks since it doesn't have power or remote door locks or a security system. All I wanted was a remote start system (that's why I chose the simplest remote starter Bulldog offers). The installation manual is a bit overwritten leaning to a beginner but the kit is complete with everything you will need except for a screwdriver and a roll of double face tape to mount the box. It even includes a razor knife and a test light (I never used either one). It worked as advertised and was easy to program. I recommend anyone interested in buying one of these to visit the manufactures website and view the installation video and vehicle specific info prior. This is not an installation for everyone, and the video will allow you to decide if you want to tackle this yourself or have a professional install it for you.
As a side note I also installed one of these in my wife's Korean Spec Hyundai Samtamo (built under licence Mitsubishi Expo. It was also easy to install and I had it in and working in about 4 hours also. I found after installing both of them that by doubling the length of wire supplied on the antenna the range of the remote starter in increased substantively.
Also.. If you ever discontent the battery form you vehicle, make sure you start it with the remote starter key fob soon after reconnecting the battery. I have found with two RS-82 whichever fob is pressed first after reconnecting the battery is the fob that is now the one that controls the remote start.",4.0
"First off, I'm no shill for Bulldog nor do I work for them. I am not a professional auto mechanic but I am very technically inclined and handy and have installed 11 Bulldog remote start systems for friends and family over the past 8 years. I have installed 3 RS82 systems. First of all, if you have little to no mechanical aptitude and don't understand basic wiring or automotive electrical and security systems then please do not try to install this yourself. You need to know what you're doing to install any remote starter and none of these things are ""plug and play"" to where you hook up a couple wires and it works. You need to know what kind (if any) of security system your vehicle uses and you need to be aware of the various bypass modules and relay kits available that may or may not be required. Bulldog does a great job of making this information available at their website including vehicle wiring diagrams and special notes about such bypass modules that may be required.

I think it is unfair for some of you people to give the product and the company a bad review simply because you are not capable or qualified to install the product yourself. As for the ""other"" installers who won't do it either...of course not. They want you to buy their system. Like I said, I have successfully installed 11 Bulldog systems in 11 different vehicles....some requiring bypass modules or extra relays or extra harnesses or whatever and have had ZERO issues with any of them. Junk as some have implied? I doubt it. Its not the Cadillac of remote starts but its not a toy either. My point being, from my experience Bulldog makes an excellent product and I have had no issues with any of the systems I have installed. Again, don't bash the company or their products because you can't figure out how to make it work. All the information is there...you just need to know what to do with it. I can't stress enough, this is not something the novice who can barely change a light bulb should attempt. I can't speak to any customer service issues as I've never had to call them but I am speaking simply from my experience with reliability and from an installation standpoint. Bulldog makes a good product, IMHO. I gave 4 out of 5 stars simply because to me 5 means perfection and nothing is perfect or without fail. But, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another....and I probably will.",4.0
"This is a basic remote starter kit and is a DYI kit if you have a basic knowledge of auto electricity.

I like these for my glass top stove.,4.0
"I have had occasion to use this product just once. I was very careful with the ""scraper"" because it has a razor blade on board, so scraping my new cooktop was scary.

Just got a new glass cooktop and these items were on the list of must-have cleaning aids.  Glad to see it arrived quickly and in good condition.,4.0
"It is basically a straight razor blade that comes in a retractable molded plastic holder.  It works well in cleaning your glass stove top of burnt on messes.  I'm sure it may be handy for scraping other surfaces as well although I have never tried it on anything else.  The fact that it retracts allows you to store this safely.  It gets the job done but the price is a little high for what it is, especially since you will need to replace it from time to time as it gets cruded up and starts to rust.  Good little product, only I deduct one star based on the price.  A must have for glass top stoves.",4.0
"We love our ceramic cook top but cleaning up burned-on spills was quite a chore before we bought this scraper. It  does a fine job of removing those spills without a lot of effort and without scratching the surface. Be careful though, it is quite sharp.",4.0
"Although it's plastic, it does a wonderful job and it's light weight.  It fits just right in my hand and comes with your basic instructions on cleaning.",4.0
Works exactly as advertised when it is finished being installed. The instructions aren't very clear about several things. I wouldn't definitely not attempt this unless you feel pretty confident in your skills.,4.0
Works as expected. Could not find the T harness that would have made installation easier but this has worked out. Now it has been close to a year since I bought this and It has been holding up well. The remote battery has died once. Not to hard to replace just a unique battery to find. Most local stores do not carry it. Found it at Radio Shack of all places. May be available at Batteries Plus. Range is excellent. Use the door lock feature to keep kids away from it at times when they think there is no one there seeing them. Would recommend this to other people.,4.0
"I purchased this and a the ""DS18 RC-CLS2 Red Cobra Central Lock 2 Door System"" from Amazon to give my aging 2-door 2003 Toyota Tacoma a refresh with some modern features (that my wife was primarily interested in). I started the day before reviewing the videos that Bulldog put together, which really helped. This morning I woke up, and installed the kit and the two power door locks in about 8 hours.

Tips:
-remove all obstacles, including the seats around you.
-the brake connector (brown) was the hardest connector by far
-the door lock red/black wire may need a positive 12v connection, so look into this first before you finish your splice into the 12v power lines (I had to redo this)
-the tachometer line (grey/white?) should not have been needed, however, Bulldog states that if your vehicle starts and shutdown in a cycle (mine did, 5 second cycle.), then you need to connect this line to the first ignition line (I had to re-do this splice).
-the unit started up and was in ""Safe Mode"". look into this. it will basically just cause your parking lights to flash repeatedly.
- Note again that the auto-tach feature is not enabled by default and you have to enable it.
- you should really have your own set of wire strippers, razor knifes, zip ties and electrical tape. you will use more than they provided. The razor knife they provided was broken (and I wouldn't have used it anyways, but for some I'm sure it is handy).
- know that the professionals use solder on these connections, however I doubt the electrical tape + zip tie combo and proper splicing is really any worse.
- the install kit comes with splice connectors - these maybe handy for the connection to the brake and accessory lines - I did not use them.
- the electrical probe was very handy and i'm happy that they wisely included it. test everything before splicing.
- don't forget to connect everything up before you fire it up for the first time!
- the connectors are one-way - I could NOT unconnected the 12v and ignition connectors one connected! be warned.",4.0
"For the price it's a good remote starter. No more cold car to get into in the winter. I give 4 stars on the product, but if I had to give a rating on tech support I would give no stars because I couldn't get a hold of them for the life of me.",4.0
"I was very reluctant to purchase this product. I read every bad  review and some good reviews, but I went ahead anyway and installed this unit into my 08' dodge Dakota. along with a dball2 interface. Yes it was a lot off work, but worth it.....I do not have to go outside to start my truck up in foul weather.....awesome. Bulldog technicians are very good, and know what they are talking about. I would advise though if you do not know anything about electronics do not attempt this install, but if you have any knowledge, basic knowledge would work. ....it is well worth it.",4.0
"Very good in build quality. It took me almost two days to install tho. Granted, I was being very cautious being the fact that I have never installed one on to a car before. I have gotten the remote start to work and everything is wired correctly according to my Jeep's wiring diagram. I am having issues with the key less entry tho. It does nothing but click when I press the lock/unlock button. The Jeep used to have an anti-theft system in it before it died a couple years ago and I had someone take it out. Maybe that could be the problem but who knows. If anyone reading this knows anything about this problem in a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee Larado and knows how to fix this, I love to hear from you. Over all, good product, great price. But unless you know what you are doing, save yourself the time and energy and have a pro do it.",4.0
I LOVE being able to warm or cool the vehicle before leaving the house.  The only problem with after-factory installation is that you have to unlock to vehicle (by factory remote) before using the starter remote.  The vehicle will shut off if no key when you hit the brake to put it in drive so no vehicle theft but it still leaves a running vehicle empty and open.  It's really only for if you are in your own driveway unless you are monitoring the vehicle.,4.0
everything works well. I have no complaints.,4.0
"This kit is great if you can get it installed correctly. I'm an engineer so I've got a technical mind and many years of experience servicing my vehicles. I still found this kit to be slightly difficult to install due to bulldog directions being wrong or unclear. This was installed on a 2002 dodge dakota quad cab. One of the ignition wires said it required a relay but I read from several sources that the ignition 3 wire was not required. I called tech support to confirm and they agreed, so I wasted 10 bucks on a relay and additional wiring, oh well I'll use it in another project.

I extended the antenna wire up and around my headliner to increase the range, I estimate it to be around 500-600 feet.

One thing I wish was a little different was the unlock/lock feature. There is only one button for both functions so it simply alternates between the two. If you unlock the truck with your remote, drive around, stop and get out but lock the doors from the door panel switch the next time you use the remote it will lock the doors since the unlock command was last sent from the remote. Two separate buttons would be nice. Or make it to where one click unlocks and two quick clicks locks.",4.0
"Regarding my personal level of expertise, I am not a car audio guy but I do have a good bit of mechanical experience, I was a military helicopter mechanic for five years so I am also not a complete beginner.  I installed two remote start/keyless entry systems this Christmas for my sister and my mother. One was an Avital 4301 and this was the other. For self installers I would recommend this one. As far as installation, they do the same thing and so are installed the same way. Each one took about the same amount of time which for me was about 5 hours total. This one is probably very slightly easier due to inclusion of most of the necessary tools including a nice little +/- test light with clear instructions on how to use it to verify you have the wire you are looking for in the car and a DVD instruction video which I can't review as I didn't watch it. More importantly was the customer service. Bulldog provides on their website free wiring instructions for all applicable cars which Avital absolutely does not. They claim they do, but if you try to get one they will ask for your login which requires a not-free commercial account with them. If you call them, they will basically tell you they only work with professional installers. Bulldog on the other hand provides free customer support by phone or email as well as a very decent website where you can get most of your questions answered. In general if you aren't willing to open your dash and cut into the wires inside of it, then installing a remote starter isn't for you. However, even if it is a little bit scary and seems confusing, if you just follow the instructions and take it one step at a time, you will be fine. Also worth noting is that on first use this system may require some initialization and may need additional parts on newer vehicles, know your stuff before starting this project. Regarding use, I am not in love with the single button lock/unlock feature as it requires line of sight to verify that you have indeed locked and not unlocked your vehicle, but it does have very nice range and dedicated start and stop buttons, whereas the Avital has only one combination start/stop button. This system comes with only one remote, which is of nice build quality and feels solid in your hand as well as giving a nice factory installed appearance. The buttons have a very satisfying and definite click when you have depressed them far enough, which the Avital system does not, though it does come with two remotes which are also of decent quality. Price between the two fluctuates slightly but this one tends to be five to ten dallors more expensive which I am okay with. Overall I am very satisfied with this system and glad that my mother had it for this very cold winter.",4.0

Then I trained to be a contorchounist(sp?) to get under the left dash. Worked right off. 400 feet?  No way.  But, I did not route the yellow antenea wire in any special place. As long as it will start from my house to the garage. The only thing worth mentioning is I had to replace the remote transmiter recently (after six years).

"I installed this on a 98' acura integra and it works very well.  I did not use many of the optional features including the power door locks, hood connection among others.  My background consists of being an electrician although I had limited experience with car electronic wiring, with some experience with car audio.  That said I do have a good understanding with power,voltage,amperage as well as logic controls.  This was my first remote start install.  The dvd and written instructions were decent and I suggest going over them at least once, but probably a few times and having everything available for the install on hand.  I haven't installed other remote starts but I am guessing the others are very similar in difficulty unless they included T-harnesses for the optional features.  I used the T-harness from bulldog for my install and it helps but is not a cure all for splicing into wires.  Using the color code for my car available on the website made locating the wires pretty easy. The hardest part of the install for me was getting to the wires in my car and having room to work and splice.  I think this probably varies from car to car, so I suggest looking near your fuse box and getting an idea on where all the wires are and how easy it is to get to them before deciding whether to install a unit yourself.  The difficulty in getting to the wires without taking apart too many things was the major factor in not installing the optional features but the basic install was not too bad.  I am recommending this product but would advise doing some research before taking on an install.",4.0
"I purchased the rs1100 almost 6 yrs ago and installed it in my 93 Taurus GL.It has functioned flawlessly up until 3 days ago. It just stopped working. Im an auto electrician so I crawled under the dash today to see if I could locate the problem. After moving the harness around with the remote depressed,I found the problem. Over the years the starter amp draw was too much for the duel 30 amp fuse holder. It and the fuses were melted into puddles of plastic. Fortunatly it didn't burn my car up!  I definitly see this as a serious safety issue. The fuses and wiring supplied are unable to withstand prolonged use. Buyer beware!",4.0
"RS1100 Unit arrived in good time in good condition, as with every other purchase made from Amazon ""Thanks Amazon"".
OK first things first the main control unit was a little bigger than I expected, so finding a place under the dash to conceal it was a bit of a struggle, I found a position that I thought was the best for wire and control unit placement, then I  roughly ran the wires to their locations, at this point I realized that some the wire harness wires were too short for where they needed to hook up to, so first job was to extend the wires that I needed to and label them accordingly,  I extended then with a soldered  joint and heat-shrinked the connection, second was to cut the wires from the harness I did not need, and also heat-shrink to cap them off.
The Bulldog wiring diagram [...] for my truck was pretty accurate, just one wire that was different, before starting the installation I also downloaded a wiring diagram for my truck from[...] and compared the two diagrams, this is where I found a discrepancy for the wiring.
The install went without a hitch and took around 3hrs, I would recommend going with the Tach on option, from my previous experience I have found the Tachless option a little unreliable, you could do this two ways, both ways are more reliable than Tachless; 1: Connect Tach wire usually at coil, or 2: Connect the Tach wire to the Ignition number 1 wire, number 2 is the way I did mine as I was already in the wire harness at the ignition and you don't have to run the Tach wire through the firewall, finally before actually testing and your remote start don't forget to set the dip switches polarity, for dome-light, door locks etc, if your vehicle start and runs, read the manual and programmet the unit for Tach on, also whilst your doing the programming  set the run time, cold start etc.",4.0
"I bought this on a whim one day at the store - ""Remote starter? Easy Install?? $50??? Heck yeah!"" When I got home I tore open the packaging and then sat there stupefied for hours.  I've never taken my car's dash apart or done any electrical work in my life.

Read the manual a few times through, don't worry if it doesn't make any sense.  I let it stew for a few days and googled as much as I could.  Take your dash apart and really inspect what's going on and try to follow the manual.  Once I figured out how a car's ignition system actually worked, I understood the unit and install procedure much better.  I decided to solder all the connections and insulate with heavy duty silicone fusion tape. (NOTE: make SURE there are no little pokey copper braids that made it through your tape job.  Sparks, blown fuses, and terrifying minutes thinking you ruined your car will follow)

PROS
If you take your time the unit will work exactly as it's supposed to.  It fired right up on my first attempt, and hasn't given me 1 issue in over a year. If the unit ever craps out and you did a good job with the wiring, it's cheap enough that you can just get another one and pop it in. Also you will learn a lot about your car, and circuits in general.

CONS
NOT ""easy to install!""  I had to take my driver's seat out and lay on the floor upside down for hours to get most of the connections in.  A few things require going through the firewall which, on my car, is a huge pain.  Also, DVD would not play.",4.0
"I bought this over a year ago and its still working. Although i think the battery is almost done. If you wire it correctly this will work just as intended. The remote has a nice fancy rubber feel out of the box however this is just a thin coat of rubber that will wear away in a couple months. Not a big deal, im just happy its never stopped working for me. Only thing that annoys me is the button arrangement on the remote. I know the small button is for both unlock and lock, but everyone else seems to think the big button with the key on it is unlock (cant blame them). This means my car stalls sometimes, (i wired it in a manual). By the way if you are doing this in a manual, be very careful of wether you leave the car in gear. I never do so it doesnt bother me.",4.0
"As I first started looking for a remote starter, the first thing I did was to read the reviews of the ones I thought I may like to purchase. As I read the bad reviews for various products, I started to get nervous about trying to install this myself. To make a long story short, I said screw it and ordered the kit.

I have a 1995 full size GMC Sierra pick-up. I chose this particular model for a few reasons; 1) all I wanted was remote start & keyless entry, 2) price, and 3) after doing some research, bulldog is actually made by Viper. When the system arrived, I was very pleased that not only was it on time, but it was not damaged in any way.

Now, on to the fun stuff. First I should say that while I'm not an automotive electrical expert, I do have some automotive mechanical background. With that being said, whe I received the product, I was VERY nervous do to the amount of wires that I saw. But, don't let that scare you! Depending on the type of hook-up and type of options your vehicle has, you may be like me and only use a small portion of the wires.

Installation..... The instructions, at least to me, were fairly simple and to the point. Anything that I was unsure of was on the dvd or the website. The dvd may not be exciting, but I reccommend that you watch it, it can be helpful. Also, the website has factory wire colors and locations to help with the install which proved to be EXTREMELY helpfull during the installation. The installation was not hard. It was a little time consuming though. It took me roughly 6 hours to complete. However, I was trying to watch my kids and I soldered all the connections.

The unit works as it says and I have had no problems with it in the 3 months I have had it. To all the negative reviews on this product; If you would have read the intructions, watched the dvd, and/or visited the website, it would have probably worked a lot better for you! And to those of you thinking about doing the install yourself; If you can not install a car stereo, this may not be something you want to try!",4.0
"This product works exactly as advertised and my wife loves it.  I installed it myself and I must admit it took a lot longer than a couple of hours, though it was very cold outside.  As other reviewers have recommended, it is a good idea to use solder on the splice joints as they are more likely to work in the long term.  I dinged it a star because the wire splice color guide for my vehicle on their website is not totally accurate.  They apparently were confused in several points about where one would perform the splice since the wire colors change as you travel down the harness.  I do not think I would have found all of the wires without the aid of the factory service manual.  For the price though, I doubt this could be beat.",4.0
"Works good now but hard to install in my opinion.  But qwhen I want to sstart it and Im in the store eating,  WHAM it does go on.  Heard it can effect electrical system but no problems as of yet.",4.0
"Let me start by saying that I used to work as a mechanic and am very familiar with automotive wiring. That being said this install still proved to be difficult and not for the faint of heart wishing for a quick easy install. I purchased this for my wife's 2004 Ford Expedition about a year ago. The install was difficult but not overly painful. Once installed the unit worked fantastic. I have never had some of the problems that other reviewer claim to have and judging by some of the comments I might be inclined to suspect a bad install for the problems in other reviews. I have been inside of buildings hundreds of feet away from our vehicle, hit the start button on the remote when I go outside...my vehicle is running!

"I installed this remote start into a 1994 GMC 3500 dump truck.  The truck originally had no power door locks or windows and I recently installed a power door lock system.  (Which I purchased on Amazon...see my other reveiw.)  The main reason I installed the remote start was for the keyless entry feature.

Although this installation was pretty straight foward, you need some mechanical/electrical experience.  It should not be attempted by a complete novice.

The included directions and DVD were very complete and easy to understand and follow.  I was able to attach the remote start to my power door lock module simply and it works great.  The remote start has never failed to start the engine.  Very nice to have a warm truck when parked outside in the winter.

I've been using it for about 2 months now and for the money, it can't be beat.",4.0

I purchased 2 remote starters.  The installation was cumbersome, mostly taking the dash apart and locating wires.  The suggestion from Amazon was to add the pass lock and relays which I didn't need for one vehicle but needed the pass lock for the newer vehicle.  We also purchased the t-harness from the site recommended by BullDog to aid in installation, it removes the guess work of locating most of the wires but not all.  After install, during the first week, if the heater motor was set to high in one vehicle, or the auto headlight light function on the other was energized the remote starter would shut off and keep restarting for the default set by BullDog, three or four times.  There is a current set limit of 10 amps which we solved one of two ways, connecting and setting tach mode on and connecting to the tack wire or to the 12V heavy gauge wire associated with the installation.  Both methods seem to work.  The signal is also strong and is able to go through 3 walls and also be used in a metal building, I don't know if the signal strength is typical of remote car starters.  It works well and is American Made.",4.0
"This is the second Remote starter I have installed and it was fairly easy to install.  Your car type will affect how difficult it is to install but my '99 Mazda Millenia wasn't too hard.  The remote isn't long range but I can start it from my house to the curb.  It depends on if you have a clear line of sight to your car and where you place the antenna.  I was able to get about 400 ft range in an empty parking lot standing on the driver side of my car. I've owned this for about 5 months now and it still works fine. There have been a couple instances where it failed to start, but that could be because I didn't connect it to the tachometer as recommended. I also didn't connect the remote door locking part. Over all it's cheap and it works.",4.0
"I'm an electrician so installation was pretty easy - about 2 hours (no T harness). Once you have your vehicles wiring diagram, just match up colors and away you go. Works fine but the transmitting range is no where near 400', more like 60' from inside a house with car in garage.

One other note: I got this for xmas 2008 and wanted to use a ""T"" harness for my 2003 GM minivan. The model # is GM1-T harness. Absolutley NO one has this particular harness in stock and some companies say it's discontinued. This harness is the most widely used for GM vehicles and it's discontinued? Splicing was the only option which does take longer.",4.0
"Hardest thing about doing this install is connecting the wires. Not much room under the dash. The web site has good info (wire diagrams) for different models, just have to find it. I had a pretty simple hook up. No door locks, keyless entry and such. You can just hook up the brakes and accesary wires. Don't forget to ground the hood wire to put the remote starter in operation mode. After install was complete, about 4 hours, it worked great.",4.0
"This was a simple project and the kit contains almost everything you will need to install your remote starter. It was a time consuming project so keep your afternoon clear and visit Bulldogsecurity.com and look up your vehicle's wiring chart. The chart identifies the wires on your specific model that you need to connect and whether or not you will need a security bypass module or relays. They also have pictures of key locations to help you identify where to find those wires. If I were to do this again, I would order the T-harness to speed up the installation and minimize potential damage to the vehicles wiring.
Overall, a great product for little money and you can avoid calling tech support if you visit the website first.",4.0
"Good product, the instruction doesn't included trouble shooting. I have to go online and look for Q&A.

"Bought this for my son's 05 Corolla. Buying the wiring harness easily cut the install time in half. Make sure to check Bulldog's web site to see if they have vehicle specific instructions for your car. Even with pictures from the web site, took longer than anticipated to install.

Once installed, we're pleased with the functionality.",4.0
"Got two of them 2 month ago and set it up through a whole day. It really took me some time to figure out the right wire, because the diagram on their website is not so accurate for one of my car.(for 1996 avalon, the color of the wire for the door is not right). But once I set it up, it worked perfectly. I can control it at about 100 feet away from it. although it's not 400 feet, it is good enough. I gave it 4 stars only because it is not as easy as what I thought to set it up, but maybe it is different in your case, depends on how good you are at electrics. :-)",4.0
"I received this unit for Christmas, and installed it in my Ford Explorer. The instructions are not as direct as they could be, but the video helps organize things. I needed to call tech support for a question/clarification and after a fairly long wait on hold (two days after Christmas so I expected that) I got the info I needed by a cheerful tech. The biggest problems with any of these self-installed units (this brand or others) are (1) people who don't have any electrical experience or tools, and (2) installation on cars that have difficult to access wiring (most). The latter can make the difference between a relatively easy or relatively hard installation. The kit electronics appear good for this type of item. All parts (and a small installation tool kit) are included - - except for any small relays that may be necessary for some door locks, security bypasses, and some dome light activiation situations. They are not needed on every vehicle, but many. A couple should be included since they are cheap and these Remote Starters are not. Also, if under-dash wiring is a bit hard to get at (or not), they have plug-in T-harnesses available that range in cost between $10 and $20. Using one would eliminate almost all hookup problems. I didn't use one. My unit works great. I don't anticipate problems, but I have experience in tapping into wiring properly so the connections should last. If there is going to be a problem, it will be in that area. This thing makes getting off to work on a cold, snowy morning more bearable. It's also kinda neat, in general. Take your time or have someone who knows more about these things do the installation. Enjoy. Happy New Year!",4.0
"I've had this rack for since 2002 - has worked well for carrying bikes whether towing my +2000-lbs popup camper or not. I've recommended it to friends, and would buy it again.

Don't use the swing-down feature often, as it's pretty heavy if bikes are loaded. The v-cradles for the bikes don't work as well for the oval tubes on some bikes - especially for really ""tall"" top tubes. I bought a ""cheater"" tube for adapting troublesome bikes (ladies frame, etc.) to fit the rack.

The three screws to fasten the top plate are a little tedious, but I can clamp it as tight as I want, can accomodate top tubes of varous diameters (the top plate flexes), and I have never seen them loosen even after several hours of highway driving.

"We searched high and low to find the right tool to carry four bikes while towing our pop-up.  This Swagmen looked to fit our needs for the right cost.  After our first trip over the Easter weekend, we were pleased.
We are carry three adult and one child's bike.  The child's bike will only fit in the last space ( won't work with two small bikes). By alternating the two men's and the girl's bikes, we were able to carry all four without additional hardware.  The bikes were easy to lock down and the did not move during out 50 mile trip (each way).
We did need to extend our tow chains and will extend our electrical connection in the coming weeks.",4.0
"This hitch is great if you also need to tow a small trailer or camper. It is also nice that you can lock your bikes in it.  The downfall, as far as using it as a hitch for a small trailer, is that your receiver must already be at the proper height for the trailer, since the draw bar on this bike carrier is straight - it stays exactly at your receiver level and does not dip down or rise up to accommodate a trailer tongue that may require a height different than your receiver. So if your receiver height is OK for the trailer (or not too far off) then you are good to go.  But also keep in mind that you may have to run your safety chains a little longer than normal, as the this hitch setup will make the trailer about a foot or or so farther back from the vehicle than a normal draw bar with a ball on it.  As far as a bike carrier, I have another rubber strap type which I use for quick trips to the park with the bikes, as it takes less time than to secure the bikes compared to this Swagman bike rack which you secure by using bolts with knobs on the end.

This unit has had a considerable field test, with use in 4 border watches and many night operations.

The user has a moderate case of asthma which is aggravated by damp, cold night air and in cases where night stealth is required, this tool is a must.

It is hard for the user to evaluate a product like this, because, as the directions on the back of the package indicates, the user cannot hear any difference in the volume of his own cough. To you, it will sound as loud as coughing without it. But that is hardly the case.

In evaluating the unit, others are enlisted, and all will say the cough is greatly muffled, probably heard no more that 20 feet. But even then, the sound is greatly changed, and the inexperience ear would not be sure what he heard, assuming of course, he even heard it.

The operator soon learns some additional techniques to muffle the cough even further. Hanging the unit on your neck, the uniform jacket is opened and the cough is further muffled underneath the jacket. Additionally, the operator soon learns how to ""throw"" the cough into the unit, which affords additional suppression.

The unit can be disassembled for washing, and the cotton baffles dried out. When needed, the cotton baffles can be replaced by a package of larger cotton balls, re-formed around the muffler portion.

Overall, I rate this product 4.5 Stars. If cough suppression for stealth is what you need, don't go into the bush without one of these.

After my Seadoo broke down on the lake I decided I should have a better tow rope on board.  I called around to all the boat shops and PWC dealers in my area and also checked with boat repair shops looking for a tow rope designed for a PWC.  No one had anything that was made for a PWC.  All the tow ropes I found had a very large hook on the front that was much too large for a PWC.  I was happy to find this tow rope that fit my Seadoo perfectly.  The latch is very heavy duty so I am pleased that it is a quality latch and snaps back smoothly.  The item arrived in a sufficient amount of time.  It was exactly what was pictured.  I really like how compact it is.  The storage bag is about 7 or 8 inches long and maybe 5 inches wide.  I now have the peace of mind that I have the appropriate tow strap on board in the (hopefully unlikely) event I ever need another tow in.  For anyone wondering about the maximum tow capacity of this rope it says the PWC should not exceed 900 lbs in weight.  I paid more for it ($10.00 which included shipping) through this location but am satisfied that it arrived as stated and I have Amazon backing my purchase.  I've seen this same item listed under the names Kwik Tek and Jet Logic.  On the box it indicates that Jet Logic is a division of Kwik Tek so either way you are getting the same product.,4.0
Keeps trailer and hitch secure. Still works well after years of use.,4.0

good lock for bikes,4.0
"I like the fact that there's no loop at one end so you can feed it through small openings to lock tools.  I mainly use it to lock two pressure washers inside truck beds.  With other locks, I could only lock the body of the machines which can easily be stolen if you just take the body apart.  Now I can feed the wire through the engine of the pressure washer!! and then through the truck rack!!

The only issue is that every time the lock is unlocked there's a chance that The numbers from the combination mechanism could fall out an all get lost. So you have to hold them in place with your hand every time the thing is unlocked.",4.0
Works great. The lock itself is not as heavy duty as the cable but it does the job.,4.0
"Overall pretty nice, however, if you leave it out in the rain, even for a relatively short time, the lock will already start to get rust-powder on it, which you have to blow off, and my numbers froze up pretty good to where I had to really wrestle with it to get them moving again. This was on a brand new one that had only seen rain maybe twice, WITH the rubber guard over it.

The rubber guard itself btw, seems JUST a bit too short. It kind of stops leaving about a 1/16 inch of the chrome lock showing, and it often feels like it's not on well enough no matter how much you struggle with it to push it on harder. Sometimes making you think it may not be there later due to falling off when you have it attached to a bike on the back of your vehicle.",4.0
Very long. Someone could probably pull the lock portion off with a good set vice grips and some force. Works great though for locking up 6 bikes.,4.0
"I like it, and it works for the money, so I consider this is a good buy.  But, any semi-good bike thief will be able to cut this cable and take your bike.  I bought it for my son, who uses it at school, so I think for his purposes, this should hold up fine.  But, I would not recommend this lock for public lots, or colleges where the people we are trying to protect our bikes from are a bit more creative.",4.0
"The only thing I don't like is I expected the numeric lock to be permanently attached to the cable on both ends, allowing me to simply insert one end of the cable into the other and locking.  It's not a deal breaker, but you do have to enter the combination, remove the combo part of the lock, and then slide the cable through.  This length is perfect for locking either two bikes side-by-side, or locking an adult bike and a connected trailer bike for a child. I also use it on my bike rack as a deterrent for theft.  Obviously a serious thief will cut it, but as a deterrent for a casual thief, it does the trick.",4.0
I use this for a tandem bike and the length allows me to secure the bike and wheels.  Having a combination is better than having to remember a key.,4.0
good,4.0
"We use this to temporarily secure our expensive City Elite stroller in the mall (e.g. when we go into a restaurant). This lock cable would not deter any serious thief, but it does prevent the stroller from walking off. It's long enough to tie around a post, and the resettable combination means I don't have to remember another code. Recommended.",4.0
"ok, this is not ready for new york city, but then few locking devices are.  if someone really really wants your bike and they have enough time they will get it.  this is easy to use, easy to reset the combination, and has a nice dust cover (important for my application since it will be behind the car collecting dust).  nice length too.",4.0
"I bought a four bike hitch mounted rack that came with an 8' cable lock.  With the 8' cable lock, I was unable capture every wheel and every frame, so this lock was needed.  While I was 1000 miles from home on a family vacation, the mechanism in the hitch provided cable lock broke and I was really glad I had this one. The lesson learned is any lock is better than no lock, so having a backup is a good idea.  I gave this lock four starts because it is too small of diameter to prevent any slightly motivated thief, although the same can probably be said for the hitch provided cable that is nearly twice the diameter. In combination with a second cable it provided me with a satisfactory level of comfort to take the family in to a restaurant provided I had a view of my vehicle from my table.",4.0
"Well made lock!
I would have given it a higher rating if the cable would have been a larger diameter.",4.0
"Bought this to secure my bike rack and bikes to my car. The length is good and wraps nicely around 2 bikes on a Yakima hitch rack. I'd guess you could even do four bikes, if needed.

The combo lock is kind of hard to use and line up. Plus you have to make sure it's aligned right to even insert it into the chain.

The quality of this lock is of the kind that ""it keeps honest folks honest"" but I doubt it would slow down someone determined to take your bikes.",4.0
"Not really used yet - seems fine but the lock a little difficult to find the ""sweet"" spot to pull off the cable when unlocking.  I might use it to lock up a jet ski to a lift, and anticipate no problems there.",4.0
"Decent lock, quality cable. Bought it just replace a 6 footer. Design is very nice too, smart, adjustable length. Lock itself is a little cheap but it does the job and has a rubber cover for it so that helps with the elements. It's not to bulky and fits in my handle bar bag. If there was an option 4.5 stars, that would be my rating.",4.0

"I have a brand-new trike, which I park in car's parking space, with the bike cable wrapped around the adjoining pillar.  The first cable I bought was just barely too short to wrap around the pillar and the trike frame.  Finding a 10' cable is incredibly difficult.

The tumblers on this one feel really secure.  The key is a little harder to separate from the tumblers, but I expect that will loosen up with time.  Once it's in, though, it's locked down tight.  One word of caution: when you put in the combo to open it, the ""key"" will be stubborn; when you go to lock it back up again, put in the key, hold it inserted in the tumblers, spin the dials, and *then* you can let go.  It slips in and out really easily once it's pulled free.",4.0
"man it's hard to come up with a title for this. and it's a mixed review

It works.  It's metal, strong, rust-resistance (it's not a grade of rust-proof stainless as there are already spots from road-salt), but given the narrow space where it fits, it's difficult to get the locking end on and off.  It's hard to get a good grip on it,  even with the knurling on the ends.  But the ends ARE small enough so there's no interference with other hardware.  The hitch on my truck is just wide enough outside that there's almost to end-play on the lock shaft which makes getting the end on even more difficult.  Takes some getting used to.  I don't think there's a better product out there though, which makes this worth the price.",4.0
Easy to install. Rubber cover is cheap and may fall off in the future. Company needs to come up with something more durable. Other than that issue it will do the job.,4.0
"I would love to cut this unit in two, because I have a hunch it's a lot softer metal than is actually required.  But for carrying keys and a couple of bucks in the receiver guard, it's probably fine.  I wouldn't use one of these for anything important unless I had an idea how fast it could be cut by a diamond wheel mounted on a high speed rotory air tool.

I used SS metal washers for spacers to close the space between the lock and my receiver.",4.0

"This pin looks good and feels pretty solid. The lock seems well made and well protected. However, at lease on mine the locking head is a little wobbly, which has me a little worried.

"I ordered 2 of these locks. They came keyed with the same key for both, which will be nice. One lock fit perfectly on the end, the other was very difficult to get on. I figured out that the internal rubber gasket had some extra material on it, and will need to be replaced. I'm hoping the vendor will send me a replacement gasket, it just pops in and out of there. I may have to buy one at the hardware store. Overall the locks seem very nice.",4.0
"I could not lock the pin until I ground off about 1/8"" of metal on each side of the receiver around the hole, tapering it to match the shoulders of the lock.  Chevy and GMC HD 2500/3500 pickups put on an honest Class V hitch that is a full 3 1/2 across, and in spite of the claim, this product is just a bit short.  Regardless of the needed modification this is a quality lock that should deter even an ambitious thief!  I would not recommend grinding on the lock as that might weaken it.",4.0
"I purchased this camp fork because I wanted a fork that would be long enough to cook without my kids ending up too close to the fire. I was pleased with the quality of the fork when it arrived. I was also impressed by how sturdy the metal stem is, it is firm and doesn't wobble like other forks I purchased and used in the past. The one down fall is that it does not retract and thus remains at full length at all times. I feel like the fact that it does not retract is part of what gives it the stability it has so that wasn't a drawback for me.",4.0

"The two Bullrings will not fit properly with the BakFlip Fibermax (and I'm assuming other Bakflip products as well) due to the edge of the bull ring overlapping the rubber seal that is part of the Bakflip rail.  Seeing as they were plastic I simply shaved the edge of the bullring to a 45 angle and sanded it smooth again for each side.  It fit flush against the rubber seal at that point and was no longer an issue.

As far as Bull Ring quality it is as advertised.  When down it wiggles only slightly.  I do not hear any rattling whenever I'm driving at any speed on the road. The ring will lock into the up position when pulled.  I'm not sure if it'll secure 1000 lbs as advertised as the top part of the bull ring is plastic.  I would imagine it would crack if I pulled too much force on it laterally with a tie down strap.  I agree that a steel upper plate would be preferred, but it would have been much more difficult to modify to fit the BakFlip.",4.0
"I really wanted these to workout but the hole size is too small for this Bull Ring Anchor.

"This works well once I got it positioned correctly.  My only complaint was getting it to fit properly.  I have a 2011 F150 and the bed stake hole covers are covered with a plastic cap.  I had to cut holes in the bed cover and then get the anchor point to fit.  The issue is the bed rail cap is about 1/2"" above the metal of the bed, this makes the anchor bottom not able to fit flush against the top plastic part.  The stress created by the gap between the bottom mounting point and the top plastic part caused one of mine to crack when I was tightening  it down.  I was able to fix this by placing a spacer between the bottom mounting anchor bracket and the top plastic part.  They need to redesign this to remove the weakness in the top plastic part due to updated pickup designs that don't have the metal of the stake pocket flush with the underside of the bed rail cap.",4.0
I had a set of these on my previous truck and after buying a new Denali I had to purchase a few new sets.  Easy install with just a screwdriver.  Sleek look on the top rail and a great design.  Highly recommend.,4.0
Install six of these but used only four to hold a 700 pound Vulcan 500 all the way to Florida. It never budged the whole way. When not used they pop down so nothing is sticking up to interfere with anything you do in the bed. These are well made. I had to center them to get them in without binding but that was no big deal. The only complaint were the screws. The philips head slots need to be much deeper and/or a deep slot or hex screw used. I used a cutoff wheel and put a deep slot on mine so I could really tighten them down. The current screws because they were so shallow could easily strip but the over all construction is great. I would purchase them again. Rf,4.0

"Ordered a cargo net, or ""spider"" for my trailer.

"Just received the cargo net today. Very prompt shipping. However, they did ship me the camo version of the net instead of the one pictured above.

"I tore out a fence and the county came in and rebuilt the ditch. I had about a 40 foot wide strip a half mile long to reseed with Bermuda grass. Not allot of acres but more than I could do with a small hand-held spreader and much too rough and sloped for a pull-type. After researching as much as possible, I bit the bullet and bought this one. It mounts quite easily to my Kawasaki 4 wheeler rack (either rear or front) and has a shield to keep grass seed from hitting the driver if front-mounted. It mounts with 2 U-bolts with wing-nuts. Then attaches to it's own mount with 2 small hitch pins. The only tool I needed was an Allen Wrench (1/32 size, by the way!) The 12 volt actually plugs into the power plug. I didn't have to wire it to the battery as I had expected. (Though this could be a problem if you don't HAVE a power plug on your ATV!) My only complaint about this spreader is that it has no graduations or markings to help you set the openings for different seed or fertilizer. It has two large holes in the bottom of the spreader that are opened with a draw-bar. It took quite a bit of experimenting to get it set close to where I thought it should be. There are instructions on how to calculate the opening but since my 4wheeler has no speedometer, I couldn't use their calculations! If you are spreading Bermuda grass, as I was, then halfway open and driving at 1.8 MPH is about right. The seed flowed through the spreader just fine. Over-all I am very happy with my purchase. I know I will use this spreader to seed pond dams and waterways and spread weed & feed on my lawn in the future.",4.0
"The spreader is a good buy for the price.  The spreader is very well constructed.  I've used it to spread both pelletized lime and dry granular fertilizer for food plots and the yard and it functions well, spreads evenly and throws it a considerable distance.  I put 80 pounds in it and it handled it great.  It's really handy having the cigarette lighter plug that plugs directly into the 4 wheeler and an on/off switch you can mount just about anywhere.  The heavy poly tank is nice as well, as it has a built in funnel to keep the material flowing and it won't rust.  You should be able to spread anything you put in it with no problems as long as it's dry.

The mounting bracket could use some help though.  It's heavily made, just needs something on the bottom to keep the spreader from tilting down when you load it up.  I fabricated a metal bracket that mounts to the bottom of the spreader and fastens to my 4 wheeler to make the spreader rock solid now.  One would think they could have included something similar without much thought.  Not the end of the world, but a necessary item for my 4 wheeler rack.  The rod or arm for adjusting the flow could have been better designed as well.  Again, some minor tweeking may be necessary.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this spreader, but be prepared to do a little work to make this spreader what it should have been from the factory.  It should last for a long time and plan on getting lots of use out of it.",4.0
This spreader is fairly easy to assemble but require some addition supports to fit my ATV. Once installed it worked great spending lime pellets on my field. I rally like the electronic switch that allows you to turn on/off the spreading mechanism. I am satisfied with the product.,4.0

Nice Surprise that I really like this item so far.  Read some reviews with concerns but have none to share.  Nice light weight but strudy design.

"Somehow I thought the bin would be bigger, but as long as it holds 2-3 bags of fertilizer I am happy.  I have a Polaris Sprortsman 570  that I installed a rear brush guard on, so mods were necessary for the install since the guard prevents mounting the plate on on the rear rack.  I had a choice of getting larger U bolts for the 2"" brush guard, or drilling...I chose drilling for a more stable, better looking permanent mount for the plate.  I centered the mounting plate on the brush guard using the lowest two holes on the plate, marked and drilled through the brush guard with a 5/16 bit then mounted the plate using two and a half inch grade 8 carriage bolts, nuts, washers and lock washers.  To solve the tipping/leaning issue other reviews commented about when the bin is full of heavy material, I removed the bolts holding the top metal band on the bin and replaced them with 3/8 eye bolts, then used a pair of 6' 400lb-rated ratchet straps hooked through the eye bolts and rear rack to pull tension on the top of the bin (before loading with material) to add extra stability (you can get a pair of them here on Amazon...Keeper 03720 Camouflage...for less than $13).  Trim the strap length for a custom fit then just store them in the bin with the pins used to secure the broadcaster to the mounting plate when off the quad. (By the way, I tried bungee cords first and found that they just did not provide the stability I was looking for, so went with the ratchet straps.)
I finished my mods by putting a couple of small pieces of Gorilla tape on either side of the slot in the mounting plate where the gate handle goes through then cut a slit in the tape to push the end of the handle through when mounting the bin, so the handle doesn't flop around loose in the slot...kinda anal about stuff rattling on my quad.
  The instructions on how to determine broadcast rates would have you wasting a lot of material.  We just had someone follow me, starting with the gate closed, then gradually opened it until we felt the width and material spread was right given the speed I wanted to run on my quad and the size of the food plot...slower for the narrower plots and faster for a wider spread on the large plots.  Since I broadcast in two directions to get good ground coverage on the food plots, we keep the initial flow rate at an estimated half of what we want to put on the plot for the initial pass, to ensure that we do get some material on the entire plot before that allotment runs out, then open the gate further on the second pass if we have more than half of the allotted material left to spread...takes a bit longer but we get better coverage in the long run.

UPDATE 10/24/16:  Switch died 15 minutes into broadcasting wheat on the first of 10 food plots on recent work weekend at the camp.  Ohmed out the part and it is the El Cheapo inline switch.  Fortunately I had a spare power cord I was able to use that saved the weekend for our crew, since I was one of only two 4-wheelers and the only one designated to spread seed.  Called Buyers and the first thing I was told that since I didn't buy it directly from Amazon they would not support direct parts replacement and I had to take the part to one of their distributors an hour away to get it replaced.  WRONG ANSWER...long story short Kristin with Buyers did agree to ship another part direct (3002232) so at least I may be able to use the thing again this weekend...THANKS KRISTIN, I appreciate you...good move on the customer satisfaction side...bad initial decision not to directly support Amazon customers since I'll bet Amazon would be happy to discontinue listing your product altogether and sell just Moultrie spreaders...reviews suggest you need to look into QA on the power switch too...",4.0
"Got tired of the pull cart spreaders.  I got this and decided to build my own bracket for my 2 inch receiver on my Grizzly and put a screen inside the hopper.  Finally got to spread some lime on my food plot and it worked great,  My only complaint is with the gate mech.  It is really hard to use and I would prefer a cable design or a better lever design.

"For $200. I'm a happy man. I delivered seven bags of weed & feed over my several acre lawns. Mounted on the back of my Honda ATV. Now, with the job done, spreader removed until next Spring.
Points:
1/. Install it, wire it, use it and then remove it. You do not want to have any part of this spreader to remain on your ATV when not in use. Attachment metals provided are of very modest grade and not intended for normal ATV use or being exposed to weather.
2/. While the attachment plate for the ATV is appropriately stout, I am stunned so few holes were provided to accommodate various machines. 40 more hole choices would help and wouldn't hurt attachment plate integrity. Plan on drilling your own plate attachment holes.
3/. The distribution armature is useless. I called customer service. They chose not to return my call.
4/. Adjust the aperture on the fly. Start with the aperture closed, turn on spreader and adjust from there. Adjust flow--no big deal, jump on and go.
5/. Have delivered bb sized product and sand sized product. With adjustment's, both delivered fine.",4.0

I like the tub.  The spreader has a wide range of spreading options.  The operating bale to adjust volume is not well designed but I just used my own thick plastic coated electrical wire to design my own.  The mounting plate is solid but the options on how to mount it to your ATV are limited and I think every ATV owner will need to design a mounting option more specific to their ATV.

This spreader was simple to connect to the ATV.  I had to weld a couple kickers to strengthen the top of the rack and drill a couple new mounting holes but it took only a few extra minutes.  The hopper is decent size.  It held 100 lbs. of 34-0-0.  The control arm design could be improved but I set it to half open and installed the lock collars and it worked great.

"I haven't used yet is why I gave 4 Stars but I installed to the back of my basket rack, I had to do some modifying to secure the plate but its solid and heavy weight and sits level, the ratio gauge is not marked so I added some white tape to the bottom funnel and marked it myself ( full, 3/4 1/2 1/4 and close ) also marked the opening plate, I left off the control handle because there is no way to install it, I don't understand that, so if I need to open or reduce I will have to get off the bike and move it to one of my marks, I sprayed the hardware with black Rustoleum to avoid rust, Once I've used it I will clean, oil and dry and store back in the box and keep in my garage, If ever stops raining I'll get an opportunity to use it, "" Remember, your next successful hunting season starts with a great food plot"", feed em all year.",4.0

The spinner  could do with some work - the vanes on the full size spreaders are cupped in shape rather than a flat vertical surface.
This would have more control of the material being spread.

Because the material is thrown in all directions- including forward into the guard, it tends to be more dense directly under the ATV

I would recommend the product

The service from Amazon was amazing. Ordered it Tuesday night, arrived at my door in AUSTRALIA the following Friday morning-fantastic.

"Works as advertised. Great spreader - only issue is the control arm for opening the spreader isn't a
very good design - but its workable. Otherwise - great product for the money.",4.0
"Works flawlessly, rugged also on rough terrain. But the bracket wouldn't fit on my 2007 Honda Rancher, so I mounted it on my sons ATV",4.0
Bought this for spreading fertilizer and for seeding my pastures. It worked great for spreading the pelleted lime and was able to adjust the opening to spread it how I wanted it. Also worked great for spreading the grass seed for overseeding the pasture. The spreader broadcast about 20 feet in diameter.,4.0
For the money you can't go wrong with this unit. used one season on 2 different food plots. you just have to play with the setting to get it right. then it works just fine.,4.0
"Works great.  Does not fit ALL ATV's.  Had to make some modification.  Great going over bumpy terrain to seed, the seed will not fly out, or if raining it doesn't get all gummed up.  Would get again, knowing we will have to make it fit our ATV.",4.0
"Was exactly as advertised. Delivered in a reasonable amount of time.
Fit perfectly. Had them on and the splitter ready to go in no time.",4.0
"Just got this little pump and so far only have one complaint. I have this mounted on a 45 gallon aluminum tank in my truck and this rascal is loud. Granted, it's on a smaller aluminum tank so that's part of the problem, but my Dad has a GPI  (silver pump) on a larger steel tank and it's so quiet you can barely hear it over his truck rumbling. I can't say that's a fair comparison since one is a large steel tank and one is small aluminum but I do believe GPI is a quieter pump. Other than that, this pump runs like a top and does the job I need it to do.",4.0
"I used it for a fueling station on a travel trailer project.  Works very well, and these are a lot more reliable than the cheesy fueling stations that come with most toy boxes.  It pumps fuel really fast, so you have to be careful with the smaller quads.  It would be nice if the hose was a little stiffer, and more kink resistant like the hoses you see at gas stations.  It is a little noisy though.",4.0
Excelent,4.0
"As described and made it before the items that were to arrive sooner. Did have some minor damage to the suction tube due to OEM packaging.
Well made product and made in USA.",4.0

Works well...,4.0
Good product and prompt delivery.,4.0
"Great product made here in the USA.  Works flawlessly.  Packaged very well and instructions were very clear.  Minimal assembly required.  Only complaint is it leaks continuously after used.  I have diesel all over the side of my truck.  Would be 5 stars if not for this.
I did find the suction pipe was too short for the tank I ordered.  Not Fill-Rite's fault, and a simple modification fixed the problem.  Not something that affects my rating, but worth noting since I think my tank is a standard depth tank for a pickup truck.",4.0
"Great pump, but no auto shut off?!!?",4.0
"Added these to my harbor freight folding trailer. The center holes let you use a bolt to lock-in the stakes  or make them removeable as needed, and also can hold an eyebolt as a tie-down spot.",4.0
"Work as designed. The forms could be more accurate, but worked fine.",4.0
"The instructions are very easy to follow but you have to have some assembly experience along with wiring knowledge.  This pump will pull most of the fuel out of your auxiliary tank.  It is a bit noisy when it's operating and doesn't have an auto stop so that it stops pumping fuel when the tank being filled is full. With the loud noise of the pump, it makes it difficult to hear when the tank being filled is getting full.",4.0
Good Product as always from Fill-Rite. Exactly what I was expecting.,4.0
Works well,4.0
Really fast.,4.0
"So far so good, have only had it less than a month but so far works exactly as advertised and was easy to install. While I have not measured its transfer rate it fills up the tanks I use it for in no time at all.",4.0
works well suction pipe is a little to short for 275 gal tank had to add about 4 inches to it,4.0

"Good protection for the money; fits larger helmets (i.e.: Dirt helmet with long visor).  Mine came with the ""Raider"" logos which was kind of a bummer as I was hoping to get an unlabeled one as some other reviewers received; must be hit or miss when it comes to the logos.  Other reviewers have complained about a ""cut"" in the bottom of their bag; this is by design.  The slit is for drainage and is reinforced.",4.0
"Useful and big. It's completly black (no letters). I bought it for my kid's karting helmet. I keep a helmet, gloves, racing collar, rib protector. It's padded but not rigid.",4.0

"Pro's- Very large compartment for very large helmets, interior soft pile protects the helmet, great price
Con's- Good for storage and light transport (not heavy use), no separate side zip compartment

"I use this bag for my ski helmet, gloves, goggles, face mask, and turtle. It became my ski accessory bag. The inside is lined with fleece. It's very roomy and great price.l",4.0
"I bought this to carry my $xxx Welding Helmet to and from Class.  It's got a nice ""wool"" (faux?) lining and there is room for my helmet, Extra lenses, Gloves and a little more.

"The only reason I can't give this a 5 is the bolts that come with are prone to getting lost in the package. But, it's a good piece.",4.0
"It's a little big, but it accommodates other items you would typically want with you anyways. Interior is plush & provides wanted protection for helmet.",4.0

Great quality,4.0
I bought this to hold my Star Wars X-wing helmet for professional cosplay conventions.  The bag is big enough to hold it (the ram's horn on the X-wing helmet makes it larger than most motorcycle helmets) and the inside padding should protect the paint and plastic from pressure dings.,4.0
Big enough that it fits my giant XXL helmet and a set of winter gloves.,4.0
"Protects helmets well and is roomy enough for a motocross helmet with a visor or a street helmet. Biggest flaw? Needs a vinyl or plastic bottom so it would be more durable and more water-resistant. Vent holes would be nice, too. But quite nice as it is, especially for the price.",4.0
Very good product for the price!,4.0
material and shape are ok... But i have automotive helmet...fit good.,4.0
"A little light weight, but does a good job of protecting my helmet under ordinary conditions. This interior lining is very soft and protects the finish of my helmet just fine.

I would give it 5 stars, but in reality if you need 5 star protection, buy a heavier bag.",4.0
Great value! I bought this bag to house my welding helmet and it works perfectly. These is plenty of space and the fake sheep inside of the bag provides plenty of protection.,4.0

"I am  using these as a storage option in my garage, so dust and gunk won't affect my helmets. Only took a few times of having to clean my helmet BEFORE I went riding to buy a storage solution. Now I only clean my helms AFTER the ride since buying the bags.",4.0
"Great bag for the price.  I needed a bag to throw me helmet, gloves, and tape in and this filled the bill perfectly.  Only 4 stars because this is a no frills bag - the handles, zipper, and lining are its only features.",4.0
"I'm not sure what ""helmet bag"" features there are out there that I'm missing, so I'm giving this 4 stars on the assumption that somewhere there is a helmet bag with, like... I dunno... something super convenient that I haven't even thought of yet.  But for the purpose of holding a helmet, this bag is functional and sturdy enough.  And the inside is cozy and soft, so it won't scratch the thing up.",4.0
"In the costume building world we spend a ton of money on our helmets....and often wait a year for a craftsman to make them one at a time. While inexpensive this has been the choice for 501st Legion members for a few years now because it fits the full size movie accurate Rebel Pilot , TIE and ATAT driver and certain Stormtrooper and Clone  helmets.  I've carried my helmet four four years and more than 60 events in five states in this.

Just make sure to vacuum it out to get rid of the cut off ends.  Nothing sticks to a gloss black surface like fuzz.

It will not fit a Vader helmet.  Those bags are custom made to the particular helmet.",4.0
"It holds my helmet, and my communicator equipment just fine. Haven't used it much, but it seems to be holding up well in my shop.",4.0
"It's cheap, but it looks cheap and it feels cheap. It does, however, do the job I intended for it.  It holds my helmet and prevents scratches and dings. It has a handle so you don't have a hard time trying to hold your helmet while you walk to and from your bike with no danger of the helmet slipping through your fingers and falling to the ground (done that before).  I can easily shove it in my backpack while I'm riding and it doesn't take up an absurd amount of space. It's function over form and for the price I'd definitely buy it again.",4.0
"Great quality to price ratio. A must have to protect your investment between rides. Tough on the outside, soft on the inside.",4.0
"a little loose for my suomy helmets. but at least there's plenty of space left to put a spare visor also. wish it had pockets on the side for a ear plugs and what not (or helmet visor removal tool). otehrwise, not bad value. not much padding but i'm coming from a ogio bag too.",4.0
An excellent product which could at least protect the helmet from any knocks against any object. It should have the shoulder strip to be carry easily.,4.0
"This is a good, cheap bag.
Holds both Simpson and Bell helmets with some room to spare.
Soft, sheep skin won't scratch helmet or visor.
Large zipper handle.
Not a ton of padding, but enough as long as you are not extremely rough on it.
Does NOT have room for HANS device along with the helmet.",4.0
"Great inexpensive bag. Can get my helmet and several other items in this bag. Well built, good zippers, just what I needed.",4.0
"This is a well manufactured bag, that accommodates my helmet very well. The soft lining ensures I can store it without the worry of scratches.",4.0
"Bought it for Fulmer open face helmet. Looks good although I wish it came in 3 sizes - for full face, open face and half helmet. Reasonably priced too",4.0
"This Raider helmet bag is a basic no frills bag for keeping your helmet enclosed in a soft fleece lined enclosure (not heavily padded but adequate). With two zippers and two grab handles it makes it easy to hang on to your helmet while you transport it. This is probably the least expensive bag out there and it does the basic job I bought it for. I store my helmet 10mo. per year in the original box. The box is too large, bulky, and hard to grab. But when I dig them out of storage to move them into service for snowmobiling, I need an easy way to grab them up and keep them secure enough to haul to the cabin for the riding season. This bag does just that at a bargain price. Being somewhat careful, I don't need a hardshell or premium bag, just don't want to spend the extra for that. Protecting against scratches and small bumps, this bag does it for me. Also, my helmet is a 3X BV2S, rather large and bulky. This bag is much larger, with room for gloves, extra shield, or whatever. It folds up reasonably small as well. A solid four star performance.",4.0
"Big enough to fit a helmet with a snowcross-type visor, and it's padded well. The fabric seems a tad ""light weight"" but unless you're packing the bag across the country and back, it should be more than sufficient. Mine is used only for off season storage.",4.0
"I really love this little pond (it's 31 gallons) it's perfect for my small backyard. It took longer than the two hours mentioned to install, it took me the entire day. But, it was time well spent! You do need to add your own rocks and landscaping to 'pretty it up' but, that's the fun and creative part! I was a bit disappointed when the 'waterfall' didn't seem to make as much noise as I would have liked, I wanted to enjoy the sound of cascading water...but, not problem. I added a 'pond spitter' which not only gave me the sound I wanted, it also adds much visual interest! Adding the spitter was easy, I simply needed a diverter from the local garden center (about three dollars) and added it to the existing hose! I also added a solar powered spotlight to it, so it's just as enjoyable at night. I really am enjoying it, and would definitely reccommend this to anyone who always wanted a pond but has 'limited' space!",4.0
It is actually a really great pond but it took us a while to get the right depth in all of the various gradations.  We love it in the backyard.  Very soothing.,4.0
I needed to make some adjustments but overall serves it's purpose.,4.0
Great size for my yard but not that easy to install in the ground. Adding rocks will give you a better cascading water sound because the pump is as strong as it should be for a pond this size.,4.0
Works as advertised.,4.0
"Easy to use and mount. Water cooler was very secure and this bracket is solidly built.

This stool is very good.  I bought the Craftsman version because I was able to pick it up at Sears and save the shipping charge.  There are many similar kind and the only difference is the top cushion is a different color and has different logo's on it.  After I got mine I found one at Harbor Freight Tools for around $22.  I would recommend shopping around.,4.0
The seat is well made and works the way it should.  As good as any out there at a better price.,4.0
"It's a great pump but there is nothing telescoping about the suction pipe, It has to be cut to proper length. I would give it 5 stars except for the telescoping part",4.0

Fits like a hand in a glove.,4.0
excellent tool and not using tire spoon tools......,4.0
"I am rating this four stars for the price, if it wasn't so cheap to buy I would rate it lower. The biggest problems I have with this tire changer are related to the mount / dismount bar, the bar really should be longer for more leverage and for mounting the tire it tends to pull up from the rim. I saw one reviewer here modified theirs to make the mounting bar stay on the rim when installing a tire and I did so as well.",4.0
I think this will be a good tool. I haven't actually used it yet but it looks just as described. It is bound to be an improvement over changing those little tires with only a couple screw drivers.,4.0
Very good product.  Would have given it 5 stars except that it should maybe have some type groove in the handle to help hold it down on the rim when re-mounting the tires.,4.0
"I used this to change a tire on my lawn mower. It is a little tricky to use, but there are plenty of videos on youtube demonstrating the use of this little tire changer.  I high suggest watching them to get a better idea of how to use it.",4.0
Nice tool,4.0
"Good tire, had it mounted at local tire shop for $10 and worked great when I eventually had a flat on my trailer.",4.0
"This product works great for it's intended purpose - large dents that weren't created from a high-impact crash.  I accidentally kicked a large dent in my door by trying to kick it closed when my hands where full.  The dent was about the size of a youth soccer ball.  The heavy duty dent puller pulled it out within a few tries without using adhesive such as other products.  There is still evidence that the car was damaged (a ding mark), but it looks a helluva lot better than it did with a huge dent.  I had another dent from a high-impact accident I had with a deer and I got close to pulling it out but ultimately couldn't because the suction would release whenever i got close to pulling it out (although this dent was more serious and has been on my car for several years).  I highly recommend giving this product a try for low-impact, larger dents. I can't attest to how it works with small dings and dents but am guessing by that other products may be better for those because the size of this product's suction mouth is rather wide.",4.0
Bought this to pull large dents on motor vehicles.  Works as expected keeping in mind the size and range that this tool can handle.  Also I use this tool to handle large sheets of glass and as a helping hand during new/old window install/removal.  A little water on the rubber face of the tool will increase the holding power.  Recommended for DIY.,4.0
"Appears well made and water tight.  As others have noted, the clasp on the front is a little light-weight, but it will do.  The big thing to know is that the lid is not recessed, so the box must be mounted 1 3/8ths inches away from the trailer to allow enough space for the lid to open (I took one star off for this).  This might be a critical issue for you if your tongue jack doesn't clear the box enough to turn.  In my case, it was a very near thing and I considered returning the box.  However, I decided to keep it as it is the best light-weight option available for my application (the containment of batteries for my solar chargers).  If I get tired of rapping my knuckles  against the box when I work the jack, I will purchase a side-mount tongue jack.  Just take carful measurements to be sure it fits your application and allow for the extra setback from the trailer and you should be happy.",4.0
"Lots of storage. Not so easy to mount. All trailer tongues are not the same. Have to watch not to drill holes through your wire for your light while finding the proper place to mount. Overall, very pleased.",4.0
Works better for bigger dents that the suction cup can fit into. I was able to make the soccer ball sized dent into about a half dollar size. Its definitely nice in the suburban area i live since it seems my vehicles attract dent making objects!,4.0
"I wish I got this earlier, before the paint peeled of the edge of the dent. Worked perfectly first time.",4.0

"Used out of desperation and lack of money to get a dent in front hood in awkward place to have to use paintless dent remover pro, so tried this instead. Small impression of dent still in hood, but it looks much better and can be mistaken for a shadow now. I can deal with that. Worked very sturdy, did it myself as a not super buff woman in my 20s and felt the pull and heard and saw the pop out of dent.",4.0
Great for larger dents! I couldn't get the smaller ones out though. The car at least looks better until I can get a new quarter panel.,4.0
This suction cup has great suction and can pull out almost any dent if you have the pulling power to use it.,4.0

"I bought a new 18ft aluminum utility trailer in June 2016 to mainly haul restored John Deere lawn tractors to shows and of course use it for other hauling also. I quickly found out I needed a tool storage box that could be mounted on the tongue for all the tie downs, jack and handle, dolly wheel, lug wrench, breakaway emergency trailer brakes battery and all the other things that's needed when traveling with a trailer. I ordered this box from Amazon because the dimensions seemed to be such that it would fit the trailer tongue very well. When it arrive and had the chance to install it, the tongue fit was perfect. The only downside is that I wished it had been made about a 1/16th inch thicker, it does seem to be a bit ""light weight"" as far as thickness. I've only had it on for about 3 months now, so time will tell if it's built for long life. I gave it a 4 star only because I think it needs to be a tad heavier in construction.",4.0
I bought this for my trailer. It's ok for what I'm doing (as long as it doesn't leak) the lid is a nice solid plastic but the sides and bottom are a little flimsier than I'd like to see I re-enforced the bottom with metal bar stock you can find at most hardware stores,4.0
"Too big to use on the dent I had, but I did help out a friend in a recent accident.  Worked well, just be sure that the dent is large enough before purchasing this item (must be at least the size of a small dinner plate)",4.0

It didn't wok on the dent I had on my car but maybe The dent was bigger than what this tool can handle. I am sure it would work on smaller dents but it did not work on mine.,4.0
"It did a good job fixing a large dent on my car. You can still see a crease but it looks much better. It also didn't do anything on smaller dents on my car.

"Takes out larger dents pretty well, but not effective on smaller dents. Sturdy product.",4.0
"I purchased this item after reviewing some positive results in this forum.  My daughter's car had a dent (approximately 10"" diameter) on the right front fender of her Honda Accord because women can't drive in a straight line.  So, I took the vehicle to the local ""reputable"" repair shop for an estimate.  Having been there before they gave a real ""deal"" on the estimate for approx $900.00.  They were to repair the dent, prime, sand and paint and polish to match the car.  I thanked them for their kind estimate and thought this item (dent puller) would be worth a try.  Well, after immediately receiving the item, I gave it a try.  I must say I am completely satisfied with the results.  I attached the suction cup to the damaged area of the vehicle and popped out the dent, leaving only a small portion unchanged.  So the result was, I removed 90% of the dent for about $10.00.  THe remaining 10% of the dent is completely unnoticeable unless you know where to look, so I'm pleased with the results.  The only reason I gave this item 4 stars was because I had to use it two or three times to achieve the results I was satisfied with.  In any event, I recommend trying this before you pay the local Body & Fender guy a ton of money.  It's fast and easy to use, just clean the area for maximized suction, after attaching the dent puller, pull straight out and ""POP!"" there, you're done!!!  My non-driving daughter loves me, my wife (another bad driver) loves me and my wallet loves me, I'm a happy man : )",4.0
"I bought this about two weeks ago and received it in great condition. I was skeptical about this product but after pulling a decent size dent out of my car, I was pretty impressed with the suction power. I had a pretty decent creased dent, basically two dents in my driver door. After going to the body shop and getting the damage appraised at $1,500.00 I decided to take my own route. So, I came online looking for something a little cheaper to repair damages myself. First, I had my eye on the glue dent puller but after some reviews I looked a little further and ran across this product. The reviews looked good and it was a lot cheaper than the glue puller so I ran with it. I received the package in a timely manner and in great condition in its original packaging and Northern Tool & Equipment even sends a huge catalog of products with your order so you get to see all their cool little gadgets, prices aren't bad either. Anyway I pulled the big dent out of my car with 1 tug and did my best with the other. With a little determination and the right placing I pulled the whole thing out pretty well. This thing saved me $1,470.00 I could have wasted at a body shop. I mean its not perfect but I'm not driving around with a huge dent in my door anymore and the damage now is minimal compared to before. Great product and seller",4.0
"I had an 18"" dent right above the driver side's rear tire.  Looks like someone was trying to pull in and hit me.  Goes to show you some people these days will drive away rather then leave a note.  I looked this up on amazon and decided to give it a try.  To my surprise it worked like a charm.  I'm quite happy and would recommend this to anyone trying to remove a large dent.",4.0
"Good suction power, good handle, good de-suction mechanism. The reason why i gave only 4 stars is bcoz you can repair only large dents with it. They should have included smaller ones for small dents which is very common on vehicles.",4.0
"Heavy-duty, well-made, especially for the price. Works best on wide & shallow dents, tho it takes a lot of strength -- but that's because it works. A clean, wet surface is best, but that also means a tendency to slide off the target at the last moment. I would buy it again for large dents without grooves.",4.0
"Fine and dandy box, a little light duty. Great for the price though! I knocked a star off because this is the only thing I've ever ordered from amazon that showed up late.",4.0
Easy to install with self-tapping screws.  Decent quality.  Will keep tie-downs and supplies dry.  For the money you can't really beat it.,4.0
Used this on my passenger side fender to get dent out of quarter panel worked great....my dent had a slight bend whcih remained but i couldn't really expect more.  definitely does the job as is well made.  can see many uses for it.....worth the cost definitely,4.0
"Had a soccer ball sized dent from backing into a pole - on rear bumper pass-side at the curve of the bumper. The dent puller pulled this out, it was creased (the dent ) which when pulled out left a remainder: a linear ""ding"". This I believe is due to the location of the dent on a curved portion of the bumper.

However, for $30 (including tax & shipping) it did what it was expected to do very well. A bit of touch up paint and looks like a small ding/ cart accident - before was a crater (soccer ball sized, apx 3 inches deep at maximum depth).

For comparison to future shoppers this bumper is fiberglass composite. (Not rubber/ metal)
Prior tried the plastic suction which would not stick (also by Northern supply).

Overall - recommend if you do not want to drop upwards of $800 on a perfect repair. Will not fix cosmetic problems like scratch or remainder crease but will make a large dent less horrific. Overall saves about $150 off a sloppy pullout job.",4.0
"I used this dent puller to try and remove the dents out of a refrigerator door.  Unfortunately, it didn't work, but it wouldn't work on most fridges due to their metal-over-foam door construction, which I learned about only after purchasing this puller.

That said, I was very satisfied with my purchase.  I liked the heavy-duty steel-and-rubber construction.  You could probably drive a car over it and it would not break. My only complaint was that the rubber suction cup left a thin film on the metal that you were trying to pull, which was a little tough to remove.

I could see myself owning this puller for a very long time.  It was more expensive than the others, but one of the best available on Amazon.  I would recommend it for anyone looking for a dent puller that will last them for years.  In this case, you really get what you pay for.",4.0
This product has a ton of suction power.  Works really well on large dents.  Did okay on a small dent but did better on the large one.  I'm glad I purchased this product.,4.0
"I was tired of looking at the dent on my car and decided to give this dent puller a try.  As soon as it arrived (and it arrived right on time), I pushed it against the dent and pulled.

Recommendation: Use this if the dent is just an indent and the metal did not actually bend.",4.0
This surprisingly worked on pulling out shopping cart dents on my 2007 Mercury Milan.  My car apparently attracts shopping carts.  I had about 4 of them and the suction sucked it right out...,4.0
"I got a huge dent on side of my door and tried using this product to fix it, or at least make it look better.  I got some of the dent out and still working on rest of it.  Meanwhile, few issues/tips.

1. You definitely need a good amount of strength to use this!  Also, wearing gloves help since it puts a lot of strain on your fingers as you're pulling with all your might (in my case anyway).
2. The dent doesn't come out at once in my experience. So, you have to use it several times to get it out.
3. Clean the surface of the dent for better suction.  I haven't tried it yet, but slightly dampening might improve the suction as well.",4.0
"this dent puller pulled my dent out in 2 seconds i couldn't stop smiling from it and im glad i invested every penny into it. i advise anyone to buy this for medium to large dents, but not small, but other than that its awesome! TWO THUMBS UP! =)",4.0
"I received the dent puller within about a week. It came with instructions, but to a completely different system. The tool was easy to figure out though, and no instructions were actually needed. The dent I pulled was right on a body line of my car, but the tool still managed to remove most of the dent. The dent is still visible, but it is now quite minor. The tool does not work on wavy dents caused by rubbing up against something. Nonetheless, the product exceeded my expectations and was well worth the money I paid.",4.0
"Provides an excellent grip.  Good for pulling non-creased dents from car panels, which is what I purchased it for.  I can see other uses for it around the house as well.",4.0
The Product worked well for my dent very strong i would recommend it for any large dent on a car,4.0
"Worked great, took out a large dent in my hood that would've cost $1,000 to fix (bodyshop said hood needed to be replaced).  Hood isn't 100% fixed, but the small remaining dent isn't noticeable unless you are close to the car.  Will probably buy a smaller dent puller to attempt to fix the remaining damage in the future, but this works for now.",4.0
"I had two dents in my car, and now I have one.  The dent that was successfully pulled was about 18"" in diameter and shallow with no crease... It was the classic butt on the hood that wouldn't pop itself out for a year...  That dent came out with no problem.  The other dent was about 12"" and is a bit deeper.  It's on a rear quarter panel.  The dent puller made that dent into a 10"" dent, a bit shallower than before.  Overall, I really wasn't expecting much, but this suction cup is incredibly strong.  I am satisfied, despite still having one dent left to go.",4.0
"Really like this helmet. It fits great. I was worried about sizing issues due to other comments, but had no issues. I wear a large helmet and ordered a large. When it arrived I put it on and it fit perfectly. Not too loose not too tight, but the perfect snugness you want from a helmet. The only complaint I have is that the visor snaps aren't that great. It's difficult sometimes to get them lined up and when you think it is snapped securely it's not, but when you do get them snapped properly it stays on just fine.",4.0

"This is a modest car cover. The material is single layer fabric. I appreciate that there are two big grommets on the bottom of the car cover. On a windy day, you can use these to attach a length of twine under your car. A length of cheap twine is included.

I cannot find anything that would scratch my car, except *maybe* those grommets. The car cover fit my little Hyundai Elantra OK, but it looks rather baggy in places. On a windy day, you will need to use twine (or similar) with those grommets.

The included carrying case is useless. It is at least three times too small.

I use this car cover to defend against large quantities of guano and moderate quantities of tree sap and pine needles. Adequate, barely. A giant owl dropping would probably soak through.

Three suggestions:

If you cannot find a size that matches your brand new car, then search for the same make and model of car, but one year old. I had to do this to find a match for my ride.

Find a colorful ribbon and attach it to the grommet that will hang near the driver's side door of your car. When deploying the car cover, you can look for this ribbon. You will then avoid trying to fit the cover backwards or sideways.

If you are going to secure the car cover against wind with the grommets and twine, then go find yourself a little key fob or something similar. It need not be big or heavy, but it should be made out of something that will not scratch your car. Keep this object tied to one end of your twine. You can toss this object under your car when using the car cover. It makes the job easy.",4.0
"This set of three triangles is a very useful must-have in all automobiles. The triangles themselves seem pretty sturdy and compact. The base appears to be heavy enough to support the triangle out in the open. The box is a little flimsy though, especially in the latches that secure the lid in place. It could also use a handle for easy lifting. However, this is a minor issue for an item that is hopefully going to spend most (if not all) its life in the back of your car!",4.0
"This is a good product with 3 quality high visibility warning triangles.  The bases are heavy and the triangles fold out to size and orientation to prevent tipping over next to wind created by traffic.  The case is another matter and after opening I am unable to get the latches to catch thus the 4 stars since the case is part of what the description sells.  However toss the case since the price is reasonable enough for 3 quality reflectors.

A good item I hope I don't have to use soon.",4.0
"Absolutely a critical safety item to carry in everything from private cars to commercial vehicles.  They fold up nicely and pack three into a 5""x5""x18"" box that easily fits into your trunk.  The bases are heavy (filled with sand) and not likely to blow over.  The only reason I didn't give them five stars is that the latches on the carry box are plastic and really aren't strong enough for the job.  One of mine was broken (the triangles were fine, just the carry case latches).  No problem, I just wrapped some heavy rubber bands around the box and tossed it into the trunk.

I liked them enough I bought four sets for all my family.",4.0

"First the good; these triangles are definitely worth the money, I recently had to use them for the first time to help out a friend of mine who hit a deer so what I was impressed about them was how heavy the black base at the bottom of each triangle is, whatever is inside them is pretty dense, with cars going 50 to 70 miles past them, they didn't move. The orange is very bright and the red reflective pieces are definitely well made and highly refractive. The storage of the 3 triangles is also pretty neat, they fit inside a red box that is a little bigger than a foot and 5 inches wide, so they definitely do not take up a lot of space. On the other hand though when I first opened the box when I went to help out my friend, the triangles were all lightly coated in this dust of varying colors, I'm not sure if this is from the manufacturing process or that the bases are leaking the material but I had to clean them at the spot. So as a note I would recommend that you check them when you receive, I made the mistake of just getting the box and putting them in the truck of my car.",4.0
"Wish the box it was stored in had a label. So people looking to break into my car, wouldn't be curious about what's inside the box.",4.0
"These are heavier than I expected, but that is good.  They are sturdy and deploy easily, my only minor gripe is that the legs have to be bent back somewhat before they will unfold.  If you were to unfold them without bending them first, they are going to break.  This wasn't a problem when I tried them at home in good light, but I could see if my first attempt was by the side of the road in the dark the legs would break off.",4.0

"I wanted to comment on a few things about the triangles since receiving them in case anyone else has the same questions.  The triangles do come in the red carrying box which is nice since it can be stored easily and visibily in the car.  Ours fits easily underneath a row of our suv.  I do wish the latch on the box was a little sturdier but only because the triangles are quite heavy which is good.  The triangles are already assembled and simply need to be unfolded to set up, quick fold up and fold down for use.  The red sides of the triangles are actually a reflective plastic just like a reflector on a bicycle so they are quite visible at night if say a headlight shined on them.",4.0
"Ordered this because of a road trip across country I took.  Fortunately, there was no reason for me to have to use this item but it is very well made.  It is much heavier than I was expecting but well worth the added insurance if needing to be seen on the side of the road at night.  While on the road I saw many truck drivers using these triangles at night while they slept.",4.0
"I haven't actually used them, but purchased them to keep in my car should an emergency arise.  NOTE:  I didn't pay attention to the package weight (it doesn't matter to me), but they're really heavy.  I'm sure this means they'll be durable and not tip over should I need to use them.",4.0
"The triangles themselves are fine, but the storage box arrived with a broken latch and the triangles do not fit well in it.  The box needs to be a little larger.",4.0

"Only had to use it once and I was very satisfied with it.  The triangles seem very sturdy and withstand the wind drag from the highway well. The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the box for storing it is not well made. Once the box is open it is very hard to close it, as a matter of fact, it will not fully close. The Triangles by itself get 5 stars though.",4.0

"As already stated by others, it's a mixed bag.  The markers themselves are great: with a heavy enough base to not blow over. Actually, surprisingly heavy. The only minus is the plastic box they're stored in (which others have remarked about): lid won't close most of the time and the plastic is a little light weight for such heavy items. But: it's bright red (a good idea).  I got a couple of bungee cords to wrap around the box: one to hold it shut, the other to anchor it in place in the trunk.  Voila, perfection!!",4.0

"Well designed to fold down to size of a toolbox. Very visible but also quite heavy, ended up taking one out to put in my other car.",4.0
I closely examined a couple of different safety triangles on the market and these appear to be of the highest quality.  They are heavy and for the most part that is a good thing (they don't fall over with big rigs etc going by) but it also adds to the shipping. The tabs that interlock the top of the triangle appear that they will hold up well. Look carefully at the shipping costs it can almost double the price even when going with the cheapest shipping method.,4.0
"On the plus side, they seem heavy and sturdy, and less likely to topple over when in use.

On the minus side, they're bleepin' heavy, took a lot of effort to transport up and down several flights of stairs to get them into my car, take up a fair deal of space (I have a 2010 Nissan Altima Coupe, and while I think it's a sexy car, the trunk space is laughable), and weigh down my car... But safety first!

I like that it comes with a case. The case doeesn't seem to be too sturdy, though.

"I purchased this to have a place to put my trimmers inside my enclosed landscape trailer. It has room for 3 trimmers, and removes them from the wall enough so they are not touching the wall.  What holds the trimmers in places is a 1/4"" spring loaded lever that presses against the trimmers shaft.  The spring on the trimmer rack and the lever lock thing is heavy duty enough that it will last.  I was about to post this review and give it 5 out of 5 but I noticed after a few days of using it and driving around a little bit I could see that there was wear marks where the trimmers shaft was being held into place, I put about 3 rounds of electrical tape on the shaft in a 2 inch swath and it seemed to resolve the issue.",4.0

"It is a good concept, mounted it as directed on the inside of one of our mow trailers. After a week or so of use, the motor side fell off the wall. These trailers bounce going down the road, and the vibration with bouncing took it down. The only flaw here was that the bolts were not able to anchor to anything. I bought some different anchors and welded a hook plate to the top so it has the ability to hang on the top of the wall and become attached to the board on the wall. The trimmers hang well, just wish they did not spin. I will be going to the drawing board to figure that part out.",4.0

"Fit-wise this was perfect. But it didn't last 2 months. Granted, the husband didn't read the description closely enough and didn't see that it wasn't meant for outdoor use... so with the Arizona sun, it completely degraded and tore apart within 2 months. It would hold up much better as an indoor cover (as it's meant to be), but definitely not for a constant outdoor cover.",4.0

"Overall this was a great product. I use it for my 2015 Dodge Charger that sits out in the sun.

Pros:
- The fit is snug and seems custom I don't see this cover flying off that easily in the wind.
- the polyproplyene material is fairly thick but lightweight as well. The covers material is comparable to a reusable grocery tote bag.  it doesn't seem cheaply made and is solid for the price point
- This might be small to some but it has a label indicating which side is the front or back makes it easier to put it on and be consistent with it

Cons:
- It doesn't cover the car completely on all sides like the picture shows. It goes down to about the midway point on my rims and doesn't go all the way down to my exhaust in the back. It essentially covers about 85% of my car.
-  Could be a little better at deflecting dust still have dust on my car after removing it but my car stays outside by dirt so its not that big of a deal
-  It hasn't rained in a while the beauty of living in California but I don't see this cover protecting that much considering that polypropylene isn't water resistant although the material tends to dry fast.

"This appears to be a well-made product, and the other reviews make me think it performs well -- with one BIG problem: the pressure indicator rod is spring loaded, and only sticks out when the gauge is on the tire valve.  As soon as you remove it from the valve, the rod snaps back and you can no longer read the pressure. This may be a feature of a water-pressure gauge, but it make the gauge almost useless for reading auto tire pressure, especially in dim light or when the tire valve is close to the ground.  This characteristic is not listed in the description. I am returning it, and looking for a gauge in which the pressure-indicator rod stays out after the gauge is removed from the valve.",4.0

Since I ordered two filters I bought four 1in to 3/4 in. reducers that I do not need.

Pro: the filter is of very good quality, I dropped it onto a Concrete Floor, I thought there goes a good filter but it did not break. I have a home made, two wheel trailer that just sets around. I have to drive fifteen miles just to get five gallons of Fuel. Driving that far costs $3.60 for the vehicle that I am driving to pick up Fuel. I have three Tractors, a Bulldozer and a Backhoe. So I decided to buy two 55 gallon Barrels from Amazon, two electric pumps two Filters and have my own filling station. Now I can take the trailer to the Filling Station and have Diesel and Gasoline both on hand. I am waiting for the Barrels to come in. The filter will not allow Water to pass through. Water is heavier than fuel and will drop to the bottom of the Filter. There is a valve to drain it out. If the Filter gets full it will shut of the fuel so no water can get into your engine. If there is solid Contamination you can see it in the filter.",4.0

"I liked this car cover and think it is perfect for those that don't live around a lot of trees or plan to use this while car is still in a garage or under a car port. It does well to protect your vehicle from Bird droppings, wind and light dust. If you live in an area with a lot of pollen in the Spring months then it will not keep your car from getting dusted. It will reduce the amount but even after removing car cover you will see significant coverage.
Its not heavy so unless you snug the cover around your car parts to prevent the wind from catching it, can be blown off your car under heavy wind without you knowing it. Does offer some protection from tree sap. Again I wouldn't recommend this cover if you live under lot of trees as if they sap a lot you will find spots where it will seep through.

"I used this polish on the headlights and stone guards on a Porsche after buffing them with Meguiar's M17 plastic cleaner:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meguiar-s-M17-Mirror-Glaze-Clear-Plastic-Cleaner-8-oz/dp/B0000AXMD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meguiar's M17 Mirror Glaze Clear Plastic Cleaner - 8 oz.</a>. M10 with a PC7424 and orange LC pad really shined up the headlights and stone guards, but it just isn't strong enough to remove heavier marring, oxidation, or scratches. The very small scratches and marring on the stone guards were removed very well and the guards in particular were brought back to their original shine. Before polishing with M10 the guards had a dull luster to them that contrasted quite poorly with the highly polished paint around them. After polishing with M10 the guards blend far better with the paint around them.

Overall I am satisfied M10 did what it was intended to do, but for deep marring or oxidation you will need to step up to a compound like Meguiars M105 or even a full headlight restoration kit. I highly recommend the 3M headlight restoration kit (see my detailed review on this kit):&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3M-39008-Headlight-Lens-Restoration-System/dp/B001AIZ5HY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3M 39008 Headlight Lens Restoration System</a>",4.0
"Meguiar's consistently provides some of the very best consumer products and I know this from an owner of two car detailing shops who uses pro products and told me this, besides using their products myself for years. But let me tell you what I found out about this one.

I used it on several things, but I purchased it mainly for the LCD screens on my testing equipment and a fish finder, because of many hazy spots, most likely from rubbing while packed and traveling. But I don't recall using this product before and that was what was important in the end, and why reviews can be important.

Polishes normally remove just a tiny bit of what you use them on through the abrasives in them, and I don't feel any in this with it between my thumb and forefinger. So I didn't have high hopes for the tiny scratches that I would like to remove also, but the hazy look seemed possible.

I went at it four times for a pretty long time each, maybe 15 minutes altogether and my results were very poor. I must need two steps more abrasive and then this, to remove what the more abrasive product will leave behind, because this did so little. But for my purpose,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meguiar-s-G2000/dp/B00P9OF04I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meguiar's G2000</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/G3000/dp/B004HCOE72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">G3000</a>&nbsp;would likely work better. Really though, unless I need it for my headlights also, I should look to another brand because these otherwise fine products are just a bit more and more expensive than what I need.

I ended up trying UltraBrite toothpaste and then this product afterwards and the results were much better. Another toothpaste might even work better, who knows? While the toothpaste didn't get it all, using it before this I actually saw results when this all alone did very little, so there you go. I just used a corner of a washcloth, but I'm considering my Braun electric toothbrush before I take my Dremel tool to some of them.

Anyway, always test a spot that won't matter first, but this is a good product to use after toothpaste. It just does a very fine polish to remove the tiniest of scratches and did little on the haze on my screens from rubbing while they were packed and transported.

So I recommend this product if you don't have much of a problem to start with.",4.0

Initial review...
There are two metal plates that form the foundation of this device, all other parts bolt to one of two included ""main plates"".  If you look at
the photo, you'll see them.  There are four holes drilled into each plate. If you observe carefully, you'll see the bottom two holes are aligned on both the left and right bracket.  Unfortunately the top two holes can be clearly observed to not be aligned between the left and right bracket.  The Loadhandler cannot be assembled with the main plates supplied. Naturally I recycled the packing box two days ago. I've got a call into the 800 number but naturally they are closed on the weekend.

I'll modify the rating if I have a positive experience with their tech support but this never should have ever happened.",4.0
"We hauled a load of heavy, damp leaf mulch (about 2 cu yards) today using this Loadhandler.  It shortened the off-loading from 5 hours to 1 hour.  It took an hour because after off-loading using the Loadhandler there was still mulch around the wheel wells & near the cab AND we also spent some time raking & placing the mulch b/c we couldn't back the truck into the exact location we needed the mulch.  If we could have just off-loaded it into the right spot, it probably would have taken half an hour or less.  It's great & I hope it lasts many mulching seasons for us. :)",4.0

"This works, but the ""easily unloads your 3000 lbs load in 30 seconds"" isn't totally true when you add in needing to set up the ideal conditions needed as well the load capacity being less than you may expect. I got the 2000 lbs version when my brother ask if I'd help him get a bunch of fill dirt for his yard. It did help with emptying the truck bed more quickly, but it isn't making things as easy as if you'd added a hydraulic dump (as they may try to make you think it is).  The only real difference in this one and the 2000 is the mounting brackets, this one has steel plates with ball bearings, the 2000 was plastic.  The 2000 brackets was only 1 high max where the tarp rides and had a smooth taper up to the pipe area, this one has steel plates sticking 3 inches strait up right at the tailgate edge (which will be a ""snag"" for my added tarp, see below).

This is pretty much a 4 foot wide woven ""tarp"" that gets wound up on a pipe on the end of the tail gate to ""conveyor belt"" things to your tail gate. The crank handle is just a flat bar that slides in a slot cut in the pipe (which easily falls out of the slot when you're not holding it) and has a bolt with a plastic sleeve as the actual ""handle"". I have a plastic bed liner where this tarp rides fine on it, but if you have a spray-in liner I'm not sure if it would work well since they are like ""sandpaper"" and the woven tarp would likely snag on it (see their ""double mat"" for use with it if you have such).

When I used it, I'm almost sure now that I overloaded it, so my tail gate now has indentations where the brackets for the pipe were (despite the rubber in them to cushion it). Also the plastic mount brackets (2000 lbs model) have pulled off of the tail gate when first starting to pull the load off of the truck (because it was easier for the pipe to move toward the load instead of the load move to the pipe), so I've had to have someone help hold them down as I start winding it. Note; this one has a strap to go to the bumper on each bracket, so that should help hold them in place (the 2000 had a strap for 1 side).  Perhaps the overloading seems like my wrong-doing, but they do say ""helps you with hauling, rock, dirt, & much more"" even showing that in the ad pictures. A full size truck like mine can easily end up with ~4000 lbs load and how do you know just by eyeballing it what the weight is? Running some math now, to keep a load of dirt under 2000 lbs even with pretty dry soil (that is said to be about 75lbs per cubic yard with wet soil being over 100lbs), in a 8 X 4 foot bed you need to get only a 10 inch high load and that is about 1/2 the height of most beds. I can understand it being hard to engineer something for a full bed load, but if it's to be used for such things as they say & show who wants to only get 1/2 what they could in each trip? The pictures do show the peak of the load just at the bed height with very little on the sides, but is that what you're likely to get when at the nursery?

I found it helpful to use a typical tarp on top of this units ""tarp"" to try to have an easier way to gather the dirt from the corners, funnel the dirt into a wheel barrow while unloading, cover the load while on the road, and keep the dirt out of this units woven fabric. When it's time to unload, I first need to dig out the area in front of and behind the wheel wells (throwing that dirt onto the tail gate partly to help weigh it down). If I don't do that, any dirt that's between the cab and those wheel wells makes it seem like the load is hitting a wall where it's impossible to wind this up. Again, the pictures show the perfect pile centered in the truck (with almost nothing going into those sides), but after you've driven very far (going over some bumps etc) it will probably have shifted to the sides making you have to dig them out.  If I don't dig out behind the wheel wells, then the dirt near the edges can snag my tarp on the brackets as well as the trucks tailgate cables.

Also when preparing to get a load, I extend this units tarp so it not only comes off the pipe down across the full bed, but also have it go back up the bed wall along the cab. That makes it so as the load is being pulled toward the back and some dirt falls toward the cab, the extra couple feet of tarp will catch that dirt and bring it along with the rest.  Someone else also suggested putting some ""folds"" in the tarps to make it so you pull part of the load first, then more as the ""folds"" pull out.  That may work to some extent, but I doubt you have enough tarp for very many or very big folds.",4.0

I have used this style before and they last a long time. Only reason why it wasn't a 5 star rating was becauce the tool came about 5 PSI out of spec. The tool I learned can be calibrated yourself fairly easily. I couldn't find a youtube video on it but the procedure is pretty strait forward you will have to disassemble the gauge portion of the tool. Just compare the readings to a known good tire gauge after each adjustment untill they read the same. The only tools I used were a medium sized and a pocket sized screw driver.  NOTE: It is probably a good idea to calibrate this at about the middle of max and min pressures.,4.0

I have been struggling with my RV's rear tires for years.  Inflating them have always been a challenge.  This tool makes the job so much easier.  My only gripe is the gauge.  It doesn't match the reading I get with the Milton straight-foot gauge.  So I don't know which is right.,4.0
"The quality was impressive.  Pretty much the same inflator used in good service stations.

The only negative was that if the tire pressure was too low, or totally deflated, the check valve in the chuck diverted all the air to the unused port.  I disassembled the chuck, and freed up the check valve ball, and then it would inflate a deflated tire.  If the air shoots out the unused port, a slight tap of the chuck is enough to cause the check valve to block the port, and it works fine.",4.0

I find this to be a far superior solution to buying one more expensive, heavier car cover - I've tried those and they start to disintegrate as soon as the summer sun hits my car.",4.0
Replaced a different brand cover that fell apart in a year. This is being used outside in direct sunlight. Arrived quickly and fits my 89 LX hatchback Mustang perfectly. We'll see how it holds up!,4.0

This is the second light weight cover I have used.  I use it in my garage to keep the cats from leaving footprints all over my car.  I simply pull it off hang it on a hook at the front of the car every time I drive out and come back in reverse the process by keeping my car covered always . Works great.  I wouldn't recommend it for outside in wet weather where it freezes for that cover can stick to the car and tear easily when you pull it off.  That is why I have had tears in it during the winter months coming in and put it on a wet car then it freezes .  Really well done for the money though and makes a good fit .,4.0

This cover fits my 1994 Camaro Z28 JUST BARELY! But it does cover it end to end,4.0

"Used this on my swim goggles in the pool and it does help. A very SMALL bottle, but it seems to help make water bead up more",4.0
Helps reduce stuck bugs on glass but creates a bit of glare at night. Has kept the windshield glass cleaner longer than I remember from use years ago.,4.0
"I used it to shade my car in the summer. I could leave the windows down and cover the car. I used a lock and cable to secure it--not perfect, but adequate. I now am using it to protect a fixer-upper for my grandkids. Knowing it is not waterproof, I layered a cheap plastic drop cloth over the car (with sunroof and window stuck open), then ""locked"" the cover in place. Perfect? No. Good enough? It has more than paid for itself just as shade, and is bonus for the junker.",4.0
Great Covers,4.0

"Product is nice and light and easy to put on and remove from my classic 1962 Corvette. Cover is a bit too big for my car, but it is used to keep the dust off in my garage only.",4.0
NOT BAD!,4.0
"For the low cost, not a bad cover at all. Fit my midsize sedan just fine and didn't blow off (without using the tie downs even!). Useful and practical for the cost.

UPDATE: Six months later and I still like this cover, especially for the price. Had to order another one now though as the elastic wore out and cover won't stay on anymore. Still, worth it at this cost.",4.0
Better than non-working blades. Water didn't sit in my view.,4.0
It WORKS! Delivered intact and on time.,4.0
"Takes a little bit to put on in cold, keeps from icing up though",4.0
First time ever using rain-x. I've been amazed at how easy the rain and water slides off. I like having crystal clear glass and was afraid this might leave some residue but I've been pleasantly surprised at how clean it has stayed.,4.0

"Overall this is a pretty great product, but I think they have changed the formula over the years or something.  This product works great but wears off very quickly.  If you live in a very rainy climate, you will find yourself reapplying this once a week or so.",4.0

Came off once in the wind one of the grommets came out before I used it the first time. I wish it had more of them so that I could tie it on better.,4.0

Great price. But did not cover all the way down to the tires. Rain does get in. Not a lot  I still like it,4.0
"Horrible!!  Don't waste the few bucks, disintegrated in less then one month, literally turned to powder (top) where sun bakes!
Pure crap!!!  Buy a multi layer cover!",4.0
"I like this product but I'm too lazy to do it every month or so!

The rain does bead off the window but not as much as I had hoped and definitely less at lower speeds. At high speeds, rain tends to come off your windshield of its own accord but it definitely beads off the windshield more cleanly and completely with this product applied.

I think that the video that I saw for this was a perfect condition video and immediately after application or something because as usual, the real life experience was a bit less. Never-the-less, when recently applied, like within the last couple of weeks and at sufficient speed, it is impressive.

I guess I don't have quite enough rain where I live to ""encourage"" me to take the significant amount of time and effort to do this process. And there's that. It really is kind of a chore that will take over an hour of hard work to perform. I have a lot going on in my life so I guess that's another reason I haven't done it again after the first time.

To me, this is a 'meh' product,  a nice to do if you really feel inclined but not absolutely necessary.",4.0
"I have always used Rain-X products in the past because they work, and this is no exception.  I applied this product to my windows on all my vehicles and it hasn't let me down.  Paired with Rain-X windshield wipers and Rain-X cleaner, you have a great product.

The rain truly does bead up when applied properly.  Also it helps to prevent ice build up on my windshield in the winter.  I would definitely recommend!",4.0
Easy application and works great! Makes it much easier to see when driving in the rain.,4.0

"Easy to apply and works very well, though it seems it never lasts as long once applied as it should.",4.0
"Only been in one rain storm so far, worked well and application was not that bad, clean glass is paramount for said application so you want to have a clear view in sunlight or oncoming cars at night. So spent the time to do it right, you won't be sorry.",4.0
I had been given the advice to thoroughly clean the glass doors on my shower then to treat them with this- and what do you know? It really works. Keeps the soap scum and water stains at bay and makes all my scrubbing not in vain! Great for the car of course too!,4.0
Seems like it is working.  I used it for my glass shower.  But I also bought a squeeze.  So I use it right after.  But now I do not gt any soap scum on my glass shower.,4.0

"This was the 2nd tongue jack I purchased in 2 years. The first was a Fulton 1200 lbs jack that lasted 13 months before it froze up and died, despite being rinsed off with fresh water after every use. This Dutton Lainson has a much smoother operation and appears to be a higher quality unit than the more expensive Fulton.",4.0
"though rain goes right through it.  When the tree pollen hits it and then rain, the pollen will sorta seem through and leave some marks on the truck.  Not great, but better than the huge amount of needles I would have otherwise gotten.  So I am happy. Also the cover will not pack down easily into the bag provided. So plan on someting for that if you have a need.  otherwise, it fit nice on the tundra (with canopy) and looked good. never came off in wind.",4.0
We needed something to cover our car when we stored it in our dusty barn and also to keep the cats from tracking dirt all over the car.  This cover is light weight and easy to put on the car.,4.0

"Came quickly, fit perfectly. Easy to put on the Blazer that I bought it for. It looks nice in grey. It came with a bag for storage, and had tabs on the cover ""front"" and ""back,"" for easy application. I have little experience with other covers but this one suited my needs perfectly, and was the least expensive of the options for this vehicle.",4.0
I can never find this in the store anyone. Stores always have the 2 in 1 rain-x. This stuff really works great on your car. I tried this in my shower where I have a glass door as I saw this as a life hack to help cut down on the cleaning of the glass door. The water doesn't shed off like it does on a windshield.,4.0
It's a cheap cover .  I use this to put over my nicer cover as it helps prevent sun rot.  Cheaper to replace this every year.,4.0
