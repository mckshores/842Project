Nowhere I found to write a message.,2.0
"Its a gift card what can you say, but the gift box it came in looked as though it had been drop on the floor and kicked around and then shipped.",2.0
"Disappointed in the condition of the box. The ribbon was flattened and dusty and the white box had some brown sticky stuff on it.  Since it is a gift, I expected it to be in better condition.",2.0
"This was for a wedding gift and the white box had what looked to be yellow food spots on it. I was able to clean off 3 spots, but not one of the larger spots.",2.0
I purchased the giftcard for my sister for Mothers Day. Didn't receive it until two weeks later.....THANKS!,2.0
"Please add the name and Billing address while sending gift card. Otherwise how people are supposed to find out who sent the gift card?
And also allow us to send a short message like Happy Birthday!! or Happy Anniversary!!!!",2.0
"The boxes where scratched and stained. Not nice at all. It is a gift card, and when you give a gift, you expect it to be impeccable.",2.0
Box was not as nice as it looks on line.,2.0
Bad packaging. Box has some kind of stains (may be printed receipt ink marks).,2.0
"Boxes dirty, scuffed and not gift-worthy. How badly can you mess up a box. Jeesh! We bought 4 and the boxes were all marked up and dirty. I can't even wipe it off.",2.0
"The box was a used one... had some note that someone tried to erase, looked dirty. We were not able to use the box for the gift, just tossed it out. The card itself was fine.",2.0
"Got to me withing 24 hours but the gift box had sticky stuff on it, and some dirt on the inside where the card is held.",2.0
The gift box it came in looked cruddy like it had been used before...I'll have to buy a new gift card box because it is not acceptable to give someone.,2.0
"I bought a $100 gift card for my mother last year for Christmas and for some reason, they are having trouble getting it connected with her email account and she still, 11 months later, has not been able to use it.  They continue to charge her credit card.  I've never seen anything like this.  My mother is  82 and she has called them several times to no avail.  She had to change her email and apparently they can't seem to get the change made so that it is associated with than new email. They continue to tell her on each call that they have it straighten out and each time she orders they charge her credit card.  I have even called when I was visiting in September and was told that they had it straighten out but they still do not!!",2.0
there gift cards come on.,2.0
"It is pretty much as pictured, and would be a lovely presentation, but the box was dirty, and not in a way that it could be cleaned.  I would not order this again.",2.0
Never recieved promotion 10$ amazon code or credit.,2.0
"The gift card was fine but the gift box it was in was DIRTY.  There wasn't time to return it.  I couldn't give it in the box as a gift, which ruined the whole presentation.  I am very disappointed.  I have never had this happen before.  I usually love the Amazon shopping experience.",2.0
Gifts card was fine but I didn't get the promised 10$ bonus back after the promotion time. Disappointed I bothered.,2.0
Bought this as a gift for a wedding. The box does not look as good as the image here... Ended up buying a wedding card and put the gift card inside instead... Disappointed with this purchase,2.0
I bought two gift card boxes. One is white and one is black.  The black box looks neat and is nicely sealed.  The white box is dirty and is not sealed.  What a disappointment.,2.0
"Purchased this card for my mom for a mother's day gift. The box came dirty, smudged and damaged. That was so disappointing, especially for a WHITE box. The one positive thing is that Amazon sent a replacement right away, but it's still disappointing that they aren't delivering these in better condition.",2.0
"I was disappointed in the gift box that the gift card came in.  I realize it is free, but I would never give it away the way in the condition I received it.  The box was scratched and dirty.  I've ordered about 8 or 9 and had to repackage every one.",2.0
"The white gift box was smudged with glue or some other substance, giving it a very grubby appearance.  It took a little work on my part to make it attractive enough to give as a gift.",2.0
I was confused as to why they shipped a package and then informed me that they couldn't activate te card and resent another one.,2.0
"It's not as shiny as it looks, kind of dirty looking, but all that matters is the content, the money I put in right?",2.0
"Online shopping and gifts have gotten to be so impersonal, and often with surprising results.  We decided a physical giftcard might at least give the option for the receiver to have something to actually ""unwrap"", but alas, the box was most unattractive and the note was very very tacky.  With some new packaging we made it work, but overall a not a very good impression",2.0
"I was surprised by all the negative feedback about this gift card..... thought for sure Amazon would have all the bugs fixed by now. I ordered one anyway, it arrived promptly, but the personalized greeting was nowhere to be found. The recipient had no idea who it was from, or why she was receiving it. Kind of takes the fun out of it if you have to explain.",2.0
Well I was looking forward to getting the giftcard and gifting right away.  Instead I needed to go buy a new box because the one I recieved was damaged and had black marks on the corners.,2.0
"So everybody loves Amazon gift cards... hence you are reading this review.

If you are like me, you wanted something a little nicer than the simple gift card, and much nicer than the printed email; so you looked at getting the gift card ""with a free box""

Well, although our gift card arrived in a padded envelope, the box was dented and somewhat mushed; not quite in giftable condition.

As this was a thank you gift for our kids swim instructor, she was most interested in the actual gift card, it was a little bit disappointing to me to feel the need to put the gift card in a dented box, and then hide the dented box in a gift bag.

Next time I'll stick with the simple gift card only route.",2.0
"The box was really cute, but the bow was dusty and the box was dirty on its edges.  Looked old as if it had been sitting on a shelf waiting to be purchased.  Not the impression I want to give a friend when giving a gift.",2.0
"I purchased a $50 gift card for as a birthday gift.  I've never bought Amazon's gift card before.  I actually wanted a different card and gift box, but Amazon doesn't have a $50 amount for it.  So I decided to get this one instead.  Not a good idea.  The box was dirty, smudged in various places, as if someone with dirty fingers was doing all the shipping.  Unfortunately I didn't look at the box before giving it.  I'd advice that you buy a card with a dark box, that way any dirt won't show.  Really disappointed with Amazon, they could have taken a bit more pride.  Especially since this is their product, their gift card.",2.0
"The gift card was lovely, but it came with NO indication of who sent it or why!! Not even a receipt, just the box with the bow in a plain brown wrapper! You guys need to get your act in gear. I found out with a phone call who sent it and they said they had typed in a gift card to be included, but nothing happened!",2.0
"The box was beautiful and all, but I'm not sure if it was the shipping or if it was already damaged. But the box came to me all ripped up. Some gift this turned out to be.  Well, it did delivered as it said it would, fast, free, one day. But I would rather have it shipped to me non-damaged and later than soon and damaged.",2.0
"I ordered a bunch of gift cards for co-workers and others.  Amazon delivered them the next day as promised.  Missing one of the cards.  No personalized notes on any of the cards.  The boxes come with no names on the outside so if they were personalized I still had to break the seal and open each one to find out who the box was for.

Their online chat customer service is worthless.  I have a feeling they are not in the US.  I've spoken to three of them and they've basically told me to wait until next week to see if the box arrives and the notes ""should be there.""  There are no notes.

Disappointed.",2.0
I hadn't realised that the amount assigned for my gift would be in US dollars. This made my gift a lot more expensive.,2.0
"I purchased this gift card for my Mother-in-Law for Mothers' Day.  I would like to have had it shipped but Amazon forces you to purchase a $50 card to have it shipped.  I thought that it would be nice to put our photo on it and have it emailed to her, but you cannot have a the card emailed to a recipient.  What kind of BS is this????  I had to forward her the email link and then walk her through accessing the card in my account; I also had to give her all my account information and my credit card number in order for her to access and print this card.  Fortunately, I trust her; please explain to me Amazon why I would purchase a gift card from you that I couldn't have sent in some form or other to an actual recipient??????",2.0
"Yes, Great idea, But, it did not work for me !  It could have been my printer or way I tried to make
the picture come out on a Gift Card.",2.0
Following the instructions I redeemed the gift card into my Amazon account but the funds did not become available for the purchase I was in the process of making.,2.0
The photo came out a little fuzzy,2.0
im lost on this one!,2.0
I'm sure this does not happen all of the time but the card ended up not working and I had to call and have amazon manually add it to my friends account along with another one. In the end Amazon was very helpful and did not give me a hard time. I am pleased with the customer service just wish it worked the first time so my friend did not have to wait to use there gift.,2.0
I am having trouble trying to use this gift card for myself,2.0
The hooks ripped off in the first month. Very poor quality for the price.,2.0
"I would have given this 5 stars if it came before I needed it. Beware of the amount of time it will take to arrive. If you are in a hurry, do not purchase. If you can wait a day, this is a good option.",2.0
I was surprized to find when I got my credit card statement that the currency I bought the card with was US dollars when I expected it to be Canadian dollars.  This should be made more obvious in the purchasing process.,2.0
I didn't like how it printed to A4. If it was an A5 size that would be better so it was a simple fold in half. that would streamline the design and make it a nicer gift.,2.0
"The card was easy to purchase and print, but was not understood by the recipient.  The recipient does not have any easy way to thank you for the gift. Amazon does not provide useful information on my ""orders"" list to let me know if the recipient did anything with the card.  (The ""orders"" list has status information like ""processing"" which could mean just about anything.) All told, I would say the gift card is perplexing trouble.

The card would need a lot of fine print in order to be comprehensible... such as that the recipient can be anyone, the recipient needs an Amazon account or can open one, the card can be used in part or entirety for any purchase at a later time on the Amazon web site, and the card should be redeemed right away even if you don't intend to use it right away.  Plus the card should say how to redeem it (which is already fine print on the card now.)",2.0
"When I called for support, I was on the phone for 1 hour and 10 minutes. The person helping me had very little knowledge of how gift cards and the greeting cards worked. The custom photo on the paper gift card was very small and didn't fill up the alotted area. There needs to be an option to have a plastic gift card with a custom photo upload for the associated greeting card.",2.0
"Product came bent, stained, and wrinkled.",2.0
"The product is what it is and that is fine, my problem is I selected the gift card option yet it was not included in the received order. The gift recipient did not have a clue who it was from.",2.0
"Card was purchased as a gift. Upon receiving it the card itself was pretty beat up. In the end it doesn't really matter since it's still worth the value, but I'm disappointed in Amazon's shipping and handling care and it detracts from the value of the gift.",2.0
Card came halfway opened in the back.,2.0
"Regret buying because of Starbucks leftist, anarchist political statements. They should stick to selling coffee, not selling out America.",2.0
The card was not activated and was worthless.  Still waiting for a response from Amazon!!!,2.0
Hoping it will arrive before Christmas,2.0
I just learned the recipient received on time but had no idea who the gift cards I sent were from.,2.0
"This was a gift with enclosed gift message.  Not sure why it took 8 days to arrive...and when it did, it didn't contain the message.",2.0
Was dissapointed. Purchased this for a Christmas gift and it was not received in a presentable manner. It was smushed and wrinkled in its packaging.,2.0
"I bought three Starbucks Cards, to give as gifts and use for myself.  I hallucinated that since I was purchasing the cards through the wonderful Amazon, my treatment at Starbucks would be the same as the magnificent customer service of the Amazon specialist.  Who are the best!  What was I thinking?

One evening late at night I entered the Starbucks on Hollywood & Western in Hollywood CA where I spent most of my gift card. After being given the code, I entered the bathroom.  Why was an armed security guard, siting directly across from the bathroom and waiting for me to come out.  A security guard was already there, but the called a security guard with a gun!

I asked him why was he waiting for me to come out of the bathroom?  With a smirky smile he said: ""I wasn't waiting for you.""  When I started to walk out, while following me, he asked the female worker:  ""Is it always like this?'  And she said:  ""No only when we have the stupid? half price Frapiccino sale!""  When I walked out, he walked out.  I returned five minutes later and he was gone.

I asked the manager why he allowed that to happen?  He said he does not hire security and he cannot control what they do.  They treat everyone who looks spooky to them like that.""  I asked:  ""Will you allow them to cuss your customers out?""  He said:  ""I would not allow that!""  Then I told him:  ""So you do have control,""  asked for the number to the Starbucks Corporate Office and left.  Two security guards were outside in the parking lot waiting.  One was in the car, one was standing.  I've experienced discrimination by the kids working at Starbucks, but that was the worst.",2.0
"I ordered three gift cards for a friend who was moving and selected one-day shipping, with the gift cards set to arrive the day before she was due to leave, so she and her son had gift cards to use for meal stops along the journey. She was to leave in the morning, as one does when they are moving 15 hours away, but instead of having the gift cards with her they were still on the fedex truck until 12:30pm. The one-day ""guaranteed"" shipping did not happen. There was no bad weather. There was no holiday rush. When contacted about the delay, there was no reason for why they failed to be delivered by the promised time. Just that they failed to be dispatched with any promptness, and from then on failed to be treated with any of the urgency one might expect with ""guaranteed one-day shipping"".
I got my shipping fees refunded. Well that was nice of them, wasn't it?",2.0
This is supposed to be a gift and the cardboard holder for the card is bent and creased which does not make for a very presentable gift.  Was not worth the convenience of having it delivered.  Next time I'll simply go to the store.,2.0
"UPDATED 12/26/13: Comments 'Revised' due to UPS holiday shipping problems broadcast in National News ... rating increased to 2 stars.

PROS:
- Can be shipped to address of person receiving gift
- Limited capability to send personalized message.

CONS:
- Likely due to UPS issues ... Not Delivered on Expected Date (projected to be 2-3 days late)
- Likely due to UPS issues ... Confusing delivery status info.
- Inconsistent experience to personalize messages
- Inflexible ... Message can  (& can not) be printed on Card

ACI Gift Cards, Inc. ... Ordered Amazon & Starbucks gift cards.  A Holiday Card comes with the Amazon gift card, but a personalized message can not be printed on it (only on the invoice).  However, for the Starbucks gift card, you can pay extra to add a Holiday Card with a personalized message.  Expected Delivery for both cards is now 2-3 days beyond the 'original' expected delivery date (likely due to UPS issues reported in National News for Holidays).  SUMMARY: This service allows you to select a gift card and ship it to the address of the person receiving the gift.  However, it is inconsistent in allowing a personal message to be added to a Holiday Card.  Problematic delivery may be due to UPS problems BUT to be sure read product & seller reviews to confirm delivery performance.  If you want to personalize a Holiday or Birthday card to be sent with your gift card, you may be better served buying a gift card and Holiday Card locally and using an expedited shipping method.",2.0
"I'm reviewing my most recent experience with a regal gift card, which I received as a gift (no surprise there).

I went to see a movie I was excited about, but Regal didn't have it. I picked a different movie that looked interesting because I had this gift card I needed to use. The movie was terrible!

I tried to get a large water from the concession stand, but they refused. Apparently you can only buy a large soda. I offered to pay their outrageous soda price with remnant gift card value, but have them fill my large cup with water instead. They refused. So I watched a terrible movie, parched and unhappy.

If you're thinking about giving someone this regal gift card, I'd suggest instead giving them $50 and a large glass of water. It's what they really want.",2.0
A poor deal for the money.  Can do better with matinees or senior discounts.  When I purchased I thought the deal included drink and popcorn.  Without add ons save your money.,2.0
"I thought I was doing great by ordering this 50.00 Gift Card, but it came loose from the adhesive and I have yet to find it.  Can I cancel the card and get it  replaced?  It was a Christmas gift to my in-laws.  I am so sick about it, and have looked everywhere, but am afraid it stuck to some other paper and it was accidently tossed into the trash can.",2.0
"I love the idea of sending a gift card by email, but I (like other reviewers) had the issue of the receiver getting the e-card from Amazon upon completing the order. Knowing this was a reported issue, I emailed the person that should have received the gift card to have them check their email. The e-card was not in their email, nor their spam mail, nor did they have any email filters that would have prevented the email from getting to them. I then got onto my Amazon account to check the order, and it stated that the gift card email was sent. There was an option to resend the gift card, so I did (making no changes to the original receivers email address). Upon the resend: the person did receive the e-gift card (yeah!), and I did get an automated email from Amazon stating the gift card was sent and received by person sent to (which I did not receive on the original order).

I will probably use the Amazon email gift card again in the future as long as follow-up with the intended recipient is part of the process.",2.0
The gift card reached the recipient without an issue.  I wanted to personalize the gift card with a photo of the mom to be and couldn't.  I tried you using several different pictures in size.  Reported the issue to Amazon.  They responded with resolutions I had already tried.  That's the reason for the 2 stars.,2.0
It was nice getting it all done in such a short time. I will be back again. Made a great gift.,2.0
It takes more than two weeks to be delivered to recipient after I sent the cards many times. I should mail a regular gift card.,2.0
"I was expecting a 10 dollar reward on this purchase of 50$ gift card, but i was not given",2.0
"The gift card would not print, and as I needed it for a gift that day, I had to go buy a gift card.  It finally printed the next day.",2.0
The process to purchase this gift card and apply it to my account was not easy. It was actually a very frustrating experience. Weeks later I received an email that it was not processed and there was a problem purchasing it even if I had already used it. I used it that same day...and NOW I'm being told there was a problem?!?!? It took me 3 tries to get someone on the phone (and via email) to tell me this had been resolved.,2.0
I don't seem able to redeem for kindle books.  It is not in the payment options to redeem a voucher.,2.0
could have had some bonus,2.0
Despite several tries this card would not print in color.  I checked my printer and it had color ink and working properly so the fault was in Amazon's delivery. It did print in  black and gray but that was hardly what I was looking for.,2.0
soso,2.0
You didn't send it to the recipient for 2 weeks - I asked her if she got it and said no; I forwarded the confirmation I got from you to her and she had to contact you THEN she got it.  Not sure what happened but if I didn't ask her if she got it it wouldn't have gotten there and would be out of $100 !! SO I wasn't very happy.......,2.0
"Disappointing - as for the second time I used this service the gift card was not delivered and I had to follow-up with customer service - they did rectify the situation, but not sure I would use this service again as I am now ""twice bitten"" and not sure I would risk it. - so this probably won't get published!!!!!",2.0
It is great for change a present or gift for a importantly people that you can't see or don't know a idea to gift to him and I don't know how write in English because I am a Venezuelan thanks a lot,2.0
I ordered for my friend who is amazon.com.  I use amazon.ca.  He was not able to redeem the certificate.  I thought that was weird and unnecessary in this hyper-wired world.  Make .com and .ca certificates interchangeable.,2.0
"I ordered this card for my nephew on September 22, 2013 -- but he did not receive it until October 20, 2013.  That is not acceptable to me.",2.0
"Reviews might be more objective if the reviewer was not compelled to fill this field in.  Even filling the field in is not enough, a minimum number of words is required.  Not only that, Amazon sends you an email that looks like the review form that actually is a click-through to the web site.  You cannot rate a purchase using the email as it is made to appear.  Because of the unsolicited email and the hassle Amazon creates in the process forcing a customer to go though all of this to do a review, I always deduct at least two stars.  I am happy to spend money and to give a rating.  Whether or not I provide a minimum length dissertation on the topic should be at my option.",2.0
"I never received ""a thank you"" for this gift card mentioned..  So, it is not that I really didn't like something as I had nothing to like tr dislike.",2.0
"When I printed it out, the entire card didn't print.  The code was cut off.  I had to reprint it twice to get it all.  I've ordered many Amazon Gift Cards that I've printed out, and this never happened.",2.0
"The top part of the basket handle did not print. Although, now looking more closely at the picture, I guess it wasn't supposed to which is dumb. The words could have been slightly smaller and then the entire basket would have printed",2.0
When I purchased this gift card I thought it would print out with the design I selected. It did not. What printed was the Amazon Logo. I did purchase this after Easter but I didn't think that would matter.,2.0
I was very disappointed that my original order was not sent and had to be resent AFTER Easter.  My granddaughter was disappointed !,2.0
"The gift card was fine and arrived for the recipient expeditiously. Was disappointed, however, that I did not receive the $10 in my account for purchase of the card.",2.0
"I spent a lot of time to download the picture and wrote a message, ect. Everything seemed to be OK until I got the final email - half of the picture was gone... I ended up cancelling it...:-(",2.0
"I never got a confirmation that my recipients received their cards. Worried it was money wasted. What if it went into junk mail or the recipient didn't understand that it is basically free money (maybe they are old-school and think it was a virus or something)?  Ok, yes I know this sounds paranoid but since I never received a thank you from my recipients nor any acknowledgement that the gift card were retrieved and used, I have no way of knowing if it was.

The card was easy enough to make but why can't I save a template to use on another person? I had to go through the whole process twice to send what was basically the same gift card. Also, it doesn't show up as my personalized card but as the generic amazon one in my orders and there is no way to see what was sent. It would have perhaps been nice to be copied on the email or something so I would have an idea of what my recipients saw.",2.0
I may have to re-think using amazon gift cards. The last one I sent I actually had to contact the recipient myself to see if it had been delivered! Rather embarassing! What happened to emailing when it is picked up by the recipient? If you cannot do that I won't be buying any more!,2.0
"The receiver couldn't use it on amazon.in
That's frankly a bummer.",2.0
The recipient had issues with the site and could not redeem her gift card. The order had to be cancelled and reordered on Amazon.ca as a physical card.,2.0
I had planned to send a gift card to my daughter on mothers day in my grandson's name. I chose to go with Amazon because there was a $5.00 additional gift card for me.  I never received it.,2.0
"I thought the card was really great and sent it to two friends of mine, a few days apart.  The second card, I believe, was for $72, not $100 -- 72 is the friend's age this year on his birthday.  As it turned out, I was there at his house, when he received the card.  Instead of the animated card I believed I had chosen, the card was just the amazon ""a"" logo and nothing else!  I was so disappointed!  Maybe I did something wrong when I was setting it up?  Maybe your instructions need to be a little clearer?  It was a huge letdown . . .",2.0
"So I sent one of these to a friend and the $150 gift card showed up on my timeline but not his (amazon said it would). So I have to ask him if he received it and he said he did. Then when he goes to try to use it the video won't load and the confirmation number isn't showing so he can't redeem it. Then when I go and click on it on my timeline to see if I can get the code to pop up (amazon also said the code would be seen by me, the buyer as well), its not there for me either. So now I have to call up amazon which led me to some lady that admittedly had no clue about the e-gift card process and how it worked (really....smdh....you work for the damn company!!!). After researching, she couldn't come up with a fix but found out how to resend the card via email. My friend finally received his confirmation code through his email and was able to start using the card. Stupid unnecessary hassle and stress makes this a 1 star, but I bumped it up to 2 because I liked the card and customizing options.",2.0
First of all it wasn't  a $100. It was $50. It did not go through the first time so it was not on his Birthday. It took 3 attempts to get there.,2.0
Animated card was not included. I had to request the gift card be sent again as recipient didn't receive it. Thankfully they knew it was coming and could prompt me to request it be sent again.,2.0
the animation did not play and failed to arrive on the date of the birthday so having to spoil the surprise by asking if they got a gift E-card on their email defeated the object I was hoping for. Will go back to posting gift cards at least I know those get there on time.,2.0
wouldn't tighten and wiggled around too much. If I kept it I'm sure I'd end ups spending half of my shower time trying to solve the world's problems and the other half trying to tighten the handheld shower head. I am ordering another one and fingers crossed because let's be honest I need that shower time. Problems aren't going to solve themselves. I'll let you know how shower head 2 turns out!,2.0
They lost the original order. They re-ordered but received it 6 days later than originally suppose to receive it. The bad part it was a birthday gift but due to loosing the first order I was not able to give it till two days after the persons birthday,2.0
"I bought a $25 gift card and $50 gift card. The $50 card came in a plastic wrap because the card wouldn't stick to the backing shown in the photo. They should have replaced the sticky stuff on the back, not put it in a plastic bag so both pieces stay together. The back of the backing is also dirty. Looks terrible.
The $25 card didn't come in a plastic bag, and looks fine (card and backing attached). I bumped my rating up to two stars for this reason.
It's kind of pathetic that they managed to screw up a gift card. I hope the cards actually work for the gift receivers.",2.0
I got it in a timely fashion but when I went to use it the card didn't want to work.,2.0
"So as much as I was excited to use this gift card, it had no balence on it when I went to swipe the card. This made it really awkward. Shipping was fast though. I contacted their customer service twice already and still no reply. I wouldn't recommend buying a gift card off amazon. Buy one from AE directly.",2.0
"It's a gift card and worth what it says. My issue is that it's just cardboard and very flimsy cardboard. It wasn't protected at all in the shipping package and, as a result, is all bent and looks like it's been in someone's wallet for years. Can't give it as a gift, as intended...",2.0
"Came with the car board holder damaged and card was off the cardboard, otherwise ok",2.0
1 of the cards did not work i sent message weeks ago n no response can i get a refund for thst only card? The other 2 worked,2.0
"This is a new style card made out of paper instead of plastic, so it's really easy for the sticky backer to rip the back right off the card. Just a warning to be careful when removing it.",2.0
"Do not get the Christmas AMC cards. The sticky rubber stuff on the back of them, does not come off nicely. The original AMC gift cards are good. Nice and Clean backing. The only reason I know this is because, I removed all of the gift cards from the paper and put them into nice tin gift card holders for Christmas.",2.0
It looks like the dog chewed on this gift card. Cannot give as a gift!,2.0
"Hopefully the card works, because the presentation is awful.  If someone orders a GIFT card, it is likely a GIFT, so to receive a crumpled and peeling gift card backing is a bummer.  Too late for me to return for new one now, so will just have to explain why it looks likes it's been at the bottom of a gym bag for a month.",2.0
"This was sent as a gift to someone else. The provided message to the recipient was not included in the package. There was no packing slip or anything. So, the recipients opened the box and had no idea who it was from, or why, etc. Terrible experience.",2.0
Awesome best gift for my daughter !!!!!,2.0
"With no discount on the purchase and so many restrictions on what it can and can not be used for as well as what theater this card can be used ...I have to ask, why not just use cash? Its way better!",2.0
"Came and wasn't activated.. We gave this as a gift and naturally.. they wanted to use it the same day.. we got up to the box office and it had a ""zero balance."" Obviously we were mortified (was my in-laws to add to it)!  I gave it an extra star only because Amazon worked diligently to get this resolved and gave us a credit instead of a new card. I know it's not amazon's fault and after sending a scanned copy of the card, they verified I didn't just spend it and provided a credit.  So, I guess I will remain a loyal Amazon customer :)",2.0
"Card arrived in same package as another gift card, but this one had dirt and scratches all over it.  This is supposed to be given as a ""gift"" and it looks like something someone dragged along the ground.  I tried to clean up the gift card by using some spray cleaner and it took off the dirt but it's still all scratched up.  Not exactly something I want to give to someone as a gift now.  Disappointing.",2.0
"Beware. Their customer service is thin. It's 8:17a on a Saturday morning and my transaction wouldn't go through due to a ""data error"" on the Fandango site. I started a chat session and was told I was #20 in line with an 8 minute average waiting time. (It's posted on the Fandango site that chat is available from 6a PST.) 25 minutes later I finally disconnected without ever connecting to a support person. If things were that busy at 8a I'd hate to imagine problems later during a much busier time of day. 25 minutes on hold is unacceptable for online customer support. Especially when the movie starts at 9:30a. Plus, ""Data error""? (The card number was entered correctly and verified twice on Fandango while waiting for a chat rep.) Convenience fees added to each ticket are also a bit steep. They seem to double dip a bit charging for the cards then charging individual service fees for each ticket purchased.",2.0

Finally for all that inconvenience they charged me a $3 convenience fee.  In the end it did work but I would only purchase it if it was $5 or more off face value.",2.0
"Pain in the butt to use! You have to enter a REALLY long number, then a code. And your Fandango account won't hold the remainder if there's anything left on the card. So if you spend $30 of the $50, the next time you want to use Fandango, you'll have to RE-enter the long string of numbers and the code. This means you have to keep track of the card rather than being able to enter into your account and just having it debited when you use Fandango. Not sure why they can't get this right, like just about every other gift card/account out there.",2.0
"I could only use this card in at the mall, and not in many of the near-by theaters. The gift was a nice thought and I did love going to the movies.",2.0
Gift card can be misleading. You can ONLY use this gift card online and there is at least a $1.40 service charge per ticket.  So this gift card is really worth 80% of the value and very inconvenient to use.,2.0
"I do not like Forever 21. Their return policy is HORRIBLE. You can't return anything and just get your money back. The only thing you can do is get store credit and everything must have all the tags still on it and you only have a couple weeks to take it back. The clothing is very cheaply made. I bought a pair of sweatpants there and got them home only to find a huge rip on the inside leg. I can't return it either because I took the tags off before I put them on so that the tag wouldn't scratch me. I was looking at a sweatshirt in the store and the little design on the front was completely ripped off. It's all very cheap. This is a place where you would buy an outfit to wear one or two times and then throw it away. The prices are decent, but I would personally rather spend good money on clothes that will last me a long time, than spend a few bucks on something that will fall apart in a month. My BF accidentally bought this for me for xmas instead of the Victoria's Secret gift card he was trying to find. So getting this card was an accident and I couldn't return the gift card either ",2.0

Pictures of the card, front and back, were emailed by the recipient. I really felt bad about the situation and apologized, but there was nothing I could do since there are no returns on this item.

I purchased some cards myself and was given some by family as gifts. There are more options out there now for curvy women to not have to put up with LB's shenanigans.

On 12/24/13, I received a text verification that said the item was on a carrier vehicle - ""out for delivery"" - and should be delivered on that same day.  On 12/26/13, I received another text saying that the card wasn't delivered until the day after Christmas.  This card was sent to a man whose wife just died on 11/22/13. He's an older gentlemen with a teenage daughter, and their finances are in a shambles after his wife's illness. I was hoping this card could have been used for their Christmas Eve meal.  Another item, ordered under the same order number at the same time, was actually delivered on the 24th, even though I had received two text alerts telling me that item was not likely to arrive until after Christmas due to carrier delivery issues. I had initially received a text saying that gift was on the truck out for delivery on 12/23/13. Five minutes later, I received a text informing me of carrier issues and saying that item wouldn't be delivered until after Christmas. It was delivered on 12/24/13.

I ended up using it at another spa, but could only use the full amount and the spa had to call customer service to get it to go through. She said she always has issues using the gift cards.

Why in the world would you not let someone use an amazon card for an amazon product?  The only good thing was that they were good about reimbursing us the cash.  I mostly think they should get rid of this policy, or at the very least clearly state it somewhere.",2.0

It does not cost more for Whole Foods to import from Ben & Jerry's than it does say Safeway, Mariano's, Jewell-Osco, Giant, Kroger, or any other chain. It's a money-making scheme they are running at Whole Foods - claiming to have ""the best"" ingredients and charging more for them, but just in generally charging more REGARDLESS of quality.

"Be warned that you save no time by using these or at least not in all theaters. I bought they as a mother's day gift for my mother because she lives in another state and she told me that she had to print out a paper after making her ticket purchase online and take it to the box office where they have to punch in a code that is on the paper. The cashier couldn't get the code to work and instructed them to take it to another cashier so they just decided to walk in because they had already paid and didn't want to miss their movie. She also said someone else was there using the Fandango app on his phone to show the purchase and was also having trouble.

The next issue is that there is a surcharge every time you use the card so where you think you are getting a 25.00 card or three 15.00 cards you are not because they charge you a $2.70 convenience fee each time you purchase tickets. Also you cannot use these cards directly at the box office, you have to purchase them from the Fandango site and either have their app, or waste ink and paper.

I will never purchase these again and my advice would be to avoid them unless you like giving money away because they are not a time saver.",2.0

"There's nothing wrong with the gift per se but the redemption procedure is a nightmare, starting with the customer service in India and the whole process of:
- Searching on the website and spending hours to find the information needed (which is not at all easy to find);
- Chatting with a moron who barely understands and copies and pastes standard replies in bad English;
- Sending emails and then having to call because they don't understand something as simple as returning a gift card that the gift receiver does not want.
I speak crystal-clear RP and speak quite slowly and still had difficulties making myself understood, and I am used to speaking to foreigners because I was an English teacher for 10 years.
IN SHORT AND TO ROUND UP THIS REVIEW: the gift is fine as long as you don't have to return it.
If you have the slightest doubt as to whether you will need to return it, don't buy it because it will take up inordinate amounts of time and possibly they will suggest crediting the money to your account or a million other things to avoid returning the money and make your life a misery until you either give in or give up.
SECONDLY - IMPORTANT ADVICE: don't send this gift to people you don't know because they might start asking for the recipient's phone number, billing address, secondary email address, or any number of details you don't have.
WE BELIEVED it was a good company gift for clients and promotions, but we were wrong because the return is almost impossible and because they start asking for all sorts of details that you could well have if you have given the card to a relative / friend but not if you are a company giving to clients or giving cards away in promotions.",2.0

The cards aren't as nice as the separate ones and were all stuck together with nasty sticky gunk.,2.0
"I purchased three of the multipacks containing four cards each.  The plan was to save time during the busy holiday season by not having to go into Starbucks to buy gift cards.  Plus I would receive them quickly using Amazon Prime.  On xmas eve, I opened the packages, thinking I would quickly put together these gifts for my grandkids. One thing I didn't consider was that there would be no gift envelopes to put the cards into, so I had to make my own. This was time consuming which defeated the purpose of ordering the cards online.  But the most annoying thing was that I could hardly pull the cards apart due to the incredibly sticky glue that held them together.  Once I got them apart, the glue remained on multiple spots on each card.  I rubbed and scrubbed to get the sticky mess off but eventually gave up.  The cards ended up looking dirty and used and remained sticky.  Not the look I was going for as a gift.  In the end, I would have preferred to go to a local Starbucks to buy individual gift cards.",2.0
"These cards seemed like a great idea, but they come all stuck together with glue on the front and back and it's hard to get off. If you're trying to give gifts to multiple people, then you have to spend a bunch of extra time scraping the glue off so they look presentable.",2.0

"The gift card was bought as a present for my mother,  who owns a kindle,  unfotunately due to being in australia,  the gift card was not able to be used on her kindle account.

The purchase was attempted from the amazon.com.au site,  but there was no option to purchase a gift card,  assuming amazon is one company,  I purchased a gift card from amazon.com.

It was extremely disappointed with the outcome of this as my mother was not able to purchase what she wished to (kindle products).

She also informed me that she was not given a choice about converting from amazon.com to amazon.com.au for kindle purchases,  considering this was the case, you would expect to retain the same level of ability within the site (being able to purchase gift cards)...... very poor",2.0
"Even though the gingerbread cookie looked adorable for my teen grandchildren, they did not have an eMail, bank account or ID such as driver's license so they could not personally endorse and use the gift cards I printed on my computer and sent them for the holidays.

Took time and hassle for the inexperienced!",2.0
Unfortuately I gave this gift card to my brother who lives in Canada and he shared that he would have to send items to my address as I live in the United States.  Just disappointing that he cannot use his gift card in Canada!,2.0
The gift card went on my friends account but she didn't get to pick when to use it? She bought items for her Grandson and you used her gift card automatically? So what was intended as a gift for her wound up being spent on someone else? Not the way a gift card is supposed to work?,2.0
"I was given money by my mum to purchase a giftcard for xmas as her present. I have purchased giftcards in the past with no issues. This time however, I chose the $60 amount, expecting just that. My account was later charged $74 due to the exchange rate or something. Good thing i had extra money in my account or it would have been overdrawn and charged a fee. Not too happy when i found out to say the least.",2.0

"I ordered in NZ dollars and system charged me in US dollars, why offer currency if you do not use this currency, so card cost me  more than expected. Wont use again",2.0
I had to send it twice and it still didn't make it to my brother. I finally called Amazon.com and they had to deposit the money directly into my brother's account. This was two weeks AFTER Christmas. I don't understand why the gift card never made it to him on time and really never made it at all. However once the money was deposited into his account he was able to use it.,2.0
"I had my card emailed to my daughter across the ocean. It did not arrive the day requested. I called and somehow, it had been redeemed into her account. It actually arrived in her inbox a week later. She did not redeem it for fear that it would charge twice. It was very strange.",2.0
Card not delivered on due date. Very disappointing as it was a Christmas present. I had to send all information to my granddaughter's parents who then had to contact you about this. The card was sent well after Christmas to great disappointment from all of us. It seemed like such a great idea and was ordered weeks before Christmas only to not be sent by you. Very unlike Amazon and I'm wondering whether to use this gift certificate service again in future. Christmas is important to a child.,2.0

"It would not let me put in the promo code to get the $10 rebate, and that was the reason I bought it.  So I was very disappointed.  I tried to contact someone about it and did not get the response.  I shop Amazon often, but will not likely do a gift card again.",2.0
"The product was fine, but it took 3 attempts to get to the right.  It kept going to an old address that you must have had in your files.

I always have trouble with my pass word.  That takes several tries to get you to accept it, although I have never changed it.",2.0

"I was disappointed that I could not print the card the same day. I had to mail it to Alaska and I had to Wait until the next day in order to get it to print. I am having the same problem again. I ordered a card yesterday, 17 January, and I still haven't been able to print it. Now I am going to be late for the Birthday that the card was for. Upsetting!!",2.0
I had to figure out how to re send it so she could use it a month later and it was a cumbersome process,2.0
"The series of checkout menus was confusing to me.  I thought I had checked out when it reverted to what I thought was an earlier screen.  When I later tried to track the order it did not show in my cart or anywhere else.

Better of going to the mall to get one.,2.0
"Worst was that recipient had to contact Amazon to get correction, and then only got me (the gifter) a refund!  So now I have to provide another gift!?  They should have sent out a new card and would have got a 5 star rating from me.  Only gave two stars since it only took 2 phone calls to resolve (1 from me and 1 from recipient).  Now I have to go and get the gift replaced.  NOT HAPPY!",2.0
This product came bent. While this could have been a result of the postal service it could all have been prevented with proper packaging. A thicker envelope or some sort of added support would have prevented this. I hope it still works as it bent across the magnetic strip.,2.0

"Buyers should be aware that Staples has a limit of 5 gift cards per an Online Purchase.  If you have more than 5 gift cards that you want to use to purchase an item from Staples, this purchase will have to be done in the store.
I would like to note here that Staples will not accept the use of a Staples eCard for an Online Purchase at all.
We had received several gift cards for our credit card reward point with the plan of making an iPod Touch purchase from staples and as we live an hour away from the nearest store we planed to use these gift cards in an online purchase.
During the check out process of the online purchase only five cards could be entered so we called Staples Customer Support and were informed that only 5 gift cards could be used for an online purchase.  We asked if we went to the store could we use all of our gift cards there to purchase what we wanted and the Customer Service Representative response was to the effect that Staples limits any purchase to 5 gift cards online or in store.
We asked why wasn't this disclosed at the time of purchase and the Customer Service Representative didn't have a response for this question.
Fortunately we decided to call a store and ask if we could make a purchase using more than 5 gift cards and the Store Representative informed us that we could use as many as we wanted.
I would like to mention that I find the employees of Staples to provide excellent customer service in attitude and knowledge and I do a bit of business with Staples online and in different locations during the course of the year.  We prefer to purchase our electronics (printers, computers, flash drive, etc.) from Staples over Best Buy, the Staples employees seem to be more knowledgeable about the different products they provide then has been our experience with Best Buy.",2.0
"Really? They could have at least cleaned the gift card before they sent it to me. My card came slapped on the Staples cardboard display card. Crooked at that. Both the card board card and actual card were covered in nasty gunk.. don't even want to try and figure out what it was.. also the pin number scratch off area was peeling up, like it was a piece of tape. Pretty terrible ""gift card"". They did me dirty on this one!",2.0
This gift card works but for some reason they don't have PIN numbers like the regular ones so you can use them in store only and not on the Panera bread app so thats kinda bad,2.0
The card was delivered WITHOUT the gift greeting message.  Archived order clearly shows the message.  Result was that the receiver did not know who sent the card.  This caused some consternation.  Needs to be fixed.,2.0

"Bought this card and went to order online using Rapid Pick-up.  The card has NO PIN on it!  What kind of card is this?  No wonder there are all the reports of stolen numbers and cards with zero balance.  I am sure I will have the same result when I go to pay at the register, balance = $0.  How is this even legal?

The wrapper around the card was ok, but the attached note card with the message was horrible.  The text was faded-as if the ink cartridge that was used to print it needed to be replaced.  The design on the front of the notecard was snowflakes & I am presenting these to our personnel during the last week of April (which is springtime, getting ready for summer time where I live).  The giftwrap was not worth the price and I had to buy additional notecards to replace the faded snowflake ones- which added to my expense and trouble.",2.0

"Ok, but certainly not fabulous. I am looking for a Thank you gift for the people that are providing me with references to grad school. That being said. I'm thrilled that Panera is offered. But $25 is a little much to start off with. A $15 card would have been perfect - as  a ""here sit and have a nice cup of coffee"" gesture. While I realize that no amount of money can replace the time they spent over the last week or so doing the paperwork, (and that even $25 won't get you very far at panera) it would have been nice to have that option, especially since I have to buy for 5 people.",2.0
"MY MOTHER RECEIVED THE CARD AND AT CHRISTMAS AND WENT TO PANERA AND THEY TOLD HER IT WAS OF $25 VALUE. I PAID $50. SHE CALLED ME UPSET THAT THEY ARGUED OVER THE VALUE.

"As a semi-starving and incredibly busy student, I received the $50 gift card to Panera from my parents. I carried it around in my pocket for months and was able to use it twice (about $25 maybe).  By the time I made it to their store a third time, all the valuable information on the card was gone (the barcode, the super important 9-digit ID, and the functionality of the magnetic strip).  The problem is that barcode and 9-digit ID are just painted on to the card, and nothing is embossed.  After contacting Panera support, they want an insane amount of information to issue a new card (what store it was purchased at - and some don't count as in they won't support cards purchased many places probably including here at Amazon, the last 4 or 5 digits of the ID, the receipt, and a few other things - I deleted the email yesterday in frustration so I'm going by memory).

The point / warning here is that you need to be very careful with these cards and / or use them quickly or the paint will come off, the magnetic strip will fail, and customer service will not help you in any meaningful way.  I only gave them 2-stars because I like the actual restaurants.  Corporate Panera clearly is all about the money and I honestly believe these cards are kind of a trap.",2.0
"I don't think I'll ever buy a gift card through Amazon. I bought this along with another gift card and the condition of it made them look old and used. The cards had scratches and were dirty, so I ended up not giving them as a gift and keeping them (which I've lost or misplace :/).",2.0

"I ordered three gift cards for a friend who was moving and selected one-day shipping, with the gift cards set to arrive the day before she was due to leave, so she and her son had gift cards to use for meal stops along the journey.  She was to leave in the morning, as one does when they are moving 15 hours away but instead of having the cards with her, they were still stuck on a fedex truck until 12:30 that afternoon.  The one-day ""guaranteed"" shipping did not happen.  There was no bad weather.  There was no holiday rush.  When contacted about the delay, there was no reason for why they failed to be delivered by the promised time.  Just that they failed to be dispatched with any promptness, and from then on failed to be treated with any of the urgency one might expect with ""guaranteed one-day shipping"".
I got my shipping fees refunded.  Well that was nice of them, wasn't it?",2.0

"Warning: While the ""two bags fly free"" policy seems enticing over other airlines, we may want to only bring luggage we don't care about on a Southwest flight.

My recent flight (11/9/16) on Southwest involved two checked bags.  One, a yellow duffle bag, was badly scuffed and stained, apparently from contact with the baggage processing machinery or tracks.  My second bag, a large upright Atlantic bag with in-line skate wheels, had a wheel shattered during the Southwest baggage handling process.

After documenting the significant damage to the large bag's wheel, Southwest's baggage claim department responded immediately by stating that they are not liable for the damage.

Thus, please be careful with the luggage you choose to bring on Southwest.  If you are planning to check luggage that you care about, or that would be expensive to replace, please consider travelling with another airline.",2.0

"I send these gift cards often to nieces and nephews, and have been doing so for years, but I'm going to have to go elsewhere.  I can't believe how lame and stagnant this product is for a company as big and resourceful as Amazon.

It's nice to be able to upload your own photo, but then there's no animation or sound.  I would pay more for more variety or possibilities.  I liked Amazon cards because they are so easy to use, track, schedule reminders, resend if necessary, and Amazon has such a broad product range, and unlike others here, I have rarely had a problem.

My main issue was with the ""gift box"" it came in. From the picture it looks like a gift box that opens with the card inside but instead it is one piece that is open like an envelope and the other piece on top that slides up and down, in and out with the gift card in it (not the way that is shown in the picture). I nearly ripped the whole thing open trying to figure it out myself- I'm probably going to have to show her how to open it, which is really going to ruin the surprise.",2.0

I bought this as an Easter gift for a friend who ghosted me and I'm not sure why. I thought my thoughtful gift might make him realize that I was a cool friend who still care a lot about him but it didn't work.

"I got this $50 gift card for my brother.  I sent it to him.  He tried to use it at Olive Garden.  The restaurant told him that there was ""insufficient funds"" on the card (for a $40 meal).  He went ahead and paid cash for his meal.  Then he called me and let me know what happened.  I contacted AMAZON and the girl that responded to my query told me that you can't use e-mail delivery cards at the restaurant - you can only use them ON LINE.  I said ""that's not what it said when I purchased the e-card"".  She said ""I'm sorry ma'am, the only thing I can do for you is offer you a refund"".  So I said please DO refund me for the purchase of this card.  So AMAZON gave me a refund.  I turned around and went to ""GiftCertificates.com"" and ordered the exact same e-card.  I sent it to my brother and he was able to use it without issue.  There's either something wrong with AMAZON gift cards -OR- AMAZON Customer Support - or there is something wrong at the Olive Garden that my brother went to.  I kinda think it's AMAZON customer support.",2.0
The recipient of the gift card had to call me from the restaurant to ask if there were any additional numbers on my receipt because the establishment said they were unable to use the numbers she had from what was sent to her.  I sent her my receipt email and they were then able to accept the card.  Very frustrating.,2.0

Be careful when you select the amount. I ordered $50 and it kept reverting back to $25. When I went to change it then it ended up mailing it to me instead of the intended recipient. There's a late package! So I now have a $50 gift to give back to myself or keep for someone else.,2.0

When I contacted Amazon via their Chat Customer Service and explained the situation, they immediately offered a full refund. I still don't understand why the card did not work, but am happy that Amazon stepped up without any further complications. The gift fizzled, lesson learned. It's probably best to test the card right after receipt and make sure it works before you give it to anyone else.",2.0

"Hard to believe.  We ordered about 60 in total, 4 different denominations.  They came in a big box, and not one of them had the denomination on them!  We had to check each one from the SKU Barcode off the packing list to be sure we got them all.  We found 2 that were not on the list, and we found we were shorted 2, so I had to go to the Amazon site and double check these two to find the value.  Now, we are giving these to 60 different people, and since the cards/boxes are not marked as to the denomination, no one will know how much they are getting.  So, what if we send someone a $250 card and it is really worth $50 by mistake?  They won't complain, for they never knew how much it was supposed to be.
This is SO easy to fix! Just mark each box with the denomination amount and that's that.  What a mess!  Other than that, they are well packed and very cute.  This vendor just has to make this change and they'll be perfect.  It happened last year too, and I think I made this suggestion then, and nothing was done about it, so I doubt anything will be done for next year!  Merry Merry....",2.0
"The gift card is wrapped in a box but the box has a window on the back that shows a bar code, so your family member can see that it's a gift card when you open the box.

bells were all smashed on it...other than that it looked okay,2.0
"I like the packaging.  Very nice box and doesn't need any additional wrapping, but.....
I gave it 2 stars because they do not identify the cards at all.  I received 5 cards in one package for our family.  Some cards have more value than others.  There is no way to tell which one is which without opening the packaging, pealing off the paper on each card to reveal the claim code.  That should be the job of the person receiving the gift.
Also because the purchaser did not check the ""Add a gift card"" box, I have no idea who sent the cards and who is supposed to receive the cards.  Even if she had added a receipt, it still wouldn't say which one has what value on it.
Amazon you should have the program automatically ask for the gift information - sender & receiver & amount on card - at the time the cards are ordered.  That information should be attached to the outside of the packaging for each card.",2.0

You have to join their social network if you want more. I thought at first this is a 'come on'....like giving a $10 gas coupon so the person will come in and fill-up the tank and buy sodas, too. After reading reviews, though.. methinks the reason is, they want to 'vet' all customers, and will not allow a back door in for 'unwanted' ppl who insist that they have enough gift cards to cover the stay. I see their complaints are mostly about people arriving and being told they are not getting their stay for one reason or another. After seeing the social network aspect, I think the property owner went on their Facebook, and deemed them 'unfit' to stay at their house.

This was a Xmas gift for my son. He had one heck of a time redeeming it. Amazon wanted him to create an account and give them a credit card number before they would allow him to use the thing.

I am usually very satisfied with Amazon.  This item was supposed to be next day shipping it was a Christmas gift for my niece.  I ordered this on the morning of Monday December 19th.  When I left work at noon on December 23rd it still had not arrived.  It arrived that day after our office was closed.

The other 2 stores (registers) declined it as a gift card and I had to leave the store embarrassed and empty handed. Find a way to print it.

"I read all the reviews, and because I really needed to buy some groceries, I took my chances that I'd be part of the 37% of people who would be ""happy enough"" to give it a 5 star...BUT, it didn't go that well. My local Safeway, Store #1889, treated me like a criminal. I'd actually stopped going to this store for some time already, because of its high prices and general dissatisfaction...but, since this was the best I could do, with the eCard offerings Amazon gave me, I thought I'd try.

My local store at first just told me no, and hoped I'd leave. But, I wanted my groceries...so, I used their phone; called the numbers on the printout (doing their job of customer service); and, convinced the floor manager to  talk the Gift Card people. She hung up and told me she still didn't trust me; went to talk to the store manager (which they had already told me had left for the day, Hmmm?); and, then she said it was OK...and processed the card.

THEN, she said she had to keep the printout...and, since I still had a balance, I said, ""No, that's my card. I can still use it.""...and she said she needed it for her records, and kept it.

The only saving grace is that the eCard actually worked, and I got my stuff...AND, that when I got home and called Safeway corporate (# on receipt), they were very nice; they called the store and told them to give me back my printout; and, when I went to get it...they didn't give me any guff.

Needless to say, I WILL NEVER BUY THIS ITEM EVER AGAIN...and, after finishing off the balance on my card, I will probably never give Safeway any more of my money.",2.0
MOst cashiers don't know wtf they are doing with the gift card.. And the other ones that do know what they are doing is basically with the manager's discretion if it works or not this gift card absurd just make sure you talk to the manager see if it will work because even the managers don't know what they're doing only about 10% of the stores I went to I've got it to work the other 90% they don't know what they're doing they should have a class or something so all the cashiers and managers can figure out what the hell is wrong with them because they can't figure it out even though the directions are right there in front of their stupid face.,2.0

I did call customer service, and they did replace it, but I just now opened another 'Beef Top Sirloin' package that I let thaw for two or three days in the refrigerator, and again - the plastic it is sealed in didn't seal it.  This time I cannot find the crack or separation, but I really didn't look too hard since this is a common problem now.

The positive are invariably customers that have avoided interacting with Adagio's customer service.  The negatives come from those that have.  It is a shame.  I like small businesses, and Adagio is a family owned company with only a handful of employees.  But, customer service is a nightmare.  Whoever handles it seems to think everyone is trying to take them off, even to the point of rather losing a customer than making one of their errors right.

"I reviewed this product a week or so ago and the author contacted me (That's a first!) and asked that I remove the review since he felt it would dissuade others from benefitting from his unique wisdom. Upon reflection, I may have been a bit harsh, so I will try to give as objective review as I can.

First, this is not a video. It is a PowerPoint presentation and the author reads every word on every page slowly...very...very...slowly. So slowly that I had to check during the lulls to see that the presentation was, in fact, advancing.

This is not the Ultimate anything. If you have a camera with buttons or dials you already have an inkling of what ISO, aperture, and shutter speed are. If you know these things and are looking for help composing pictures, well, you're pretty much out of luck there.

Here's a synopsis of the modules:

Module 1: Know your camera. If you're going to be fiddling with settings you need to know how to fiddle. Good advice.

Module 2: ISO. ISO is the sensitivity of the sensor in your digital camera. The higher the number, the more sensitive. But the higher the number the noisier, blurrier the image may be.

Module 3: Aperture. The aperture measures how wide open the lens is. The wider it is, the more light gets in. But, as with ISO, less will leave your pictures too dark and more may not always be better.

Module 3: Shutter Speed. Again, it controls how much light strikes the sensor by how fast it opens and closes.

Module 4: Putting it all together. A proper exposure is achieved by the proper combination of ISO, Aperture, and Shutter Speed. If you change one, you must change another. For instance: If you open the aperture, you must either lower the ISO or raise the shutter speed to get the correct exposure. Opening the aperture will let in more light, so you must make your sensor less sensitive via ISO or allow less light via a faster shutter speed.

Module 5: Metering. This is all about seeing light. If your subject is backlit, for instance, they will appear as a silhouette unless you meter on their face. This module is all about how and where to fix your attention, where to meter the light, and is pretty good actually.

Module 6: Light and Composition. There are things that make a good photo good. Rules that seem hard-wired into the human psyche. The author mentions them briefly. Things like the rule of 3rds, texturing, patterns and whatnot. Problem is he doesn't explain why these things work, much less provide examples to demonstrate how they work.

Module 7: Completion. Here the author summarizes what is, in my opinion, just a summary, hardly an Ultimate course, and emboldens the reader to go out and achieve greatness.

Not all that negative, hey? So why 2 stars. First, as I said, it is not Ultimate by any stretch of the imagination. More than half the book is dedicated to things you already know. And the area you really need help, well, he glosses over it leaving more questions than answers.

And second, it not a video. If you bought the author's book you have the script. Yes, he reads everything on every screen.

Third, he says the course is worth $250 then offers a special deep discount. I think that's lesson 1 in the (expletive deleted) marketing manual. Honestly, this would have made a good $2.50 Kindle e-book.

Lastly, the hype bugs me. The author states over and over how awesome your photographs will be if you just follow his rules. As if understanding a few fundamentals of photography will make you the next Bresson.

2 stars and that's as honest as it gets.",2.0
The card is fine. The issue was getting it registered and put in place at I Tunes. The card was bought from a 3rd party. For some reason I could not get it into my account. I first contacted ITunes (as it is an IT card.) But was told that I needed to contact the seller. At first the seller told me to contact I Tunes the pass word was not working. The seller then contacted I Tunes and after 2 attempts it was fixed. The small savings was not worth the trouble and the 2 days it took to fix it.,2.0
Not sure what happened Amazon. The picture looks nice and there is a paper backing for the card. What arrived literally looks like a used gift card with a sticker placed on the top for shipping.

"This is way too small for a gift card holder, unless you are mailing it enclosed in a greeting card. If you ever managed to get 20 gift cards inside, you would have a heck of a time getting one out again. The material was also disappointing--- felt like cheap plastic--though the design is pretty.

On the plus side, if you were looking for something very small to hold your ID and one credit card while you went running or needed something to slip into a LBD or inside your date's jacket pocket, this would be just the thing. The point is that while  there might be some merit to this product, it is not as described by the seller.
I ended up putting the gift card holder inside an envelope inside a Christmas package mailed oversees. It was inadvertently tossed out with the wrapping paper.",2.0

"The gift certificate, even though you pay the full redeemable price for it, does not allow you to use any portion of it to tip wait staff. You can't really treat someone fully to a nice meal as you will have to give them cash for a tip, or spoil the evening by expecting them to dig in their own pockets. Kind of takes the fun out of it and makes it appear you paid less than its cash value. Might as well just hand them cash or a generic gift card. Great food, and I highly recommend this restaurant, but this leaves a bad taste in my mouth, especially because they didn't mention this limitation in their description.

Went to Whole Foods store and they would not accept these numbers, said I needed a bar code on the gift card (there was none on the link I received).  BTW I am a Prime member and had the Whole Foods app on my phone which works fine.  Called the customer service number on the gift ""card"" (really just the page I printed out) and they said they were just third party and I should call Amazon.  I called Amazon and they transferred me to Whole Foods rep who gave me another number to call....but they are not open Sunday.

The bar code on the e card will not appear on Edge, Internet Explorer, etc.  You need to open the link in Chrome browser.  When I did this the bar code appeared.

"I had such high hopes for this product! My intent was to use  these as clever  packaging for holiday gifts for teachers and bus drivers etc.. but the quality control was so poor, I returned the product. From other reviews, it looks like sometimes this product works out well, so it may be a hit or miss item. For me, it was difficult to load and basically fell apart during the process. This happened repeatedly, not only with my loading but other people tried as well, including people who have received and used such products by other makers in the past. The consensus was poor product, not user error. The quality of plastic appears suitable for the task but it is not high end. In our experience, the springs fell out .Because others have experienced positive results, my recommendation would be to put your time and money elsewhere, or proceed with the ole ""buyer beware"" caveat, knowing this is sort of a gamble. Who knows? You may get a product from the production team that does a good job or even a great job...or not.",2.0

When she returned she explaind that she was told the gift cards no longer came with envelopes. Why would I order gift holiday cards without envelopes? She then gave me a small credit and directed me to a link to ORDER and pay for blank envelopes. This was a week before Christmas. I was annoyed, but I needed the envelopes so I did place the order. Long story short, three days later I received a whole new order of gift cards with envelopes and the other gifts I had ordered through amazon. So I called again, there was a glitch and all of my orders were doubled. And in the second order the envelopes were included?.?? It turns out giftcard attached to holiday cards do come with envelopes. So she was kind, but misinformed and now I have a box of envelopes I will never use and had to go to UPS to return all of the doubled items.

The problem, and it's a glaring one, is the giant slot in the bottom for the bar code. You'd think that with Amazon's engineering prowess they'd figure out a way to, say, scan the bar code before putting the card into the box, but lo -- here we have a nasty visual defect that frustrates an otherwise-pleasant box.

If you have a label big enough to cover up the giant hole, go for it, but I don't think this this box provides the ideal customer experience.",3.0

"I like giving Amazon gift cards because the recipient can purchase anything and do so at a good price.  I hate them because they are often trashed by spam filters, causing friends and family to think you didn't get them a gift and as a result, lets your money be held by Amazon for who knows how long as an interest free loan or for many, provides amazon with a gift instead.  Multiply those loans and gifts by the numbers sold each year, and Amazon is getting Billions of $ in interest free loans and unintended gifts.  THERE IS A SOLUTION.  CHECK YOUR PURCHASE HISTORY AND IT WILL TELL YOU IF THE CARD HAS BEEN REDEEMED!!!  I found 7 gift cards, dating back as far as 2009, totaling around $400, that were never redeemed.  The recipients never got them.  I was able to resend and tell the recipients to check and insure that the e-gift cards were not blocked by their spam filters.

"I purchase Amazon Gift cards every year during Christmas and they always arrive promptly and attractively packaged.  This year, however, something happened and I received two boxes of gift cards on the same day, duplicate orders.  I assumed that there was a processing glitch at Amazon and that only one of the orders of cards was valid.  I received no communication from Amazon conveying which order was the good order, and couldn't determine which was the good order without activating the cards myself (and this wouldn't work, as they aren't transferable after activation).  So I took a chance and gave out a set from one of the boxes and held onto the other set just in case.  As my luck would have it, when my nephews and nieces tried to use the cards, they didn't work.  The gift cards I gave out were the invalid ones.  Fortunately, my nephews and nieces are good kids and they knew I would make it right.  So, through the help of my sister-in-law and a lot of time texting, we got the good card information to the kids.

"The gift card itself was fine, and it was convenient to have the box.  I did know that the box was black and that the bow was orange when I ordered it, but it really looked like a Halloween box once I had it at home.  It would be nice if the only color combo offered wasn't orange and black.",3.0
"The nice thing about this gift certificate card is that it comes in a cool box. Unfortunately, there is no place to include a message. The person I sent this gift certificate card to, did not know who it was from. I did not see anyplace on the order where you could include a note. Unless you are sending these to yourself to later give as gifts, I'd skip it.  (BTW, would be nice if you are a ""Prime Member"", Amazon might want to show their appreciation by giving you some discount on their own gift cards. After all; the recipient will be spending it all on Amazon anyway.",3.0
Package was wrapped perfectly.  Made for a nice presentation.  Daughter was very impressed.  She really liked the gold bow on a black box.  Her school colors.,3.0
"I got one of these as a birthday gift (thanks mom!) When I was ready to redeem it I tried multiple times to enter the claim code with no success.  I noticed that there was a QR code on the back so I gave it a try.  It took me to an Amazon page that had the claim code pre-filled.  Much to my surprise the pre-filled claim code was different than what was printed on the back of the card.  Not much different, but different nonetheless.  I signed in to my Amazon account and I was able to redeem the gift card without any further difficulty.  So if you're having trouble redeeming a card try the QR code, and see if that helps.  Of course, it shouldn't come to this which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars.",3.0
"EVERYONE LISTEN UP TO BE ABLE TO USE A GIFT CARD YOU MUST STILL PUT IN A CREDIT/DEPIT CARD IT WON'T CHARGE IT JUST NEEDS THE INFO, EVEN IF YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY ALL THE MONEY IN THE GIFT CARD FOR YOUR PURCHASE.  OTHERWISE IT WON'T ACCEPT IT.",3.0
"I love the Amazon gift certificates which is why I gave it a 3 star.  The package that it came in was in pristine condition and when I opened it the gift box looked like it was run over by a tractor.  It was dirty, cracked and 1/3 the black was chipped off the box.  I will remove it before I give the the gift.  It was apparent that this happened before it was packaged.",3.0
I am glad I had this 'boxed' gift card sent to me instead of to the intended recipient because the box was smashed and broken on two corners!  Very poor packing in a thin padded envelope.  The card itself is fine of course but in the future I will not bother ordering the boxed version.,3.0
"it said free one day delivery, I got it three days later. I bought it on the 23rd so I could get it on the 24th and instead I got it on the 26th, which isn't really great when you're giving it as a christmas gift.",3.0

"I love the concept - the box is beautiful and in great shape. The gift card is a great idea for a gift - HOWEVER. I am not a smoker, but when I opened the package, these things smelled horribly of cigarette smoke and I didn't even want them in my home. It made me gag.",3.0
"my mother bought 9 $50 gift cards for children and grandchildren for christmas. she also bought and subsequently returned another unrelated gift. all of the gift cards are unredeemable. she has been on the phone a dozen times. the latest yesterday, 10 days after christmas, for 2 HOURS, trying to get Amazon to re-authorize the cards. trying to redeem them shows the message, this card has been refunded to the purchaser.

zero stars

update, new cards issued, issue resolved, 12 days after christmas. i will up the rating to 3 stars.",3.0
"I ordered the card as a birthday resent for a friend. Everythign seem to go smoothly until I got an e-mail form Amazon stating the card was defective and that they were going to send me a replacement card next day shipping no charge, pretty awesome from them.

Package looks allot better in the picture not so hot in person. please don't skimp on the quality amazon it is supposed to be a gift.,3.0
"Was disappointed that when I loaded my gift card in my amazon account, it became community property with the rest of my family, so I really didn't get to buy the books I wanted.  Wish amazon would have a completely separate section to load gift cards you receive, that can only be used by the recipient.  Especially since the gift card was for the kindle, but my husband had to use it when he ordered something else on amazon.",3.0

"All I asked for this Christmas was Amazon gift cards. So a relative went to Best Buy to ask for one, and she was handed an Amazon Kindle Gift Card. I wasn't sure if this would work for general Amazon purchases, so I sent an e-mail to Amazon customer service. The reply I received from Amazon was that the Kindle Gift Card can only be used for Kindle-related purchases, NOT for Amazon general merchandise. I tried to take the card back to Best Buy to exchange it for a regular Amazon gift card (which is what she asked for from the sales associate, so apparently, even retailers are unaware of this policy, although when I returned the manager knew this probably because others were trying to return their Kindle gift cards). Anyway, the manager there said it cannot be returned or exchanged, and confirmed it can only be used to make Kindle-related purchases. He said this is an Amazon return policy, not a Best Buy policy.

Now the real question is, why would anyone in their right mind want an Amazon Kindle Gift Card with all these limitations, when they could get a regular Amazon gift card and buy anything at the Amazon store, including Kindle related purchases. This is a ridiculous policy, and if anyone says I'm lying, I'll be happy to forward the e-mail I received from Amazon customer service concerning this issue.

*** UPDATE: Someone from Amazon called me to say if I first put the Amazon Kindle Gift Cards into my account using the number before making a purchase the money should be available for other purchases. They also sent me an e-mail with more specific instructions. Not sure if this is a rule change or what, but I appreciate them taking the time out to call me and leave another e-mail. I'll post the new e-mail below with the instructions (the first e-mail telling me it cannot be used this way is in the comments discussion to this review). Kudos to Amazon for listening to their customers if this is true (And I assume it is). I have not used the cards yet, and hadn't even scratched the off the cover over the numbers because I was thinking about trying to have Amazon exchange them for regular Amazon gift cards. Anyway, I'll bump up my rating to 3 stars (minus 2 for the misinformation) and the new e-mail is below:

Hello Bill,

I'm sorry for the misinformation you have previously received in an email from us about using your Gift Card for purchases on Amazon.com. I've tried contacting you at the phone number listed in your Amazon.com account but have been unsuccessful.

To use an Amazon.com Gift Card (or a Gift Card with the Kindle name on it) for purchases from Amazon.com, visit Your Account (http://www.amazon.com/your-account) and look for the gift card option in the Payments section.

You can also enter your gift card claim code during checkout in the box labeled ""Have any gift cards, gift certificates or promotional claim codes?"" in the right column. If you use 1-Click ordering, you'll find a similar option if you click ""Review or edit your 1-Click orders"" after clicking ""Buy now with 1-Click"" on a product's page.

You'll find more instructions here:

http://www.amazon.com/help/giftcards

If you still need help, you can contact us via phone, chat, or e-mail by clicking the ""Contact Us"" button on any Help page (http://www.amazon.com/help).

I hope this helps! We look forward to seeing you again soon.

"I found it hard to wade through the web site, trying to figure out how to apply the card to my purchase.  The email regarding my purchase looked just like my regular credit card purchase, so I had to go wading again to find out which ""card"" paid for the purchase.  Not real eazy or friendly.  JL",3.0
Gift cards are always a well appreciated present - unfortunately in this card it is not a valid method of payment towards a prime membership.,3.0
"Great. but, some of the books are way to pricey when your not even buying the Marriott and just the story.",3.0
"I am an amazon shopper. I love amazon. I was sooo excited to get a $100 gift card from my husband for Christmas. He had also got me a Kindle Fire for an early Christmas Gift. So the card was for the Prime Membership that I wanted for a year. Well...you can't buy Prime with a Gift Card. BIG BUMMER!! Yes, it is in the fine print...but really, who thinks that they need to read it for this sort of situation. Prime is amazon! So here I am...kindle fire...no prime!",3.0
"I purchased some DVDs shortly after Christmas 2011 and selected the payment option to apply was the Amazon credit card, however the Amazon gift card was applied. I was going to use the Amazon gift card toward something  in a higher price category but for whatever reason the credit card has used. This was a disappointment. If you have both a Amazon credit card and gift card as payment options, be sure the selected option is the one you wish to use.",3.0
It was difficult to figure out how to use the card with the Kindle. It would be great if there were an obvious option in the kindle itself to upload the card. I had to do it logging into my amazon.com account online with my computer.,3.0
"I loved my Gift Card from Amazon.  however,  I was given the gift card to use with my Kindle Fire  and then found out I could not use it to pay my Amazon Prime Membership Fee....Bummmer  Amazon,  Bummer",3.0
The online instructions for redeeming were not very good.  I intended to use the card to pay for the ebook I was ordering but did not realize that you have to register the card BEFORE checking out.  I ended up having to put the book on my Visa and using the card for my next purchase.,3.0
I enjoy my kindle & also the gift cards I received. Being able to go into Amazon & have books sent to my kindle is great.,3.0
"The gift cards are nice, but I would like to be able to apply to an order when I want to, not have the gift card applied automatically! I have a sister who shares my account and she also got a gift card. I have a subscription of coffee and the gift cards were applied automatically. Whent that happens we have to keep track of the amount of our cards to use individually. Could solve this if we can choose when to apply gift card or when to charge to cr card...should be our choice.",3.0
I look forward to my Amazon Gift cards!  There is only one thing I wish I could do and that is to add more money to the card without having to purchase a new card.  I would consider getting my 9 YO a Kindle if I had the ability to put a gift card on his account and add money to it as I needed to.,3.0
"Obviously, getting a gift card is awesome.  And I hate to be one to look a gift horse in the mouth.  However, what's the deal with only being able to use an Amazon.com Gift Card on Amazon.com?  Why not Amazon.co.uk?

This may sound nit-picky, but consider this- just after Christmas, on Amazon.co.uk there was a sale- the ""Twelve Days of Kindle"" sale.  Loads of Kindle Books for real cheap.  I got excited, browsed through, chose which ones I was going to use my gift card on, and was set to check out.  Looking at the check out page, though, I realized I wasn't going to be able to use the gift card, as it was only good on the US Amazon, not the UK Amazon.

I'm not ungrateful- $100 of free books is great, even if there are limitations.  But why do those limitations exist?  It's the same company, just a different country.  I haven't really looked into the legal complications, so perhaps there's a good reason why they legally can't allow us to use both sites.  However, to a layman just using the site, it seems a bit unfair that although I'm allowed to buy products from the two (separate, yes, yet identical down to, for all intents and purposes, the logo) sites using the same log-in name, I can't use my gift card on both.

Like I said, maybe it's nit-picky.  Other than that, though, gift cards are, as one would expect, very good.",3.0
"I love picking something out for myself.  getting exactly what I want however, the shipping charges are crazy!  I picked out a variety of things.  On some of the items I choose the shipping was more than the item I picked out.  I would not recommend a gift card from Amazon.  I would recommend a gift card from a local store.  To much of my gift card went to shipping!! The giver and recipient would get more for their money.",3.0
"I've been a Prime member for some time, and have been tremendously satisfied. My mom just sent me a physical gift card. I could not redeem it online. It took two phone calls (I was disconnected once) over 45 minutes to resolve the problem. According to the service rep, the warehouse  ""must have sent me the wrong card."" The issue was resolved, but has made me aware that Amazon is not infallible.",3.0
Complicated & had to print off an ugly copy to put in a card,3.0
It was very easy to design the gift card but it did not print as designed or shown. I picked the Video Games cover and when it downloaded for me to print it had the generic Amazon cover. Normally this would not be an issue but I purchased the gift card for my 8 year old nephew.,3.0

Was great that there were different options for the gift cards but the invoice I received after buying it was not satisfactory. As I bought it as a gift for someone on behalf of work I was to get reimbursed for the money I spent but the emailed invoice/receipt did not contain any information about the currency exchange or how much I was actually being charged so I could only be reimbursed for what it said which was $26.56 less than I was charged but there was no way I could claim it from the invoice so I ended up out of pocket. These amounts come up when you buy books so I'm not sure why it doesn't do the same here. Also a few more designs for the pictures on the cards would be good.,3.0
"Well, I had to wait around 45 min for to obtain the gift card email. Just a little bit disappointed but I guess that it's like that.",3.0

What I don't understand is why you charge that much when I pay for the gift card, and I pay for the internet charges, you don't mail it out just send an email confirmation.  I also got a mitre 10 voucher which they sent out as a card and didn't charge a cent.  I won't be using this service again while the fees are so high.",3.0

I contacted customer service to ask why I was not able to have the Happy Birthday template which I selected  and the response I received was a very complicated set of instructions requiring me to cancel the order, resubmit, etc, etc. it was just a gift card! It was sent on his birthday! I had followed all of the instructions the first time! I had no intention of trying to cancel it and risk him being told his gft was worthless when he went to redeem it. I just hope the photo came through and he got a smile on his face! That was my intention all along. He did say in his thank you note he received an Amazon gift card, no mention of the cool photo. I will have to check with his mother to find out what he received. I was sort of disappointed, but as I stated in the title, a gift card is a gift card.",3.0

Well, I received the card today and like others have stated in their reviews, the tin has dents all over it. The dents in the tin not only look awful, but are disappointing as well.

Like most of us I'm sure, these cards are being purchased as gifts. Whatever the occasion may be: birthday, graduation, surprise, etc., the presentation of the gift is equally as meaningful as the gift itself. Giving any gift in damaged and dented packaging seems a little thoughtless to me.

I realize it's just a gift card, but I'm disappointed because I spent time online picking out what I thought to be a nice gift presented in a cool little tin that could be reused for something else. The dents and the hole in the bottom of the tin for the gift card barcode render the tin useless. It will be placed in my recycle bin on trash day.",3.0

I got this for my boyfriend.  The tin looks really cool.  I liked the idea of giving him a gift card in the tin (instead of emailing it like I normally do) because I knew he would find some kind of use for it.  But there is a hole cut in the back of the tin to show the UPC code.  So it's really more of a decorative presentation for the card and then it's basically bound for a landfill.  Seems kind of a wasteful earth unfriendly way of packaging something.,3.0

"Hope you are not on a deadline when they say free overnight shipping included with this $100.00 gift card purchase because I do suspect it will be late like mine was! Ordered on Friday with Monday (notice I said free overnight shipping.) delivery date and on Tuesday when I decided to see why I had not received on Monday, I found out it was routed to the wrong delivery area (it went to New York) and there was no updated estimate delivery date available.  If I had known the shipping would be an issue, I would have had it sent directly to the recipient of this gift as they live out of state. They will be visiting later this week and I really wanted to present it to them in person.  I don't really think the ""product"" purchased was bad...can't hardly go wrong with a gift card.

Thursday and still waiting....

Okay, UPS delivered the item late Thursday evening - around 7:00 p.m. It was raining outside and the delivery man barely tapped twice on my door and dropped the package. He practically ran back to his truck.  If I had not been there to receive it,or hear him even attempt to knock, who knows where it would have ended up at. (Currently my state is under a tropical storm warning with wind gusts of up to 65 mph, but no rain at the time of delivery.) All in all, I must really say that my experience is not so much with the Amazon gift card  as it is with the delivery. UPS totally failed on this one and, the saddest part is that it reflects on Amazon. USPS would have been faster in this instance. They would have delivered in five days- not seven! Oh, one more thing, the tin was slightly bent but really barely noticeable. Besides, my son won't be spending the tin,",3.0

This is because my apartment building is not secure and it is open to pretty much anyone. Since my gift was a $100 gift card, I didn't want to risk anyone taking it. Unfortunately, I came home to find the package under my mat. I would like there to be some sort of option to not have packages left under mats, especially when the main office accepts packages for its residents. Thanks a lot, UPS.",3.0

We sent this gift card directly from Amazon to our brother-in-law who lives in another State.  The card was delivered on time and the gift box was very nice.  The problem was that the gift did not indicate who the card was from.  I had to ask my sister if my brother-in-law got his gift card from Amazon because they couldn't tell who the gift was from.,3.0
"My son finally received the gift card, fine!",3.0
"Not a real problem...got caught up in the much publicized Christmas rush.  But what ticked me off most is the tracking info said it had been delivered, giving a day and time.  This made me think maybe some one had stolen it from my doorstep.  Fortunately, it had not...it arrived the next day.  Lesson learned:  Forget the nice box, have gift cards emailed.",3.0
"i bought this gift card for my mother in law for christmas 2012, she just called to inform me that they would not honor it. i am quite  unhappy about this, as the  purchase quite obviously shows up it my order history. i will be looking into this further once i arrive home.

 update:  Amazon did resolve the issue by sending a new  gift card.  Embarrassing, but at least resolved.",3.0

"There is not a better gift card out there! They make great gifts. They look cool. Downfall - for being an Amazon card you'd think this would be a Prime item, it took over a week longer to get. Sad.",3.0
The card in the snowflake tin was very nice. The tin just added to the gift.,3.0
"Actually, I was doing some research on this purchase - but changed my mind.  I did not purchase this item.",3.0
"Great gift card, very beautiful. Only two things I didn't care for. One, the card isn't plastic, it's paper. Second, the bottom of the box has a strip missing so they could scan the gift card without removing it from the box. I needed to wrap the bottom half of the box so it wasn't showing the gift card.",3.0

There was no place for the gift give to include the amount of the gift card.,3.0
"Nice product, but delivery problems",3.0
The amazon gift cards should EACH come with their own gift receipt and message. This would make it easier to determine which gift receipt goes with  which gift card when ordering multiples in case the gift recipient has a problem with the card. It is very confusing and I do not have enought gift receipts to include for the different people and states that I am sending them too.,3.0
works great but breaks to easily. anyone know how to get spare parts?,3.0

Gift card is great and was delivered on time.  The card telling who it was from didn't make it into the package and it was an accident I found out.  They made the statement someone sent us $50 and we have no idea who.,3.0

"The gift card was fine, but took forever to arrive.  It was advertised as Free One Day Shipping, while the actual ship time was reasonable, it seemed like the order sat in processing for two days and almost missed Christmas because of it.  Two days to process a gift card?!?  I have never run into this issue with any other product on Amazon.  Normally processing only takes a matter of hours and the product is then shipped.  This reseller/depot needs to work on their order processes and systems.",3.0
ok,3.0

OK,3.0
"My only complaint, and the reason I only gave three stars, is that the message that I requested and wrote was not included in the package.  If I hadn't called my son to ask him if he got it, he would have never know it came from us.

"Some of the codes were unusable on receipt. Had to request a new code for one of them which worked, but then because I had bought them in a pair, the second one was canceled as well so now I need request a new code for that one. If it's denied I'm deducting stars.",3.0

"The card and packaging were great, but when I ordered the I had also indicated that is was a gift and requested that a message be included.

How  do  you mess up a gift card? This one  was  somewhat mashed even though it was  in a box.,3.0
"Product was shipped with no damages and packaging is very cute, however I ordered two sets in different amounts (not $50 and not $100) and there is no way to differentiate between the two without peeling the claim code off and no way for the recipient to tell how much the gift card is for.  If buying in multiples, I recommend only buying in the same denomination unless Amazon can print the amount on each card mailed.",3.0
"I was supposed to get a code for a $10 Amazon credit, but never received it. The card and box look great, but feeling disappointed.",3.0
I ordered a number of these as Christmas gifts.  They did not arrive in one day as promised.  It took three days to get them.  None of them had their gift messages I had taken time to write individually.  Boxes looked a little tired - as though they had been on a shelf somewhere too long.,3.0
"The cute snowflake tin has very sharp edges in the back.  It looks like a toy, but it did cut fingers.",3.0
"The greeting note to the recipient was nowhere! I'm sending 3 more of these, so they will have to guess who sent them too!",3.0
both tins as I ordered 2 were dented so had to change the packaging to boxes---otherwise I feel the gift card is a wise gift so the receiver can pick out what they really want.,3.0
"I needed to receive my $100 boxed gift card by a certain date and paid additional charges for next day delivery. This was very early in the holiday season and I did not anticipate any problems.  The boxed card should have arrived on a Saturday and did not.

When it did not arrive the following Monday, I called Amazon to cancel  the order.  The Amazon representative was helpful and polite and did cancel the order.

I then printed an online gift certificate from Amazon on Monday. The boxed gift card arrive on Tuesday.  The credit for the first order has been received and I am satisfied with how Amazon handled the issue.  I was disappointed in having paid for special delivery and not receiving it.  The packaged gift card was very nice and I would have much rather given that as a gift than the one I had to print online.",3.0

What else do you want to know?",3.0
"I honestly love the cards but this is a warning. I ordered 7 cards with 3 different amounts on them. They all came in a nice little box with cellophane around them. All the same color, all the same box and no way to tell what the amount was on any of them. I had to open the box and peel off the sticker to reveal the code in order to determine which amount was on which card. Customer service was useless.

So a word to the wise. Buy a different color card if you have different amounts on the card then you will know the amount without having to rip open the packaging.",3.0
"This was ordered as a birthday gift and I wrote a message, which was to be included.  However, the message was not included and the recipient
was unaware of the sender!  Only today, by accident (two weeks later) was I able to confirm it was from me.  Very, very disappointed with this service, and will be reluctant to use it again!",3.0
was perfectly adequate.,3.0
Would have been nice to get an email or text letting me know it had been delivered,3.0

"I sent my daughter an Amazon gift card for her birthday. When I ordered it I requested a gift receipt and gift message. Neither was enclosed with the card. If I hadn't just happened to be at her house when it arrived, she wouldn't have had any idea who it was from, or the value. Very disappointed . I will think long and hard about using this method again.",3.0

"I thought the small box it came in was really cool. This card was a gift, but the little box was too crushed to give. It's like having a wedding ring in a crushed ring case when proposing... though obviously much less serious. Ha.

The card was great, and I even used a deal to get $10 off. But the little box was smashed. Other than that, there's really nothing to review with a gift card. It was easy to redeem on Amazon and most people will always appreciate an Amazon gift card.",3.0

"Cute, but average.",3.0
downside to this is still have to pay shipping using it????,3.0
"the card and the box are ok. Looks actually more attractive on a picture than in person. I ordered 8 of them for my coworkers. On checkout I was asked if I'd like to add a gift note, so I added gift note to each card (8 total). I received 1 note (!) instead of 8 on a poor quality piece of paper printed probably on a printer with a dying cartridge. Now I guess I have to buy couple of greeting cards to write notes.",3.0

"My son loved the money, of course, but he saw not point to putting it in a metal snowflake. It looked cool, but not necessary.",3.0
"Cute design, obviously the gift card is good, but the tin was damaged on the back - dented in in a couple of different spots.",3.0
"Expeditious delivery, but don't bother with the personalized ""to"" card---it is, as others have stated, nothing but a cheap slip of paper with whatever your message was, printed on a slip of cheap paper. You would think Amazon could do better.",3.0
"Despite the price, it did not help qualify for other Amazon discounts.  Almost any other purchase would have.  I was stuck this year, but found it so annoying that I won't be giving Amazon gift cards in the future",3.0

"Great gift card presentation device.  However, the paint on edges of the lids was marred/chipped.  Ordered replacements still not perfect.",3.0
The sender's name was not automatically sent with the gift. May I suggest that simple software adjustment to amazon for next season?,3.0
It's a gift card. What kind of review can I actually give? I liked receiving an extra $10 credit for purchasing it. My daughter liked the tin.,3.0
The tins are cute but came squashed.  Not great for a present so the packaging needs to be able to stand up to the shipping companies.,3.0
"I love Amazon and I personally love getting their gift cards. Imagine my disappointment when I opened this box, which is a gift to my Mom, and discovered the tin was dented in two places. I know it happens but the other gift card I ordered, which was in a paper box, arrived perfect. Oh well, just took the card out of the tin and used another one.",3.0
Thia is the second year that I purchased a gift card with a metel gift box.  Both times the box is smashed in shipment. The card is ok so I will have to wrap it myself.  I am glad I had it sent to me instead of to my friend.,3.0
"The giftcard is very cute, but it wouldve been better if it didn't arrive in a dented box that I have to give as a gift.",3.0
"I wish there was an option to select more protected, slower shipping. I would be willing to wait longer in order to receive these really cute gift boxes un-dented. I have ordered 3 different gift boxes or tins over the year and all of them have arrived squished or dented some.

For me, the delivery was super fast (less than 24 hours), but I would have rather had the option to wait a little longer and get an un-dented box.

With that said, I appreciate that Amazon has this option and does not charge extra for the gift box. It is a much better way to give a gift card. And it is truly exceptional that Amazon does not charge extra. The box design choices and options are great too.",3.0
"Gift cards arrived quickly and they are easy to use but both of mine were not packaged well and the Christmas Tins were both dented pretty good. I suppose I could send them back but to what end?  I'm a little disappointed, usually everything is protected very well from Amazon.",3.0
"First time I got it was bent not wrapped properly.  Had to reorder, and send back both the card and the Santa box, second time it was okay !",3.0
Came in a padded envelope but metal gift box was still dented in one spot and edge bent in another spot. Perhaps an additional bubble wrap or box would avoid the damage. Would gladly forgo the next day free shipping option to receive an undamaged product.,3.0
Hey amazon- its a gift card. Could you put in the packaging who the gift is from?  Its not nice to make people guess.,3.0
"I wrote a message to show who it was from as it was a gift.  No message inside,  so recipient didn't know who sent.",3.0
"I ordered 4 of these tins, one for $50 and 3 for $25.00. The one for $50 had the amount on the card, the rest did not, I had to write it down myself. They should put the amount on all the cards.",3.0
"I ordered both a $30 and $50 gift card for relatives.  However the cards came without any indication of their amount.  I tried to find a number for customer service but could not.  Since they were going to the same household, I included a note for them to figure it out when applying to their separate accounts.  In this regard I am only giving 3 stars: lack of customer service and lack of amount on the gift cards.",3.0
Received these gift cards and one was clearly marked as a 50$ gift card and the other had no monetary marking on it. It would have been nice to see the 25$ marking on the corner of the card just like the other one.,3.0
"I ordered two gift cards in different amounts.  They were both in snowflake gift tins.  I assumed they would be marked so I would know the amount of each.  That is not the case.  The cards have serial numbers so I looked on the invoice to see the serial number for amount.  Not any help there either.  How do I check the value of each card.  I went to ""amazon.com redeem"" and it seemed the only thing I could do was attach the card to my account.  Not helpful at all.  If you are going to order gift cards from amazon, make sure you get different gift cards or tins, and write down what amount goes into which card.  Or make sure all the amounts are the same.",3.0
"I ordered 3 of these in different dollar values.  They all came in the same box, and looked great, but there was no way of knowing which one was which value.  It was really frustrating.",3.0
I ordered 2 of these with different amounts on them and they look the exact same. Very inconvenient in deciphering which gift card is which.,3.0
"Wow, Amazon! I ordered a few of these in different denominations and they all came together in one box with nothing to distinguish them! How do I tell what's what without peeling off the special sticker and attempting to redeem it?",3.0
The product will probably be ok but it arrived with no indication who had sent it.  So the person that received it had to call around to find out who sent the gift.,3.0
"The shape and size of the tin are great, BUT the appearance of the silver on bluish background is very dull (lacks contrast) when compared to the picture in the advertisement,",3.0
"Gift cards are great and I have never had a problem with them.  Amazon Prime on the other hand is becoming a dissapointment.  These were ordered with a guaranteed delivery date of 11/29.  Unfortunatley, they were a day late.  Thanks Amazon.",3.0

"Although I did get a $25.00 BJ's gift card, it was not the one pictured here.  It says card has no value until activated by cashier. There is no way to tell if it was activated or check the balance unless you scratch the pin number area on the back, which makes it look used.",3.0
"I received a card as a gift from my son for $125.  I followed all the instructions and made a tee time at one of the listed courses.  When I try to use the card (several times last night and several times today), I get a message stating ""An unhandled exception...The remote name could not be resolved:'mail.goplaygolfdev.com'""  I called today and was told they are having system problems that will definitely be resolved by 5:00 PM Eastern.  I asked whether I could submit the redemption by phone and was told they can't get into the system either.  It's now after that and I tried again and am getting the same message.

A day later, the system allowed me to request a redemption, and I received an email confirming it.  Goplaygolf contacted the course to make advance payment, but was told it is no longer participating.  Emailed me right away to let me know.  I was impressed by and appreciated the follow-up.",3.0
"Wow. Just got these as a gift. I have used gift cards before. With those you just go to the course when you play and give them the card and they debit it. With these you have to book the tee time yourself (unless you want a $5.00 charge for them doing it only within their specified hours). Then you have to fill out a form on their website and in return they will call the course and pay 24 hrs before you show up. May be petty, but it's more to do to get a tee time. Let alone if you need to cancel.",3.0
"I thought it was great to be able to email the gift card -- however, it must not look any different on the email title than other amazon informational emails.  The person hadn't opened it until I mentioned that we had sent it.  Thought it was an advertisement from Amazon.com.",3.0
"It took it a long time to be sent, apparently.
Otherwise okay but next time I will probably
send a check.
Thanks.",3.0
"The cans served their purpose, but they were difficult to open - not specifically well made. Not for use for anyone having hand problems.",3.0
"The image was upside down and I had to have them call me both times.  They called twice before getting things right.  Although it was what the person wanted, I you have to ask for help with site it is to difficult normally.  It was also hard finding a way for them to contact me.  Both calls were prompt , but I had to wait on hold for awhile before someone picked up originally.  If you aren't  ready wait until you are to contact the person.",3.0
"While these are convenient, I'm not sure that one can really ""rate"" them per se given that I did not really purchase anything with the card.",3.0

Sometimes you forget a birthday or are running late. That's when a gift card is expecially handy. Amazon makes it extremely easy to get one and you can choose the occasion and design.,3.0

Served it's purpose but a bit craft market 'do it yourself' in appearance.  I did like receiving the ones I got but same impression.  They were printed out.  It would be so nice if we could buy them here in NZ Supermarkets.",3.0
It was a convenient feature to be able to print out the giftcard when you don't have the opportunity to go out and purchase one.,3.0
I wasn't sure how to do it and I hope  it will work to the person I gave it to.,3.0
It worked well to send a gift,3.0
"I bought this for my son so he could have his own kindle account and not worry about him being on my account.
I paid for it with a credit card on my account, it should spend the same as a credit card or paypal.. I mean.. it ALREADY paid for! But he tried to pre-buy a book and it wouldn't let him; this is not right, he should be able to buy anything with it as Amazon already has the $$!!!",3.0

"Recently purchased an Amazon Gift Card in a white box as a gift for someone special.  The box arrived with brown smudges on it the consistency of chocolate and one of the seals hanging off the box.  The seal looked like it had been recycled as it had particles of dust and a small piece of hair on it. Fortunately I was able to clean off most of the brown smudges and remove the disgusting seal.  The Amazon Gift Card of course rates a 5, and the recipient was happy to get it. However the gift box, while attractive, barely rates a 3 for the manner in which it was handled. Think in the future I will just order the gift card with no packaging.",3.0

"The gift card is obviously just fine, but the ribbon on the box is not the color pictured in the first picture; if you scroll down to the 5th picture, you'll see something more like the actual.  It is two or three shades lighter than shown so looks less classy, in my book.  The picture makes it look as if it is a deep, rich wine color.  And of course, the bow would have to be ironed to look as perky as in the picture.  It comes rather flattened, wrapped in plastic.",3.0

"This was a gift I sent. I found difficulty in navigating the site to put in the information for the receipient and when they received it didn't know who I sent the gift for. Also I wasn't able to send a note with the gift. This stops me from sending gift cards,",3.0

"The clear circular sticker to seal the box was torn off and very dirty, and the inside of the box that housed the card was dusty and dirty as well- no time to return it and get a fresh one. Also, would be nice to have more choices of ribbon color. Just ok this time.",3.0
This was an anniversary gift for my son and his wife.  The message I included was not in the box. This is not the first time this has happened to me.  What's up Amazon???,3.0
"Disappointed in the purchase...... nice white box and nicer looking plastc card than the black version of the plain amazon gift card.  This box was not wrapped in plastic so the outside of the box had dark marks and scuffs all over the box especially at the edges. Also bought the white heart which half of the bow was undone and even more scuffed than this box, a complete let down if giving as a gift.  Luckily I was between giving the gift cards in their box or sticking them into a card which is what I did.",3.0
"Not bad considering you get a gift box at no extra cost, instead of just handing out little cards. Makes giving a gift card nice since it's pre-wrapped in a nice box with a bow on it.",3.0
"Any gift and under $50 will not set in the correct position when in the gift box.  The barcodes don't match up. So if you're giving a gift card as a gift. And you want the box, then order is w at least $50 on it. A $40 GC wasn't displaying correctly in two slots
It seems a bit sleezy.",3.0
I paid for the gift wrap and it was lousy.  They cut the ribbon too short so there was a half inch or more gap and they just taped it to hold together with the gap showing.  I don't expect this from Amazon,3.0
The box was crushed in the mailing and looked cheap so it was mailed to the recipient in a nice greeting card.,3.0
Plastic case that holds the markers was broken.,3.0
"The gift card was fine, but the gift (white) box was not clean.  My wife had to wash off all the smudges and spots..",3.0
"The box is pretty. Unfortunately, the box also arrived dirty and stained. It is not very dirty, but it is enough that it was noticeable the moment I picked it up. It looks sort of like sticker residue when you peel off a sticker and the stickiness stays. If the box arrived clean, it would be quite lovely. As it is, it is not very suitable for gift-giving.",3.0
"The box arrived very dirty, I almost don't want to give it to the intended person.",3.0
"The card was just as expected.  I was disappointed that the white gift box had black smudge marks which diminished the presentation value.  Since the gift box was nicely packaged for shipping and there was no damage to the shipping box, I assume the smudge must have occurred in the distribution center.",3.0
"I love the idea of the GC and the overnight delivery was awesome!  Unfortunately, my card looked like it had been dropped on a cement floor and drug with someone's foot.  This was a gift and I was a little embarrassed to give what looked like a second-hand card, but I didn't have time to reorder.",3.0
"The box came in a completely intact padded envelope, card looks just fine, but the box looks like the sides were dragged through brown gummy scuz. It came off with some scraping and a wet washcloth, but still...meh. A gift card is a gift card, though, so I'm sure the gift will perform perfectly. The box could have used a second look before packing, though.",3.0
It works fine,3.0
"You can't go wrong getting a gift card, and there wasn't a thing wrong with it, but what are you to do when the gift BOX arrived dinged up and with some spot stains on it (as if someone splashed coffee on it)? Not cool. I'm now faced with finding a suitable replacement.",3.0
Gift card came correctly however it arrived a day late. Not a big deal but expect the delivery times to be accurate.,3.0
This card comes with free 1-day shipping.  There should be a free 2-day shipping option to match the standard Amazon Prime shipping.  That way a gift card can be scheduled to arrive on the same day as another item.  Amazon if you take this suggestion your welcome to send me a gift card or give me a free year of Amazon Prime for a good business idea!,3.0
Giftcard box was broken/scratched.,3.0
"Nice little gift box, but it arrived with one corner smashed.  Just needs better packaging for mailing.",3.0
"An Amazon gift card is very useful, but the gift box was dirty and dented when it arrived. I contacted customer service, who promptly replaced it, but even the replacement had the gift box that was dirty and dented. Less than the first one, but still enough to feel embarrassed to give it to my friend. I don't understand, as most other items from Amazon arrive in pristine condition.",3.0
"3 stars for correct gift amount. I mainly bought this for the box that it came in. I thought I'd be an elegant way to give someone a giftcard, but there were some issues. The box came next day, but upon feeling it, it was of inferior build. It was sticky and had some adhesive residue all over it. Had to give it a wipe before gifting. The bottom of the box had a seethrough platic panel that showed the barcodes. It's fine, but would be nicer if the box had no openings like that. It's a mysterious little box and sort of invites people to turn it over. Would be nice if someone sold empty giftcard boxes though.",3.0
Read previous reviews and was hoping to get a nice box. Nope. Why bother offering them if they don't look nice?,3.0
"I had these plastic cards mailed to me as I was taking them to an occasion as a gift.  (Who wants to give a gift of a printed at home gift card on piece of paper that will easily get lost?)  I filled out the Gift Message thinking there would be a little card that went with it with the message on it.  Nope -- the Gift Message is written on the Packing Slip only.  Defeats the whole purpose.  Helpful hint:  if you are sending these strait to someone, be sure to put your name in the FROM area or they will have no idea who they are from.  It seems as big as Amazon is they'd have a better system for gift cards.  What I expected was this:  A gift card with a wedding motif, and a message preferably on the gift card or at least a greeting card with the gift card that had my message and who it was from.  The ONLY advantage of buying these through Amazon was I got the gift box, otherwise you might as well buy at your local grocery store and have the amount spent used towards grocery store points.  Very Disappointed.",3.0
It's fairly a good ideal It's a neat little gift for a man to give to his wife or other half,3.0
"This was a replacement box for my original order for a $100 gift card as the first box was damaged & dirty.  Replacement was fine except it had a few water spots on it as the original had, but time was too short to get another replacement, so just went ahead with the gift card in the box with this order.  The replacement was done in awesome time and for that I was most thankful!  Thanks.",3.0
"Not bad considering it was free. You essentially get what you paid for. Box is a little flimsy, but colors are as advertised. Mine came with a spot on the white packaging. Nothing to get excited about.",3.0
"Just as everyone else is reporting, our box arrived smudged and a little crushed. However, it's not the box that really matters.",3.0
But the gift box was greasy!  We actually had to clean it with Windex and a lot of black dirt came off it.,3.0
"As some others have said, the box for mine arried a little dirty. Its a great idea to sell giftcards with decorative boxes, but you will be better off getting one of the black gift boxes, or one of the metal cased ones.",3.0
"I was caught off guard by this Amazon gift card purchase. During the Christmas season I purchased a three pack of gift boxed $50 Amazon gift cards - total $150. I did not ask for holiday rush as they were to be given as birthday gifts in the upcoming year. They arrived in nice packaging exactly as anticipated and set aside.  Over 60 days after the cards were purchased, literally the very day the first birthday card was to be distributed I decided to 'double check' the card was activated. I don't even know why I did it except the person whom it was intended gets 'confused' easily and wanted to be able to tell them exacting detail how to redeem the card at the Amazon website.

To my disbelief, after eight attempts of trying to activate the card it kept coming up INVALID. I immediately emailed customer service and instantly alerted to call Customer Service. No Customer Service phone number was provided but did a 'Google Search' to find the number.  Nina answered the Customer Service line, she was very pleasant and assuring she would handle my problem. I appreciated GREATLY not being transferred from one person to another which also assured me Amazon is a reliable business. After about 30 minutes which was mostly silence where Nina appears to been reviewing the initial purchase order and subsequent processing of the order Nina assured me the card was now activated. She said one card was credited to my buyer account for immediate use and the problem solved. Nina also verified the other two cards were also now activated and as I requested she would email me confirmation of all three cards activation. I didn't really want to  know what had happened. I assume 'mistakes happen'. It was taken care of and it was done in a way that was professional and instantaneous.  I am completely satisfied.

However from my experience I now would advise any person buying gift cards
1. Don't buy them singularly, purchase at least one extra for your own use to validate its activation immediately upon receipt.
2. Keep meticulous records of any gift card purchase until it has been redeemed, even if it means questioning the recipient several times after it was given out  -  keep track of the card until it has been used at least one time.
3.  I live in a very safe and relatively crime free community however during the 2013 holidays season several young men were known to have gone down my street late at night examining mail box contents looking for cards with cash or gift cards. This information was validated by the local police department but I didn't know about it until several weeks later - after the gift cards had been ordered and successfully delivered. Obviously Amazon i keeps all customers updated on any package arrival plus I have Amazon Smartphone notifications when any Amazon package is delivered to my home. I am always careful to go to the mailbox immediately  upon a package delivery. It is worth noting this holiday season Amazon offered free overnight delivery of gift cards . . . which I declined but upon retrospect it was likely an option I should of used as it would of provided additional insurance the cards arrive safely.

I would definitely recommend Amazon for any gift card purchase.
- The Amazon site listed multiple local businesses the average Amazon customer may be unaware of.
- Amazon don't just sell their own card and nation wide store gift cards - they also have gift cards for stores that usually don't normally offer gift cards like Whole Foods. When I presented the Whole Foods gift card to the local cashier she said she had never even seen a Whole Foods gift card before and had to call the Manager to help her . . .  and the Manager had never seen one either
- Also when you place an order for some gift cards selections they are sent from the corporate offices not Amazon so there is a slight delay in the processing of these orders.

HOWEVER there is a degree of risk with gift cards I was that unaware of.  I thought I was careful and yet I still caught off guard.  Hope this review and the general comments on gift card purchases helps.",3.0
"Boxes were heavily scratched. Cards were covered in dust from the faux-velvet lining.

Cheap and trashy, but as expected considering the fancy packaging was free.",3.0
"As other reviewers have said, the ""white"" box arrived dirty.  Not so nice to give as a gift, which is the whole point of a gift card box.  Be prepared to wipe the box down before gifting it.  On the plus side, it did arrive the day after I ordered it.",3.0
"After ordering, I was told our company had a policy against giving employees gift cards and without your consent to return the gift cards I was stuck with them. Of course, this wasn't your fault, but a return policy would be nice on the gift cards. Also, the white boxes were filthy dirty. I'm not sure where you are storing these, but they were nasty.",3.0
"I love the concept - the box is beautiful and in great shape. The gift card is a great idea for a gift - HOWEVER. I am not a smoker, but when I opened the package, these things smelled horribly of cigarette smoke and I didn't even want them in my home. It made me gag.",3.0
"Fast shipping. It's nice that you have the option of a gift box included, however the one I received was damaged and has something (glue?) on it that looked like dried yellow boogers - not really what I had wanted to give to a colleague who was retiring... Come on Amazon, take a look at what you're sending the customer. This could have easily been avoided had the person fulfilling the order simply looked at the box.",3.0
the box came a little dirty and the slightest bit dented in some places but i cleaned it up a bit and it was pretty.,3.0

"Though I filled out a nice note to go with the card and the reason to have it delivered in the mail vice e-mail, there was no card with my note or even who it was from!! :(",3.0
"I purchased this giftcard as a gift for valentines day for my boyfriend, the pacakge was just an envolope and the whole box to the giftcard was smooshed and not useable. Also i put a little note and for the giftcard that was just written on the same paper as my invoice and not a seperate giftcard or little note by itself, very unpleased for they way that i recieved it in the mail.",3.0
"The only reason I wouldn't give this a 5-star (does a gift certificate even need stars?) is because while the idea is terrific, to have it arrive already boxed with a pretty little bow, ready to give (thus saving valuable time) my white box upon arrival was in fact, all scratched up and scuffed all along the edges and top, and looked rather dingy.  So I will need to throw that box out and now have to find an alternative presentation, thus eliminating any time savings the pre-wrapped idea was meant to have...  Fortunately, there was no added charge for that white box.",3.0
"I received this and it was sent to me via the gift option. The box first of all is see through on the back so you see the bar code. Secondly, in small print it says amazon gift cards on the bottom of the box. Third, the gift invoice didn't have the ""price paid"" on the bottom but it had the item listed as ""$100.00 Amazon Gift Card in Gift Box"". So there was no waiting until Christmas to find out what was inside the pretty white box with the purple ribbon (or ordering these to put on/under the Christmas tree as gift teasers). Total fail on Amazons part.

If the box didn't have the clear plastic part on the bottom I would have been more surprised at least but then the invoice sheet gave it away when I pulled out the personalized message inside the mailing envelope. If you order this for someone as a gift and don't want them to have it right away send it to someone else first or let the recipient know not to open the package coming in the mail. The box is nice from the top and the presentation is nice, just mailing as a gift option doesn't work out too well.",3.0
"The packaging/mailing box on this and my other gift cards needed to be taped! I slid my hand right inside the end and pulled it open. And why would you have us include a gift note to the recipient if it was going to be typed ON THE INVOICE !! DUH ..

"I didn't want to print a card. I wanted to email one so the layout didn't work well for my needs because half would be upside down.

Bought as a gift so do not know yet,3.0
ok,3.0
its OK. No big deal.,3.0
"I like the idea of uploading a photo to personalize the gift card.  The only thing I was disappointed in was the inability to fill more of space allotted for the picture.  Maybe I missed something, but turning the picture may have been a better way.  Unfortunately, once I printed it, it was too late.

I would however recommend this to a friend, great idea.",3.0

They don't fit great in my ears. Not very durable. Sound quality is average at best.

"Gift card, what's to say....",3.0
"I'm just gonna say it's OK, and here's why.  I'm sure it works exactly as promised.  However the person I bought it for easily forgot about it because it was just an-email card.  I'm sure it's just that person, however it just isn't the same as giving someone a real gift.  I actually didn't even get a thank-you yet, because that person still hasn't used it.  Probably way down their in-mail box somewhere.",3.0

If you remove the gift card from the holder and just give the card to your recipient, they will not be able to get the card activated and it will have no value. I almost made this mistake. I removed the gift card from the card holder and put it in a decorative box. Then I realized the card needed to be activated. I didn't have time to buy a new gift card, so I had to give the recipient the card and the ripped card holder and explain my stupid mistake. I was quite embarrassed.

The funny thing was when we tried to put it on  the table evenly. It wasn't rectangular. Not really a good trapezoid either.

Two stars left off because it did not get any quality control.",3.0
"Card worked fine, but it was a PITA to get the system to approve my card.  As it turns out, the plastic card I was carrying had an expiration date that was one month off from what the bank computers reported, so the purchase was cancelled, but nobody could ever tell me WHY it was cancelled so I spent an inordinate amount of time troubleshooting the Amazon system but nobody there could tell me why the gift card purchase wasn't approved...so I finally called my bank and asked them if there was some kind of ""stop approval"" for Amazon; that's when we discovered the card print error.

"You gotta read the fine-print.  It states on the product page and on the card itself that these must be redeemed online and not in-theater.  Fandago is a third-party service, so you can't use their gift-cards in-theater.  It's a pain... but at the same time, it's a little ridiculous reading all these complaints from people who can't be bothered to actually research what they're buying.  That should just be something you do, regardless.  If you want a gift-card to use in-theater, you gotta get the theater-specific gift-cards.  Not a third-party card produced for use on a specific website.

The convenience fee's are steep, but that's where their profit comes from, so I can't complain too much.  Running a service like this isn't free.  And a lot of theaters offer promotional offers or rewards programs that can cut down or even eliminate fees.  Problem is, these cards aren't perfect and the customer service is pretty mediocre, so you can run into problems pretty easily.

If you encounter a problem and are having trouble with Fandango, I'd also recommend calling your local theater and explaining the situation calmly.  (Aka, don't throw a fit, since the theater and Fandango are not the same thing.)  It's possible that if you can't get help from Fandango, the theater might be able to swap your tickets for another time/movie at the very least, or work out another solution.

On the whole, I really don't recommend Fandango cards.  It's a lot easier, and sometimes cheaper, to just get cards for your specific theater, since they usually sell tickets on their own website.",3.0

If they are limited again my girls will have to be happy with another supplier. I was just  acting on their Christmas list request.,3.0
"I bought this for a family friend of mine and I was happy to see that amazon also offer it. It was more of a convenience factor which made me order this gift card. The process was quick and simple.

"This product will not protect a keyboard from spills and the two strips of double-sided tape they send are not very helpful at holding the cover in place. I put double-stick tape on every other key and on all keys around the perimeter to hold it better. This cover will work great to keep dust and animal hair out from under the keys, but again, do not count on it for spill protection because the liquid will get in once it reaches the edges of the cover. The Lenovo keyboards (w541) are recessed and to truly offer spill protection, the cover would have to extend well beyond (at least .5"" / 1 cm) the edges of the keyboard so it can get taped on better.",3.0

It was quite good at converting itself into any form of solid state matter of my choosing, although after one conversion it seemed to remain set as that item permanently.

After I gave it to him, he called to say that the piece of paper I had printed had no redemption code! Fortunately, I had saved the download link and was able to retrieve the card again and see the redemption code online. I test printed it again out of curiosity--on two different printers--and sure enough the code did not print. Not cool. When I contacted Amazon about this glitch, it was only to bring it to their attention as there was no need for action. From the response I got, it was clear that tech support didn't even read my message, so I gave up. The lesson here is to make sure you can see the redemption code on your printed card, or be sure to write it in yourself. Better yet, just buy an actual gift card at the supermarket.",3.0

First, I had a little trouble finding how to buy a gift card that would be sent via Facebook and then had trouble finding the denomination of gift card I was trying to send. I think that was because the pictures showed $100, but apparently, you click on it and make the denomination whatever you want. The other problem is that if you don't hear from the person you give it to as is common for nephews and nieces, you don't know if they ever got it through Amazon notifications. I didn't see anywhere to tell me exactly how they would receive it although I thought it might be a FB message which kids often delete.

There's no way to scan the cards with your phone either. That means having to type in each card number (19 digits) then scratching to reveal the pin number to type in another 4. It's a pain when purchasing multiple tickets that cost more than a single $15 dollar card so you're there typing, scratching, typing, typing, scratching, typing from several cards like a weirdo.",3.0

"This review is directed towards Microsoft who really needs to get their act together regarding these gift cards.  They have Windows Store cards and Xbox Store cards which are the exact same thing with different packaging.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to redeem this card in the Windows Store; an Xbox game console is required.  I called MS about this problem and their response was to use a different browser.  How stupid can they get?  Why in the hell would I install Chrome or Safari on my W10 computer to redeem a gift card for MS store?  After being transferred several times, the MS rep told me nothing could be done to resolve a problem with a card purchased from Amazon and put me on hold indefinitely.  Id10t!!  I contacted Amazon who agreed to eat the $25 cost even though they purchased the item from MS.  I went through the process of redeeming the card via my Xbox to assist the Amazon rep with troubleshooting the problem.  MS should be aware of this problem and not treat their customers like dirt.  Here's hoping that MS will see this review and fix this mess.  Few customers would have taken the time to troubleshoot the problem.",3.0

"The reason I am giving this three stars is that there isn't anywhere on the card where it says it is worth $10 each, so you kind of have to tell the recipient in some way that it is only a $10 card.  Secondly, the glue they use to keep them together in the package leaves a residue on the back that is impossible to remove. This makes the card less than desirable.

Next time I will just go and buy individual cards.  These were teacher gifts so I didn't have to see the teacher they were given to.  At least they got something (from my son, who is in middle school, and even the P.E. teachers got them).  So, that's my two cents on the product.",3.0

I'm at a loss in writing a review for a gift card. It served it's purpose in sending money to a friend and it is something that is very handy when you are at a loss for something to buy someone as a gift.,3.0
The card was as expected.  The ordering was more complicated than I expected. That is why I gave it the rating it received.,3.0
"I didn't have a problem with the purchase. However, my son could not use to purchase an online code to use for his XBox. I wasn't too happy about that. If you offer gift certificates, then the person using it should be able to purchase ANYTHING on your site....just saying",3.0

I prefer being able to order a gift card to be mailed to me as I don't have a printer at home so I had to find a place to go order and print.

"This printed nicely, folds into four sections of letter-sized page.

I signed onto my desktop & still could not find the 4 cards I had ordered & personalized. So, I re-purchased & personalized, then it allowed me to checkout...where I found 8 cards waiting. I tried every avenue before to locate the first cards. I have no idea how this should work. Must there be a printer attached to the device i order on? I was going to print later from my email. Do be careful, as a previous reviewer noted, if you wish to order more than one ""print from home"" card. Each time I request to make a second card, system takes me to ""emailed cards"". It would be very easy not to notice the apparent system flaw. Cards posted & printed promptly.",3.0

Great to give Amazon Gift Cards to people at a distance that you're not sure about what they would like.  At Amazon they can find anything!  Perfect!  The only problem with this deal was we were led to believe that we would get a $25 bonus gift card for each $100 we spent.  We ordered a $200 gift card expecting two $25 gift cards.  None came.  After inquiries they eventually gave us one $25 card.  Kind of frustrating.  Recipient loved the $200 gift card though!  I recommend it.,3.0

Punctual and well received,3.0
Well it was an easy present and what she wanted.  It just seems to lack class.  Part of getting a good present is finding something that means a great deal to the recipient.,3.0

This was OK.  I thought you would be sending me the hard gift cards instead of the paper ones for my grandchildren.,3.0
"I am disappointed that only 1 person has used their card so far out of 4 sent.  This is not the fault of the card.  The transaction with Amazon was seamless, and the follow-up was prompt.  It may either be the fault of the whole concept or the modest amount of the gift ($15).",3.0
Its good if you don't have to mail it. I didn't think it through first before I purchased these. Next time I will purchase the Amazon sent cards or the email sent cards if need to be sent away. Lesson learned I guess.,3.0
The recipient deleted the e-mail gift card thinking it was junk mail.  When I asked about it later she went back and located it.  Don't think I will use this again.,3.0
I wanted to send a total of 6 $25 gifts. I entered one and then it asked if I wanted to add more. I clicked this optin and added the other 5. When all was done it sent 6 $/25 gifts and 1 single $25 gift fot the first one I entered so I ended up giving one person 2 $25 gifts when I only wanted one. Apparently when you click to add more it doesn't take into consideration the one you already sent and includes it with the addition instead of just the added ones. You have to change your site as it is very misleading and cost me an extra $25 I had not intended to give. Won't do that again.,3.0
"We love Amazon, but in ordering e-Gift Cards, we've not had the best of luck. I purchased one for my Brother for Christmas.....it took TWO weeks for him to get it, electronically!

"They need to get a zero.  This gift card was not activated on arrival.  I bought two of these. One worked, the other didn't. I hope  Amazon  replaces the card, especially since they did the same thing with two Kohl's cards I bought.  Lesson learned.  DO NOT buy gift cards from Amazon or do not buy more than one card at a time.
***UPDATED***. I spoke with two really nice people at Amazon customer service.  The Kohls gift card is being reissued and the Quaket Steak had to be refunded, as they had no more in stock.  The people who packaged my order should get a minus 5, the Customer service reps I spoke with deserve higher than a 5.  I upgraded it from a one star to a 3.  I would recommend not buying more than one card at a time, though.",3.0

They did, and he did get it, finally.  But it totally ruined the surprise.  Get it together Amazon!  They did give me a $5 credit for the inconvenience though (which I had to request, but I still appreciate it).

Even as I write this review they show $100.00 as the amount on the card in the preview image under my recent purchases. Seeing that, I thought something went wrong with my order, and I had to log in and review my purchases to make sure that, in fact, I bought a $20 gift card as expected. What's the point of showing an amount on the preview image if it's not going to match with the purchase price? Just show a generic gift card image.",3.0
"I love Amazon, and the gift card idea is a wonderful one.  What I don't love is the tiny print that says your gift card may not be delivered right away.

I don't know exactly how it worked but when I emailed two or three weeks after sending it to say, ""hey, just checking, you did get that voucher, right?"" my friend said, ""nope"" but then a few hours later emailed to say ""ahah! got it""...

I used this for a gift card given to an 11 year old.  I was told he opened it in a matter of minutes which is fine but I was hoping it might take him a little longer.  It did work however it's a pretty flimsy plastic so one has to be careful when handling it...not worth the price,3.0
"I wasn't thrilled with this and ended up returning it. It's a neat concept, but it was very difficult to get the ball in just the right position, plus it had a little bug stuck in it. I would not recommend this for kids' gift cards for sure. I do like the idea if only it were a bit more user friendly.",3.0
"It's alright, kind of flimsy though and super-easy to do.  I'm not one for puzzles, but I had to open it in order to get the card in it.  It only took me about 30 seconds to get it open.  It will hold a single gift card or one bill because the space available is very thin.  If you want something fun for an adult, then this probably isn't it.  It would be good for younger kids, maybe 7 years old and younger.",3.0
"Works nicely, not very challenging and tends to be a bit flimsy.  But it does the job and a bit fun.",3.0
"There are two major parts to this unit.  First is a top panel with a recessed area to hold the gift card.  An attached flip-up door covers the gift card.  The second major part is the maze itself.  It contains several small pieces.  There is the ball you navigate through the maze.  There is a spring loaded catch which holds the door shut, and there is a slider switch which is used to push the ball into the catch to release the door.  There is also a spring loaded plunger which helps push the door open when it is released.  The problem is that the two parts should have come glued together.  A little plastic model cement easily fixed that problem, but it was still annoying.  Deduct two stars.

Without the gift card, it is real simple to complete the maze.  When the gift card is inserted, it covers the top, so the maze has to be flipped over.  Now the recessed area for the gift card creates ramps at the outer paths, making some of the turns very difficult.  Dont tell the recipient, but the easiest way to solve the maze when it contains a gift card is to hold it over your head so you can see the bottom (no ramps to negotiate).  This can also be used to get it open initially, since it comes with a fake gift card.",3.0

Very dubious customer support by Amazon.com upon reporting one of the cards stolen.  The customer service center that was responsible for replacement was extremely inefficient.

"BOTTOM LINE:

If you're trying to take advantage of 6 months no interest/5% back with the the Amazon card, I recommend planning ahead a couple of days and ordering the physical gift cards. These e-mails aren't quite reliable enough.

My experience:

- Purchased four $100 gift cards
- Received confirmation from Amazon in about 5 minutes
- Received the gift cards about 45 minutes later- sweet!
- Clicked ""Get Gift Card"" in the first e-mail, a page opened, but nothing loaded
- Tried the remaining three emails, those links didn't work either
- Contacted customer service via phone, spoke with a lady that had a hard time even taking my order # (bad sign), let alone addressing the issue; eventually asked to be transferred
- A couple more transfers/calls and still little to no help
- Resent the cards to myself (your account > your orders > resend e-mail)
- Two hours later the status still says ""scheduled""
- Attempted to chat with Juan, we were disconnected a couple of times, but he said he'd need to forward to the gift card department and it could take 1-2 days to hear back... to which I replied, ""That's unacceptable. Cancel the order...""
- We were disconnected again, then Gurpreet connected
- I explained that I expected to be able to use the gift cards nearly immediately, but since that didn't appear to be an option I wanted to cancel the order
- After about ten minutes, he came back and wasn't able to help... he, too, need to contact the gift card department and it'd be about 24-48 before the order would be canceled.

UPDATE:

Working cards finally arrived about 10 hours after I received confirmation of my order. I visited Gamestop's site and verified the Card #s + PINs- all worked and the balances were correct.

UPDATE 2:

Well, they finally got around to cancelling the cards now that they worked. This is the most incompetent customer service I've have ever experienced.

UPDATE 3:

Purchased the cards again while I wait for my balance to be restored. Worked flawlessly this time. Would be 5 stars if not for the half day of getting the run around.",3.0

Still only received 3,
Finally received a 4th, all 4 balances checked out with Brinker card balance, and thought everything was good, then a hour or so later I received another 1 which wiped out 2 of the good ones.
I'm still left with only 3 that have verified balances with Brinker, which verifying is further complicated because Brinker will only allow so many cards to be verified (5, I think) in one 24 hr period, so I had to keep waiting a full day to check if what I had was any good.
I'm out $15 - $25 less the supposed $10 savings I got.
Will never buy e gift cards again.

The last time my daughter used hers, it would not go through at the check out, not very good service,  not sure how's at fault, it was taken care of and my daughter went back to the store and purchased her food.  Lets try to remember, whole foods is over a 45 minutes away from where we live--not very good service with the last purchase.  I will purchase again for my daughter, if we have another issue, I will no longer purchase this gift card.",3.0
"The only problem is that each time I want to use it I have to open the email, get the link, and then use and scan. It has a solid moving, scrolling tag saying save to Samsung pay. I now have an iPhone so this doesnt work and gets in the way. If I could save it to the iPhone wallet it would be very easy to use.

It is still good because I get 5% off with my amazon card on this and thus 5% off at Whole Foods.",3.0

I bought it as a gift to my roommate. He received it and open the link with no problem. However when he tried to use it about an hours later it didn't go through. He called the number on the card to check the balance and was told the card was invalid. However the next day he tried it again and it did work. He can also check the balance too. It looks there is a delay between the time when you buy the card and the card go into Wholefoods system.,3.0

It is stated that you can receive the card less than 5 minutes but it has been three hours and still no e-gift card. This is my last time with this because I can live without playing games. Just want to have a little fun since I don't do anything else entertaining.,3.0
great deal ....no kidding!,3.0

This has been a frustrating purchase. Digital gift cards should be delivered digitally and immediately! What is the point of purchasing something digitally if you have to wait for it to be shipped through the mail? Furthermore the directions in the listing don't make it clear where to find the card number and code.  It took me a while to figure out that the digital card (piece of paper) could be opened to reveal the card number and code.  Once I got through the frustration of locating the information then it was easy to add it to the app.,3.0

I agree with other reviewers that the grand total of packaging for shipping, the cardboard itself, and the time involved made not much difference in how it was received.  The card maybe biodegradable, but the padding in the envelope seems just as unlikely to bio-degrade quickly, either.",3.0

And the shipping was around 7 or 8 dollar which took put of my gift card. Then I couldn't buy anything over 5 dollars, everytime I tried my payment was declined so I got some cheap rings and shirts all under 5 dollars. Now I would've given this card a 1 star rating but since amazon costumer has been extremely friendly and gone out of their way for me in the past I decided a 3 star review was good enough, but just be careful buying amazon gift cards since it can be a little wonky and maybe next time get a wart instead since I had no trouble with them and I got free shipping",3.0

I would have given them 4 stars (they are cheaply made but do the job) but out of the 12 I had 2 broken ones and 2 without balls. That left me with 8 usable mazes and I have 10 gifts to give. I am going to look at get replacements for a later gift giving event.  I would recommend buying them but don't wait until the last minute to fill them or you may be short like me.,3.0

"The Taco Bell I went to was out of beef. It was only a bit after 10 p.m.
I had to order more expensive thigns (that I didn't really like) and wasted my money. The chalupa I ordered was inedible. I have always had GREAT food and service from TB, but this was awful.
However, the card was sent in a decent amount of time. I suppose I should blame this TB and not the seller. I am sorry, but I have an issue to deal with as far as Taco Bell is concerned!",3.0
I will give these as gifts. they will purchase good tacos. The gift cards are very plain.,3.0
My friend says they work well.,3.0
Feels like there was only like 10 dollars on this card...feel like I got ripped off..never again,3.0
The only problem I had with the card is taco bell won't take the remaining balance off it and let me pay the rest. instead they want me to reload it,3.0

Its great- only reason for 3 stars is because I was going to get a $15 credit if I bought the $50 & still haven't received it.,3.0
I was not as impressed with this packaging compared to the adorable cupcake tin amazon gift card holders...I rate the tins 5star!,3.0

"Many of the reviews are correct, it is difficult to redeem the cards. I could not after many times trying on different computers.

"Revision: since I wrote this review Airbnb customer service contacted my wife and allowed her to get full credit for all the gift cards.

Airbnb doesn't tell you that you can only use one card PER STAY. They will not let you use multiple cards so if your stay costs more than $100 you cannot use another gift card.

Also, if your stay costs less than $100 you do not get a credit.",3.0
"Had a hard time applying multiple cards into one account, and Airbnb customer service was really terrible. I wouldn't recommend it.",3.0

I don't know if this works because I was unable to put it on my account because it's not a US currency with a US-based credit card.,3.0

"Placed a gift card order over one hour ago for the ""print at home"" cards, that I've ordered successfully many times, the whole point being that you can print them within minutes! Not this time! I entered my orders, personalized my messages on each, used my Chase Freedom card I've as my default on my Amazon account as payment, clicked purchase and....waiting, waiting, and waiting for Amazon to process the payment! This is a huge customer disappointment/convenience issue as I see on other reviews here. I understand that gift card purchases and scams are the #1 fraud area, but if banks such as Chase have fraud detection methods in place to intelligently detect and prevent fraud (which they do, and they are fantastic and are no inconvenience to me as a customer) then why can't Amazon do the same? As one other review commented, and the situation is the exact same for me, I've clearly authenticated my account via a variety of measures, and, most of all, the credit card I'm using is the same one I've used at Amazon forever, and clearly it's mine! So not sure what rationale Amazon have for blocking such orders from a customer such as me since 1997 that passed all order fraud checks that outweighs the inconvenience Amazon is now causing their customers! Come on Amazon, partner with Chase and sync up your fraud prevention systems and facilitate good verified customer transactions, not block them!",3.0

"Shipping was fast. However, the card box cap was bent and does not look good as a gift. It does not seem to be caused by the shipment from Amazon to my home because the black gift card box is inside of a bigger Amazon box and the bigger Amazon box does not have any bending or damage. Also, it appears that the black gift card is made of cheap material.",3.0
The grad hat is fun way to give a gift card!  The only problem is that the card doesnt have the amount printed on it.,3.0

"I bought two of these gift cards for a double baby shower I was attending. I found it a little awkward to open as did one of the recipients. On my order I checked off that it was a gift. By checking off it was a gift the cards were supposed to come with a gift receipt stating the amount, how to use it and who it was from. The gift receipts were not in my package. I am just hoping that the recipients do not have a problem with them. The packaging was cute but I did have to buy a card and a gift bag for the gift cards.",3.0
"The only thing about this order was they left off the note I clearly sent along with the card.  The recipient could not figure out who sent this gift and ended up calling so many people until they reached me.  Other then that, I would have given this 5 stars.",3.0
Ordered 2...one was fine the other damaged.  I am sure the recent grad won't care...just frustrating.,3.0
"This card was cute, but the personalized note I added was not on it. This is the second time I've used an amazon gift card and my notes have not made it on the card, so the recipient has no idea who it came from. Makes it a bit useless.",3.0
I wish Amazon had a metal gift box for baby gift cards like they do for birthdays.,3.0
The only problem was that I ordered multiple cards but l in different dollar amounts and there was no marking as to which was which.,3.0
"Great packaging, but the cards don't include the dollar amount associated.  If you have multiple denominations, you need to match up the serial numbers off the order on the amazon website.  I would recommend getting cards with the dollar amount on them.",3.0
"Better to have this delivered to your house instead, or else the recipient wouldn't know who it came from.  Good thing I did. I ordered 2 of these, each with gift receipts and their own gift messages. However, when I received the package, it only consisted of the gift cards (no gift receipt, no gift message). That's my only gripe. The actual cap box with tassel is actually pretty cute.",3.0
"Ok this is absolutely adorable, HOWEVER it would be nice if Amazon prints a small gift card inside saying the amount so I don't have to tell the person how much it is.  Kind of not cool.  If not for that I would have given it 5 stars",3.0
"It looked like a box, but it's really a flat sheet, which appears to look like a box in the picture where you see it in a hand.",3.0
"easy to order and ship, however was not given the option to include a note. Kind of weird  to send a gift card without the ability to include a note.",3.0
I sent this gift card as a birthday gift to my niece. She received it and did not know who it was from since the gift message we wrote was never included in the package. My brother had to call around to see who sent it. He did say that the actual gift card was cute.,3.0
"The gift card arrived on time.  The reason for only three stars was because the recipient had to make several calls to find out who sent it.  I had filled out a message to go with the gift card, but it was not included.  Amazon needs to work on this!",3.0
Always a joy,3.0

"The cards were emailed fast. I personally would purchase gift cards for another store, not Ulta. I spent about 45 minutes on the phone with Ulta trying to use these cards. They CANNOT be used together on their website. I had to call them, give them the card numbers and have them merge them into one card, wait for them to email be back, call them again because they were not working, be told they were working, try again, call them again to finally have things fixed so that I could use MY money for one transaction. I have purchased Sephora gift cards off Amazon and they are always much easier to use and can be combined.",3.0
Arrived 2 days later than originally scheduled day to arrive. Different design than in the picture.,3.0

I thought the black inner holder (if you will) would come with the tin, as pictured.

This is probably a minor detail, but I'm very into the appearance of gifts, so I'm a bit disappointed.",3.0

I had bought two gift cards and sent them to two different brides.

I don't know if it was the packaging or who put the card box together but it was all bent out of shape. The part that was supposed to pop out didn't pop out because it was tucked into the slot where the gift card was. I spent time trying to fold it into place but it didn't work. Sad and disappointed that it doesnt look nice. It came in a sealed bag so I assumed that it is fine. As I was finally ready to wrap it up into a box I decided to check it and found that it was bent in all the wrong places.,3.0

"Cute box but watch out if you are ordering more than one and in different amounts. I got 8 in the mail that all looked exactly the same and nowhere does it say how much each of them are worth!

Crazy though, the receipt in the package lists only 2 serial numbers (out of 8) and they don't show those gift cards under the same amount! So I am having to cross fingers and hope I am sending the right amount to the right person! Never again!",3.0

Speaking two languages make you a bilingual, three makes you a trilingual but if you speak only one, that makes you an American.

These are very cute and convenient to send to my family. My only complaint is that they do not list the amount when they send it.

"Fair warning, my store was not able to except the gift card by scanning my phone nor manually typing in numbers. It had to be printed. Thankfully, the employees were kind enough to give me the store email address and they printed it for me, but it was obviously a hassle for everyone involved.

"The card works fine but I should point out you absolutely have to print it out and take it to a store for it to work. I figured it'd work if I had the code or the barcode or whatever for it or if I saved it on Android pay which the gift card did prompt me to do as a convenience but then the store wouldn't take it any way other than printed.

That is absurd!  They tell her the only way she can use it, is if she prints it out.  What a hassle!  I gets barcodes scanned all the time at stores right from my inbox.  Buyers beware!",3.0

"Amazon gift cards are a great idea for last-minute gifts or those hard-to-buy-for recipients.

"I used both the black light and ""torch"" functions last night.  I had planned to use the black light to find caterpillars that were eating some of my plants.  Caterpillars are usually phosphorescent in the black light.  Unfortunately a nearby street light made the black light useless. I was able to find two of the pesky critters using the flashlight. The black light isn't very strong, meaning the light isn't thrown very far, so you pretty much have to go branch by branch, instead of the whole plant at one sweep.
I find the switch between the light and black light easy to use.  I discarded the wrist strap because it interfered with the batteries. I dropped the flashlight once (on carpet) and it still works fine.  I'm happy with the flashlight and black light, especially for the low price I paid.",4.0

Yes, buy it and you can send electronically to a friend who can then use it to buy something on Amazon. It's like money in their bank account. The only reason it doesn't get five stars is I think Amazon should give you a few extra perks by using their internal credit card.",4.0

"A convenient way to give a gift, when you do not know what the recipient would want, need, or use. Hard to believe the recipient could not find something in Amazon's huge inventory to like, and the assurance that Amazon's customer service is top notch, should the person have a problem.

Having a couple of gift cards in the house eliminates the sudden need for a gift and no time to shop.",4.0

"The gift card is good for the person I am buying for, and I am sometime asked to give it as a gift for someone but it has some problems.
First, I cannot get it through the Australian amazon site. Therefore, if I want to give $100 dollars (Aust) it costs me more - it did not cost me less when the Aus and USA dollar were equal or the Aust was slightly higher.

Also, the directions on the screen were not totally clear about getting the ecard.

The only thing I do not like is that I get 'no' notice of when they used the card.  In this case I sent it as a surprise and thus have no clue if the recipient even received it and I don't want to ask her as that obviously would have given the surprise away.

Amazon needs to work on this so gift cards don't show up as spam or bulk.  I had to sent it to her friend's email address.  I know email marketers like constant contact places web bugs in on email marketing messages so the person sending the mail knows transparently that the reader opened the message.  This would help Amazon, by letting its customers know that the gift email message was received.  Next time, I'll stick to Hallmark, plastic gift card, and snail mail.

The last time I used one of these myself there was a downside to them. You can't use the card to just buy anything listed on Amazon. It had to be purchased either directly from Amazon or an approved vendor (basically anybody you can get SuperSaver discount on). I don't know if that has changed, but if not just be aware.",4.0

I'll still send Amazon gift cards but I'll probably send them through snail mail so they don't get buried in the other miscellaneous emails we all have in our virtual mail boxes these days.",4.0

"I needed a quick present for my Daughter's birthday.  I know - I'm lazy.  I looked and looked for something to buy her and was uninspired by anything I came across.  At the ripe old age of 27 - she has more stuff than I do.

It was fairly quick and easy to purchase.  The only thing is that I wasn't able to send the card to her email box. (I STILL don't know why.)  So, the next best thing was to send it to Facebook.  I would have preferred a more private way to deliver her present, instead of announcing it to the world on FB.  Whatev.  She got a present.  I got a job done.",4.0

It wasn't your fault, but the gift cards I bought went to England alright, but then got automatically processed into the recipient's spam box. With a tip or two and a little fumbling it was all worked out. It has to be the easiest gift in the world . . . to the point of guilt . . . but at least they get what they want.  D. Otos",4.0

"As a 'thank you' I gave a Kindle to a friend who doesn't have a PC. I established that he didn't need one; all that is required may be done via Kindle wi fi. Then I tried to buy a gift card to go with it. I visited 3 retailers (In Melbourne, Australia): The Good Guys, JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman to be told by all they are not available in Australia! If Kindles are sold in Australia, by retailers, why on earth are gift cards also not sold? Frankly crazy...

I since learned that the recipient does not have a credit card: all bills are paid by DD from his (Australian) bank.

HOW does he buy more books, after his credit has been used? Nowhere can I find an answer on your sites.

If you could tell me that he can Google from his Kindle then he could (?) order another gift card but he doesn't have a printer...

What do you suggest? I have been trying to find a Contact Us indication; but can't. Hope someone will read this and respond.

"I bought this Spa model to treat one ankle problems. I mounted the unit on a can large enough to contain the unit, my foot and to have my ankle totally submerged. I modified the can with a large drain valve ( bought from a swimming pool store). I use the can and the unit in a bath tub and I sit on the bath tub edge. This arrangement concentrates the jet flows to the ankle, can use hot or cold water, limits the amount of water and drains the water in short time. Also the unit upper support can be fully folded on the can rim. This eliminates the potential problems related to suction cup failures.
I would have preferred a higher jet strength but the reduced size of the can made the spas adequate.",4.0

I like the convenience of it as well as the quick surface mail delivery of the card, even during the holidays (which this design makes clear).  The design selection is good for holidays and life events like birthdays.

OK, so why four stars?  As others have noted, there does not appear to be a confirmation of redemption by the recipient.  Given the fact that mail and delivery theft occurs (several packages from Amazon to my home have come up missing), it would be nice to receive confirmation of some sort. I don't need to know what it was used for (not my business), but I would like to know the recipient actually used it.  I know Amazon offers the recipient the option to send an email message to the sender (at redemption), but it is not automatic.

"The author gave me a copy in exchange for my honest opinion. In no way was I paid or asked for a good review.

First ,I Love reading fantasy. It's my all time favourite genre and one I write in.

Now, the Hybrid by Ms Shelton was a very entertaining read. I have to admit that I didn't expected the Hybrid to be such an entertaining novel. There are so many twist and turns, an a couple I haven't seen coming at all.

The main character is well fleshed out and easily to relate too. Even the sub - characters were well developed.

The fantasy part in this novel was my favorite. Ms. Shelton painted beautiful pictures with her words that flashes beautiful in ones mind.

If you are a fantasy freak like me, the Hybrid is a novel to read.",4.0

The birthday card and envelope for the birthday card came inside of an amazon envelope, that was inside of a bubble lined shipping envelope (confused yet?). When I opened the bubble lined envelope and saw a sealed white envelope with the Amazon logo on it I was a bit apprehensive. I wasn't sure if I should break the seal or if there was another envelope inside or not. I took my chances and broke the seal and there was in fact another envelope inside of the white amazon envelope (along with the card and gift card). Whew. Amazon, maybe don't seal the envelope next time? Thanks. ",4.0

"This is maybe the best gift card that $50 can buy! It's the standard size of a plastic gift card, and comes with a themed greeting card and matching envelope. The only way you could improve this would be to have an option for a smaller card that would fit inside the actual greeting card that you bought (because, really, Amazon's card is not a the greeting card you want to give). I mean, Amazon is kind of hogging the spotlight with this large card. That's why I only gave it 4 stars.
In any case, if you are looking for a $50 Amazon gift card to give to a recent graduate, I don't think you can do any better than this one.",4.0

"I was a little skeptical about 1 day guaranteed shipping but decided to test it out. This was bought for my girlfriends birthday to go with her kindle fire HDX 7"" I got her for christmas(which by the way rocks). I bought this gift card the day before her birthday around 1p.m central and it arrived the next day at 6p.m.

I'm very impressed with Amazon shipping

If amazon reads these, you should consider making it simple to add a gift card on a kindle. I wasn't able to go to her ""shop"" icon and add it. Instead, I had to go to her browser and log in to her amazon account and add it from the web. Why make it so hard on people that are not very computer/technology literate?

I'm happy(and so is she) with the gift card and it will be put to good use. Thanks amazon!",4.0

"It's a great way of giving somebody the freedom to buy their own stuff rather than buying them something they may not like! I bought this card for my boyfriend's 27th birthday and there was an option to write a personalized letter. I did, but when the card came the message was on a different piece iof paper; I assumed it would have been printed on the card. I ended up writing the note on the card with my chicken-scratch of a handwriting, but my boyfriend loved it anyways! I would recommend this but don't expect your note to be on the card.",4.0

It's a gift card so it's what you expect. For the card putting any info in the card should be more straight forward and it should automatically tell you who it is from. The person I gave this to said there was no indication.,4.0

It came fast as they said it would be.  Very impressed! This was a surprise birthday gift to my teenage godson.

"I bought the Kindle for my husband a couple Christmas' ago.  I still don't know why I am getting all the Kindle ads and he still can't use any gift cards on his Kindle.

"I would give it five stars except that the card is too big.  I like to attach the gift card to an inexpensive box gift because it's better to give a box gift to someone rather than an envelope.  But some inexpensive boxed gifts are actually smaller than the gift card which makes it impractical.

Instead of 7-1/4"" x 5-1/2"" and more practical size for the card would be 4"" x 3""",4.0

"I ordered a Kindle gift card for a friend's birthday in early December.  According to tracking, I was supposed to have received it included in another order.  When I realized that it was not in the package, I called to check.  The card had already been activated by then which leads me to believe that it was stolen at a point before it had left Amazon.  The good news is that Amazon was so easy to work with and immediately sent a replacement card.  Sadly, it was too late for the intended occasion, but I did send it on to my friend with a note of explanation.",4.0
"The gift was for a kndle user who has prime and downloads books, movies and tv shows.  He loved it.  I would give it five stars if the words I requested were written inside the card showing the name of the person receiving the gift, from whom it came and a short note.  Instead the requested words go on a small faded piece of simple paper in boring black ink and you have to cut out the paper and put it in the envelope.",4.0

This pretty card makes the perfect gift for Christmas. It is not too expensive but also looks appealing and festive.,4.0
Too bad that you did not send the note and greeting to the receiver.  He didn't know who sent this to him.,4.0
"Amazon offers an amazing deal with free overnight/ next day delivery of these gift cards. One caveat however, you should order MORE than one day in advance of when you will need it (especially near the holidays!). Amazon cannot control the efficiency of third party shippers like USPS or Fed-Ex. I ordered my gift card on the afternoon of the 17th, Amazon shipped the same day, but I received it on the 20th. 4 stars for great concept, minus a star for execution.",4.0

"Both the greeting card and gift card arrived quickly and look as pictured.  However the ""included free personalization"" is not printed on the actual card.  Instead it is printed on a seperate small piece of paper that is of no use.",4.0
"My siblings and I draw names for each other for Christmas each year, and since I don't always know what my sisters want for Christmas, I often get them gift cards. Amazon gift cards are relatively simple to activate and use and I know that my sisters will use it (unlike guessing if they like Macaroni Grill or Macy's).

The gift cards would be a much better option if the gift options included adding a message to the actual card. However, since I don't really mind sending blank cards (my grandma sometimes just sends cards with her named signed on the inside, so it seems normal to me), I will usually just email whomever the card is for with a short message so they know it's coming and don't think it's so odd that it's blank.

Overall, I think gift cards are a great gift if it's to some place that the recipient will use, and Amazon is so diverse that it's pretty easy to know someone will use it for something they really like.",4.0
"I like the greeting card option. I gave 4 stars because there were only 2 options for the greeting cards.

"This is going to sound terrible ""OCD'ish"" but I was expecting a more solid gift card in the card.  It is kind of papery and flimsy.

I only hope all the gift cards are in the Christmas Cards inside each of the six I ordered. If all goes well with my message on each one I will give a better rating. Of course all the cards were an equal amount so there is no confusing and no necessary names added on the inside. I will only add the names on the outside envelope.,4.0

"I ordered a gift card with the free Snowboarding Snowman Greeting Card and one-day shipping on Tuesday night, and it arrived on Thursday night as I expected.  The card was really cute.  The only things that I didn't like were that: (1) you can't tell that the gift card is from Amazon.com until you turn the card over, so the person who received the card couldn't immediately see where the gift card was from; and (2) my personalized message was on a separate, small, and cheap-looking piece of white copy paper instead of the greeting card.  I would've paid to have my message printed in the greeting card, so I was a little disappointed to see that.",4.0
very nice im giving it as part of a gift.because i would like it my self.she likes to read. no wonder i don't fill these out,4.0
"I loved being able to include a greeting card with the gift card. It makes giving a gift card a little more personal. Unfortunately you can't include a printed message directly in the greeting card but if you have it shipped to your house first, you can provide a hand-written message.

My only issue is the false claim for one-day shipping. Amazon said that if I ordered is X hours, I'd receive the card the next day. I ordered within that window, my confirmation stated the same date, yet it didn't actually ship for another 36 hours. Once it shipped, I had it within one business day, but I was extremely disappointed that a simple gift card took 36 hours to get ready for shipment.",4.0
"Well, I never thought I would be writing a review for a gift card, but since Amazon won't simply allow me to say how many stars I give them I guess I'll put in my two cents.

This is just a regular gift card. That's exactly what I wanted. However, I would have preferred to purchase the Amazon gift cards that come in those cute little gift boxes, but they only have them for cards worth like $50 or higher! Also, I wish that Amazon had gift cards that were worth $10 because if I'm going to buy gift cards for a bunch of little kids, $15 is a lot! Amazon should really consider allowing the customer to decide what the exact value of a card should be because tailoring the price could be really creative. For example, I got a check for graduation worth $20.11 because I graduated in 2011.",4.0
"I was very happy with this because it came in one time. I was a little disappointed because the card that I wants to get didn't come come with a $10 gift card, and there was a very limited selection for cards with $10 gift cards. I was also disappointed because the other cards I wanted indicated that they did come with $10 gift cards, but once I clicked on the card I couldn't get the $10 gift card.",4.0
It is a gift card and its a gift so I hope that the receiver loves it!!  I like the way it looks and that it comes with a matching card.,4.0
Great gift for teenager.  But didn't realize it had happy birthday until too late.  Is a Christmas gift.  Guess I went too fast ordering.  Not sure if they have a different card option.,4.0
I like the ease of sending the gift card and the person I sent it to really enjoys getting it.  The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because the gift note was not included when the person received it.  He only knew who sent it after I called him!,4.0
"It's a physical gift card. Pretty much what you expect.

I noticed the various card option may have some different restrictions to them as far as denomination, but overall you can get any standard amount you would want.

This card came in a bubble envelope for shipping, then inside was my packing slip and a white envelope with text and barcode identifier (for inventory purposes). Then inside that card is the actual card with envelop for giving. I'm not sure if it would vary much if I marked it as a gift and sent directly to the person.

The card is decent. Not high quality, not low quality.
There is plenty of room for writing your own message inside, either below the card or on the inner cover.

There are instructions printed on the back of the card for redeeming the gift card online.
There is also Amazon branding underneath the card.
Personally, I sort of wish that wasn't there so the card would be sleek and clean. But that is just my preference.",4.0

"Usually in the past, they arrived overnight. This most recent purchased, did not arrive for a few days. Was it my fault?  Is there some new box which needs to be checked in order for it to be delivered overnight?  [I have noticed that that is now the case in some instances if one wishes their Amazon Prime free delivery to actually occur in two days. It needs to be requested!]  Anyway, these cards remain a popular gift with friends and family because they can shop from the convenience of the computer, and almost 'everything and anything' is available through Amazon.",4.0

It would have been nice to see the gift message inside of the card and then shipped in the ONE envelope.

"I was all set to buy a generous gift card for my family in the UK when I noticed that it would expire after a year!  Good grief!
Since I'm considering a sizable gift, it is possible it won't get used within one year. (I didn't use mine within a year) On checking with the US site, I discovered I was right about its cards never expiring--the cards bought on Amazon, USA, that is.

"First, let me say that this is an excellent last minute gift. I ordered it and it arrived in less than 24hrs. It was to be a gift, but I opted to have opit sent to me so that I could give it to the recipient personally. I'm glad that I did, because there was just a small slip of paper in the package that had my personalized message to the recipient. I assumed it would be typed inside the card, but it was not. That is my only complaint. Other than that, it was a good value and arrived super fast.",4.0
"Easy because I needed a gift card, but the gift card that was to be included had only my first and last name and nothing I wrote, even though it was nly a few words.  Also all I wanted was mine and my husbands first name and it was not done",4.0
"I ordered the gift card for a friend, but the gift message, which is the most important part of the gift card, was not included. In other words, my friend had no idea who sent her the card until we were chatting that she told me that she received a gift card from Amazon, not me. If you order a gift card for someone, make sure that you let the person know!

Anyway, after I sent an email to Amazon, Amazon was very quick responding to my complaint and offered a $5 certificate. I appreciate the way Amazon handles it.",4.0

"When I first received the Amazon gift card, I attempted to load it to my account using my Kindle Touch device.  When I wasn't able to do this through the Kindle Touch, however, I was able to load the Amazon gift card into my account using a browser on my laptop (connected via Wi-Fi).  Once the gift card was uploaded to my Amazon account, I could purchase books through my Kindle Touch using the gift credit in my Amazon account.  It would have been nice to provide the ability to load a gift card directly through the Kindle Touch without having to first go through a browser to load it into my Amazon account.  It would also have been nice to be able to select my payment method instead of automatically selecting the gift card for any purchase.  However, I purchased my book using the gift card and have enjoyed using my Kindle Touch ever since!

Also, I wish the Kindle Touch would provide an ""Are you sure?"" modal dialog before purchasing a product.  It seems too easy to accidentally buy something.  However, a nice feature is that I can cancel the order right after I purchase, but it would be nice to have the confirmation panel before doing so.

Overall, I enjoy using my Kindle Touch and look forward to purchasing more books through it!",4.0

If you live in a country with exchange control (Argentina and Venezuela, e.g.), and eventually you have some juicy extra national money to spend, it would be simply perfect to use your money as you wish, even if it means paying twice-or-thrice-the-price-for-the-nice-dice-of-ice you like ;) There are lots of services online offering that business model, and Amazon has power enough to make something like that or better. Well, that's all. I would buy EVERYTHING here, with Gift Cards, if that were possible to me. Sadly, I can't, and I am unlikely the first one who shoot this to you, people. So, if you actually read this things, you are letting MILLIONS of folks buying somewhere else. Just check it out again: won't do any harm to you.",4.0

"Gift card was great produce, easy to use.

We wanted to buy for giving a prizes for an office event, after spending lot of time with all photo gallery, there was still limitation on the cover photos available for general purposes (most of your themes didn't apply), so I had to choose a standard one. Some general cartoon based ones didin't look appropriate for office purposes.

It will be great to see some more choice of professional cover pictures for use at office events.",4.0

"The printable gift cards are very convenient when one needs something quickly.  However, I order them in quantities of 20 or more for my work and it is very difficult to print them because I have to keep track of which card in the list is being printed.

My husband and I always like to receive Amazon Gift Cards since we both read a great deal - I would like to be able to use it more easily for my Kindle.,4.0
It is an easy way to send someone a gift. They can then get something they want from Amazon. With friends and family separated across the country I found I no longer knew what they needed or wanted. Why choose a particular book or music when you are not sure what someone you don't see often really wants? An Amazon gift card shows them you remember them and allows them to choose a selection they want most.,4.0
"I was pleased with the response to sell back my items. The boxes arrived quickly and I sent the package in with prepaid postage. I was disappointed in the time it took to process the package.

I was invited to an out of town baby shower and wasn't able to go.  I wanted to give something nice without having to pay for shipping a gift and not wanting to duplicate someone else's gift.  Also wanted to give something other than a check.  This baby shower gift certificate was very nice.  Cute picture and easy to mail.  I was actually looking for baby girl shower designs but didn't like what I found  as much as this one.,4.0
I was thankful to have this choice to download a gift card immediately. I thought it was going to show the Baby Shower image but it came out with just the Amazon logo. It still worked but I was a little disappointed. I was still thankful to have this option though.,4.0

When making a purchase on amazon you have the option to select or deselect the credit as a form of payment. So you could save it for next purchase. It should not expired.

"These gift cards are very convenient as thank you gift to the speakers at our yearly event. They were delivered within 2 days of purchase.
They are very convenient to the speakers too as they can use them to buy nearly anything they want on Amazon.com
We usually give two $50 cards per speaker, but it doesn't look good to hand them bare, so we hand them in an envelope we have to buy separately. That's where there is some inconvenience: we have to find envelopes of the proper size somewhere.
It would be nice and a 5 star convenience if Amazon.com would provide the option of buying the cards with matching envelopes or sleeves. That option was not available when I bought the cards.
I will still buy another set for our next year event.

This is a great gift to give during the holidays or special occasions.  It was delivered very quickly which was helpful.  My only complaint is that I wish the cards had come with little envelops to write names on or a short note.,4.0

You can't really review how much you like 50 dollars transformed into Amazon dollars except they need a deal like buy a certain amount and get a few dollars free...lot of places are doing this and making tons of profit from it!,4.0

"Picked up several of these for grandkids for gifts. Same price as the generic card or E Card but in a gift box. This makes it look more like a
decision than a last minute "" I FORGOT "" choice. The only downside is that I had credit to use and this was not eligible for that. Had to be paid
for as a conventional purchase.",4.0

"what can I say, it's a gift card",4.0
Card was great but I missed the screen to write a not to the recipient and on review I could not get back to it so the person who got the card did not have any idea who it was from. This caused the embarrassment of having to call them and ask if they got the card and tell them it was from me. Is there a was for this screen to be more prominent so it is not so easily missed?,4.0
"Got them on a timely matter.  In brown box.  Very well.
Con.  I had to open each gift box up to find out the fixed amount on each gift card.  Be all right if all was the same.  But you should still check to make sure you got what you paid for.",4.0

"The Gift Box solves the problem of how to wrap a gift card without telling the world that there is a card inside.  However, with the cutout on the back of the box, that no longer holds true, since you can see the Gift Card through the cutout. To get around that, we placed a large Christmas ""To"" and ""From"" stickum label over the opening.

The Gift Box works well if you hand it to someone, but the postage gets to be expensive if it is necessary to mail the box separately.",4.0

"Great packaging (ready to gift!) and fast (free!) delivery!

The only thing I wish Amazon would do, is print the personal message they ask you to provide in a card or somewhere in the box. Right now it comes on the packaging slip which really is of no use since that won't be getting wrapped up with the gift card.",4.0

I purchased as a wedding present for my niece.  There wasn't a box that looked appropriate so I got it in this one.  They were appreciative of the gift and I doubt they paid much attention to the box.,4.0
Product was exactly as described and arrived as expected.,4.0
"The card worked out well as a birthday present, but the greeting that the Amazon rep said would be included was not.
The receiver did not know who it came from. I was assured that, even though I could not see the greeting on line, It would be

Not bad design.,4.0
Everything was satisfactory. Only thing to make things perfect would have been the possibility to pick exact delivery date.,4.0

"The card arrived on time as promised, but the gift card was enclosed in a folded card rather than in a 'Black Gift Box' as advertised. I had wanted it in the 'Gift Box' so I could wrap it and it would look like a gift rather than just another birthday card. Time was too short to have it replaced.",4.0
"The card delivered the money, but being able to create a unique card that bares more individuality to the barer of the card is the key to a better card experience.",4.0
It really shaved close.... sometimes too close as it resulted in razor burn a couple of times.  But it does an impressive job of removing whiskers.,4.0

"Delivered on-time. Neat packaging. Good for last minute gift.

However, I was not satisfied with the free message option that to be attached to the gift.
The note was typed on a piece of paper that had additional information.
It could not be given as part of the gift. It was tacky and I had to discard it.",4.0

"Expected the packing to be good, but it's not as good as shown in the website. Still it's better than nothing",4.0
"It's a good looking gift card for Christmas I must say. The only thing I really did not like about this holiday one is when it came,  no where on the gift card or any receipts did it say how much the gift card is worth.  It basically only said any amount amazon gift card so the only downfall is that I'm going to have to tell the person how much it is worth.  Another Amazon gift card I ordered was a classic gift card it clearly specified on the gift card receipt and on the gift card itself of the worth of the card.  So just kinda strange that the holiday one was different.",4.0
"i couldn't believe that it was delivered so fast, my gift card came in a very nice box and most of all it saved a lot of running around at the last moment. i will get one of these again. thank you.",4.0
"It was supposed to be a Christmas gift, not a birthday gift. But they can still use it, of course.",4.0
I thought a card would be enclosed with me name (the giver).  They had to guess who it was from.,4.0
"Wonderful way so my family can buy something on line.
It's a cute little box. Email is another way if doing this.",4.0
Happy to be able to order it like I did .. But had to work with available denominations rather than just one card for the amount I wanted.,4.0
The box overall looks appealing.  I would give it a 5 if  the personal message can be included in the box as opposed to be printed on a separate piece of paper.,4.0
"but at least this one was boxed and looked like a little gift, which is something. I know that the recipient will use it though.",4.0
"I would give this a rating of 5 stars except I was unable to find how to enclose a gift message, and the card was sent to  my sister without any indication as to who sent it.",4.0
"Just what I needed for my son who uses Amazon. He lives a distance from us, so this was ideal as to mailing a gift and the problem of finding a suitable gift to send him.",4.0
"Made a wonderful gift.  Presentation very effective.  Makes life easy as recipient can select what is right hor him.

E.F.M.",4.0
"Perfect gift, came with a gift box but no card its easy to give away but card is better in my opinion. Saves time to go to the store. Love it!",4.0
Handy dandy for others who can be hard to buy for - and for those with or without Amazon accounts.,4.0
Gift cards were a great gift.,4.0

"A gift box for the card is a very good idea.  However it gets low marks on presentation.  The bow barely holds on to the box due to loose threads.  The card itself is covered with loose lint from the box lining.  The bottom of the box looks worn/scratched.  Most people will probably not mind these minor issues and focus on the value of the card, but I think the presentation could be improved somewhat.",4.0
This was a birthday gift  for (and suggested by) my grandson.  I know he will get great pleasure in spending it.,4.0
I bought it for my employees. It looks great with the nice boxes. I could have rated it 5 star had it come with a nice card to print out what I wrote own when I ordered it. Unfortunately the message was printed cheaply on the shipping label - unbelievably cheap and useless.,4.0
"I should have read the reviews before purchasing this card!!!! I sent this card as a gift to a friend, regardless that the tracking information showed that it was delivered late (so much for the one day delivery promise!)it was actually NEVER delivered to my friend!! after reading the 1 star reviews I can see that many people had a similar experience and there is just nothing you can do about it!!!!!!

Updated review:I originally gave this one star, but I chatted with an amazon representative and they checked if the card was used or not, I was lucky enough that it was not. Amazon gave me a refund immediately. I am giving it four stars because it was still delivered after 2 days (although someone else seemed to have received this card!!)",4.0
Came through the mail very quickly. Purchase was simply and was bought as a gift to but books for a kindle. It's perfect,4.0

"For some reason I thought ribbon was blue for my younger grandson; however, ribbon is bright orange. Gift appeared to be intended for Halloween!",4.0
I wish I would have been able to choose the amount I wanted instead of having to choose the amounts they have available.,4.0
I received this card in the mail as a gift I suppose but I have no idea who sent it. There was no card or anything. Thought I had to apply it to my account in order to see who sent it but learnt nothing after applying it. The card itself was fine and worked well.,4.0
This box is really nice the little ribbon just adds to it.,4.0
"I ordered a gift card enclosed in a Black Gift Card Box to be sent to my sister for her birthday.  Purchasing from Amazon has always been so easy, and this purchase was no exception.  Because I indicated that it was to be a gift, Amazon gave me a place to write a the recipient a message which was to appear on the ""packing slip.""  The gift card arrived on time as promised.  However, when I phoned my sister to wish her a happy birthday, she asked if I was the one who sent the Amazon gift card because there was no indication who sent it.  I told her that that the message was supposed to be in the packing slip, but she told me that there was no such slip enclosed, nor was there any other indication who sent the gift.  Thus the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.",4.0
This is an easy way to donate to a good cause (local animal shelter).  I am unsure it arrived though.,4.0
It is a gift card what can I say? It is flashier than giving cash but you can't just spend it on anything you want.,4.0
"Disappointed that my gift card was not included, although the site indicated it would be a part of the order.",4.0

"Beautiful presentation, very elegant box and bow. Don't have time to shop or surf the net for a present? This can save you! It really looks good.",4.0
When I received the gift card it did not a say who it was from.  You would think if somebody sent this as a gift it would say who it is from.,4.0
It was very nicely packaged and it more then met my expectations with the custom box and bow made look like a present,4.0
"I love shopping on Amazon.com.  The orders are always delivered promptly and in good condition.  The convenience is unsurpassed and the scope of products sold goes way beyond books.  The outside vendors are very reliable.  The only problem I've had is that I ordered an item (outside vendor) that was ""In Stock"" but several days later was informed that there were none left.  I was disappointed by that, but that is the only time I've been disappointed by an Amazon purchase.",4.0
Classy way to give a gift card.,4.0
Ive had several gift cards.  I like them a lot. In fact i wiah I had several more. Any way I can earn a free gift card?,4.0
"I was very happy with the gift card, but I ordered it with a gift box and unfortunately the box wasn't enclosed.  It was a birthday gift so I had to go and buy one. I think the people sending these need to pay attention to the orders. That was very disappointing. :(",4.0
"I got the gift card for my mom, who has a Kindle (with 3G service) but no other internet. So this is a good way for her to buy books. The purchase screens were confusing, saying they could deliver it in 1 day, 2 days, etc, but the dates listed didn't match the delivery speed. I chose the 2 day, which took 4 days.

I would have given it 5 stars if not for the confusing purchase options. But she's happy with her card and hasn't had any problems.",4.0
"Amazon Gift Cards are great.  In fact, it is one of my favorite gifts to receive.  The only down side is that it can't be used for some items n Amazon.  That is disappointing sometimes, but usually not a big problem.",4.0

I think the gift card is a great way to go. I use it for the purchasing of my kindle books.,4.0
"I finally got an electronic book! I wanted one for a while. It has been an adjustment to get used to the Kindle, but I am managing. The best part is having a book take up so little space, be so readable, and have connectivity to a hot spot for more downloads and updates. Oh, the best is the page holder....I usually turn down the page corner on paper books, and tapping the corner marks my spot for the next session!! Love it!!

The least liked item is the sensitivity of the screen. I sometimes move the page way forward and don't know how I did it. The reverse or page back not always goes one page at a time. I miss having the instruction booklet in paper form to refer to for instructions in a time like that.

My elderly mom could not manage the Kindle at all! Her arthritic fingers were all over the screen when not wanting to be an could not read with it. More time for me!

I am looking forward to getting to know my Kindle Touch better with use. It is great.",4.0
"My wife bought me a Fire for Christmas and my son who already owned a Fire knew exactly what I would need and like for Christmas.  He bought me an Amazon gift card.  I'm having fun deciding what to buy and how to use the Fire.  And it came in an attractive gift box.
One word about a problem I had.  I redeemed the card but still couldn't use it to buy anything; in fact I couldn't even get the the status (balance) on the card.  My son suggested that Amazon might recognize the card AFTER I registered with my Credit Card.  He was right, but I wasted hours trying to buy something on the gift card.",4.0

"Three out of the four gift cards that I received for Xmas worked great ($100 worth). They were easy to put into your system and redeem. The forth card evidently was not activated when it was purchased. I did contact Amazon concerning this and they said ""sorry nothing can be done"".  I see this as vary concerning. I know that I can't prove that the card wasn't stolen but the fact that there were three other cards added to my account at this time and that it was the time of year when one would expect to see `gift card activity'.... It was just very disappointing that the money spent on this card will never be used for the purpose that it was intended.",4.0
"I love having an Amazon gift card just because Amazon has so many great products, but the one thing that sets me back is that once you redeem the gift card, your account will automatically use the remaining balance on your next purchase unless you tell it otherwise. This is a problem for me because I usually use my family Amazon account for free shipping, but if I redeem my gift card on that account my family most likely won't remember to not use my gift card. This actually happened a week ago when my mom used up he remaining balance on one of my gift cards to buy something for herself.",4.0
"The product will be just fine IF and WHEN we do get it.

The customer service department was not helpful at all and I will choose NOT to use Amazon again. Our children purchased this gift card for a Christmas present and we have instructed them to not go there again.

It was a sham the way we were treated and most companies try hard to be helpful but NOT AMAZon.

However, the packaging it was sent in seemed wasteful--it was sent in the small black box shown in the picture, but that was placed inside a much larger cardboard box.

The Amazon Gift Cards are great and fun. I would have rated it 5 Stars exept for one thing. They cover whatever comes up in your account next. I was given a $75 card as a gift to by Kindle books.  I also have an auto mmontly shipment of coffee (auto paid by credit card). The gift card was applied to the coffee and when I ordered abot $30 worth of books the gift card was gone and I ended up buying books at cost by cc.  I would not have bought all those books if I thought the gift card was used.  I realize the net cash was the same but I found it annoying.,4.0
"I got this from my son for Christmas so I could order books, etc. for my new Kindle Fire (which is awesome, by the way).  I think this was so incredibly thoughtful of him.  The only complaint/warning I have is that you have to set up one-click purchasing to order things from the Kindle.  The only problem I have with this is that one-click doesn't give you the option to use another form of payment.  I solved this by using the gift card for one-click purchases for books, but order other things from my laptop where I get the choice at check-out to use another payment method so that I don't use up my gift buying gifts for others (sounds a little selfish when I actually write that).  I guess this adds another level of protection in case I lose the Kindle or it gets stolen since they could only use it to buy stuff up to the amount left on the gift card.",4.0
I enjoyed receiving the gift card I got with my new kindlefire.the only problem I had was because I already had a cc linked to my amazon Acct. When I purchased books on my kindle and wanted them to come of the gift card it automatic got charged my cc instead..it was very confusing,4.0

"Good idea and my granddaughter who received the card liked it as she  received a kindle fire for Christmas.  However, it was a good thing I was present because she had trouble using the card.  In spite of the fact that it was a ""gift card"", to use the card she had to put my information as the purchaser in, which was not obvious in the instructions, nor was that mentioned when I purchased the card.  This varies from plastic gift cards mailed as gifts and should be made clear to the purchaser at the time.",4.0

"Amazon gift cards are always a great gift, especially when you need something last minute.  It's nice that you can print them instantly.  I just wish Amazon would sell their gift cards at retail outlets.  When I give a gift card, I would like to be able to wrap it in a beautiful package so it looks nice for the recipient.  I just don't think wrapping up a computer print out looks as nice as wrapping an actual gift card.  In fact, it almost ""screams"" that you waited until the last minute to buy it.  Yes, I know, Amazon does ship the actual gift cards, but again I'm talking about a last-minute gift.  Come on, Amazon...put your gift cards in the store kiosks!  I would much rather buy an Amazon gift card than some of the others I am stuck purchasing simply because I'm in a hurry and I need something NOW and the Amazon gift card is not there.",4.0

"I was looking for a Nativity scene since it was a Christmas card after all. This was the only one. I like the simple effective artwork. Classic. The only negative (and this is nitpicking) is that the Gospels appear to indicate a more substantial house rather than the initial stable in which Jesus was born for the ""Wisemen"" scene. I liked it just the same.",4.0

I had to make a small certificate to put in a small box, so that I had something to put under the Christmas tree for the recipient.",4.0
"Face it- gift cards are convenient, generally appreciated by the recipient, and carry a high level guilt penalty.  To many, it says I was not:
  1) industrious enough to ACTUALLY shop for your present
  2) creative or involved enough to shop for that personal, perfect gift for you
  3) did not think you were worth the effort of actually shopping for, or
  4) I got stuck with your name at the office's SECRET SANTA name draw
  5) this was worth no more than five minutes of my time, and was done at the very last second

Given the above, it was a nicely designed email present.",4.0
"This was a great idea and my wife greatly appreciated it, however, when she first saw it in her email, she thought it was a gimmick or an ad and sent it to her trash.  It was only after I asked if she had received something from Amazon did she realize what she had done.  OOPS  She threw a $100 in the trash.  Maybe there is some way of differentiating these cards from other advertising items.",4.0

After several tries to re-enter the photo, I gave up & finished the program, then added the photo. Ahh, then it works. Amazon needs to look into this. The person that received the card got fast service & was very pleased. He even started an Amazon Wish List.",4.0

"The digital card arrived on the date I requested, for the amount I paid for with the image I uploaded-- magnificent! Since any departure from those criteria would have made me feel negatively about the product, I thought I should accentuate the positive. The only downside was that the recipient received two cards-- the first Amazon claimed bounced back, but it didn't. The result was that the recipient tried to apply the first and was informed the code was invalid (not good in the gc biz). The second one worked as expected, so I'm guessing it was a fluke.",4.0

Uploading your own picture really made the gift card personal. Only problem was the recipient never received it from Amazon. They are an avid user of Amazon so their email wouldn't reject it or send it to spam. You do have the option of resending the gift card so after trying 2 times with no response from Amazon saying it didn't go thru I sent it to myself and then forwarded and that worked fine!,4.0
