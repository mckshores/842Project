Looks like a pretty rose color but when applied it looks brownish.,2.0
"I absolutely love this product and it lasts me up to a year. BUT, for the first time I bought it from amazon and not my local makeup store, and several months in and the entire container of blush crumbled into a thousand pieces like sand. I am really disappointed, and don't want to but it again, as I had many more months usage out of it. Not sure who to contact, but very disappointed.  It's not rendered unusable...",2.0
"Good color, but I don't care for the glitter",2.0
"My face broke out really bad with this stuff.  It is supposed to be non-greasy, but my face was so oily or waxy after use it took a couple of days for my skin to return to normal.",2.0
"Touts itself to be an antioxidant sunscreen, but the only 2 ""active"" ingredients listed are the usual sunscreen things. How it's supposed to be antioxidant is beyond me. Would not buy again.",2.0
This doesn't absorb very well and leaves a sticky feel on your face.  I prefer the EltaMd products.,2.0
"I really wanted to like this sunscreen. It's everything I want but good lord it's like a spotlight/highlighter on every pore of my face. No matter how long I leave it to soak in before applying makeup, no matter how much I blend, use my fingers, a beauty blender - my pores are like polka dots under my foundation and powder. A problem I've never had before!!!!!!!!!!

Grrr, so the search continues for an elegant physical sunscreen that has antioxidants and doesn't cost an arm and a leg nor come in a tiny bottle. I'm beginning to think it's not possible.",2.0
Received this today. The label looks like an old one was peeled off and a new one was put on. This is in both sides of the bottle. It was not sealed either. I want to ask other reviewers out there if they have noticed this lately. I know this can be a problem for online shopping. That fake items are substituted for the real one. So question. On your bottles is the label printed on the bottle or is it a stick on label? I will revise this comment when I find out if I received the real thing.,2.0
"Does a good job at protecting from the sun, but is a cream, not a lotion, very thick. Leaves the face with a white coating, certainly with a greasy look and feel, even clumps up as if looking like your skin is peeling.
Not recommended for face.
These other reviews are way too kind.
This sunscreen is effective, but very heavy and ere are other better options, lighter weight and with better formulas. The green tea and vitamin c in it have no effect after using for months.",2.0
I have large pores and this sunscreen seems to be too heavy for me. I always get a clogged pore after using it.,2.0
cheap,2.0
"curls look great right after they come out of the barrel but do not hold a curl for very long.  they look like a natural wave, which is nice as well, however, after a couple months of use I noticed my hair was breaking and my hairstylist said it was from the gold plate.  I have medium to fine hair and ceramic is the way to go for healthy, long-lasting curls.",2.0
good but too big,2.0
"unfortunately, a barrel this large doesn't seem to do a good job of holding the curl.  disappointing and returned.  i have fairly thick hair that is quite long and could barely tell i curled it except a tiny flip at the end",2.0
"This tool doesn't got hot enough even at what it says is ""400"". My cheap way-mart curler works better.  And the arm clamp that holds your hair in is too lose/weak",2.0
Had to return. It didn't work.,2.0
"This spring broke in less than a year, it was fine until that happened.",2.0
I received the curling iron but am disappointed to find that it does not sit properly on counter in resting position..regardless of what I do it tilts forward in an unsafe position so that it is resting on the counter top.  Considering the high temp of  these curling irons I am not comfortable leaving it even for  a moment.  I have checked the springs and they seem fine. This is a replacement for one just like it that I had for years ..never did my other one do this. This iron is a safety hazard unless it is right in your hand. Disappointed.,2.0
Does not hold my hair tight so my hair slips through,2.0
"I have think frizzy hair, I can usually get my hair to hold a curl well. I can not get my hair to hold a curl with this iron. No matter how small the a section of hair",2.0
"I was meaning to get the 1 1/2''
this is too big to make any curls and leaves clamp marks whenever i try",2.0
Too short of a barrel and the top doesn't clamp down well enough and the hug spring/ rest get's all caught up in your hair.,2.0
Curls do not last nor do they create any waves. Waste of money.,2.0
"I bought the 2"" iron. On the box there is a picture of a lovely long luxurious curl (think Rodeo girl hair).  When I tried it out on my long layered hair I did not get ANY curl, even on the shorter layers, even using product in my hair to ensure curls would hold, even on the highest temperature.",2.0
"This worked fine. For a while. I especially loved the extra long cord, but it wasn't anything special. Just a curling iron. It stopped working after 8 months. Worked one day, nothing the next. Amazon was cool about issuing a refund though.",2.0
"I can't be sure, but it doesn't seem like the real hot tools iron.  I have another one bought from the makeup store, and it works great without a problem.  This heats up weird (sometimes too hot, sometimes not enough), doesn't curl well, got some build-up on it that can't be cleaned off (which doesn't happen on the other iron).
I'm giving it a 2 rating just on the off chance that it is user error, but I seriously doubt it.",2.0
"It does not get hot the way I thought it would after reading some of the reviews, I thought it would be really hot I have thick hair and it didn't even feel warm after leaving my hair on the barrel for over a minute. My cheap conair one works a whole lot better i wonder if i got a defect item",2.0
"This 2-inch iron is ENORMOUS, as compared to other irons/wands. I was hoping it would work great for either huge curls, loose wave/curves, or for adding body to the very top of my head. It didn't work for any of those for me bc I think it's just too big to make anything really happen with the hair other than sort of straighten/iron it with a very slight curve. My hair is down to my waist too, so I did have plenty of length to try it on...but it just didn't work at all for me. Bummer, bc it looked so fun/cool to do different things!",2.0
"this curling iron works well. Gave a noce soft curl at the ends but when I received the iron it was obviously previously used. It had streaks on the barrel from someone using it with hair product
I was in a time pinch so I cleaned and disinfected it and used it since I did not have time to send it back and wait for a new one but it was very disappointing to receive it used.",2.0
"I read other reviews before making the purchase. Some other reviews stated that this didn't curl, and I brushed it off. I have very long hair - all the way down my back (somewhere close to 24"") - so I figured the other reviewers just didn't have enough length to curl. Surprisingly, they are right! I'm not sure whether the barrel is too thick to heat up properly, or if. . . hair just doesn't want to create a curl that large. . . but it didn't curl. It made my hair slightly wavy, but that was it. I'm returning it and getting a 1 1/4"" barrel, which seems to be the highest rated of the Hot Tools curling irons. I'm looking for the loose curls (beach waves), and thought the 2"" barrel would make it super easy with long hair. Great in theory, but didn't deliver.",2.0
Way to big. I wasn't able to use it sadly because the curls would not hold because of how much the iron is. I have long thinner hair so maybe this was the wrong size for me?,2.0
"2"" curling Iron didn't work for me.  My hair is straight and below shoulder length.  The unit was cumbersome to hold and didn't hold a curl without high heat or nearly burning my hair.  The flip bar or whatever that is called, was so stiff that it was hard to open and catch hair. When I did have my hair in place, being so tight and stiff I couldn't run it down to the ends of my hair without opening and thus losing the hair under the flip bar.  The finger tab to open the flip bar was so far from the body of the unit, I burned my finger when I missed that grip.

This curling Iron was not for me...  I've used several different ones over the years, but this one got returned.",2.0
"heating element works great, however, my hair is constantly caught on the screws. This is my second curling iron - same exact model/brand and the first one never did this.",2.0
"For the 3.5 months it worked, I loved this curling iron. It heated up quickly and held my curls all day. Then one day this week, it let out a poof of smoke and hasn't work since. The light still comes on, but it no longer heats up. Very disappointing.",2.0
"I usually LOVE HOT tools/Hot Shot Tools products, but I'm pretty disappointed with the performance of this iron. I have really heavy, thick, wavy hair so it's hard for my hair to hold a curl, but I fell in love with this brand when I found my 1 in barrel ceramic Hot shot tools curling iron. That was the first curling iron I ever found that was capable of holding my curls all day long. I took a real leap of faith when I tried this metal (as opposed to ceramic) iron. It had rave reviews and results photos from customers on Amazon so I thought I'd give it a whirl- thank goodness it wasn't too expensive because my curls fall out immediately. At best, I have a few waves at the bottom of my hair after trying to curl it for almost an hour. This iron takes a really long time to get hot, and just doesn't work that well on my heavy, thick hair. You can try your luck and maybe you'll have results like some of the other customers, but if you're like me try ceramic. I regret my decision to stray from my good ol' tried and true.",2.0
too large and combersom,2.0
Too large of diameter to make any curl or even a wave.,2.0
"Ooops what was I thinking ordering a 2 inch curling iron.  After my last hair cut, mine is too short.  You need really, really long hair for this one.",2.0
"Average, doesn't hold a curl.",2.0
This didn't work for me. Returned it.,2.0
"Heavy is an understatement for this curling iron. I ordered the 1"" and really liked it, so I ordered the 2"" for lift and body without tight curls. It was impossible to get this curling iron out of the box without destroying the box, so returning it was not an option. I've owned lots of curling irons, but I have NEVER owned one that was as heavy as this one. I didn't even try to use it because of its weight. Honestly, I was afraid my arm would give out before I left the hair wrapped around the barrel long enough to get the body and lift I was hoping for.",2.0
It does not get hot enough to hold a curl,2.0
"LOVE the big wand, but damaging to the hair.  Okay for occasional use, but not everyday.  I probably would not buy this again.",2.0
"I thought the curling iron would get hotter then it did, the curls did not stay in as well as I thought.",2.0
"Worked great, but for less than 1 year :(  I was very disappointed this product did not last quite 1 year before malfunctioning.  It was not misused or damaged, but stopped working for some reason.  I will not order this brand again, and cannot recommend it highly based on my experience.",2.0
do not work as I thought. The curlies do not look good.,2.0
"What I didn't realize - the bigger the barrel, the more your curls fall out.  My hair curls fairly easily - so the fact that it won't with this make me sad.  Looks cool in theory - but in use, not worth the money.",2.0
Gets way too hot.  Even the lowest setting was too hot,2.0
Doesn't hold a curl,2.0
"It was too fat, and I didn't care for it.  I thought I would like the 2"" curl, but I went back to using my 1.5"" or my flat iron to get a large curl.",2.0
"Even though I turned it all the way up, it still barely curled my hair, and was only somewhat successful when I used really thin chunks of hair. Mine's pretty thick, but it's layered and had a good product in it too.

I was using my 5-year-old Chi straightener at the same time, and let me tell you: that old Chi is three times hotter than this thing.

Definitely disappointed.",2.0
"I really wanted to love this curling iron! As someone who has only gotten curls professionally done, either I am just not good at it or something is wrong with the product. I tried ALL settings and the lowest to medium settings were just not putting any curls at all, anythibg above medium I was smelling burnt hair. Suffice to say I now have some burnt ends. I heard great things about this product but for me it just didn't work...it's promptly being returned.",2.0
"I should have reviewed a 2'' curling iron a little better before purchasing this. I was looking for big bouncy curls from this and that's not what you get. And after reviewing it AFTER I purchased it, (dumb), a lot of people have said the same thing. That's not what this curling iron is for. It will mostly straighten the hair and give a little volume but mostly do the straightening thing. So for my review I give it 2 stars because its not what I was expecting. If someone wants this to straighten hair then it would be a great product!",2.0
"I wanted big wavy curls...I knew this big iron wouldnt make tight curls, but I have long hair and it didn't even wave my hair...it took me like 5 min on one section to get a semi wave that fell flat minutes later. :(",2.0
"It's too big though, should have gotten 1-1/2"" but the product itself works well and transaction was fast and easy",2.0
I BOUGHT THIS TO DO MY FARRAH FACUETT CURLS BUT ITS TOO BIG THE CURLS DONT HOLD MY HAIR IS REALLY LONG SO IT JUST GIVES A BODY WAVE LOOK,2.0
Won't hold a curl and I refuse to use hairspray. Guess I'll just still to my flex rods for now. okay,2.0
"This curling iron is very heavy and hard to use. I have straight, fine hair that needs bounce and wave, but this curling iron does not do the job. It is very hard to hold this curling iron AND try to roll the hair and keep it in the clamp. My hair just falls or slips out. Maybe I should have ordered a smaller size. Several times I burnt my fingers when the iron slipped in my hands. I would recommend a smaller and much lighter curling iron for anyone interested in trying these out. I'm very disappointed I wasted my money on this product. I would probably go down to the 1 inch size if I ever decide to get another product similar to this one.",2.0
"I was looking for a 1 3/4"" curling iron, but no company seems to make one that size. I usually use a 1 1/2"" Conair iron, but I decided to try this one. For my hair, which is a bit past my shoulders, medium thickness, and mostly straight with just a touch of natural wave, this curling iron works more like a flat iron than a curling iron. The barrel is just too big for my length, so it doesn't do a good job of curling. It's got a really long cord, which is nice, but as others noted, it comes with extra springs because they break easily (I haven't used mine enough to have that happen yet). Overall, I was rather disappointed, and I wouldn't recommend this.",2.0
I have heavy hair and this tool didn't work so great for my hair. I have to put a lot of hair spray to have it hold but was trying to find something where I wouldn't have to fry my hair on top of putting so much chemical in it.,2.0
"I do not like using this iron. The spring's tension is too tight and my hair ALWAYS gets caught in it, pulling out strands if any get close to the clamp. Otherwise it works the way it should. Buy it if you don't mind the pain of having your hair pulled out.",2.0
"Although the curling iron did exactly what I wanted in terms of shape of curls (a 2 inch barrel is not meant to CURL... very loose waves, similar to round brush) I had issues with the spring on TWO of these curling irons. The first iron I bought was fine for the first couple of uses, then the spring came off track and it was hard to open and close the clamp -- needed extra force and screeched the entire time I used it, very frustrating. Finally, the spring broke off altogether, probably from being stressed at the wrong points too often. I bought the same iron in hopes it was a defect in just the one, but alas this one also had trouble with the spring. Even after realigning it multiple times, the spring would revert back off track. Also, just last week the plastic piece covering the lever to open the clamp broke off, rendering the iron useless. As much as I love the curl results, the quality of the iron is terrible and not worth the hassle.",2.0
"I've tried numerous curlers and to be completely honest my long hair holds curls amazingly for days without any hairspray. Unfortunately this curler couldn't keep a curl in my hair for longer than 5 minutes. The 2 inch curler didn't curl very well because I've learned the bigger the barrel the more heat it will need to curl hair and it just doesn't get hot enough. I don't own hairspray so it might work better using it but my opinion is no matter how long or coarse your hair is, don't get a 2 inch curler unless it has a higher wattage than 430 or else the curl won't stay.",2.0
"Pros;
Curled great
Perfect size

Cons;
Spring kept coming off (put a new spring on, same thing)
Hair got caught in spring (a lot)
Smoked more often than not (and that was on low heat)
Sometimes heating element would stay on high even though I had it set on low

All in all, I won't be buying this product again. Talked to a friend, who is a hairdresser, she had the same problems. I don't know if its hot tools or just this size, but for that price, I don't want to find out. I paid over $40 for mine because all the reviews were positive. I was very disappointed.",2.0
"it didn't just work for me that's why i returned it about four days after i received it. I really wanted the  big curls that's why i got it, but because the curling  iron is big, and gets really hot, i could not get the curls i wanted. Hence, i ended up getting burnt. i guess it might be perfect for people with very long hair (mine is in neck). may be in the future i will buy a 1inch curling iron.",2.0
"Unless your hair curls very easily vast amounts of mouse/thickening spray before blow drying and lots of hairspray afterwards will be necessary to accomplish any kind of style with this tool. If you're looking for big curls go with a 1 1/2"" barrel iron, but if you're happy with just loose waves get this one.",2.0
I have 2 other hot tools curling irons and use them at least 3 days a week. I love them because my fine straight hair actually holds a curl with these irons. Unfortunately the first time I turned this curling iron on to use it the gold started PEELING OFF! I didn't even know that this was possible! I'm not really sure if the major chunks of metal showing through will damage my hair or not...but I'm just completely shocked that the gold peeled off. Maybe I just got a defective one...never had these problems with hot tools before.,2.0
"The Supertool 2"" curling iron arrived timely, a quality product, but the barrel was too large for my daughter's shorter hair style.  I had to figure out how to make a return and the vendor Lamerchendise was very accommodating.  Lamerchendise replied to my emails promptly with specific directions and waived a portion of their restocking fee. As long as I receive the refund through Amazon appropriately I would purchase again in the future.",2.0
"I tried it out for the first time, cranking it to its highest heat setting and allowing it to heat up for 10 mins before use. I have decently thick hair and its long as well, i sectioned my hair into smaller portions and began curling, it did nothing for my hair except flipped the ends slightly. I washed my hair the day before so it couldn't have been that. im very disappointed",2.0
"I'm not real happy with my new purchase, I have used hot tools for years and the quality on  this one doesn't seem to compare to the others I've owned. It's not made as good as the others I've owned, Maybe it's an after market who knows.  I love Hot tools curling irons they usually last me while but just do not love this one !",2.0
"I really wanted to like this and was excited to get it.  I hoped to use it to smooth my hair and provide volume at the root.  It turned out to be very cumbersome and didn't seem to get very hot.  Even though I have straight hair, I found it difficult to get hair taut and even around the barrel.  It had very little effect on my hair at all.  I even tried hairspray, which I don't normally use.  If your hair is easy to curl, it may work for you.",2.0
"I have long, curly hair all the way to my waist and I was looking for something to give me beachy waves that a 1"" curler does not. I guess I can't say that it is a bad curler but it definitely does not make curls, it simply straightens hair and makes it curl out or in at the bottom. I switched to the 1.5 inch, however, and it worked exactly how I wanted to. This one was just TOO big!",2.0
"When this curling iron came with extra springs, I should have known what was coming. I used it twice and the spring tweaked and wouldn't roll correctly, I have replaced both springs it came with and it did the same thing, so now I have to push on the thing to get it to close around my hair everytime I use it. I would not recommend this product to anyone and am now buying a new iron from a different manufacturer.",2.0
"If you want curl, please do not buy this item. If you want a straight kind of styled look, this might be for you. This ""curling"" iron is really a monster. I was hoping for some bigger volume curls but it didn't turn out so well. I really would suggest going smaller. You can use it to get a pretty cool straight look but that's not personally what I needed. So it really does depend what you are looking for.",2.0
"after i use it on my hair, it looks amazing, but i have naturally straight and very thick hair, so after about an hour, it goes flat. i use hair spray so it's not that. if you have the same problem, get a ceramic iron , not this one",2.0
the scent is off...not like the original...would not order again,2.0
"I love this scent! Problem is it goes away so fast. You'd have to carry a bottle around with you.
UPDATE: I've been reading some reviews and it seems since this product is so difficult to find in department stores, someone's been watering it down and selling it. Wonder who that could be.",2.0
Was wearing this scent when I was in my early 20's.  It was ok. It was a gift so I didn't complain. But I didn't personally love it. The scent only lasted a short time.,2.0
"although this cologne smells good, it was delivered in a raggedy box and the cologne itself was missing product. will not order again.",2.0
"The smell is decent, but when you take a whiff you can clearly tell that there is too much alcohol in here. Meaning that the scent will not last for long.",2.0
Warning ! When I first  bought this cologne at the department store it delivered a bang of a smell ! Then it got discontinued yet cool waters and the first ck one still lives!!  I finally got my smell that belonged to me again. Not a chance!!! I put it on it had a life expectancy of maybe 10 min tops. The wonderful smell that Lacoste delivered vanished the same way it did at your local department store!!! Very disappointed!,2.0
"There is no doubting that this cologne has an amazing smell, I put it on and it smells fantastic. It seems like the scent develops, grows into an even better smell after a little bit of putting it on. Which is why I'm so disappointed that the smell lasts almost no time at all. I put it on, feel and smell great, and 10 minutes later I smell my wrists/ chest and there is no longer any type of scent.

I spray one or 2 squirts onto my chest and rub it in, mixes well with shirts and from my experience girls absolutely love it. My other colognes can leave a scent in the shirt for quite a while, the better ones sitting in for a week or so. This spray doesn't even hold in the cloth.

I don't know if it's the bottle or not, because there are several reviews that say it lasts and smells great forever. I've tried multiple times and I just cannot get it to stay for more than 10 minutes. It's really frustrating because this is honestly one of the best scents I've owned in a while.",2.0
"I have purchased this cologne couple weeks ago based on reviewes in amazon;
make me totally upset. Even you spray more than an adequate amount, just disappears
after 5-10 mins. Just a nice example of an expired cologne and I am just like an
classic example of ""effect of buying materials not before testing it""
AMAZON should find out something to keep customers free from this issues.",2.0
"THIS FRAGRANCE WAS PURCHASED BY ME AND FOR MYSELF TO USE, HOWEVER THIS SPECIFIC LACOSTE RED FRAGRANCE LET ME DOWN DRASTICALLY. I AM A FAN OF THE FIRST ORIGINAL LACOSTE GRAY SINCE IT WAS FIRST SPRAYED ONTO MY SKIN. THE SMELL PLUS THE LASTING EFFECT WAS SUPERB! BUT THE LACOSTE RED COLOGNE WAS A TOTAL LET DOWN BECAUSE ALTHOUGH HAD A GREAT SCENT, THE LAST EFFECT WAS MAYBE 25-30 MINUTES IF SPRAYED WITH A HIGH AMOUNT. THIS LACOSTE RED DID NOT STAY ON ME FOR LONG AT ALL. THANK YOU FOR READING MY REVIEW.",2.0
"I'm pretty sure these pads actually made a few pores on my nose LARGER. My foundation now sinks into those pores and it looks like dirt has been flicked onto the side of my nose, with 5-6 dark little specks where the enlarged pores are. It's been over three months, so I doubt this is a temporary thing. :(",2.0
Please be carful. I used a product before with 8% glycolic acid about one a week and it was awesome. I bought this one thinking my skin could handle the higher concentration. I broke out with a terrible rash all over my face and neck. Im returning it and buying one that is not as intense.,2.0
"Ok so I've been using this product for about three weeks now. I've been using one pad every other night and my skin is not new to glycolic acid treatments. So far, I haven't seen any change in my skin tone, but that's to be expected after such a short period of time. Additionally, my pores actually seem larger than before I started using this product. WAY larger. You can visibly see the pores on my chin and nose which was not the case before. I'm really hoping this is a case of ""gets worse before it gets better"" the pads are slightly irritating, make my skin feel a bit itchy, but nothing intolerable. I'm going to keep using the product and will update my review if anything new happens.",2.0
"First time I bought them they were amazing. Second time made me have horrible acne. Don't know if they changed the product, but I will never buy again. Try Peter Thomas Roth it's way better.",2.0
A couple years ago I ordered this product and it worked great but I feel like it was in a white container with green letter. The packaging is not the same and the strength is not the same either. I paid 20 some dollars and it does nothing !! The pads are not soaked so you pull one out they are really very thin and they are mostly dry. Not even close to what I had before .,2.0
This causes me to break out. I'm going back to Loreal 10% peel pads.,2.0
"I have sensitive skin and it makes my skin sting. It does say so on the bottle, just sad it's gone to waste since I can't use it.",2.0
"I've used Glycolic pads in the past and thought they did a great job of cleaning out my pores. They must have been a weaker strength than these. They were nicely moistened, I could even turn one over and use it the next day, really extending the life of the product. But they left my skin so sticky I felt like a human No Pest Strip. Layering it with my serum and moisturizer didn't help. Disappointed.",2.0
Gave my skin little red bumps,2.0
"These pads leave a sticky and oily residue on my skin.  Not what I want on my already oily face!  Have used glycolic acid for years and these didn't give much of a tingle or do much to improve my skin.  I liked the ease of the pads, but chose to return them.",2.0
"I'd been using a glycolic pad treatment from the dermatologist for about six months, every other day, with great results. The problem was it was so very expensive. It seemed like I could purchase the same basic thing online and save quite a bit, however after using it a few times I realize this product causes some type of reaction on my skin, even if I just wipe it on and wash it off afterward. It could be an allergy, but I wanted to throw this out mostly because I never had a problem with the dermatologist's formula. Just be cautious and maybe do a small test on your skin. If it turns red immediately you might not want to rub it all over your face. I do like to use it on my dry heels, however. Softens that skin and doesn't cause a reaction there...",2.0
"I've used others where I saw results, no results with this product.",2.0
Please take out the menthol,2.0
Its Ok. It did not exfoliate like DCL pads did....not as strong. I couldn't tell much difference with these. Would not reorder.,2.0
I was not happy with this product. I didn't feel like it did anything. Would not recommend. Save your bucks!,2.0
I see no difference in my skin texture. Going back to philosophy am pads. They rock!,2.0
"Did not notice any difference in pigmentation, fine wrinkles or smoothness of skin",2.0
"I've been using the Glycolix pads for over a month now. I have yet to see any difference at all in my skin tone or texture. I was so hoping these would give my middle aged skin a boost of radiance, but nothing. I am super disappointed.",2.0
It wasn't all that,2.0
"I have never in my life had a problem with acne until I bought this product. it made my face break out all over. I had to stop using it.
it only took using this for about 3 or 4 days for it to start breaking my face out. it also says to use it on your throat and chest and that started getting tiny bumps on it as well. I stopped using it as soon as I noticed this!!!",2.0
"I sadly did not see any effect from this. Granted, it is the 10% formula so I may need the stronger formula.",2.0
I've been using them every night for several weeks with no noticeable improvement.  I feel like I wasted my money.,2.0
used it for six weeks didn't notice any difference at all in my skin except for more breakouts than typical--your face feels clean and tingly after use but didn't do anything for me realistically.,2.0
Poor lid that is made out of cardboard on the inside. It's crumbling and dropping particles of paper onto the pads.  They don't seem like 10%.  I've used 5% before and they feel more potent?,2.0
was not as effective as I hoped.,2.0
Didn't work for me. Left my face a bit worse (redder and drier) than it was.,2.0
Very thin pads. Hard to separate. So so.,2.0
"Background on my skin.....I'm in my late 30s and have been suffering from acne since my teens. I've tried all kinds of products from over the counter, to department store to prescription-only topic and oral medications. Nothing worked except for Accutane, but after 2 rounds of Accutane and the acne eventually returning after I stopped taking Accutane, I'm trying to find something else.

I was using a 15% glycolic acid cleanser, which I really liked, but when I used it up, I thought maybe I should look for a glycolic acid treatment that I could leave on overnight (on the assumption that I would reap more of the glycolic acid benefits). The cleanser I was using stung a little when I first put it on, so I thought I would stick to a 15% product and work my way up. But these glycolic pads don't sting at all, which makes me wonder if they're really doing anything. And after applying it, my face feel a bit sticky and itchy, where I almost I want to wash it off. But I'm sticking with it, at least until I use up the pads, in case I do end up seeing some real results. But for now, I don't like it, and I don't plan on re-purchasing this.",2.0
"But it seems to be a bit drying and makes my skin red after using it.  It goes away in the morning, but i think I'd rather use a less harsh treatment.",2.0
"I have used Alpha Hydrox for about a year now.  I have seen great results with Glycolic-AHA, so I thought these wipes would be the next best step before attempting a stronger peel.  Unfortunately, one of the added ingredients (I think it may be the witch hazel) broke me out with small white bumps.

I used them for about a week and other than the adverse reaction, I did not see any other results. I am going back to the brand I know works and does well with my sensitive skin.",2.0
"First, the item arrived with a crack in the jar and had leaked all over. To my surprise the pads inside the jar were still wet enough to use so I tried it. It leaves my skin feeling greasy, which I don't care for. I think 20% is a great place to start if you've never used glycolic acid before, or if you want to add it to your daily routine. I will not reorder these. I will look for another brand at 20% for daily use.",2.0
"The product itself is ok. I just feel it doesn't look great on everyone, including myself. I have green eyes, dark hair and olive skin. This color makes me look washed out. I also don't like the consistency of the lipstick, it dries my lips too much and must be reapplied every couple of hours.",2.0
"I got the one in Sophia and it's a lovely coral color, better than I had expected it would be.  However, the packaging is the problem.  The lipstick just sticked to the lid and I was really upset and shocked.  I thought i didn't turn it back in deep trouble enough but it's not.  I don't know is that just me or this happened to others as well, just I am really upset that I've lost already 1/3 of the lipstick when I haven't even started using it... :(",2.0
"I recently tried several Jouer products after seeing a number of beauty vloggers talking about the brand. The color was a very bright, pastel pink, like Barbie pink. For me, (I'm fair with dark hair and eyes) it wasn't the most flattering color.

The formulation was the real disappointment though as it settled immediately into my lip lines (I'm 33 and don't normally have that problem) and the wear time was a joke.  It was practically gone in two hours without eating or drinking anything.",2.0
"The fragrance in these items are too strong.  I am confident that they are good for the skin, we just couldn't tolerate the smell.",2.0
"I love Mustela products and have used them for a long time, but I purchased this set as a gift, and it arrived leaking and damaged. I'll be returning it.",2.0
All of the products are heavily scented.  I wish I would have known this before buying since my family is extremely sensitive to fragrances. I can't use it on my infant (for whom it was purchased) because it breaks him out in a mild rash. :(,2.0
"I bought this for my new baby who was having issues with dry skin. I didn't even try it because I could not get past the smell. It has a VERY strong ""grandma perfume"" smell to it. Wish I hadn't opened it so I could have returned it. If you or your child is sensitive or picky about smells, I would pass on this one.",2.0
"I really wanted to love these products but I could not get past the smell!  To me it was too strong and it covered up the ""baby smell"" that I love.  Fortunately I found the Lavanilla baby products after this misstep and my baby smells like a baby again!",2.0
"The tobacco in this is quite nice, but it is overwhelmed by a bright, high pitched bergamot that induced headaches in me every time I burned it. The candle was lovely to look at and I wanted to enjoy it, but in the end I couldn't tolerate it and had to give it away. If you're sensitive to high pitched fragrances, you might want to skip this one.",2.0
Hardly smells. What's there is nice but is very faint scent.,2.0
"The entire glass container was completely shattered and ruined upon arrival. Returning is such a pain in the butt, so we will attempt to use.",2.0
Underwhelmed. I do love a great candle (and happy to pay up!)  but this wasn't one of them. Oil quality is comparable to anything I could find at big box stores.,2.0
I was expecting a more powerful scent. I did not smell the scent at all. Disappointed. The candle did not last very long either.,2.0
I've always loved archipelago candles and willing to pay the cost but was very disappointed with the offensive scent way too strong I've been trying other brands since purchasing this candle,2.0
"My review is not really about the product but rather due to the fact that it arrived damaged. The wax inside the jar appears to have melted and it leaked on the jar and packaging, making it greasy and used looking. It was intended as a gift and there was no time to exchange it for another one. I love this fragrance and would definitely recommend that!",2.0
nop,2.0
wasn't what i expected,2.0
"Should have trusted the reviews for faint smell.  I can barely smell this close up, not like my other candles from this brand with a strong scent.  The scent is great, you just can't notice it as it's burning.  Wonder if it's a fake.  Not worth the cost.",2.0
"I ordered this after being at a friend's house, but the scent did not work in my home at all.  I found it overpowering and immediately passed it off to someone else.  I'm not sure why there was such a difference between the candle at my friend's house and the one I bought, but I would not buy it again.  I realize that scents are very subjective, but it didn't work for me.",2.0
If you are looking for the same scent as the diffusers look elsewhere.  These aren't nearly the same lovely scent.  They are a very watered down version.  Not worth the money.,2.0
"The Havana candle with it's heady, thick, romantic, sensual, scent is not this candle. I have purchased this candle elsewhere many times in different shops and even travel to a shop in St. Augustine, Florida to buy it in the fall because it's the only store near me that sells it and they only purchase it in the cooler months I found out because it ships from overseas and tends to melt. I was very disappointed. While the candle has a heady scent, it's not the luscious, rich scent I am used to with this brand and fragrance. I don't know why it's different or off if you will, I just know that it is, more pungent that heady and will not be buying this candle online ever again I will stick to finding it in stores that I frequent. It did arrive timely, no damage to the contents. Maybe it was just old..? It didn't last very long either. Maybe a week if even. So not worth it.",2.0
"So I am totally the type of person who always has candles lit in my home. I was soooo excited by all of the reviews on here to get this canlde, very intrigued by the descirption of the aroma. Well it arrived yesterday and I pulled the lid and took a nice inhale and loved the smell. I lit it up right then and there.... only to find that the smell was not very noticable. I let it burn for a good 2 hours and still nothing, from the couch about 6 feet away seeing the flame was the onyl reason I knew it was still burning.",2.0
"Other people love this scent and this brand and I have loved them in other people's houses, but in my own house I get a headache from this candle.  The fragrance lingers even when it's not lit.  It is definitely made with some synthetic scents (not just natural oils) and the wax is a blend and gets smoky.  I left mine on a bathroom sink and the bottom of my medicine cabinet was black with soot.  For the price, I wish that it had been nicer.  If you are a Yankee Candle or Glad person, that you will probably love this and it will be an upgrade.  If, however, you are more of an essential oils person, this might be too much for you.",2.0
"I bought one of these candles about a year ago, and loved the scent. It was strong and warm and masculine and it filled the room. I just purchased another and it arrived today..... and I don't know what happened. I have the same complaints that many other reviewers have.... the scent is almost not noticeable, and the candle does give off a lot of smoke. It makes me sad, because I was previously so pleased. Best case scenario and these are inconsistent. Worst case is that Archipelago has cheaped out and changed the quality of the candle for the worse.",2.0
I love the smell of tobacco leaves and especially since I have a condo and wanted the place to have a nice smell but not feminine.  I bought this thinking I was on to something.  Very wrong.  It actually smells like Vanilla when it does smell like something.  Mostly it just sits and doesn't smell like much of anything.  I am sorry but for $20 it needs to smell stronger.,2.0
Love this candle but the glass doesn't ship well. Smells amazing and is a great choice for a man that doesn't want to smell like a woman. Go with the non-glass options out there.,2.0
"This candle smokes terribly.  I know all about trimming the wick, etc. as I have multiple candles in my home.  The scent is barely there and the presentation looks cheap.  The glass top simply has a sticker affixed as does the rim around the container that the candle is in.  The sides of the candle look as if they have melted and re-solidified.  I am a big fan of Trapp candles and thought this Archipelago would be a good choice.  It was a waste of money.  Looks like something from the Dollar Store and performs poorly.  Save your money and choose something else.",2.0
"I was VERY disapointed in this candle.  Normally the sent will blow you out of the room, but not this one.  There is literally NO smell to it what so ever.  I will continue to buy these candles, but I am concerned that this one may not have been a TRUE Archipelago.",2.0
"I'm no stranger to candles...trimming wicks, not over burning... this particular candle has been putting out more smoke than scent... not real happy",2.0
"Nothing against the product itself, as I loved it right up until it gave me allergic dermatitis.  I'm not sure which ingredient gave me the reaction, but when I took this out of my routine for a few days, it cleared up.  I initially thought that maybe it wasn't this and was a pollen thing instead, so added it back in.  I broke out in dermatitis again by the end of the day.  Sad because I loved the coverage and how it held my makeup all day.  If you don't have an allergy to it, it's brilliant.  I just had to give it 2 stars because it's not hypo-allergenic and some people are likely to have the same reaction to it that I did.",2.0
"Light, Sat on more like thick baby powder. Not for me.",2.0
Sent back. The powder showed every wrinkle.,2.0
"I am a big fan of dermablend make up drops so I was excited for the opportunity to try this product. I had high hopes of loving this product!

The powder was a little lackluster on my skin. The powder is super very fine and includes a pufff which fluffed up very nicely. I tried applying the powder with the puff but felt like it was immediately absorbing into my skin and I couldn't really tell where the powder had been applied, so I ended up using even more. I preferred using a powder brush to apply this so I could tap off the excess powder before applying and so I could better control where it was being applied. I didn't love this powder as much as I hoped. Rather than having a silky feeling going on to my skin, it was more like matte and oil absorbing. It made my usually dewy skin feel very dry and matte and although I used the powder sparingly, it didn't blend into my make up and I felt like I had a light dusting of white on my skin. It looked a little ghostly, flat and dry. I know most powders by design are somewhat oil-absorbing but I felt like immediately absorbed into my make up as soon as I applied it more than any other traditional powder I've used.

This is the first time I have used a make-up setting spray and I didn't notice a dramatic difference using this product. It felt nice going on and did have a wide spray to cover my entire face. I was pleased that it didn't seem to smear any of my applied make up and it did seem to dry everything in place. It did leave my skin a litte flat and dry looking. Unfortunately I have very acne-prone skin and I felt like this spray flared up my acne.",2.0
Its okay. I prefer a setting spray over a powder.,2.0
Did the job but made me ghostly,2.0
IRRITATED MY SKIN,2.0
"Another translucent  make you face better,that this one .no big deal. I waste my money.you can buy un drug stores like maybelline or Almay ,same efect",2.0
"I like some of the derma blend line, like their concealer.  But this powder does not work for me at all.  I have dry skin & this goes on like a ""bake"".  You have to dust it all over your face and then brush off the excess.  This left my already dry skin, EXTREMELY dry & showed off even the finest of lines.  If you are prone to dry skin i would definitely go a more moisturized route.  This one is a huge miss for me.",2.0
Garbage...,2.0
"It's not so great at setting make up and keeping it in place... I thought I must be using the wrong foundation to go with it so I bought dermablend foundation and even with that, it's not great.. Waste of money",2.0
This powder is supposed to be transparent but it is chalky and ghostly white on the skin.  It is also very itchy on the skin.,2.0
Messy setting powder for the foundation. Very messy. Wear a robe.,2.0
didnt like,2.0
It's ok not that crazy about it!!!!!!,2.0
Not what I expected,2.0
don't like,2.0
Doesn't keep make--up from transferring onto clothes. No reason that money should be wasted buying this rather than another brand.,2.0
"The shade is too dark, It doesnt cover tattoos like it says it does with combination with the cream cover up.",2.0
Dont use the puff that it comes with the hairs fall out everywhere on your face and its so itchy I will use a regular brush to apply next time,2.0
Not impressed with results.. Possibly works great on someone with dry skin... Almost runs if u have oily skin..,2.0
I was not pleased with Dermablend loose powder. It is lacked for light and fair complexion but the color is to dark for my light complexion. Also I find it does not cover as stated yet it is more expensive than most loose powders.,2.0
"i don't like it. it is extremely messy and goes everywhere once opened. the puff they provide is very flimsy and doesn't hold the powder for very long, and it doesn't allow you to put the powder where you really want to. i was left with a lot of white mess the first time i tried it, and once i applied it to my face and let it ""set"" it was then difficult to brush off, because it had set in place where it wanted to be. i think you do need this in combination with the foundation though, because it helps it stay oil-free longer, but it is very messy and gets all over clothing, the puff, and your face. you lose a lot of the powder when it's loose this way",2.0
I was looking for a micro-fine powder to use to set my makeup.  This looked cakey on my dry skin.  I much prefer the Laura Mercier setting powder or even the $5 Elf HD powder.,2.0
"I just don't see what all the fuss is about with this product.  I'm 60 years old and this makeup (with this ""setting"" powder) just melts off my face within a couple of hours.  I fed into all the hoopla about how great it was for rosacea.  Spent a LOT of money on the whole package.  And then it melts off my face.  So sorry I spent the money.",2.0
"I just received Dermablend Setting Powder, but it is not the product from Vichy, on the bottom is written Dermablend L'Oreal USA, so it's not the real deal.",2.0
"Free samples were indicated on the receipt stating 3 items included in the box but only received the 1 product I ordered.
Shipping people must have taken the samples.

That's all I can say.",2.0
This product was a waste of $34 for me  I cannot use it. I have used curling irons for years and thought I was buying another Iron that would last me a long time. There was no mention in the advertisement for this product that one person cannot handle this iron .It takes two hands and someone else working on your hair. The top bar is too hard to work by yourself. I had to buy another iron elsewhere and felt I had been deceived with a false add and it was expensive buying two irons.,2.0
very difficult to use,2.0
Not the best for fast styling as you have to use more finger than usual to control your work,2.0
These irons are nice while they work. They burn out extremely fast as the cords twist up until the wires in the inside break. Not worth the money spent for the purchase. I've bought more than one. The results have been the same.,2.0
Shorts out to quickly...owned many never last long..I have found that the cord connected the the iron some how shorts out over a few months,2.0
"This item broke after only 6 months of use.  The cord must be defective since the iron is now only getting intermittent power and the on/off light is flickering.  Because of the flickering power supply it no longer heats up.  Have tried different outlets in the house - same problem.  Amazon won't take returns after 30 days so now have to deal with Helen of Troy to hopefully replace this.  Since my prior Helen of Troy iron (same model) gave out like this as well, eventually losing power and not heating up, I can only deduce that the wiring in this product is substandard.

I still like the IDEA of this iron but it seems to be manufactured poorly.  Bummer.",2.0
"I have been a hairdresser for several years, and I have found that the Hot Tools Curling Iron has gotten to the point the do not last even 2 or 3 months.  There seeems to be a problem in their design of the wiring in the handle.  It shorts out within a few months, and there is no way to repair it.  I have now been looking at trying another company.  The iron I just purchased lasted less then the 2mos.",2.0
This thing is impossible.  I gave it away!,2.0
"This product was returned as my wife was not pleased with the product, but the return process was simple and was smooth.",2.0
"This didn't work for me, although I didn't return it. The long shaft is flimsy and it gets really hot. Might work for someone more coordinated.",2.0
Two of the handles spin and only 1 locks.  The barrel is too short.  I hate using it.  I'm giving it to my stylist because I threw away the box and am unable to return it.,2.0
I have the 1 in & 1/4 version of this curling iron and it gets way hotter. This did not get hot enough to produce the tight curls I needed so it's kind of a waste for me.,2.0
"I like the small size BUT did not notice that the tip of the hot tool has no plastic cover so you can hold the end with your fingers while you are
curling your hair.. I have burnt my fingers several times because the previous hot tool I bought had that black tip to hold.------kept forgetting.. As a creature of habit I now have to be extra careful when I curl my hair with this device.
And the normal thing to do is hold that tip.",2.0
I have a very difficult time using this curling iron.,2.0
the package was delivered early but the marcel is kind of hard to get used to,2.0
"I would like to give this curling iron a 5 but b/c it burns out so fast, it's lucky to get a 2. I have brought at least 20 of these curling irons in the past 10 years, because it is a great curling iron, but does not last but a short period of time. Electric Marcel irons are hard to come by that's the reason for continued purchases. I wish I could find a good alternate.",2.0
I bought this under the impression it was NEW. It had been previously removed from the package. The original box was ripped and dirty. The iron was in decent shape but the handle is lose and the spring needs replaced.,2.0
All the soft plastic parts turned sticky I could not get rid of it. Tried several methods. The on switch is in an awkward spot: it's easy to inadvertently turn it off while working on your hair. the dial and flexibility of heat is good. Clamp is good.,2.0
Great product. Just too small. Ordered the 1/2 in --Wish I would've ordered next size up.,2.0
"I may have had a defective one, but the edges may not have been smooth because it sounded like it was tearing my hair. Also, it was not effective even at the highest setting for curling my 4c hair.",2.0
doesn't clamp thin hair tightly. No good for very short thin fine hair.,2.0
We returned this product.,2.0
"I have quit using this.  I was really interested in the 1/2 barrel for my short hair, but I found it too long to use comfortably.  I'm fairly tall with long arms, and I found this awkward to use because of its extreme length.  I ended up burning myself because it was hard to manuver and control.",2.0
Had to return this item. It would not clamp down on my hair.  My hair just continued to slip out of it,2.0
"I purchased this curling iron last year and after about 2 months, the plastic covering on the tip started breaking off. Now I have just metal.  I don't even use the curling iron every day so I was surprised it started falling apart so quickly. The heat output and settings are perfect but curling iron is cheaply made.  I wrapped the tip so I could continue using it, however,  when I try and curl, the tip bends because the material is so thin.  Definitely will not purchase from this manufacturer again.",2.0
I do not like the curl I get from this product.  Very disappointed with it!,2.0
"It doesn't clamp down, close tight when trying to curl my hair. I have had them before and they worked great, this one does not.",2.0
Great curling iron!,2.0
not enough heat returned for credit,2.0
"I ordered the wrong size of rod on this one. I have decided to keep
it, although it was a mistake.",2.0
"I bought the 1/2 inch curling iron but the barrel is more like 1/4 inch.  Way too small, I returned it for the 3/4 inch one - much better.  Otherwise, I love Hot Tools.  I have been using their products for years.  They work well and last a long time.",2.0
"Maybe because its 2 main ingredients are water and alcohol, this gel leaves my naturally wavy hair helplessly frizzy.  In the beginning I thought I was not using enough product so I slathered up on my hair section by section.  It left my hair stiff like any other hair gel would. If I have to pay $22, I expect the product to work much better than my $3 Herbal Essence Totally Twisted Gel.  This Ouidad gel is a disappointment.  It doesn't do any ""quenching"" thing and it doesn't even define curls as well as a drugstore product. I get much better result with the Totally Twisted Gel with less amount of gel.  I'm giving it 2 stars because it doesn't make my hair any worse.  It just doesn't do anything for my hair.",2.0
"This stuff leaves my hair frizzy, won't be buying again.",2.0
I'm a big fan of the Ouidad hair care products.  This one misses the mark with me.  It's too sticky and doesn't work as well as Whipped Curls or Heat and Humidity Control.,2.0

Not as good as promised,2.0
Works okay but hate the strong smell - way too perfumed for me.,2.0
"Results look great on my hair. But I always break out in a fungus on my fingers whenever I use it. So sad cuz it is difficult to find the perfect product for your hair. Ah, well. I have to discontinue using it. and I cannot recommend it.
p.s. what's in that stuff that causes fungus?",2.0
"I have been a Ouidad user off and on for about 14 years.  After 2 years going the suflate/silicone free route, I started using silicones again.  I decided to give Ouidad another try as I always liked her Climate Control Gel.  Ouidad had a great deal on a set of Curl Quencher products that included an 8.5 oz bottle of the gel.  The gel is not great for me.  While it leaves hair very soft, it does not have enough hold.  My hair gets fluffy and poofy with it.  I get far better results with my $3.50 bottle of LA Looks Sports Gel.  I won't be repurchasing.

[Note: I also re-purchased the Climate Control Gel and that one really is great for my hair type.  I like it best when I add a touch of LA Looks Sports Gel (2 parts Climate Control to 1 part LA Looks Sports Gel) because I find that my curls look really defined that way.  Climate Control Gel by itself leaves me with stringlets.  For tightly coiled hair, Climate Control is the way to go.]",2.0
"I'm a loyal Ouidad user, I use botanical boost and heat and humidity gel almost daily. I bought the playcurl amplifying foam to switch it up. While my hair comes out really nice when I use it, it's been painful to wash out. It literally feels like my head is full of snarls and shampoo won't even get it out. I need to load up on conditioner just to run my fingers through my hair again. Not sure if it's something about this product when it comes in contact with water or something. It's so bad that I'm tossing a mostly full bottle.",2.0
"I used Ouidad Products for my curly, dry hair several times. Shampoo, Conditioner and Serum. I expected to have at least a little improvement with my hair but it did nothing. Also a packega is useless, conditioner was too thick to pour so I had to use my finger to take it out each time.",2.0
"Products purchased: Playcurl Shampoo and Expert Curl Kit

Ladies, if you are hoping these products would bless you with better waves/curls, don't waste your money! I have some wave with the length of hair I wear - to unruly if really short. Was hoping to boost the wave and get hair to cooperate a little more without having to style it to death. No such luck. I still have to use all the styling tricks I used before.

The shampoo smells like that horrible bar soap you find in some motels. Yuk! The other products have a pleasant fragrance but they do not cancel out the bad smelling shampoo. My biggest problem, however, is with the the shampoo, which contains sodium laureth sulfate, an ingredient a lot of manufacturers are getting out of their shampoo while Ouidad lists it second on the ingredient list.

The price for all if it isn't worth it. I will go back to the Jason Pure Natural and Organic volumizing shampoo and conditioner, have more pleasant smelling products (and hair) that cost less than half of what these 4 Ouidad items did (under $9 per bottle for Jasons in this area) and use the same styling tricks I have been using to get the same results.  And I am sure I can find similar styling clips for far less money or more for the same money in my favorite stores.

My only consolation - I did not bite on the product and order through the TV offer only to get stuck with a membership I can't cancel like some unsuspecting souls did. I'll use up what I've got, either in my hair or as a bath and shower cleaner, and pull Jason's back out of the cupboard.",2.0
"I have naturally curly hair and am always looking for shampoos designed for curly hair. I decided to try Ouidad PlayCurl because I'd had good results with Ouidad Water Works.

"I actually loved this product while I was using it. It smells very medicinal and somehow 'feels' like it's killing bacteria. Unfortunately it completely dries out your skin, and is, in my opinion, WAY too harsh for acne prone skin. I've since overhauled my skin care routine once I realized that acne is caused by inflammation, and needs skin care products that CALM the skin, not strip it of all natural oils. Try using natural soaps for cleansing, and certain oils (jojoba, tamanu, etc) for moisturizing.",2.0

Honestly I don't use it that often and my face is pretty dry.  I have oily skin but this is drying me out.  I have backed off and stopped using it. With drying out my skin am having more of a breakout more often.  So unless you have pretty bad break outs I don't recommend this.  I also use the pigmentation bar. I love this.

I wanted to love this but it is unfortunately a little too strong and irritated my skin.,2.0
Not worth the money - concetration of BP is too low.,2.0
"I have really oily and acne prone skin. I've used several other PCA products and really liked them, (ClearSkin, Acne Cream, Blemish wash) so I had high hopes for this.

However, this wash makes my skin really really dry. Especially my eye area. I try really hard to keep it away from my eye area, but when you wash, the water swirls around and still get to the eye area. It would dry up my whole face, but not my acne.

I would use it once a day but I couldn't stand the dry skin, so then I used it once every other day, but it would still dry up my face but not my acne. sadly this wash doesn't work for me. :(",2.0

I felt like it was burning my skin.,2.0
It would be nice if it came out of the bottle.  Has a defective squirt pump.  Have to unscrew the pump to make it work.,2.0
This product - without the toxic hydroquinone - is somewhat effective.  I have been using it regularly for about 5 months - once every day or two - to reduce dark spots and freckles and I have seen them slowly lighten.  I'd like it to work faster but since it does the roly-poly under other creams and makeup I don't seem to be able to use it more often.  My biggest gripe is that PCA has DOUBLED THE PRICE in the last 2 months.  What on earth possessed them to think that consumers will pay a 100% price increase overnight?  They've lost my business now.  I will instead purchase another product a dermatologist recommended - Meladerm.,2.0
"I had high hopes for this product after a friend recommended it.  After using it for a couple of weeks, my skin started to look stretched out where I had placed it and there was no visible improvements to the dark spot.",2.0
beware. It burned my skin badly. Now I have even darker skin that I must cover up with tons of concealer.,2.0
"I love the way it make my face feels. Every single time I've used this I discontinued using it right after, bcus I get a new pimple or two. Maybe it's bcus I only tried using it at night. It's a little sticky, if you don't change your pillow cases, I could see this stuff attracting germs from your sheets..",2.0
This doesn't really work as does the PCA Pigment Gel with Hydroquinone.  I bought it by accident and opened it so I cannot return it.,2.0
"I got this for hyperpigmentation, specifically melasma, and I've seen no change over the past month. It might take longer to work but unlike other reviewers, I've seen no sign it's doing anything.",2.0
Didn't work for me. But I think I need the one without hq free.,2.0
"Two stars after a month of use. I didn't notice any change in my skin until the 4th or 5th day. It had an orangy look that others have mentioned. Very slight flaking. From then on, nothing. At all. I use it quite generously even, with only slight burning when I use retinol the same day. It does smell like it would work, having done lactic and glycolic peels. But perhaps it's not authentic or best quality when purchased from Amazon?  My skin is light-med ivory with dark hyper pigmentation from acne. It needs exfoliating daily. 6 IPL and ultrasonic facials didn't work. I had really hoped this would. I'll continue using the 2/3 rest of the bottle 1-2 x day and just hope I can update this review later with better results.",2.0
"I did not do well using this product. It. burned my skin and discolored it worst than it was from being darken by the sun.
I will never use this again. One should be under a medical doctor's care when using this product.

Did not help my hyper pigmentation at all. Too much money down the drain,2.0
"I really wanted to like this product, and I used it for several weeks with mixed results.  I am of Ethnic decent with dark brown skin, and I found that a thin application once a day would cause an fairly rapid exfoliation.  This is great the first time the skin peels over the dark areas, as it produces a lightening affect.  Yet, I found that continued use caused an inflammatory response, that then re-darkened the area I just slightly lightened. :(  Incredibly frustrating to say the least.  I experimented with using it less; less often and less quantity, but to no avail.  I found that the amount/ frequency of use needed to reduce the inflammatory response was not effective enough to produce a lightening effect.  I ended up using a combination of Melazepam and Nadinola with fantastic results!  Hyperpigmentation that I have had on my face for YEARS is nearly gone with the use of these two products.  I wanted a HQ free product to work for me, but unfortunately this product did not.",2.0
"Even though the skin covering the brown spots peeled, the brown spots were still underneath on the new skin. It is very harsh on your skin.  Caused redness and drying.",2.0
"It does not work on me at all.  At first, my face turns red and then darker red.
It is not good to use if your skin is sensitive",2.0
The item arrived on time an in great condition. I have a couple of sun spots on my face and I was hoping that this product would do the trick to lighten them. I have been disappointed with the product because it as done nothing to get rid of the spots or to even lighten them in the least.  I used the product for over 4 months without noticing any difference in the appearance of the spots on my face. In fact this product is harsh and there were a few times that my skin felt as if it were on fire and I had to wash it off.,2.0
"This product has turned out to be a big zero for me.  In 2 1/2 months I have not noticed even the slightest improvement as I did with my previous product.

I didn't give it one star because it has not caused any negative results, just no positive ones.  A big waste of money for me.  :(",2.0
"This is a REALLY oily, thick face cream.  Unless this is what you want, order the balancing day cream.  I made a mistake and ordered this instead.",2.0
"They changed the formula and now it makes my skin dry.  The perfume smell in this one is sooo loud.  Please bring the old formula back. I purchased 5 tubes and ended up dumping them into my body lotion, this new formula is not good.",2.0
"I used to think this product help me, but having stopped using, my hair improved.  Received product quickly and in good shape, but not for me anymore.",2.0
"Nothing even close as Rusk Wired which I have been buying for years.  I would have given it one start, but I keep it for backup should I run out of others.  It gets stiff as if I was using gel which is reason #1 why I went to the creme products.",2.0
This stuff is like sticky Elmer's glue. I don't think it's a legitimate Rusk product.,2.0
Leaves my hair crispy.  Would not repurchase,2.0
"Been using this product for over 10 years. What arrived at my door appeared to be a slightly different liable, so I figured I'd try it. Totally different consistency, smelled different and did not work like the product I'm used to. This appears to be a knockoff product in my opinion.",2.0
"I initially liked this thickening creme, but after using it for a week or so, my hair started to look stringy. I have wavy dark blonde hair that I have to wash every day because it gets oily. This creme just didn't work for my hair type at all.",2.0
"Does not thicken, as if I didn't use any product at all. Very disappointed. This one says level 3, not sure if other radicals have different levels of strength? This one was ineffective.",2.0
Thick and gluey.  Did not like for my hair.  My hair is fine and this weighed it down.  Gave it to a co-workers daughter but don't know if she uses it.,2.0
"This is an awful product - left my hair gooey with residue on the hair dryer. I washed my hair again immediately to remove it.
Don't buy this one!!!",2.0
"I really wanted to like this. I have thin hair and saw such great reviews but for me it does absolutely nothing. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this was a prank bottle filled with water. The only reason I am even giving it 2 stars is simply because it doesn't weigh down my hair like most products.",2.0
"This product has a very strong smell, and the consistency makes me feel like I sprayed hairspray through my roots!",2.0
Like the product. Nozzle does not work. Even after running under hot water. Probably would not repurchase!,2.0
Didn't really make a difference with my hair.,2.0
I love this product for my hair - it is light and not sticky and adds volume.  This particular purchase was faulty in that the spritzer doesn't spritz.  I haven't had time to deal with returning it.  Disappointing.,2.0
This does nothing but make my hair greasy!,2.0
"I bought this conditioner because of the way it smelled in the bottle, frankly. Once I used it, the smell was actually really overpowering and took on a different, more spicy smell that I didn't like as much as the way it smelled in the bottle. It also didn't do much for my hair. It left almost a waxy feeling on it that I didn't care for. I'll probably pawn this off on one of my friends.",2.0
very strong cleanser. it worsened my skin condition.,2.0
"Having very sensitive skin I was very excited to see that this product works well with skin prone to irritation.  My shave started out well, but by the next morning I had practically the same amount of razor burn and ingrown hairs that always plague me the next day.  Overall, I am very disappointed with this product as it didn't work much better than your typical generic shaving cream.",2.0
"Although it is pretty mild, it is still nothing special and not worth the money. I tried one bottle after reading its suprisingly good reviews on its website. After using it, I strongly suspect the fake customer's reviews on their website.",2.0
"This product appeared to be a positive alternative to the main stream retail brands and did appear to work in the initial two to three weeks.

However, under the test of mild stress I had a break out worse than I have had all this year. I have oily skin with the occasion moderate breakout / open pores but nothing like when I used this product and the price compounded the matter.

I think it would be more useful investing in your internal health rather than external e.g.) Colon and Liver, reassess your diet and maybe Fiberzon (Amazon Herbs) or the three day apple diet.",2.0
"This face wash is average at best, and definitely not worth its $25 dollar price tag. Although I believe it's supposed to be odorless, it has a slight but noticeable ammonium scent. One of its major ingredients is in fact ammonium laureth sulfate, one of the many sulfate varieties you'll find in your cheap (and some expensive) shampoos. Fun Fact: In larger and more concentrated solutions, sulfates are used to clean grease off engines. It lathers fairly poorly, and you'll need a good handful of it to get going, so it will get used up faster than a comparable cleanser. For what it is, it should be no more than $5 at a local pharmacy, right next to all the store-brand face washes.

Speaking of local pharmacies, the easily found Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser is a superior alternative to this MenScience product, but not the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser which is incredibly diluted. If you're still shopping for a more expensive face wash, in that case I recommend Zirh Clean, which is about $20/8oz. It lathers very well, has a pleasant citrus scent, and leaves your skin feeling fantastic.

"When I got this bottle, I was surprised at its size, at 8 oz it is only 0.4oz smaller than my shampoo. The first time I used it I understood why, it takes a pretty big bottle to fit all of that water into. This would be 4 oz of product if were a regular strength. The cleansing of the soap itself isn't while not bad isn't very good. It is not overly harsh and can be used twice a day with no problems. It just doesn't seem to me to have any lifting action. The smell is neutral and boring, but still present. 2 out of 5 seems very appropriate for this product.",2.0
"I changed from Baxter of California to MenScience, but the MenScience smells like mildew.  While this is a step up from Baxter, which smelled like a urinal, I'm thinking male AHA and BHA products may just be a waste of money.",2.0
"Overall, it is a good quality lotion. Face feels softer after using. Besides that, there is no real difference from any other lotion. Face doesn't look firmer, or better or anything like that. I decided to give this a try based on the good reviews. It is a good lotion; however, I would say it is definitely not worth $35+. I probably will look to try others in the future. If the price was about half of what it is now ($15-$20) I would rate it higher.",2.0
"This stuff is highly over rated. I looked at all the reviews before I bought this and am very disappointed. This work no better than CERAVE that I can buy at Walmart cheaper. If you want to spend big bucks on a bad product, go ahead and buy this.",2.0
"i saw all the reviews from facebook postings to google reviews. I though this would be a great product to fight body acne. I used it and was not impressed. Not worth the price for just one bottle. MenScience has great products but sadly they just lost my business.

I will look for another product to try out for better results.",2.0
"I'm on my second jar of this formula and I'm not sure I will order it again. I have stretched my imagination and tried to see improvement in my skin tone, but I can't. It's definitely not worth the price! I can't recommend this product.",2.0
"Like others have said, sometime in the past year or more, the formula for this product changed, and it's no longer as effective as used to be. The consistency is thinner and the the scrubbing action isn't as intense. For $30 a bottle, it's sadly not worth it. This used to be a great product, but now I will look for a replacement.",2.0
"Its kinda hard to verify that this stuff works but my main issue with it was some funny smell that I noticed about me the first day I used it. I thought it was just something I handled, but the smell didn't go away. I thought sweat but quickly dismissed that seeing as I was in an air conditioned office all day that day.

The smell is not a strong smell its very 'silent', but its there and doesn't smell good.

This product was supposed to be 'no smell'. For the price, I really don't think its worth it. I used mine for 3 days and would have returned it if I could stomach the extra trouble.
I settled for the Lubriderm product-that was truly no-smell",2.0
"Ive been using this shampoo for about 44 days and I get mild scalp acne and dandruff. My hair is very oily. The first week I notice my scalp became more itchy, but I disregarded it because I thought I needed to get used to it. The itching contributed onto the month. 2 weeks after use, my scalp began to break out very bad. My face has been clear and thank god it got spared, but my scalp was going through hell for 2 weeks. Nevertheless, I kept on using it. Bad idea. 4 weeks in and I had about 12 pimples on my scalp. The itching was worse than ever and my scalp was red. I decided to stop using it everyday and only every other day. No results and after 40 days, I stopped, which was just this past week. I can already see an improvement on my scalp ever since I stopped using it. I had mild scalp acne (like 4 pimples a month) and mild dandruff and I thought this shampoo would help but it ultimately made it much much worse. It was so bad I got an acne scar and hence, a bald spot on my scalp. I don't know what it could have been since I'm not allergic to anything, just cats lol. Anyway, it was a pricey investment that didn't work for me. I'm back to using the $1 vo5 and it made my scalp better.",2.0
"made no difference for me personally, i have acne and seborrheic dermatitis both on the scalp but this shampoo did not show any results.",2.0
didn't make much difference. won't be buying this again,2.0
Very disappointing product even when you realize the size .  It doesnt stay on the hair like other products of this should and DO,2.0
Its too obvious when worn,2.0
Can't believe I paid$7.95 for this little sample size item! What a waste!!,2.0
Much lighter than my husbands hair. Wish we could of actually used it.,2.0
"Waste of money,  doesn't look natural.",2.0
"Can never get it to spread evenly, could be the applicator",2.0
Did not work for me.,2.0
Didn't see much of a difference. Might be better off getting root touch up spray. You can tell the powders on your scalp.,2.0
"I suppose for very specific types and (tiny) degrees of hair loss/thinning, this might, MIGHT, be useful for certain circumstances. Medium to low resolution (or somewhat distant) photographs and videos, for example. But if your thinking this is going to make you look like you have a full head of thick hair to someone you're having a face-to-face conversation with, think again. Up close, it looks exactly like what it is: colored dust in your hair and on your scalp. It does cover fine hairs and make them look thicker, but it does NOT cling or adhere enough to be practical. It barely adheres at all and you can brush it right out with your hand. It's just dust, after all. It also mottles your scalp and makes it look dirty. I personally think I look better with out it. YMMV.",2.0
ordered wig,2.0
Didn't work for me.,2.0
"When I shook a bit on my hair it matched quite well. The bits that got on the scalp looked greenish and then clumped together. I can't imagine using this on thin hair and then going out in a warm place or to exercise. I will try it some more  but I don't think it will change. I guess it adds body to hair but if your hair is thin, it might end up looking strange. I think the purpose of the product is to conceal thin hair by adding color and texture.",2.0
"Didnt stay put-could see little black clumps form that looked unnatural and stuck out against the hairline. What was worse was if I worked out, the dye they use for this product would cause the sweat from my head to turn green.",2.0
It didn't do what their commerical shows.  Waste of money,2.0
"While it does help fill in the gaps, it can leave your finger nails very dirty if you forget and touch you hair. Make sure to wash it out before going to bed. It leaves you hair and scalp very dirty.",2.0
Works as expected but packaging is sooooo small,2.0
It was too small for the pump which 2as probably my fault for thinking that it would come in a bottle that fit the pump. I was shaking the fibers they would not come out so I gave up on it. There currently sit to on my dresser.,2.0
Color I wanted was brown. It looked black on my scalp.,2.0
"Works only with certain hair styles and depends on the thick or thinness of your hair at certain parts. It will kinda work if you have average to thick hair but if you have thin hair it just falls through and you end up with the color you chose on your scalp. They should have this in different sizes since everyone's hair size is different. I have concerns about the product that does fall on your scalp of which you can't see,since it could block the pores on your head and if you're taking propecia will this stifle the upcoming hairs you're trying to get back?

Overall it's good if your now starting to loose hair or maybe if you shave your head really low and use it. Some of those videos aren't showing the real  result of using the product,some people use couvre along with this,maybe that might work better.",2.0
I really just wanted to try this so I brought a the smallest one.  No impressed at all.  A little too messy for me.,2.0
If you have a real bald spot it just makes it look like fungus is growing on the top of your head,2.0
"Make sure you read the size label.  They should call this a TRIAL or TRAVEL size.  It is about 1.5"" tall, if that.
The package it came in was ridiculous (that's an Amazon thing).  The dark brown is nearly black.  It's a little too dark for me, even though my hair is ""dark brown"".  It might work great, but I have to play with it a little more.",2.0
"I'm sure it would be fine for someone with more strands of hair, but the fibers just won't hold. I used the spray and everything. It's pricey, but I'm going back to hair cubed.",2.0
"Well, it does SOMETHING, but not much, and does not produce the dramatic results shown in their before and after ads, unless they used several containers' full on the woman's head. I shook quite a lot on, it is not shiny, so has a dulling effect, but was disturbed to see all the tiny fibers in the air that were released, that I was likely breathing in as well.  Can't be good for you!  In my view this is not worth the money so I will be returning it.",2.0
"I liked the product but the size was like a sample size, way to small for the price, very disappointed and will not order it again because of that.",2.0
It doesn't work as advertised unless you use LARGE amounts of it :/ Also slightly difficult to apply without the spray tool (which you have to buy separately).,2.0
"I purchased the Glycolix Elite Facial Cream Fortified from another website. I bought this cream because of all the excellent reviews. But, after using it I can see now that my pores are a lot bigger than they were before. It made my overall complexion look dull and dirty. It is also very oily. At first I thought maybe I have finally found the perfect moisturizer with a perfect price, but I guess not. [Oh, and this product contains paraben, for those who care].",2.0
"This did not work well for me, even with the spray applicator.  Too much money for something that really didn't do the job.",2.0
too itchy,2.0
"I was not happy with this product.  The cream is thin so it will go on easily and absorb quickly. However, the price and the results don't justify buying this.  I have used many others- more and less expensive products, that do a better job with making the skin soft and more subtle.",2.0
I have very sensitive skin and dry because of the winter. This does not work on my skin. Makes it all red and swollen. My husband ended up using it for him.,2.0
"No matter how I try it, this powder just makes my scalp look patchy.  I tried a cheap brand from Wal-Mart at a fraction of the cost that worked just as well.",2.0
It's black powder.  You look like you've dumped powder on your head.,2.0
"If you are missing quite a bit of hair, the blonde will not work for you.  Did not cover at all.",2.0
"Buyer beware. The main photo shows a taller bottle of Toppik, which I already own, than than the bottle that was sent.  I already owned the size the picture showed.  Instead, this is 0.11 oz as shown in the pictured of the tilted bottle; look at the distance between the top and the title.  This is about 2"" tall and less than an inch wide. I like the the fibers well enough, but this was overpriced.",2.0
It[s powder without an applicator and I think that's a ripoff. Why sell something that you cannot use without buying something else? You don't.,2.0
The black is too black. Lots of the fiber comes out in big chunks together. Does not Spread very well.,2.0
one of the items was open when I received it .,2.0
Looks fake,2.0
"Not for me, hard to apply and to keep off your forehead. Comes off during the day.",2.0
"Its more of a powder than hair fibers. With the small bottle being hard to manage, it comes out too much at a time and is very course in hand.not what I expected",2.0
When I apply Toppik it does not bond to my hair! It falls right onto my scalp! Soo my hairline still looks thin but I have blotches and blotches of brown powder patches. I bought a Toppik spray that is to help attache the Toppik. It does help the fibers attache a little better but the spay makes my hair stick together like glue! Glad it works for many of you. Does not work for me!,2.0
did not work well for me. messy and can definitely tell the difference between this product and your hair.,2.0
Was excited but realized that the product works better on dark hair color.  The blonde hair powder has a yellow tinge and is too obvious for me to use in the front hairline due to color differences.,2.0
"Gooey, large particles, would not stick to my scalp. Returned product.",2.0
"Not what I thought, the direction was in small print couldn't read them.",2.0
Didnt work well and didn't blend with my natural dirty blond colored hair,2.0
Unless you get the sqeagy accessory its application is a big messy mess.,2.0
"Looks very fake but an okay substitute (delivered same day via Amazon Prime) in a jam until my GoFybr's arrived (GoFybr's are shipped from the U.K.).

The Toppik hair fibers are too thin and do not look natural on African American hair. The brand GoFybr's are made of 100% cotton so they lay and look much more natural on my texture of hair. Above is a pic of the Toppik fibers on the left &  GoFbyr on the right. I hope this was helpful.",2.0
"Unmanageable  container- ugly color, too( my hair is fire engine red)",2.0
"I've used Toppik Auburn Fibers for years and have been very happy with it.  However, now they've changed the color and the Auburn is more like a muddy brown than Auburn.  I tried to phone customer service and got a person in Utah who had no clue and kept apologizing to me.  The bottle seems to be made somewhere new too, because it has Auburn/Roux/Rojo on it, rather than the old bottles that just had Auburn on the label.  So best to go to a beauty supply where you can inquire about the product.",2.0
"Waste of money, my fault for not paying attention to the amount/size. But, seriously only enough procduct for one or two uses.",2.0
This Hair product was not what I thought it would be.  Just my opinion. It may work for others.,2.0
Did not bond to hair as well as I expected . Recommend the use of a holding spray.,2.0
Not anything to write home about. It does not work as well as I expected.,2.0
"Blonde doesn't cover much. Bottle is TINY! It's like 2.5"" tall.",2.0
"I got this in light brown.  I have slight hair loss from a medication I was taking, at my crown.  This looks like dirt, & sucks the shine from my hair wherever it falls.  The color is not even remotely brown or light brown.  More grayish black brown. I gave it 2 stars because I like the shake it on container.",2.0
I tried this for both my husband and myself.  It was hard to apply on the crown of my head. It did absolutely nothing for me. I put it on my husband and from a distance it was great but up close it looked pretty bad.,2.0
"I gave this two stars because it's so tiny it may last 1 day if I'm lucky. It's way overpriced for what you get. Apparently I wasn't paying attention to the size and amount you get. It's tiny even in the palm of my hands.. I just bought the full size for a little more money, not much...Reccommend buying the full size not this tiny little sample size..",2.0
It smells like a dirty ash tray. Too much blowa out when pumped,2.0
Glad I bought the small bottle to try. This did nothing for me except glob on my scalp and make it look like I had dirt in my hair.,2.0
The color was much darker than the last time I bought. Ordered same color as before but definitely not the same.,2.0
Didn't work,2.0
I purchased this from a beauty supply place before and this doesn't seem like the same quality. Disappointed,2.0
Way too expensive for only getting a third of the jar full.  It only last a few uses.  But overall if it's just for special occasions it might be what you're looking for.  Not something I'd want to pay for every day use.,2.0
"Seems to have gotten grainy compared to how it use to be, I've been using it for 18 months and I've moved brands due to raising prices and less quality.",2.0
Gave me incredible headaches.,2.0
Did not really do much coverage.  I don't know if I am using it right or what.  Advertisements were so misleading.  Was so eager to try it before delivery but disappointed with the results.,2.0
"Ordered light blonde received what appeared to be light green, tried it twice and both times it looked terrible. I wasted my money but at least I ws smart enough to purchase the smallest trial size for less than $ 7.",2.0
Didn't make my hair look thicker. Did cover up the part in my hair somewhat.,2.0
se sale al tocar facilmente,2.0
Its very noticeable the psrticules on the scalp. Its not blendable.,2.0
The product was not sealed and dispersed in the carton completely,2.0
Glad I got the smallest size to try. I keep my hair cropped pretty close (1/4-1/2 an inch); this ended up just looking like powder on my scalp. The medium brown also has a green tint to it.,2.0
"There are better more natural looking products out there, especially for more textured hair types.",2.0
Used to really like the product but the massive price increase has me looking for alternative options. The stuff works but I can't justify spending over $500 per year for this stuff.,2.0
The formula has been changed since my last order. Instead of covering the bare scalp with colored powder it's fuzzy like lint.,2.0
"If you have highly sensitive skin, PLEASE DON'T USE THIS. Your scalp will burn and itch after a bit. This doesn't work on people who have significant thinning hair. It looks as if you have colored hair rinse residue that hasn't been washed off the scalp (like many elderly women do), in direct lighting. It's not easy to match colors as they are limited.",2.0
Trial size/Single use.  Purse or pocket size.  Not much bigger than a thimble.  Overpriced for what you get.,2.0
Too light,2.0
"Seriously a rip off/joke. $50 for a container 3/4 full. Before this brand became super popular, they'd fill up the container. Time for a different brand.",2.0
Color is more blue-ish than gray.,2.0
"Don't sleep with this in. I spent a few nights at parties and in the morning, it looks like dirt and bugs in your scalp.",2.0
Too expensive for the amount,2.0
"My first review was that I liked it but after actually using it more than once, I noticed even though I pat it down to my head, it still managed to come off and onto my sister's head rest in her car. And this is a pretty good sized one and you'd think it'd last, it's almost gone less than a month. I 100% recommend  Gofybr.  They now ship on the US instead of the UK:))",2.0
"The ""light brown"" is very reddish colored. I have light brown hair but could not use this because the color was so red.",2.0
I don't like this product. Its not so blended into your scalp,2.0
"It covered okay although a lot darker than expected- but makes a mess and I can't wear it in any heat as any sweat causes it to ""clump up"" and look like dots on my scalp.",2.0
The color was way lighter than the previous bottles I've bought. The color is yellow not blonde.it looks unnatural in my hair unlike what I've bought before.,2.0
"this stuff is okay.. i mean, it does make your hair look fuller but it also clumps together . maybe i should try getting the applicator. i will see about ordering an applicator , but by itself the product clumps. its like throwing just black powder on your head. it doesn't really stick that well , but its not bad to be honest. its good for someone who wants thicker looking hair but i think the applicator is necessary to get good coverage.",2.0
It's purple instead of light brown. Otherwise good.,2.0
I switched to this brand because I thought the product was the same as toppik just less expensive. After 6 months of using it I didn't like how it looked so I tried Toppik again and I look so much better even my wife noticed. Its not worth saving the 10 bucks on this. Save money on something else.,2.0
"If you have seen some of my other reviews, you're already aware that I suffer from alopecia and am looking for ways to disguise my scalp. Toppik is so expensive, and has a great reputation. So, I was excited to discover I was able to try a small 3g size before committing to a full bottle. Unfortunately, I'm not sold on the product, and am not sure I want to buy a larger size.

From all the reviews I've read and watched, it seems the best way to apply these fibers is to invest in the cap that allows you to spray them on. However, the cap doesn't fit this tiny sample bottle. So, part of my dislike may be because I am unable to apply them in the best manner recommended. I did look around the house for something I could use to spray them on with, but I couldn't come up with anything. So, I ended up watching some youtube and manufacturer videos, shaking the fibers on after making various parts in my hair, and then gently patting the Toppik to kind of put it in place.

My first problem was the color. The dark brown looks black to me (and actually has a purple tint if you try to wipe a spill up or rub it with your fingers), and it was way too dark for my hair. But aside from that, I couldn't figure out how to get the fibers to do anything but fall directly to my scalp. I am not so bald that there is nothing for them to grab on to!

Once the top of my head is completely covered with the Toppik, my hair does appear fuller because no white scalp shows through. But I was under the impression that these were also supposed to cling to my hair, and make it look like I have more hair. They definitely don't do that. And, even after copious amounts of hair spray, if I accidentally touch my scalp, the fibers move out of place and reveal my scalp. Once that happens, which is inevitable, there is no way to move them back into place. Instead, I have to waste the precious powder by applying more.

So, yeah, I guess these work alright for thinning hair. It does disguise the scalp, which creates the illusion of fuller hair unless you're up close - and how many people are really going to do anything more than give your hair a cursory glance? But, I get the same effect from using a tinted dry shampoo, and that has the added benefit of giving my hair a lot of volume, which the Toppik doesn't. Toppik is so expensive and I can't see paying for it when I prefer the dry shampoo. I may break down and give it a try with a bigger bottle and the spray cap, but until then, I can't recommend this product. At least not when shaken on to the hair.",2.0
"This is not for me.  Too powdery, can't put it where I want it. It just awful on my hair. Tried it once and that's enough for me.",2.0
"Find caboki blends in more naturally.  At least with the black toppik, it has a tendency to turn blue on the scalp.",2.0
"When I opened the package for this item, I was a bit taken back when I saw there was no clear seal sticker. I didn't pay too much attention to it until I used the product and realized it was half empty. I usually buy this product monthly or so and never experienced such a dissatisfaction from this sender.",2.0
My husband doesn't like it at all.  It looks like he put stuff right on his scalp. It doesn't seem to blend well and just doesn't look right.,2.0
"I have baby fine hair and I needed a little help around the hairline. No matter what I did I couldn't get it to adhere properly or look natural. The texture  difference between my silky hair and the product was noticeable. I would get some fallout throughout the day which caused horrible eye irritation..I could see how this might help for people who need it more on the crown, but for me not good.",2.0
"Not as advertised do not blend into hair,
Looks powdery",2.0
I guess there is really no substitution for real hair on your head!,2.0
Didn't realize what a tiny amount I was getting.  Next time I have to order the giant size!,2.0
"Just go with Hair Illusions. I tried them first but I didn't like ""shaking"" the fibers on my head. Then I bought Toppik. It looks suspect.  A close friend told me that it looked like dirt on my head. Its very grainy. The fibers are so small that they will get lodged between your fingerprint lines.  I got it for the spray applicator. Its just not quite subtle enough. Looks like i got a Beijing dye job. The holding spray doesnt hold sh#t. But if you use Lusters Pink Spritz, it'll hold up pretty damn good. You cannot blend it into a fade. Not even with a super soft blush brush. Its not a bad product but its not a good product either. I got hair illusions and a ""wide spray bottle"" to apply it without shaking it all over the place. Not the spray bottle with the straw connecting to the nozzle...its a hand pressurized, plastic bottle. They sell them here on amazon for like $16. Its worth it. Way better than toppik's spray applicator. Im not hating or throwing shade. I just call it how I see it.",2.0
"This fiber works well but the truth is this keratin fiber is extremely expensive per gram in comparison to fiber you can get on Ebay or here on Amazon from other vendors!....when you get down to it and strip the names off of these labels, you really only have two major options for realistic and natural looking hair fiber.  Gossypium Herbaceum Plant fiber (Caboki uses this) and Keratin Animal fiber (Toppik uses this)  They both are effective at providing natural looking hair coverage and most brands use one or the other of these 2 solutions....so it really only comes down to the cost to help you in your selection once you decide on which type of solution will work best for you.
So to keep things in perspective, Toppik is one of the MOST expensive solutions when you can get a product of equal caliber for alot, alot less per gram.  For example, you can purchase 75grams of another brands Plant fiber for the same price of 12grams of the Toppik and get the same results.

Trust me on this please as I have a bald spot in my crown the size of a monk and I've tested about 8 different companies and found very little difference in about 6 of the 8 products I've tried.

Among some of the ones tested:

Toppik
Caboki
Samson Hair FIber
Follic Tech
X Fusion
Finally Hair
Hair Squared
Westwood Hair

There may be a few more...but for the most part they are all very similar in performance and I wouldnt be surprised if they almost all came from 1 or 2 main factories.  Dont be fooled by the marketing.....get the stuff that is the cheapest and just refill the shaker bottles and you'll be looking sharp in no time",2.0

"For the price I paid, bottle should have been full to the top and when I pulled off the small screen on top the bottle is only half full.  This made the product look cheap since you did not fill it up to the top.  Not worth the price!",2.0
"these fibers are too small, they don't hold on the hair but rather drop onto the scalp. This product is cheaper than cabuki but it does not work as well. I bought one with their applicator, and the applicator seems to be ok, but the fibers not. I got enough hair for cabuki to hold on, it is just this one that does not stay on",2.0
"If you're trying to cover up frontal thinning this will not work. It doesn't bind to hairs like it says it does, it goes on your scalp like dark powder.  It looks way worse than the natural look - actual very comical.

doesn't seem to do much except make head itch,2.0
Disappointing..,2.0

"Terrible product. I ordered a sample size to give this a try. I wanted to fill out my thin edges when I pulled my hair back in a ponytail. This product was such a mess and hassle to deal with. They say not to be heavy handed, but you have no choice to be. The product barely if ever comes out. The product barely goes on where you want it to go. And of course a lot of product comes out when you apply it. Cleans easily with a baby wipe. A little does go along way. And it is true to color. I would recommend to get the travel size, to try it out first.",2.0
"Got product very quickly, but I ordered medium brown and received dark brown. :(",2.0

Messy and didn't look very natural. Maybe I don't know how to apply it or maybe I don't have enough hair to make it work.,2.0
"I have used Caboki hair fibers once before and I assumed this would be the same.  It is NOT.  When I used it on my crown it moved forward throughout the day and ended up making my entire forehead brown! I never had this problem with Caboki.

 It works ""ok"" but I would return the item if I could and will likely not use it.  I am going to go ahead and re-purchase the other brand as I never had this problem before.

I will see if I can post a photo of my forehead.",2.0

"My wife likes this product to cover thinning spots. We bought an applicator on Amazon that was demonstrated on the Dr. Oz show and searched for the right size can to use with it.

"My fiance bought this for me hoping it would hide a thin spot for our wedding pictures.  After a little reluctance we did a trial run.  Lets just say the Manscara looked about the same as it does running down the face of a crying woman.  One sneeze and out comes the black snow.

If you want turn a few towels black, maybe a pillow or two and the head rest of your car then go for it.  The only thing worse than a bald spot is a leaking bald spot leave a trail of sad tears along the way.

We both had a good laugh and never touched the Manscara can again, maybe someday I'll find a use for it if the kids accidentily shave the dog or something and we need to cover it up before mom gets home.  Lets just hope the little guy doesn't sit in her lap when she has her nice pants on.",2.0
works only for short hair and video is overrated.  I would not buy it again.  Length of hair makes it obvious,2.0
The color of the product is not as dark brown as the ones I used in the past. I am not quite sure it is genuine product actually.,2.0
I purchased the brown and it looks more black. The bottle is small as well. I've used other products from different companies and have had better results.,2.0
wrong color  much too dark..i started with the screen light brown..when ti switched over to choices and prices it decided to make all of those darkbrown and I foolishly did not notice it...so we are stuck with it.,2.0
"Did not look natural. When sprinkled on, the powder made spots on my scalp and did not distribute evenly. When I ran my fingers through my hair or scratched my head, I ended up with powder under my fingernails and on my hands that looked like dirt. Perhaps lighter shades would work better or on people with skin color closer to hair color. I have light-med skin and very dark hair (I ordered the dark brown powder). I ended up returning this product for a refund and decided I'll just live with my hair the way it is.",2.0
This does not stay in place and clumps up.  Feels like dirt on your head.  I am going back to Xfusion which is much better.,2.0

"shows like I have put dried mustard in my hair. After a couple of hours, it's gone. Will not try again.",2.0
It takes too long to cover the patches. The colour was too dark for brown. It was like black. It cannot be used for large areas of baldness.,2.0
This product needs a way to apply.... could it be in a shaker can?  I do not find it useful.,2.0
"I have some thinning in my part, and have been using Joan River's Great Hair Day for years. It gives a slight itch sometimes but is easy to brush on and gives full coverage. I bought the Toppik after reading reviews of no itch and how it works better than Great Hair Day. I kept shaking it on my head and it didn't look like the powder even came out. Then I slowly see a pile of powder forming on my hair, and I had to mix it in with my fingers. I even tried using the Great Hair Day brush, to no avail - the brush didn't pick up on the Toppik powder. I used the Toppik applicator for parts which I bought seperately, but that didn't work well either. I'm back to using Great Hair Day and the Toppik is sitting ignored in my closet.",2.0
"I don't think I have any allergy to the materials it contains, but applying this caused my scalp to feel itchy. Otherwise it works firly well and produces a natural-looking result, especially with a bit of practice.",2.0
This stuff is a rip off!  Does not work as shown on TV commercial!  I would not recommend this to anyone!  What a mess!,2.0
Found this product difficult to apply neatly on it's own.  It's rather messy and hard to distribute evenly; partiuclarly on areas near the face (near the crown of the head).  Perhaps it would be better with the applicator for an additional charge.,2.0
Regarding my experience....can't be use outdoors as i suppose as rainy & too warm weather will affect the product and keep u in embarrassing state .. don't know about you :),2.0
I bought the Toppik to help cover grey roots in between salon visits. The Toppik does not work very well for this purpose.,2.0

"I didn't like this product. The powder is visible on scalp! you need to use a lot to make it invisible, and I think in that case you would look not natural! So actually I don't use it and unfortunately couldn't return it since I started to use it very late after I received it",2.0
It don't seem to work as well on women and it says it does on men.  It doesn't seem to cover the bare spots that well.  I guess if you want to buy it and try it you can tell for yourself.,2.0

"I am fairly young and I was in constant search of a product that would hide my bald spots. I looked at Rogaine and trying vitamins like Biotin and such...but I wanted instant results. So I came across this product. My bald spots are located at the top of my head near the back. Maybe where the scalp ends. It's unsightly and it doesn't help that I have very thin hair, so I can't hide it by just moving hair around lol. Quite honestly, I don't want to end up leaving my hair in a bun for the rest of my life to hide my bald spot. I like variety. So, when I received this product, I was really excited and I applied it to the spot. It's extremely difficult when your bald spot is at the back of your head...obviously it's hard to apply something there when you can not see anything. But I went on, and used two mirrors to see what I was doing (one in front and one in back of me). It looked great from far away, I was still concerned with how it would look if people had to stand close by me. It looked great...really great from far away. I was ecstatic that it blended so well.

Here comes the problem. I noticed a few people that kept hovering behind me or looking in my direction oddly. I knew immediately that something must have looked bad enough to cause such attention. Mind you, no one mentioned anything to me. But I knew, when I got home and took photographs. Sure enough, the spotted pattern appeared (I included a customer photo above).

Okay so maybe you're saying to yourself, ""She should have bought the applicator!"" And you're right, maybe I should have. But honestly, I wish someone would have told me that without the applicator this would make you look like you were some sort of hybrid of human and animal. It would have saved a lot of embarrassment. I""m not going to diss this product entirely, because it worked and it looked somewhat natural in terms of color and blending. But the experience after using, over weighs the pros.

Here's another con: I must've spent 10 minutes applying that product and still the spotted pattern was still there. So that means, you're wasting product! You might not even get an even application after using the whole bottle (without the applicator). If you are still interested in this product, buy it with the applicator. I'm willing to try it, but honestly, I just want to hide under a rock until people forget this ever even happened.",2.0
"This product just covers the thin areas by providing color. I have been applying it for the past 3 weeks. However,  didn't notice any change really",2.0
"I have been growing more and more desperate over my thinning hair, to the point, apparently, of total stupidity. The proof of that is the money I wasted on this product. Reviewers advised me to order a shade lighter than my hair, so I ordered light blonde. Unfortunately, light blonde is the exact same color as my scalp, so the powder did absolutely nothing for me other than rain all over the counter, and my shirt, and make me sneeze! If it weren't so overpriced for what is essentially colored talcum powder, I might be sucker enough to buy a shade or two darker than my light blonde hair and try again. But, times being what they are, I'm going to give it a pass.",2.0
I was not happy with it.  The product just covered the scalp and did not look like real hair upon closer examination.  I think it's an over-sell.,2.0
"Great to be able to try a travel size for this.  However, it didn't cover bare spots of scalp.  I kept scratching my scalp ~ feeling that it was dirty.  This was recommended by a hairstylist, so I was willing to try it, but would not purchase it again.",2.0
I work out and when my sweat mixed with these fibers i found that the color bled out of them.  I had to run to the bathroom several times to wipe away the dark green streaks that were making their way down my face.  Similar products that I have tried did not have this contraindication.,2.0
I thought I ordered medium brown.  This is the wrong color - way too dark for me.  Wish it was right!,2.0
"This Review applies only to people with light hair.

My Brother's wedding picture were coming up and I expected a bright day, which always make my thinning blonde hair disappear.

So, I saw some good reviews for the larger size of this and thought I'd give the sample size a try.

The problem with it is that it isn't blonde in color; it's the exact same shade as the dirt in my backyard, a grayish-brown. Might work if my hair was grayish brown, but it's blonde.

I'm sure I got the right color, because it says 'Blonde' right on the package. But no matter what I tried it just looked like I had dirt in my hair (I tried all sorts of ways, dry hair damp hair, hairspray before product, hairspray after.

Even worse, this stuff doesn't go in your hair like the marketing material says, it goes on your scalp, making it darker, so the thinning hair is less noticeable.

That's great if you have brown or black hair, but my hair is lighter than my skin color, so it just doesn't work.

Bottom Line: IF YOU HAVE BLONDE HAIR, DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!

The good news (for me), is that the sky was a little overcast the day of the wedding, so my hair didn't get as washed out as it could have been. I guess I just need to learn to be a little less vain.",2.0
"I really had high expectations for this product based on the highly rated reviews, but I was very disappointed. Now I will let you know that I am an African American with natural hair (sister locks) and i have noticed my locs aren't as thick as they used to be so I wanted to see how this product would work. Well when I put it on, the color was a bit weird. Though I ordered black it was black greenish gray looking. Weird is all I can say. It kinda reminded of cigarette ashes or something and it just didn't adhere well to my scalp and between my locs. Thankfully, I found this product called Caboki (i think that is the spelling) and it's unbelievable how good this product works! It's amazing!!! I actually thought I would be disappointed with it like I was with the Toppik because usually these products are made for Caucasian type hair, but it worked miracles for my hair. My daughter is a hair stylist and I asked her to look at my hair and tell me if she noticed anything different. She just said my hair seemed thicker. When i showed her what it was I used on my hair, she was impressed. This stuff is literally like fine hair in a can or bottle or whatever the container is....that you can shake on your hair. The best part i found is that when I rub my scalp it doesn't come off and get all in my finger nails. Just an amazing product. Anyhow, in my opinion Toppik isn't the product for Ethnic (or at least natural ethnic) hair. I don't work for the Caboki company, but I wouldn't mind investing in the company because i will definitely be buying more of that particular product so I gave Toppik two stars because I would not have found that product on youtube had I not been searching for Toppik.",2.0
"Maybe it's me but, it just doesn't look like hair. More like powder on my head. Save your money and go elsewhere.",2.0
My hair dresser introduced me to TOPPIK to go along with my Rogain. Both are great but together over time they have cured 80% of my hair loss isses which is amazing. A little TOPPIK on your scalp dulls and colors your exposed skin and thats all i needed to solve the ballance of my issues. Works good,2.0
"I have been a Toppik user for many years now and have enjoyed the use of their products. I was upset though when I received my purchase that it was not at all as it was shown in their advertisement.
They had a picture of a larger size of the Toppik, 25gm, yet I was sent the small one, 10.3gm?
I was not very pleased to say the least when I open the package..
Besides being mislead, the product itself is fine..",2.0
"I'm in my early 30's and have a receding hairline. You ever sleep with hairspray on your hair and to wake up next morning with linty hair? That's exactly how I would describe the texture when you use this on your hair. I purchased color black with the pump sprayer, pick/comb, and their hairspray. I accidently sprayed the toppik powder onto my scalp and noticed the toppik color was more like dark purple. It takes a while to perfect the use of the pump to get the right amount of Toppik sprayed only onto the hair. No matter how perfect your results come out, up real close you can notice something different and I'm sure under the direct sunlight it's probably 10X more noticeable. Toppik claims that people can't even notice 2 inches away, that's bull. This is definitely a better product than Couvre the scalp concealer. Toppik hairspray is like any other strong hold hairspray, absolutely nothing advanced or special about it. The comb is a piece of crap, made out of cheap paper/plastic not even worth a quarter! Go to a dollar store and find yourself a better comb. Toppik comes off easily so avoid moisture even your sweat, wind, and any objects & elements disrupting the do. The money and the time you have to spend to get a half decent look in my honest opinion is not worth it. I rather deal with a wearing a hat then worrying about an embarrassing toppik malfunction. Maybe if you're in your 60's and not as concerned about the natural look then more power to you, but I still think people are over paying for a product that doesn't promise what they claim. I'm currently trying a product called NuHair. I'm taking the vitamin and using their hair serum. I'm only on the second month and hoping to see some results within the next few months. There are no cheap quick fixes that lasts forever so I'm going to commit to this NuHair program for 5-6 months and hope for the best. Figure hair transplant takes up to 6 months anyways so might as well give the natural method a 6 month commitment. If the natural way fails then Rogaine is a possibility and then hair transplant. Bottom line, my girlfriend thinks I wasted my money on this product (toppik) and I'm going to have to agree with her on this. Hope you guys learn from my mistake. If you guys know of any good hair transplant doctors in the bay area CA let me know. Good luck fellas.",2.0

"UPDATED REVIEW: (4/2018) After a year of using the Marvis Jasmine twice a day and flossing daily (I am religious about dental health), I was informed by my dentist that I had not one but three cavities! This is after not having a cavity for years and years. This is a huge let down as the only change I made in my dental habits was to switch to Marvis as the taste is wonderful and I love the company aesthetics (hey - it's true, they are great). However, I have to admit that compromising my health isn't worth it.

I did grow up with softer teeth using non-fluoridated water (well water) so it is worth disclosing that I started out with an uphill battle, however there was a huge difference both I and my dentist have noted since I switched to this particular toothpaste. Hugely disappointed, as now I have to find another toothpaste with fluoride in it that still tastes great (I had read conflicting information from where I bought this product originally stating it did contain fluoride, and bought it for the above reasons, re-ordering on Amazon). I have to say I don't recommend it anymore, as the cost of dental mitigation and long-term effects is huge vs. just switching to something that works to protect your teeth. :(

PREVIOUS REVIEW: This is the most amazing toothpaste. I love to brush my teeth when I get up in the morning but hate how it makes my food and drinks taste. This has some mint in it and feels like a really clean toothpaste, but is not so overpowering that you can't enjoy a meal afterwards. It does have some whitening elements in it, so you have to be careful not to wipe a lot on a grey towel, for example, but it is not noticeable when you brush.

Lastly - it just tastes amazing! I call it my flower mouth toothpaste.",2.0
"Because I have such an obsession with Jasmine, I thought this would be a great product to try. It tastes like plastic or something that would be put into your mouth after a dental procedure.
My teeth feel like an average clean after using it.
The scent is NOT that of Jasmine, more of the MINT, but with the weird undertone of another flavor; the jasmine.
Meh, oh well. It was worth a try !",2.0
"This is a pretty pricy toothpaste, and you don't get much (about half of a normal tube of Crest or other toothpaste). The flavor is good, but it fades quickly. As far as how clean my mouth feels after brushing it's nothing special.",2.0
"I was really looking forward to using this toothpaste, especially after reading such positive reviews about it.  I love mint, and I love the scent of jasmine, but had never really discovered them used together in any fashion.  Maybe it's me, or maybe not, but the initial smell that comes to my mind every time I use this toothpaste, is...now this is gross, but it smells like minty dog poop to me.  I've never smelled jasmine that smells this way, and I know that mint wouldn't, so I don't know what's in this toothpaste that makes me think of that.  To be fair, though, it is only the scent I'm turned off by.  It does make my mouth tingle afterwards, and my teeth feel really clean and the initial gross scent does subside from my olfactory senses. Maybe I'll try another flavor, but without any floral flavors added.",2.0
I have the ginger mint flavor in this same brand and decided to try this one too. When I put it on my toothbrush the smell immediately reminded me of the smell of rubber tires. It didn't taste any more pleasant than it smelled. It did clean my teeth effectively but I feel that the other flavor did a better job of freshening my breathe.,2.0
This cost 3x price of regular toothpaste and the tube is slightly smaller than regular toothpaste. I got the Jasmine flavor and it was like putting perfume in my mouth. Yuck! After one wash I immediately tossed it and ran out to the store to buy another brand of toothpaste.,2.0
I love this product but I definitely notice the difference from my drugstore whitening paste. Teeth just don't look as bright with this product. For the money I would not purchase this designer toothpaste again. I'll spend $3.50 and have whiter teeth.,2.0
Not so mint! Feel not goid as toothpaste!,2.0
It tastes like perfume. Stick with the plain mint flavors.,2.0
Not my favorite flavor. It's really Jasminy. I prefer pretty much every other Marvis flavor I've tried.,2.0
Stick with Classic Mint.,2.0
"I received a set of these as a gift and a though all of the colors were pretty, it felt like having sticky glue on my lips. Do not recommend if you want a smooth non-sticky feeling. It's a gloss that you manually click up onto the brush, I suggest one click at a time. It seemed like nothing was coming up and then all of a sudden a big blob plopped out. I like other Stila products but not this",2.0
"I love a lot of Stila products, but these lip glazes aren't among them.  They're MUCH sticker than other lip glosses I've tried (i.e. Smashbox, Makeup Forever, Laura Mercier, Too Faced, etc.) and the color payoff is more subtle than I'm looking for.  If you don't mind a stickier texture this might be for you, but personally I struggle to get over it when there are so many lip glosses that feel more pleasant on my lips and have a better end product.",2.0
"It's messy and EXTREMELY sticky. The majority of my day wearing this was spent trying to keep my hair out of my face due to the fact that this gloss became superglue and attracted stray strands of hair- sticking them to my lips. Don't let the color fool you, this product's pigmentation is subpar at best and you could find a lipgloss of this quality at the drugstore for less money.",2.0
"I like that this product seems to last long and there is no weird taste; however, it is hard to get it out of the container.  How many times are you supposed to turn it?  Sometimes once, sometimes five times.  I have a nearly full tube right now that I can't get a significant amount out to apply enough to even see color, so I don't use it anymore.",2.0
"I don't care for lip gloss that is that sticky. It also sticks on your teeth.
I would not buy it in the future.",2.0
"I bought this lip gloss looking for something that would last as long as a lip stain. The application isn't that bad (twist and wait), and the taste isn't bad, but as soon as I put it on, it's gone 30 minutes later. I put it on and it's goopy and sticky because it's a gloss, but after I wait for it to set, it still comes off within 30 minutes. And I'm not obsessively licking or chewing my lips or anything! Honestly, both cheap lipstick and lipstain from the drugstore last 10 times as long as this (and are MUCH cheaper.) Don't waste your time with this. It doesn't last and I find it ridiculously expensive.",2.0
"Does not fit the smaller brush. Flimsy and not really worth it. Ended up not returning it because it was more of a pain, so now I just have the brush standing inside it.",2.0
"just normal plastic - worth for 2$. it does the job but overpriced, quality is ok but enough for the purpose",2.0
"Not a balm, more like a gel.",2.0
"I so so want to like this! It feels and smells so good! But this aftershave always left my skin in much worse shape than when I skipped it. We're talking breaking out, red, uncomfortable rash! Oy!",2.0
"Worked ok, but I'm not crazy with the formula containing Parabens. I contacting Baxter of California a couple months back to ask if they had plans to remove this from future batches. No response from them at all. I honestly would probably not buy this again.",2.0
The product smells bad but it works.,2.0
Have use better products poor for the price,2.0
I didn't like this product. It simply did not moisturize my face like I thought it would. I would get proraso or nivea balm.,2.0
"Bought it on basis of reviews.

I will just use it as I have it now. But will not buy a new one.

No, nothing wrong with it.

But did not find anything special about it either. Will try another after shave balm later, after this one is used up.",2.0
"After first application I was orange, itchy, dry and smelly",2.0
I used this for about 5 months.  Made my hair feel thicker but didn't add any hair to my head.,2.0
It doesn't work me at all!!! I wish I had never bought such an expensive and useless shampoo.,2.0
I really don't see a difference other then a little more strands of hair coming out. I'm hoping it's not this making my hair fall more. The smell is pleasant and clean. It has a minty smell and it made my scalp feel fresh and cool.,2.0
"I purchased these two times as I noticed some significant thinning on the top. It makes your head tingle and feels pretty minty, but to be honest for the price and the changes (I didn't really notice any...) I would not purchase this product. You'd have better luck looking at some proven routines such as fish oil capsuls, biotin, Nizoral regimen, and rogaine.",2.0
"its an okay shampoo. it just gives the illusion that your hair is thicker, doesnt really help with anything. i won't buy it again because its no use, if you don't use it for two days your hair is back the way it was. don't buy it if your hoping this would cure your hair loss or whatever.",2.0
This hair product did nothing for my hair except to make it fly away.  Just didn't work for me and cost me so much money.,2.0
Made my skin very dry which led to break outs,2.0
"When the product arrived, the seal had  been broken and some of the product was leaking out from under the plastic seal.",2.0
"Although I have used many PCA products and like them all, this is one I did not like.  When I received the bottle, it looked as though it had leaked, although the seal was not broken.  The consistency was not the same as when I used a sample of the product before.  I really am not for sure if it is the product itself, or if this bottle simply was outdated and sold after the time when it should have been.",2.0
"I purchased this from this seller.  When I opened the box, the pump was loose from the container so I put the pump on it.  When I sprayed some makeup on my hand, the pump didn't work right.  There was residual makeup from the pump.  I, therefore, returned the items to the seller and ordered my items directly from Elizabeth Arden.",2.0
"It seems the ""color"" was a lighter shade than before.  I don't know if it was a different formula or just labeled wrong but it defiantly was a lighter shade than before",2.0
"The product itself is good, although it gives me static all the time, probably it's just my hair.  The packaging was horrible when it arrived, totally damaged and I won't buy from this vendor again.",2.0
"Have had this brush for a year and for some reason still makes my scalp itchy. I thought the itch would subside after using this specific brush for quite sometime, unfortunately it has not. I have not had any itchy results with any other hairbrushes.",2.0
"I got this hairbrush after years of lusting after it (yet not being able to justify to myself why one should spend so much on something like this). After seeing a recent onslaught of glowing comments about Mason Pearson products on sites like Into the Gloss, etc., I decided it would be worth the cost. I did select the kind that was designed for my hair type (long and fine, but lots of it). I am sorry to say that this hairbrush makes my hair all static-y and fluffy, and the bristles aren't long enough/straight enough to get all the way through my hair,so I would have to brush it in sections, which is kind of ludicrously time-consuming for so simple an act. However, the product is beautiful, as is the packaging, and it will look lovely lying around on my dressing table. Unless you're going for the status-symbolism element, I would say that, unfortunately, this item as a utilitarian product falls a bit short.",2.0
"I started breaking out when I bought this, but I kept trying it for a month. Breakouts kept getting worse!",2.0
"I have been a long time user of this Vichy cream but the one I received from this store had a different consistency from my usual cream...I ignored it and used this for a week then noticed my pores were getting bigger! So I bought the same cream from my local drug store and again
noticed the difference in consistency. I stopped using the one I ordered on Amazon and am using the one I bought from drug store and have noticed my pores are back to normal again. Im not sure why but the Vichy I bought from this Amazon store was different from my other ones and gave me large pores after 1 week!",2.0
"I love Vichy products but, I would not buy this again.  It doesn't seem to give me the moisture I need.",2.0
"I have really dry hands from moving from a very humid climate to a very arid one. Used this product for a little over a week, every day, multiple times a day. Didn't get any ongoing improvement in between putting it on, sometimes 6 or 8 times a day. Also had a pretty strong odor that I didn't like. Also, for a product that claims to be non-greasy, it was pretty greasy. Not as much as other products, but I wouldn't describe it as non-greasy.",2.0
It is OK but does not seem to do any better than far less expensive hand creams.,2.0
"I'm a huge fan of their lip balm stick, so I thought this would be a good find for me. I don't think it moisturizes my hands that well. I like the scent of eucalyptus, but in this product it doesn't really smell that appealing. That's just me, though.",2.0
"I was hoping for a lotion to fight the very dry weather this winter, but this is not it.  It seems to lack the strong moisturizing that I'd hoped for, and I'm not found of the smell either.  Not a good product for a woman.",2.0
Leaves your hands with a tacky paste feel. Last hand cream was Aesop which was much better. Going back once I finish this bottle. This stuff smells like Ben Gay too,2.0
"What's the difference between this hand cream and any ordinary drug store hand cream? I find myself having to re-apply throughout the day. Guess, I have to keep looking.",2.0
This product did not work for me. To me it worked like any other lotion. I work in a hospital and am always washing my hands. The back of my hands are so dry that my skin has darkened. People have started asking me what happened to my hands. I bought two tubes because of how great everyone said this was. My hands need something a little more nourishing.,2.0
"I wasn't impressed at all by this product. Greasy, the smell was awful, and it didn't do much for my hands.",2.0
I hesitate to use this product because of the strong odor.  You definitely know it's with you.,2.0

"This takes at least 4 or 5 coats to cover up yellow stained nails. My nails had been stained by dark polish and I was sick of always wearing polish while they grew out. I thought this might be a nice way to cover up the yellow without worrying about chipped polish constantly. It does not deliver on that promise. Additionally, the polish turns yellowish when exposed to sunlight, so after a few days it made my nails look even more stained. Fortunately that came off with remover and didn't cause any actual staining to the nail. The only thing I could see this being good for is if you need to make your nails presentable very quickly. If your nails are not stained and you just need to make them look a bit more professional very quickly, it's easy to swipe on a coat of this and be out the door. I'll keep this in my suitcase for work travel.",2.0

I'm very hard on my nails, as I'm a poker dealer in Las Vegas and I don't have a dishwasher so I hand-wash my dishes,  I was looking for a ""healthier"" alternative, so I bought this. Still, in all the polishes I have tried, nothing stands up to the Sally Hansen Triple Shine polish test. I will not be using this again, even though it goes on nicely and was a pretty color. It chipped the second day, and even though I retouched it, the chips got larger and were not repairable. The Sally Hansen will wear a little on the edges after a week, but then a retouch and topcoat, I'm good for another week. Can't beat that - so far! :)",2.0

I usually love zoya but the formula Is awful..the color in the bottle is amazing but the polish dries matte and darkens in color when it dries so of course u can put a clear coat on to give it a shine but that dark color it dries into doesn't go away....so sad considering the color in the bottle is such a bright vivid magenta but dries into a dark magenta or plum. I do love other Zoyas though,2.0
I am very disappointed in this product. I received it about 2 weeks after I ordered it. I tried to polish my nails with the product a few days later and the polish was very sticky. I had to remove it and haven't used it since.  I have had this brand before and have never had this problem.,2.0

"the color goes on great and has a pretty subtle shimmer but if you're looking for a light gray with gold and copper as the description says...look else where. The color is more lavender than gray.

I was hoping for this to be my new favorite.  Zoya is just not working for me.  It remains a little sticky like it is never quite dry on me and I cant figure out why.  The price is high and I was willing to pay it for a polish that was safe and free of toxic chemicals.  Maybe the toxic chemical are the things that make 99 cent polish work so well for me.  Darn,2.0

I was very dissapointed when I got this polish in the mail. It is way darker than the picture. I was expecting a vibrant bright blue as shown and that's far from what I got. It also dyed my nails a blue tint when I took the nail polish off.,2.0

BARELY any difference. Still a pretty color but just be aware that it is just like this color. Now I have two of the same basically.",2.0

"I like wearing neutral color on my nails and I usually love Essie.  I went with this color to get some subtle glitter.  I was disappointed with the product.  It goes on with lots of streaks.  It needs at least 3 coats to get the right coverage and the nice milky pink finish.  I stay away from 3 coats for nail polish because it doesn't last as long.  The good thing about this color is that it wears well meaning that chipped color doesn't show.  I wore it for almost a week, so that's good.  I doubt that I would have been able to do it with 3 coats, but I will experiment.  It is a good color for the office, but I still wish that it was less ""watery"".",2.0

You definitely need to add more than 2 coats. Super sheer and my nail shows through. I'd resell it if I could,2.0
The color does not come out like it is pictured until you apply about 4 coats. Who's got time for that.,2.0
Ok to be clear I have to point out that the seller was great! I received the product early and it was packaged securely. The issue I have with this polish it that it NEVER DRIES. I love essie but the formula on this one is aweful. The color is gorgeous but it goes on pretty sheer so it takes 3 coats just to get to what you see in the bottle. BUT even with one coat (I tried it out just to see if it'd dry that way) it'll smudge as soon as you touch anything. The better buy would be sinful colors endless blue!! The colors are identical and the formula's great!,2.0
I loved the color.  But this entire color line by Essie chips VERY FAST.  Even with a great top coat.  Fortunately it dries fast.  But I found myself having to redo my nails almost every day with all of the colors that I bought from this line.  Making me shy away from Essie for a while...,2.0
I mean this nail polish truly just like other nail polishes. So nothing is different. The people always want to find something new but I'm sorry it is Samo.,2.0
This is not really neon. You have to put 3 coats since it's sort of clear the first coat and streaky the second coat.,2.0
This was not as purple as it looks here. If it were more cool toned gray I would have loved it too. This color is best on darker skin tones. It looked odd next to my fair skin.,2.0

"I don't know what thy hype is about here.  $10 for a tube of imported toothpaste?  The mintyness is below what I'd expect from any generally available commercial brands and tastes like baking soda and leaves a dusty tasting residue in your mouth.
 No topical flouride (may be a plus for the tinfoil hat crowd) and no whitening properties.
 First and last tube for me.  It's not aweful so I give it two stars but not worth a second look even if it were $2.",2.0
"I wanted to LOVE this product... and at first I thought I did. Flavor and texture of toothpaste are incredible. Such an awesome brushing experience. However, my teeth are undeniably less clean feeling since I began using this paste.

Back to Colgate for me :(",2.0
"The Italians do style and design so well I thought this toothpaste would be a strong and refreshing alternative from the bland generic stuff we usually buy.

Italians, fantastic cars, furniture and boats. Toothpaste, not so much!",2.0

Will not repurchase, but of course I used the entire tube at the price I paid for it.",2.0

"Great product, but no fluoride and don't put it clearly publicly?  That is first.  Then, the same thing I tried on air plaine as a free gift is much better and tastier.  This is weird.  This two things are disappointing, and then thinking now it is expensive without that two features that are the highlight of it in my experience (hope it shows clearly it has no fluoride and the taste will not be as good as the sampler on the airplane).  It is not misleading but I felt cheated, since it is expensive.  A disappointing experience.  I still use it, but won't buy it again.",2.0
"I love love love the taste of this toothpaste, but it made my teeth extremely sensitive after about one month of daily use.  I had to switch, for the first time in my life, to an enamel-restoring paste to repair the damage.  Now, I just use this once in a while when I want uber-fresh breath.",2.0

"I bought the Ginger Mint flavor of Marvis toothpaste because I was hoping to get a flavor that was different from the standard mint flavors from the supermarket. The ginger flavor is basically unnoticeable behind the very strong mint flavor. If you're looking for something different or unique, look elsewhere. There is nothing to distinguish Marvis from any other toothpaste.",2.0
"This is perfectly good toothpaste with a good flavor, but it's just toothpaste.  It's really no better than Colgate or Crest and costs twice as much.  I debated giving it three stars but it is just overpriced for what it is.  I might consider using this more often if the price comes down, but it's not worth it at ten bucks a tube.  From some of the reviews you would think this toothpaste will change your life.  It really won't.  By the way, the tube looks metal in the picture but it's actually just plastic like your American brands.",2.0
"This is an extremely over-rated toothpaste.  It tastes marginally better than regular toothpaste, thanks to the artificial sweeteners...do you really want those in your toothpaste?  On top of that, it has no fluoride at all - so it is not going to be as good of a cavity fighter as regular toothpaste.  I really do not understand why this product has such high reviews, due to the cost. It's like people have to justify the cost of it to themselves.  I bought a tube just to try it out and will not be purchasing it again.",2.0
Not all that its cracked up to be. I was expecting a lot better. Wasn't impressed. Tasted like normal mint tooth paste.,2.0

But it leaves my hair with flaky residue, doesn't tame the frizzies well, and has such a sweet, cloying smell that it's overpowering. It smells like almonds, but not mint at all, so there's nothing to cut the sweet scent. At the end of the day, I end up with these white flakes coming off my head from this product, while my hair is greasy, yet somehow still frizzy. And the amount they recommend you use - 4 to 8 pumps - is a ridiculously large amount of styling product that would make it so much worse. I have extremely curly, shoulder-length hair, and always use a leave-in conditioner because my hair sucks up moisture like a sponge. I tried this as a break from the Deva Curl products, but immediately went back to my standby favorite, Deva Curl's Believe In, which doesn't leave any residue, and actually works at taming the frizz. Needless to say, I'm not a fan.",2.0

"Things I disliked about the product:

Terribly expensive. I've had better results from a store-bought products.

I have naturally curly hair and this left me very frizzy. I tried for 2-3 months to find the right combination of products (cleansing conditioner, styling cream, texture balm, etc.) but in the end I went back to Infusium&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Infusium-23-Frizz-ologie-Leave-In-Treatment-Step-3-16-oz/dp/B0019RKS5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Infusium 23 (Frizz)ologie Leave-In Treatment, Step 3, 16 oz.</a>&nbsp;and a bit of gel.

The estimate of a ""90 day supply"" is a joke. I would style my hair about every other day and it still lasted less than half the time. My hair is very thin and did not even need the recommended amount they specify but I went through the ""90 day supple"" in less than a month.

Greasy feeling. It just didn't leave that soft, conditioned 'feel' that I love for my hair to have.

Things I enjoyed about the product:
The fragrance is pleasant and there is a large variety to choose from.
It gave me a very 'natural' look and soft feel, but in the end I want Soft & Defined curls, not just Soft Frizzies.

***Do NOT buy this product from the infomercials!!
Their high-pressure phone sales tactics are horrible and I was charged for $210 of extra product that I DID NOT ORDER.",2.0
"I had really high hopes for this product after watching the infomercial.  I have naturally curly hair and I'm always looking for products that will give me frizz control without weighing my hair down or making it crunchy.  This product smells great, but it made my hair look greasy even without using it as a leave-in conditioner (and I don't have oily hair).  It also left it twice as frizzy, regardless of which products I used after washing.  My hair was definitely softer than before, but completely out of control.

The styling cream seems like it could be a decent product on its own, but beware of using with any other products as it will congeal and leave you with little gelatinous chunks in your hair!

I think that for someone with straight hair, this would probably be a decent product.  It smells great all day, make your hair soft, but it just doesn't control the frizz.  I can't recommend it to anyone with naturally curly hair.",2.0
"WEN has nothing new with this product other than another ""average"" conditioner.  Suave or Vo5 conditioners are actually better at cleaning/conditioning your hair as they have the chlorides essestial for ""clensing"".  Wen has too much ""guck"" in it. It builds up on hair.

When I used this product my hair was ""heavy"" and dull.  You don't need to spend so much or use as much if you co-was with vo5 or suave.  I actually discovered how great these inexpensive conditioners were.  I have always used expensive conditioners thinking they were what is best for my hair and tangles...I have thin, dry hair and much of it.  I have used Biolage conditioning balm as my favorite..since I have gone with co-washing (no shampoos) vo5 is now my favorite. Comb glides through effortlessly and does as good if not better than Biolage or WEN.",2.0

"Based on the Amazon reviews, I decided to try this Paul Mitchell shampoo.  It was pretty decent shampoo and I liked the tingle.  I had used about 1/3 of the bottle when I saw the same shampoo on sale at a salon.  It was a good price so I got another bottle.  It looked like the same stuff (same bottle, same shampoo color & consistency) but what made me suspicious was the difference in smell.

The primary scent of the shampoo from Amazon is tea tree oil (sort of similar to Pine-Sol).  The primary scent of the stuff from the salon is peppermint with a background tea tree oil scent (a much nicer smell overall).  Then I used the salon stuff to wash my hair.  Wow, what a difference.  The salon stuff had a better tingle, it created a much thicker lather, rinsed cleaner, and left my hair with more body. Over the next four days, I tested my theory by washing my hair with the Amazon-bought shampoo one day and the salon-bought shampoo the next day.

RESULT: The salon shampoo was FAR superior and I am certain I have been had.  I give the counterfeit shampoo two stars because it wasn't bad, but the real Paul Mitchell shampoo is so much better and I paid for the good stuff.

I love Amazon, but they need to get to the bottom of this.  I am willing to donate some of my fake Paul Mitchell shampoo for testing.  Just send me an email.",2.0

"Pros:
1. The brush is ultra light weight, and hence very easy to hold.
2. It is made of boar bristles, which softens hair.

Cons:
1. Because the brush has cork where bristles are attached, I struggle to get my hair to glide, so I end up pulling, and pulling, which hurts, and pulls out hair.

didn't work well on my hair. hair kept getting caught in brush,2.0
Really does not provide the volume it claims. Maybe just my hair but I thought it made my hair flat. Disappointed,2.0
For a $50 hair brush the handle shouldn't be ripping out my hair. I want to love it. I'm trying to love it. I hate it.,2.0
It's a lot of money for a brush. I honestly see difference in my hair.,2.0
"This brush has a very hard time going through my hair.  It gets stuck trying to round brush while drying my hair.
Maybe it's just my hair type.  Arrived very quickly.",2.0
"This is a real disappointment, since the spray mechanism that dispenses the product does not work at all.  Not one bit.  I have to pour some in my hand and pat it on, which does not do the same job as spraying.",2.0
"I don't love the scent, which is strong enough that others can smell it easily.",2.0
This stuff seems a little dangerous to inhale and you can't help but inhale when you spray it. Be aware its probably cancerous . It adds shine but almost too greasy.,2.0
It made my hair a little to greasy-looking and had an off odor.  I didn't care for it.,2.0
The lady that does my hair told me to do a conditioning treatment once a month on my hair- so I bought this. After leaving it in 5 minutes and then rinsing- my hair was one big knot and looked worse than when I started. I seriously wanted to cry.,2.0
"Was disappointed that it was a new formula, much thinner than the old one and much harder to use. Don't like the spray. Preferred thicker original product.",2.0
I thought it would be a bit better about slicking down my edges but it's not. It also leaves white residue in my hair which I'm not happy about. It's a bit disappointing after hearing such good things about it.,2.0
"not a whole lot of extra volume, not a great product. I was looking for something with more of a thickener and volume boost. This is not",2.0
Smells good thought it was cleaning well but maybe making my hair feel a little dry now it's 4 days later and my head is REALLy REALLY itchy I have to stop using this now. Never had a problem with itchy scalp before.,2.0

We always bought it from the salon so I was surprised to see t here on Amazon.
I decided to give it a try, I don't like the way it makes our hair flat and a little oily.
I don't know if this is a true Paul Mitchell product so be warned.
Will not buy Paul Mitchell products from Amazon anymore.",2.0
"I bought a tiny sample (3.5 oz) of this shampoo to try out. It smells great - like pina colada - and that's why I bought it. But that's where the pros stop. It doesn't lather up very well and it leaves my hair a tangled mess, like a mop. Of all the shampoos I've used, this one is up in the top three worst of all for me. Maybe it's just my hair type (fine, blonde, long), but other less expensive shampoos have worked much better for me; namely Nexxus, Abba, and Matrix.",2.0
The fragrance of this shampoo is not the same as the original that I purchased in a retail setting.  I am wondering if this might be a copy because of the heavy coconut fragrance.  It was also was not factory sealed.,2.0

"3c/4a coil curls.

It has a pleasant, neutral scent. It smells like baby to me. It is clear and gel-like. That's all that I like about it, really.

I tried this on a large section of my own hair before putting it on my whole head. I do this for any new hair product to make sure it won't dry out my whole head if my hair does not like it. That is exactly what happened with this particular shampoo. I only used the tiniest amount, and focused it all on my scalp. When I rinse, I let the shampoo rinse over my hair while rubbing my scalp clean, so that I don't use too much product on my curls. I could immediately tell my hair was drying out. I didn't like the feeling. I checked in the mirror ad my curls were dry. I immediately co washed with a conditioner.

I am returning this bottle to Ulta, where I purchased from. I would love to keep it since I like the scent and consistency, but if using such a small amount and only focusing on my scalp dries out my hair that much, it is not worth it.

*Only buy PM from an Ulta store or professional salons paulmitchell(dot)com lists. Otherwise you risk buying fake, old, or tampered product.",2.0
"The smell is tolerable and the hold is great, but I didn't know this was a non-aerosol. The heaviness of the product weighs down my hair so it's not as puffy. I also think the product sat on the shelf too long because the sprayer is somewhat clogged. I tried soaking it in hot water and poking it with a pin which helped somewhat, but sometimes the spray comes out in clumps.",2.0
"After using out of this container, it doesn't hold well, I think the product is not genuine Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine. Will not buy from this supplier again.

Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine is the only hair spray I use. I've used it for years because it holds well and doesn't leave your hair sticky, brushes out easily and it smells good.",2.0
"I purchased this from my local salon; not from Amazon, and this is not the product that I remember. The fragrance is different; but more importantly the hold simply is no longer there. I began using this in the mid 1980's; and one round of spray held my hair all day, even in humid weather, it lived up to it's name, your style was frozen in place, no need to re-apply throughout the day. I just sprayed my hair, giving it time to dry, and I can run my fingers throughout, nothing ""Frozen"" in this product, it certainly doesn't live up to its name or reputation. Will not purchase again if doing so from a salon makes no difference, it's just good money wasted.",2.0
This smells watered down. Not sure if it's an authentic product or not...,2.0
"This was recommended to me by my stylist and, although the spray works great on my hair, the plunger consistently gets clogged so it either depresses without sending out spray or it doesn't depress at all.",2.0
"It goes on wet, makes my hair hard and heavy.  I guess I'll use it for my male clients at work instead if gel bc I sure can't use it on myself.  I loved the idea of a pump bottle bc of my allergies but if it doesn't work then it doesn't work.  Smells good.  Kind of like mangos.",2.0
Small bottle for price,2.0
I think Paul Mitchell has changed their formula.  I've used Freeze and Shine for years and loved it on my fine hair.  The last 3 bottles I've ordered from 3 different places have all been the same and sadly different from what I've been using.  It feels like there is more water in the formulation now which does not work for me at all.  Sadly I will need to find a new hairspray.  :(,2.0
"I Love this hairspray, but the bottle I received, the spray nozzle did not work from day one.  The hairspray also smells a bit different than what I usually buy at the salon.  I probably wouldn't purchase through the internet again, but would stick with a Salon.",2.0

Leak hole in the bottle,2.0
"I've been using Paul Mitchell wax for years. I decided to try this variant as I love the smell of Tea Tree. I was extremely disappointed. This wax smells nothing like Tea Tree, and if anything smells like petrol (gas). Very unhappy with this purchase, and will revert to the orginal wax ASAP.",2.0
"Does not hold hair in position at all and I do not like the ""floor cleaner"" scent.  Overall, I am very disappointed",2.0
Packaging was suspect. The security seal was removed.,2.0
"I have used PM Freeze and Shine for many, many, many years!  The past year or 2 I've noticed that it's taking more and more to hold my hair in place.  I didn't know if I got a bad bottle, so that's why I continued to purchase it.  I would buy large refill bottles so I wouldn't run out or stock up on it when it was on sale.

It is NOT the same!  It has to be watered down or a ""new"" formula.  I'll have to start looking for a new hair spray!  I'm sad that this happened, as I used to love the hold and loved that it didn't build up on my hair.",2.0
"The product I received was not the origianl Freeze and Shine product that I have used in the past. I don't know if the product line has changed or if a different product was placed in the bottle I received OTHER than the orginal product. All I know is it was not the original Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine Spray. It had a distinct Awaphui fragrance, which is not common with Freeze and Shine. Just sayin...",2.0
"I have fine hair but a lot of it. Hard to find a pony tail elastic that I can wrap around twice. My hair is color-treated and after I shampoo and condition and squeeze my hair with a towel to avoid tangles, I still can't get a wide tooth comb through it. Switched to Tresemme Moisture conditioner and that helped the most but still took me a long time to detangle before I could blow dry. Read great reviews about this Paul Mitchell The Detangler and purchased a bottle. It actually made things worse. I'm trying to avoid adding things that weigh my hair down such as Moroccanoil just so that I can get a comb through my damp hair, but I guess that is what I am going to have to stick with. Also, the Detangler left my hair devoid of any shine. This may work if you have fine, thin hair, but if you have a lot of hair, either fine or thick, you should probably look elsewhere.",2.0
I ordered it on an accident thinking it was Paul Mitchell The Conditioner. Thought I would give it a try and it did absolutely nothing! No slip for my 3B/3C natural hair.,2.0
"This might be an ok conditioner, but it did very little to detangle hair.  I used it a couple times on my daughter's hair and I used A LOT of it and it didn't help combing through her hair.  She has fine hair, but she has a ton of it.",2.0
Not a good conditioner at all..my hair actually feels worse m.,2.0
"I wish I loved this product. I have thick wavy hair and my hope was this detangler would do the trick to help prevent knots in my hair. It does nothing. It smells nice, but so does a lot of products. I was hoping it would leave hair smooth and silky while preventing knotting waves. Instead it leaves hair greasy and I still have to yank a hair brush through my hair.",2.0
did not work on my hair,2.0
I am not sure what this product is.......a detangler it is not.............I am going to try and see if it will make a good body lotion so as not to waste it. I tried it as a leave-in conditioner and it kind of works if using only a small amount,2.0
"This sounded like a deal too good to be true. I should have known better, but I fell for it. The product I received is not the Detangler by Paul Mitchell. There is an underlying odor, not overpowering, but definitely there. My guess is that some actual product was mixed with whatever this stuff is, in an attempt to pass it off as authentic.",2.0
This must be counterfeit. It smells nothing like the same shampoo I've bought at the salon. Also it has a different texture.,2.0
"I've used this product in the past, but this was my first time buying it on Amazon and the first time buying the 33.8 ounce size. It did not have the velvety richness I was used to. I have very curly hair and it knots a lot when I wear it in a loose bun. I am used to The Detangler getting those stubborn knots out, but this particular one did not do the trick. I used it about 10 times before giving up. I eventually tossed it in the trash. I'm going to assume it was old product because I had never had that problem before.",2.0
"I bought this to reduce product build-up, rather than after swimming. I never used it more than once per week, but every time I used it, it stripped my hair to the point of it being extremely dry and straw-like! I can see how it might work well for people who naturally produce more protective oil, but it was WAY too harsh for my hair.

My recommendation: This probably works well if you have a LOT of build-up or chlorine to replace, but is too harsh for most normal use.",2.0
"The only reason I am giving this 2 stars instead of 0 stars is that it does the job as a de-tangler - but it smells horrible!  It has a strange smell - something like melted plastic, or some kind of petroleum byproduct.  I won't be purchasing this item again.",2.0
"I have used the salon version of this Paul Mitchell Detangler and it was much thicker and conditioned/ detangled much better. I believe this is an adulterated product, it is thinner and smell funny... heck it smells like and feels like Vasoline hand lotion! I will not be buying this item from this seller again. The ""real"" Paul Mitchell Detangler is an excellent product, but not the product offered by this seller.",2.0
"I didn't buy this on Amazon, I bought it at a beauty store. My hair looks fine when I use this, however since I started using it my hair has become insanely tangled. Before with any conditioners I've used, my hair didn't tangle much at all. Now, I've noticed that my hair gets rather matted constantly and I've had breakage and hair loss trying to untangle my hair. This just doesn't even seem like an actual conditioner.",2.0
"It's a good product... but not what I had thought I was purchasing. On the picture & title it says ""the detangler"" under the description further down below says ""the conditoner"". I bought this as a leave in product. This is a rinse out conditioner. Works well, but not what I had wanted",2.0

"I have long-straight, dry hair. When I get out of the shower it is very hard to comb through my hair. This didn't detangle my hair at all and, I think it smells like melted plastic.

I only bought this to give my hair a break but it definitely didn't work.",2.0

it tangles my hair after the shower and a lot of my hair falls out when I brush it!!,2.0
"3c/4a coily curls.

This conditioner is lackluster. I used a dime-sized amount on a decent sized section of clean, damp hair (how I always condition). It did not give me much slip. I finger detangled and that wasn't very productive with this conditioner. I then detangled with a comb to see if it is good for that. The comb glided through, but I suspect only because I had already finger-detangled. I would honestly have to do another test to see its detangling capabilities, but I won't bother because it didn't even condition my hair.

It did not condition my hair at all. I left it on for 10 or so minutes before rinsing with cool water. My curls were not at all defined or decently moisturized. It was disappointing, because I love other PM products (The Conditioner, Awapuhi Mist), which have left my hair conditioned, moisturized, and beautiful. After rinsing this detangler out I followed up with a cowash with Herbal Essences Hydralicious, which defines my hair and leaves it well moisturized.

The only positive thing I can say about this is the scent. It is neutral, and smells like baby powder to me. I like neutral scents because of my sensitive nose to fragrance. The consistency is medium-thick, and it is yellow in color.

I am returning this bottle to Ulta, where I purchased from.

"I ordered this mistakenly thinking it was leave-in treatment.  I tried it anyway as it was advertised as a deep conditioner.  I have thick, fine hair, which can tangle easily and has a tendency to frizz out a bit.  I was hoping this would give me some added control, but it doesn't condition half as well as products that cost half as much.  I can't recommend this product.  I hope the retail seller sent me an authentic product because after this experience, I certainly have my suspicions.",2.0

IT ROCKS....but I did like this a little but I would recommend rockaholic detangler it's great I love it but its really hard to find anymore :(........but this product was ok....i have the thinnest hair ever but it tangles alot.....i would recommend this to thick hair might be better for a thick hair girl than me with thin hair....lol.....hope this helped",2.0
Normaly this product is very good but I purchased some from Amazon and it was not the same product that you would purchase at your hair care provider.  I believe it is an immitation product.  I recommend this product if you purchase directly from your hair care provider but would not recommend purchasing this item from Amazon.,2.0
"I have serious doubts about the authenticity of this product...arrived unsealed, but shrinkwrapped and leaked all over.  Also, it is virtually unscented.  I was really looking forward to that classic awapuhi fragrance and am really disappointed--seriously considering a return on this one.",2.0
"I am doubting the authenticity of this product. Received on time, but there is no factory seal as many other users have commented. Used the product once, and you can see that it is way more liquidy than the shampoo I purchase at the salon, almost like it is watered down. It smells the same however, so I still washed my hair with it. One day later and my hair looks super greasy, like I haven't washed it for a few days. Definitely will be returning this product and buying the real deal.",2.0
Did not like how it made my hair feel. Gave it away to housemates daughter.,2.0
"POSSIBLE ALLERGEN/IRRITANT FOR PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVE SKIN!

I want to qualify this review first by stating that I purchased this product from my salon, not on Amazon. I say this because I want to clarify that I am talking about the REAL Paul Mitchell Original Awapuhi Shampoo, not the fake stuff people claim to have gotten online. That said, here is my review:

I probably should be giving this product a one-star review, but I added a star because I really liked the fragrance and the ability to use it as a body wash. I loved the shampoo at first--it smelled good and lathered well. However, I noticed a slight itching on my scalp after using it for the first time. At first, I thought maybe I did not rinse all of the shampoo out of my hair, but after using the product again--this time rinsing very, very well--I still could not get rid of the itching/burning sensations. I noticed that I started getting small to medium sized bumps on my scalp that would easily bleed when scratched, and my hair started falling out in large quantities...I'm a healthy 22 year old, so my hair should NOT be falling out. I have never had any kind of allergic reaction or contact dermatitis from a haircare product (including coloring and smoothing treatments), but I do have sensitive skin and will break out in hives if I use most skin lotions (especially ones with artificial fragrances). I am wondering if that is what is happening with me. I used almost the entire bottle--this product was too expensive to waste--and the problem consistently got worse. I decided to stop using it the other day and switch back to my usual Biolage regimen and, since doing so, have noticed a significant difference: my scalp no longer itches and the bumps are going away. However, my hair is still continuing to come out any time I brush or wash it; hopefully this will stop soon.

In summary, if you know you have sensitive skin or dry skin, I would recommend staying far away from this product. If you are looking for a new hair care product brand, I recommend Biolage. I have never had a problem with them.",2.0
"I haven't actually used this yet, but the bottle was dirty, scratched, covered in fingerprints, and had the remains of an old sticker on it. I'm not sure this was actually a new item, and I really hope that what's inside is what the bottle says it is.",2.0
I find this shampoo leaves my hair feeling dry. Maybe it is because of my hair type but that is my experience.,2.0
"I don't know if I got a bad batch of this or what but this stuff is VERY VERY thick, stringy with a snot like consistency. I don't know whats going on here. It's impossible to rinse out and leaves your scalp very itchy.",2.0
"I just prefer the old formula of awapuhi. It seems to rinse out of my thick hair so much easier. In fact,i use this as shampoo/body wash. I love the smell of this and always have from day 1!",2.0
"I have used Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Shampoo for 10-15 years and I loved it, but it appears Paul Mitchell has changed the ingredients.  I resently purchased a new bottle and now I am having an allergic reaction.  My scalp burns, itches and has red spots.  I don't have an old bottle to compare ingredients, but I noticed some of the new bottles advertise ""white ginger"" and this new bottle's ingredients does show ""white ginger.""  I honestly do not know what has changed, but I can't use it any more.  Why do they have to mess up a good product?",2.0
I actually threw this away. It did nothing. It seemed like just water.,2.0
This is one of the worst products I've ever used to try to detangle my fine hair. I ended up giving it away.,2.0
"This cream smells bad, like cheap gas station soap. It is also not as good as the Anthony shave cream, or Art of Shaving. (So I went back to those, even though they are more expensive.) Another negative, Amazon would not allow a return after I smelled (but not used) this cream, even though this is an Amazon Prime item, and the return policy isn't clearly spelled out. I filled out a complaint form and eventually they refunded the purchase price, but other than that (extra work), these are all negatives for me.",2.0
"Not good, very sticky I will not recommend.",2.0
truefitt and hill much better,2.0
I did not like it . It is not terrible and it does the job. It has a pleasant menthol smell to it. But it somehow dried my skin . Plus when I went to Europe it was sold for like 3 euro and that might have ruined it for me when I spent $10 on Amazon.,2.0
My skin gets flaky dry a day after using this.  Great lather but my skin says no no. I've tried using this multiple times and every time my skin just looks like a lizard in the desert.  Anyone want a almost full tube lol.,2.0
"It Smells weird, once you apply on face and start to shave it becomes a slimy consistency. After done shaving the cooling sensation feels good but after a week of use I noticed my face started to breakout and I got rid of it. Not for someone that has sensitive skin.",2.0
"My husband didn't like this cream, he said it was burning him while he was shaving and didn't prevent nicks. wouldn't buy again",2.0
This cream dries out my skin badly. Even soap doesn't roughen my palms like Proraso does. My face feels so dull every time after using it. The smell is ok. Not the thickest shaving cream I've used. I am ok to finish the tube but would not buy again.,2.0
Not a bad shaving cream for the price,2.0
All the reviews were positive but I find it dries out my skin.,2.0
"I had been using the Art of Shaving Shave creams for a while and just wanted to try something new....

The Proraso is priced much lower, and I soon found out why...  The scent is not terrible, but not great either.  I just don't like it much.  The biggest disappointment was the lather....  Very low lathering, unlike the Art of Shaving Shave creams which get very thick and stay put very well....  I am very disappointed with this Proraso shaving cream, and will not order it again.....  It just doesn't work that well at all.....  Sorry....",2.0
"I didn't care for it.  Wanted to.  I still have found ""Shave Secret"", purchased at Walmart, to give me the best non-irritating shave.  That and shaving in a sauna after a good 15 minute sweat.",2.0
"Not that good.  Not thick, not smooth.  You have to use much more than you do from Anthony shaving cream that is a much better value.",2.0
"I am astonished that Proraso Shaving Cream has 91% 4 and 5 star ratings here. It is nothing special, not even as good as some canned gels that can be purchased at any grocery store.
My specific complaints are about performance. It is thin. It dries quickly on the face. It does lubricate but it does not cushion, and that is a serious deficiency indeed.
Stick with the English shaving creams. They cost twice as much as Proraso and are a bargain in comparison.
I will comment further only to say that I received a tube that had clearly been used and then returned by a previous buyer, so I am done with this vendor also.",2.0
"I must admit that I am perplexed by all the positive reviews.

My beard is quite thick and tough. I found that this cream does not provide enough lubrication or softening of the beard. Shaving with Neutrogena cream or even Gillette foam from the can is substantially more comfortable.

On the plus side, the smell is strong but pleasant.

If you have thick beard I would recommend looking elsewhere.",2.0
Smells nice but does not give a good shave. Was left with shaving rash and bumps. Used all my normal razors that work fine with other creams. Will not repurchase.,2.0
"One star for the scent of old school barber shop. One star for the pleasant cooling sensation that slightly soothes my bloody face.

I have tried shaving with this several different ways, with a brush, in the shower, etc. My face always ends up bleeding all over. Around the same time I also ordered Cremo, which works much better for me. Unfortunately my wife does not like the smell of Cremo, but Proraso is not a feasible alternative. It produces lather that is too thin and scrapes off of my beard before the blade of my double edged razor gets to the hair.",2.0
Extremely strong fragrance,2.0
"This is an okay cream, but I was really expecting more. I find it difficult to get as close a shave with this cream, and it dries up on your face, making it a little harder to shave (for me, even just using soap ended up working better). I ended up not finishing the tube, and buying another kind instead.",2.0
"I get pretty bad irritation on my neck so I thought this might help.  It didn't.  It works fine as a shaving cream, it just didn't solve my problem.",2.0
it works. just prefer shaving soap,2.0
Couldn't get past the smell. It's extremely strong and I immediately went back to using my old brand.,2.0
For some reason I don't get the greatest shave with this stuff. My skin is easily irritated and I'm left with a very small rash after. It's easy for me to nic myself with this product. I literally get a better shave with cheap bar soap.,2.0
I wouldn't recommend for use with multiple blade razors.  Found shaving with this very rough on my face.  Thought this would be a good alternative to a travel shaving gel - I'll have to keep looking.,2.0
"Not really thrilled with this shaving cream. Maybe it's because I'm using a cartridge razor and not a double edge? Anyway, it dries my skin out the same way most shaving creams do, though it does smell nice and reduce irritation somewhat. I will stick with shaving with cheap conditioner for now.",2.0
Had trouble getting a good thick foam.,2.0
The new formulation is not as good as the original. I loved the strong astringent minty eucalyptus in the previous formula. The menthol and eucalyptus are basically nonexistent now. Not happy with the new product.,2.0
"this was dumb, IDK why i bought it",2.0
I found this shave cream a little drying to my skin. I wanted to try something new but I think I will stick with my Edge shave gel.,2.0
"I'd grab the Sandalwood.  Menthol closes your pours as it's cold, when you're shaving you want your pours open.",2.0
"I like this line of shaving product, but the metal tube started leaking after the second use.  I had to squeeze all of it out into a tupperware container.  It was such a mess that I'm going back to the solid version.  This formula is great though.  The two shaves that I got before the tubing fiasco were pretty decent.",2.0
Very unpleasant smell. Probably not fresh. Not buying again.,2.0
"Does the job ok just not a fan of the smell. It reminds me of old man, really old man",2.0
"This shaving cream has a most foul odor to it. The best comparison I can make is a wet dog. It's absolutely gross. Worse, the smell has lingered into my badger brush and despite multiple efforts to clean the brush with soap, the smell remains. I'm aware that new badger brushes can carry an odor to them, but the cream is what smells this way. The only reason I give the product two stars instead of one is that it works. The cream applies nicely and you will feel the soothing menthol while you shave, but the smell is just so bad. As a side note, the product is German and the package has German text on it, though I had no need to read the text.",2.0
"Lathers up nice and gives you a nice tingling sensation, but the smell is so bad that it is hard to use. To me it smells like a combination of the air fresheners and cleaners they use in public restrooms, not desirable at all.",2.0
"Like some one else said in the reviews, is this thing suppose to be runny? When I took off the cap, a good amount of the product just came up and the cream felt super liquidy. I wouldn't even call it a cream because it was just very running. Everytime i open it and squeeze it, a bunch of the cream just comes running out the tube, wasting extra. I used it once with my Badger brush and I couldn't get a good lather after the first time. I like the sent and that cool feeling you get after using it on you face.

Still the feeling of this cream is not to my taste. Just very runny and watery. I'll stick to something else next time",2.0
"I found this shaving cream to dry out on my face and not provide a good amount of protection for my sensitive skin unless I used a lot of it.  I used up the whole tube because I'm cheap, but I just didn't find this to be a great product for my skin even with multiple different pre-shave treatments.

For the moment I've switched over to Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream",2.0
"All you need is 2 pea sized balls of cream for your whole face and it does leave a soothing cool feeling.
The downside is it leaves a strong barbershop scent on you.  The smell is really strong and hard to take off.",2.0
My husband usually uses the Nivea shaving cream. He loves that one. But I decided to buy this one for him as he loves trying new products.

"I loved the old, thicker Proraso.

Not sure when it changed, but this new formulation is far thinner and less useful for my thick beard.",2.0
"I have used Proraso or C.O. Bigelow (Proraso sold under a different name at Bath & Body Works Stores) for a couple of years now and loved it.  I couldn't understand why anyone would use Edge Gel or any of the other products you see at Target or Wal-Mart, especially since a $10 tube of Proraso lasts forever.

However, I recently got a new tube and immediately noticed something was wrong.  Instead of the usual experience, there was a strong chemical smell and what seemed like significantly less menthol.  Instead of feeling great on my face, I found myself hurrying to get it off because the smell was so artificial and the feel was not enjoyable at all.  I couldn't figure out why it was so different until I did a web search and found out about the new formulation!  This is a huge disappointment.  It should have been launched as a separate product...why would you change something with hundreds of 4 and 5 star reviews???

I'm not sure what my next step is since I don't know how I can find the original formula.",2.0
"I have tired many different types of shaving creams and this one was not the greatest.  It's ok, but not as nice as I wanted.  In my opinion, I didn't like the strong scent of menthol that comes with this product.  Others said they liked it, but I don't, like I said it's too strong.",2.0
"I have bought Proraso for 20+ years. The first time I went to Italy I bought it and loved it as the only shaving cream that goes on thick. Whenever I went to Italy I would buy about 10 boxes to bring home. Then, when I would finally run out, I'd buy it in the US for $12 a tube. No more. They have changed and cheapened the product. It's not as good as American shave creams. No more. RIP Proraso",2.0
"The product works fine for shaving. No problems there. Definitely felt/smelled the Menthol. Kind of an interesting ""cool"", yet burning effect on the face.

But it smells like a retirement home bathroom. One that hasn't been cleaned in awhile. I also didn't appreciate there was no English text on the product, so I can't read the ingredients. What's ""caked-on urine"" in Italian?

It makes you smell like a 90 year old man. Since using this, I've found myself hiking my pants up over my navel. Also eyebrows have sprouted, creating little ""horns"" that I can braid into my new gray ear hair.

Do not recommend. Unless you can remember what you were doing the day we invaded Normandy.",2.0
"I enjoy trying new skin care products, shaving creams, etc., and while I was going to be away for a month decided to give Proraso Shaving Cream a try. It's not a product I'd use again; in fact, I left it behind where I was staying. As a huge Kiehl's (spelling?) fan, I've gotten some good lessons in how to apply and use shaving cream...so I feel like I know how to do this. First, the scent was off. Not particularly strong, but sort of flat. I don't like strong fragrances, which is why I chose eucalyptus oil and menthol, but there was something off-putting about the scent. Worse, even with brand new, good quality blades, I could not get my normal close shave.",2.0
"I guess i am spoiled, the first shaving cream i got was the proraso green tub. And it was everything i needed. It was cheap, lasted a long time, made for a great lather, smelt great AND was down right refreshing in the morning. In a pinch i could even lather right there in the green tub instead of busting out my lather bowl.

I do not care much for this product though. I will preface my discontent by saying that MAYBE i may have gotten a bad batch or something (cream was VERY runny, did not have the same viscosity as the tube of proraso sandalwood shaving cream i have).

I didn't find the form factor convenient either. I take a lot of flights as part of my work and this tube is just as cumbersome to fit in my dopp bag as my green tub or proraso. Since i like the tub more anyways i have just relegated this cream for home use only.

The lather this cream produced seemed to be less rich than the one produced when using the green tub. But that is a subjective observation, so take it with a grain of salt.",2.0
"I've used Proraso for several years now and love it. The smell, the lather, and the way it leaves my skin feeling are all better than anything else I have tried. However, I ordered a new tube several weeks ago, and just first used it last week when my old tube ran out. I did not realize they had changed it, but as soon as I tried it, I knew it was different. I assumed I got a bad tube--and maybe I actually did. The smell, to my nose, is almost like a petroleum product, and the consistency is much thinner. I can still smell something of a hint of menthol, but nothing like the old stuff. It still lathers well and feels good on the skin, but man it smells bad. Not sure if I should try another tube (it's too late to return this one, apparently). Any other long time users who think this new formulation smells way worse than the old one?",2.0
"I have gotten more cuts with this product by far than the foam ones and the major western brands. I have used Axe shaving cream in a tube like this, and never had one cut, but when I tried this, I cut myself many times and it always sticks inside the razor blade.",2.0
I'll be going back to the Gillette irritation defense system that I was using before trying this out. It dried out my skin and caused some irritation while shaving that I hadn't experienced before.,2.0
Bought this product before . Great product . But should have a exp. date on it. Second  tube i bought on Amazon was a little dry. Still usable just a little harder to to work with.,2.0
"I ordered this shave cream because I wanted shave cream with menthol.  Menthol shave cream used to be fairly common, but recently, it has disappeared.  I used the shave cream this morning.  It worked very well.  However, there was hardly any menthol fragrance at all.  You had to really almost stick it up your nose to detect any menthol.  I'll use it because it does work, but so does soap, which is a whole lot cheaper.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Proraso-Shaving-Cream-With-Eucalyptus-Oil-Menthol-5-2-oz/dp/B001L2U61E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Proraso Shaving Cream With Eucalyptus Oil & Menthol (5.2 oz.)</a>",2.0

Here're some pros and cons relative to the Barbasol:

The good:
- it's oil-based, so it's moisturizing to some extent
- from the customer images I gather that some people think it looks sexy lying on their counter
- it reminds some people of barber shops and fathers. perhaps they're older than I?

The bad:
- it comes in a tube, so you have agitate it manually to generate a lather
- it's oil-based, so it's a bitch to rinse off
- it's oil-based, so it's a bitch to rinse out of your razor. I can usually finish shaving before it clogs completely and I have to take it apart.
- it smells like old-man-on-the-bus to me",2.0
"This product contains propylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate, propylparaben, and butylparaben--the same chemicals that caused me to quit using American canned foams. I get better results with a badger brush and non toxic natural old fashioned shaving soap. I will say if you go a few days without shaving and apply this before using your shaving soap and brush it makes for a smoother make up shave but I won't buy again to avoid the chemicals.",2.0
I really don't like the cream. You can feel it working on your skin. It also kinda clogs the razor if too thick. It will however whip up into a big later and I know its popular in Italy. To each his own.,2.0
I have this a shot because of all the hype it has received in the reviews.  I just didn't find it all that good.  It requires a lot of water or it will stay sticky and gummy on your face and then gum up your razor.  I use a Mach3 (no fancy straight blade for me) and it would just get caked full of of the cream.  I really didn't feel any protection with it.  I got sliced and diced using this shaving cream.  My standard can of Barbarsol works way better than this did.  I had high hopes for it but it just didn't provide the kind of protection from cuts that I'm looking for.,2.0
"This cream is not my favorite. I expected it will have a lot better smell. It is good quality, you can feel that, but the smell is not the best.",2.0
No better than regular shave gel from a can such as Edge or Gillette unless you just like to use a brush.  I miss the Mennen brand shave cream I used to be able to buy.  Frankly there a lot of chemicals in this product which I didn't expect.  Not as good as Edge or Gillette gel for protecting the skin.,2.0
"I've been using the more expensive brands over the years (Truefitt & Hill, Taylor of Old Bond Street), and thought I'd give this cheaper brand a try for a change. It does not even come close.
Not only do I have to use twice as much of the product to get a shave, but it instantly dries on my face and I'm afraid that it's going to cause a nasty cut if I don't keep wetting it.
I've used other cheap brands like Palmolive and Colgate with similar results, but this was an even bigger disappointment.

"I really don't think this is doing much for me.  It's kind of a fun product to use because of the colors (green, with black kiwi seeds) and texture (very light and almost whipped) but I'm just not seeing the results I expect.

Part of the problem is that the exfoliating particles (the seeds, presumably) are not very dense in this product.  You can feel them going over your skin and if there were more of them, I think my opinion of this product would be different.  But as it is now, a large percentage of your skin is never going to come into contact with one of the seeds as you use this, so most of your skin will not be exfoliated.  Since this is marketed as a scrub, that's a problem.

This is gentle and non-irritating when used a few times a week.  If you have sensitive skin and have had trouble with microdermabrasion-type scrubs, this could still work for you.  Please note that it has alpha hydroxy acids and so should be used in combination with a sunscreen.  It does rinse off cleanly and without leaving residue, as well.

For what it's worth, I'm having more breakouts with this than before I used it.  I don't necessarily think it is causing the breakouts, but the less-effective exfoliation (as opposed to my previous scrub product) is slowing turnover of my skin cells, which is what's causing my problems.

In the end, this may be worth a try if you have really sensitive skin.  Otherwise, I'd look for a different product.  (Please note: you can read the full ingredients list in the product images.)",2.0
Doesn't work that well. I have to really scrub to get my NYX gel liner off. I like their waterproof remover much better.,2.0

"I thought initially that this was a cheap imitation of Mustela, but it seems that it is a new formulation. Why change something that works?

My toddler cries every time we use this shampoo. Also her dandruff does not go away as I thought it would with this natural shampoo.,2.0
May state that it's hypoallergenic but it still contains a perfume that caused rashes on our infant. Confirmed with pediatrician that it was a skin rash and not baby acme.

Took too long to dry my hair, the handle got so hot every time I used it, I finally decided to go back to an Elchim. I was so excited to get it, it was a breeze to dry my thick hair, until the heating element broke after about two dozen uses. So disappointed.

I feel bad when I dry my hair early in the morning because I wake up my family from the noise.  The air also blows too strong...feels like it's messing up my hair more than anything and the heat on this dryer is not hot enough.  I also have a CHI dryer and it's much much quieter, it doesn't blow strong air, which I like, yet dries hair quickly.",2.0

It was very powerful and was harder to manage and control.  I may not have given it a fair shake but it was just too much for me.  It was not loud or too heavy, although I was used to a heavier dryer.  I got something else for half the price and am very happy with it.",2.0
"FIrst, I'd like to state that this would be a perfect dryer for someone with different hair type than me.  It's obviously well built and does provide quiet heat.  I give it a two star because I personally can't use it.  It's too much of a hassle to return it, so I'll just give it away to someone.  I bought it because I listened to reviews saying it was great for fine hair.  IT""S NOT!!  It's way too powerful and there is no ""low"" setting.  It makes styling with just a brush impossible.  I have fine, shoulder-length hair and if I use this dryer, I have to dry my hair and then use another device to style.  Ugh.  There's no ""cool shot"" button on it, but it's not that big of a deal to switch the heat selection over while drying.  There's three heat levels, but the last two are the same temperature.  An aside, it came in a box like you see, nothing else.  So it was just rattling around in there with no padding or even a plastic bag.  Like you'd see at a lawn sale.  I have a friend with thick, long hair and I'm sure she'll get plenty of use out of it.",2.0

Well this one sparked even more than the other one and even zapped my finger. I also read another review about that and should have listened. it is not a bad dryer at all and actually dried my hair decently.

"To start off - my skin is oily with redness and large pores but I don't struggle with acne. This product may work better for someone with drier, acnaeic skin. My main goal with concealer is to cover redness, large pores, and acne scars on my cheeks.

You get a lot of product in the tube so I was really hoping it would be my new favorite concealer. Unfortunately it's difficult to apply as it doesn't really want to stick to skin. When I try to blend it it moves around and I end up having to use a ton to get it to stay in one place. If you can get it to stick where you want it, it settles into fine lines and doesn't do anything to cover large pores. It has a very dry, makeup-y finish so it's best to use it on very small areas. It may work well to cover pimples if you have acne but I think it would be very difficult to apply it to a pimple. If you have larger areas to conceal, this is not going to work for you.",2.0

"Background on my skin.....I'm in my late 30s and have been suffering from acne since my teens. I've tried all kinds of products from over the counter, to department store to prescription-only topic and oral medications. Nothing worked except for Accutane, but after 2 rounds of Accutane and the acne eventually returning after I stopped taking Accutane, I'm trying to find something else.

I was using a 15% glycolic acid cleanser, which I really liked, but when I used it up, I thought maybe I should look for a glycolic acid treatment that I could leave on overnight (on the assumption that I would reap more of the glycolic acid benefits). The cleanser I was using stung a little when I first put it on, so I thought I would stick to a 15% product and work my way up. But these glycolic pads don't sting at all, which makes me wonder if they're really doing anything. And after applying it, my face feel a bit sticky and itchy, where I almost I want to wash it off. But I'm sticking with it, at least until I use up the pads, in case I do end up seeing some real results. But for now, I don't like it, and I don't plan on re-purchasing this.",2.0

I used them for about a week and other than the adverse reaction, I did not see any other results. I am going back to the brand I know works and does well with my sensitive skin.",2.0
"First, the item arrived with a crack in the jar and had leaked all over. To my surprise the pads inside the jar were still wet enough to use so I tried it. It leaves my skin feeling greasy, which I don't care for. I think 20% is a great place to start if you've never used glycolic acid before, or if you want to add it to your daily routine. I will not reorder these. I will look for another brand at 20% for daily use.",2.0
"I am beginning to think all these glowing reviews are bogus. I used this product yesterday for the first time and I was less than thrilled with the results. First of all, it WILL make you look ghostly, and I am actually very pale to begin with!! Secondly, it was drying to my oily skin. By the end of the day, my face still looked ghostly, and also shriveled up as well. It had also settled into my pores and fine lines, and was sliding off of my cheeks too. And lastly, how do you wash this crap off??? I had to wash my face three times to get it clean!!! Sadly, everything I have tried from this company has been overhyped and overall not very impressive.
I do have to say that it didn't irritate my very sensitive skin though.",2.0
"I bought this product in hopes that it would not break me out and unfortunately it does. So now I let me kids use it and I'm back to searching for something else.

I think I would really like it if it weren't for the breakouts. It soaks in well, and is not too sticky. and I can imagine it works well with make up. But I can't even use it because I get huge deep pimples and lots of them. So I can't recommend this to others.",2.0
I bought this for my trip to Spain.  I used it for a week with no problems then one day it started steaming and melted my hair when I put my hair in it.  It burned it right off and I had it set at 8 which is a low setting.  Then the next day I put it on 13 because it was cold and it never heated up.  I got a second one and it is still extremely hot even when I set the setting at 2 which is next to the lowest setting.  I feel like it is burning my hair.  I am afraid to continue using it.,2.0
I did not know that I would be receiving a Conair iron in a Babybliss box. So I didn't get what a was expecting. I'm a hair stylist and there is a big difference. Lesson learned. I will buy my professional products from the professionals.,2.0
This is the second one I've purchased in three years- they just do not last. I won't buy again.,2.0
It didn't seem to work as well as my Titanium curling iron but perhaps my hair just didn't react to it.  Didn't hold the curl.,2.0
I do like the curling iron but I could not get it to work in Europe using a converter to 110volt current.  I had no way to test it prior to my trip.  Will keep looking for another product.,2.0
Does not stay got long enough my curls lasted 5 min after I had it on level 23 suppose to be 400 no go,2.0
Burns my hair.  Even on the lowest setting.  I have very fine gray hair and it really made it a frizzy mess.  Very disappointed.  :(,2.0
This curling iron did not get hot at all. I returned it right away. The Babyliss nano/titanium series one i got to replace it is great and virtually the same price.,2.0
One of the screws came out the 4th time I used it. It's not made very well. I'm a hairdresser and have had my equipment for many years. I treat my tools very carefully. So for this to break means it's not made very well.,2.0
It curls well but is damaging to the hair. If your hair is in great condition you'll probably love it.  Weak hair will not do well.  Either way use a very good treatment oil to allow the iron to slide through the hair without snagging it and to lessen the damage.  I personally prefer the gold irons.,2.0
"This curling iron works fine, BUT the handle is very sticky, leaving a sticky residue on your hands which has to be washed off before using that hand on ones hair.  I would like to return it but because I was traveling for a whole month, I missed the deadline for returns.",2.0
Unfortunately this item was defective and I had to return it.  The on/off switch didn't work right.  It kept siwtching itself back and forth.  I am disappointed since the features looked promising.,2.0
I thought it was awesome until it suddenly died after about 3 weeks of light use. Boo.,2.0
Very disappointed in quality.  Spring seems more loose and do not get the curl I did with previous curling irons.  Having to use higher heat setting than recommended for my hair.,2.0
Sent back. Daughter did not like it.,2.0
"It may be my hair, but it does not hold curl at all. Flat as soon as curl it.",2.0
Does not get hot enought and does not hold tight when curling.  I've been using curling irons for years - this one not the greatest,2.0
"The picture says the is ceramic  in gold,however I received silver and is very light and heats ok",2.0
If you don't use a blowdryer professionally it may be ok unless you use it every day. I had one years ago and it lasted a long time. I used it professionally not more than 5 times a day 4 times a week and the heat element went on it today. Works fine just no heat! Useless to me. I would rethink before buying this.,2.0
Average,2.0
used a few times and works inconsistently....not good quality,2.0
Don't expect a $200 dryer for $20 and you won't be disappointed. I got this and the GHD and there's no comparison. Not even close. Sorry.,2.0
Why do they have to put the on/off switch right where you grip the handle and turn it.  I turn the switch on or off a couple of times when using it.  What a pain!,2.0
This is not like the last Hot Tools Hair dryer I owned. It never gets real hot and it blows hot and cold on the same setting.,2.0
"this was useless to me, my flat iron can curl much better that this thing, i don't even know why i bothered buying it. i might be donating it or giving it away to someone.",2.0
The curling iron heats up fine and does not burn my hair BUT the dial to set the heat is located right where your thumb hits it every time you push down the handle to curl or release your hair.  Because of this the heat reduces and you have to start over to heat up the curling iron.  I would not recommend this product because of the location of the heat dial.,2.0
"I was looking for a curling iron with a 220v plug.  Used those search keywords.  Curling iron came up and even said for 110-220v plugs.  However, you have to buy an adapter and I was purchasing it so that I wouldn't have to buy one.  The adapter plus the curling iron costs more than I would've paid for one here.  Disappointed.",2.0
"Seems well made, but be careful in figuring out which size you want.  I bought it as a gift, and ended up re-gifting to someone else.",2.0
"I purchased my curling iron like this babyliss in March of 2013 Since the time of purchase the switch has not worked properly. I have to hit the ""on"" switch several times to get it to come on.",2.0
"I have a ""no frills"" hairstyle (long, naturally straight and fine) that can air-dry and still look okay.  Therefore, I have never been one to spend a lot of money on styling tools.  I bought this very basic, inexpensive hair dryer since I normally don't have time for air-drying.  It worked ""okay"" for the past 2 years--it dried my hair in about 10 minutes but left lots of little frizzes on top that I would then have to smooth out with an iron.  It just met the bare minimum requirements for a hair dryer, nothing more.  I cleaned the lint filter regularly and only used it a few times a week.  I was therefore surprised when it shot out sparks and smoke while using it yesterday morning.  I carefully unplugged it and disposed of it.

I have always heard that with hairdryers, you actually do get what you pay for but I wasn't too concerned with it.  However, since the performance of this hairdryer was nothing special and it didn't last very long, I guess it is time for at least a modest upgrade with my next hairdryer.  I am wishing now I had just bought a nicer one to begin with as I will be out the same amount of money, having to replace it so soon.",2.0
"I purchased this curling wand as I currently have a single voltage Babyliss 1"" model (which curls beautifully) abut wanted a larger, softer curl and also thought the dual voltage would be perfect for travelling.  I am very disappointed with this purchase as the wand barely produces a curl in may hair at all, even when the highest heat setting is used and very small amounts of hair are taken at a time.  I have long hair that curls and straightens with other products just fine.  I would not recommend this item.",2.0
"The product arrived with a sticky residue all over the handle.  I tried several grease-cutting solutions to clean it and was unable to get even a small amount off the handle.  I paid extra for shipping for the product to arrive in time for a trip to Ireland, but had to send it back because it was unusable.  Very disappointing.",2.0
Kinda cheap looking and kinda loud,2.0
"Very quick delivery, product is not as good as I expected. Not very powerful, although it does dry hair fast. I figured the watts at 1875 would be as strong as my old conair. Wouldn't purchase again :(",2.0
The cord was faulty.  It shut off whenever the cord connected to the tool was moved in any way.  I loved the fact it was ceramic and heated fast.  Instead of buying a replacement  on line I decided to look locally for one.,2.0
Ordered for my wife for xmas. She likes it but it is not CHI so be mindful of that. Had it gift wrapped when sent so I had no idea it was not what says until she opened it lol.,2.0
I'm not impressed. I bought it solely based on the rave reviews. I have thick hair and was hopeful this would help me get some pretty waves/curls but am disappointed.,2.0
"I liked this hair dryer while it worked. It was light and didn't tire my arm or wrist, it got hot enough to dry my hair, and it wasn't extremely loud like a lot of dryers are. However, after a month and a half of using it once every day for about 15 mins, it stopped blowing hot air. It still blew air and everything perfectly, it just stopped heating the air. So, I had to get rid of it because cold air does not work well to dry my long hair. I think it might have just been a lemon, because I know sometimes there's just going to be defective items in a group. Amazon customer service was quick to help me though, and I was able to get a refund.",2.0
It takes a few seconds to get the hot air and the plastic attachments fall off. I wouldn't buy again.,2.0
"Most importantly, the iron doesn't get that hot. I want to see smoke after a minute because that's what 400F should do! The stand gets way too hot because it rests on the iron. The on off switch is poorly located so you inadvertently end up turning off the iron or lowering the heat setting while trying to load your hair. Whack!",2.0
"Purchased product 9/7/2012.  By 4/6/2013, the product does not work.  The dryer is not overused - 2 times per week, maximum.  I call Helen of Troy products to make a complaint.  I have to pay the cost of shipping the product back to them and wait a minimum of two weeks for them to return a replacement to me.",2.0
Works ok...does not get hot enough so my hair looks good for the first couple hours but not the whole day.  Would have been worth it to pay a little more for better quality.,2.0
"I tried multiple times to get nice waves/curls using this product. I tried using it on clean hair, dirty hair, and with lots of product. I tried changing the length and angle of which I curled my hair. I tried using smaller and larger sections of hair. No matter what I try I can not get this curler to leave me with a decent curl! I am convinced that it is the ceramic plate that prevents me from this effect. Even when set on the highest heat setting, it only gives me the effect of straightening my hair with a slight wave at the ends. I would return this product if I could. I'm going to give it another try but if anyone knows a solution to replacing this curler let me know!",2.0
"This is a good blow dryer, but less then a year later it broke.  I hardly ever write bad reviews, but my last blow dryer lasted me over 5 years.
So I would recommend a blow dryer that cost a little more, because you'll end up spending more money having to buy another one in a year.",2.0
"I'm not a hair dryer connoisseur, and I have 100% curly hair and just wanted it to dry my hair before I flat iron it occasionally but it kinda leaves my hair frizzy and not smooth like it says ~ I can only compare it to my roommates Conair hair dryer that I seemed to get a better result with.",2.0
"I was happy with this dryer for about the first week, after which Low speed no longer worked and it was stuck on High all the time.  It sounds like a few other reviewers have had this same issue.  I would not recommend this product, and am going to buy the Helen of Troy Professional Ceramic Hair Dryer (which I've used at my gym and works great, and seems to be a higher quality product) instead.",2.0
"I bought this a little over a year ago, used it 5 to 6 times a week to dry my short hair, and kept the dust/lint trap clean regularly. Loved this dryer and it dried my hair quickly. However, after barely a year, suddenly it blew nothing hotter than luke-warm air. I put up with this for a couple of weeks until one day it blew only cold air. Very disappointing, as I'd really liked everything else about this dryer. It's now been replaced with a lesser but more dependable brand until I can find something comparable. Look elsewhere or expect a limited product lifespan.",2.0
I love this curling iron.  I could use it here and abroad.  Many settings for all hair.  You won't need a transformer for 110 to 220 but you will need a plug adapter for were you are going.  I would definitely recommend this product.,2.0
"I just bought this blowdryer a week ago, and I admit that it works great on my very frizzy hair!  The problem?  It broke the 2nd time I used it.  The on/off button broke and so I can't turn it off.  It's stuck on high.  Definitely not worth it!",2.0
I was impressed with this hairdryer until it broke on me the fourth time using it!  I would advise you not to purchase this.,2.0
"I bought this to take on a trip to Europe, but ended up leaving it at home.  The unit is too big and heavy to be practical for travel.",2.0
Lotion is really watered down. Not sure if I just got a bad batch but definitely not very moisturizing. Not worth what o paid for. The regular Mustela baby lotion is creamier and thicker and costs less. I got the stelatopia cream because it supposed to be better for eczema. But this lotion is very very watered down! Will not buy again. I can't recommend this product.,2.0
Dont notice any difference in my eczema.  Was disappointed it didn't do anything for me since its pricey.,2.0
"I used this lotion on my first daughter when she was a baby for her excema flare ups and I remember it working really well. I bought it off amazon to use on my second daughter and she screamed and screamed as I applied it after her bath! Not sure if the formula changed or what, but I couldn't bear to try it again after she reacted that way...",2.0
"My 4 month old son started developing eczema when he was about 6 weeks old and I have been trying out several products. Mustela seemed attractive since this was specifically made for baby eczema. It actually worked pretty well on dry area such as shins, arms and back but, like some other reviewer has mentioned, it worsened the rash on his neck, armpits and back of the knees. I think it works on regular eczema since it is very moisturizing but not on areas that tend to get heat rash.",2.0
Not worth the $$. Felt like it did more drying than moisturizing. I will stick with Cetaphil or Cerave.,2.0
"I got this along with the cream cleanser for my daughter who's been dealing with eczema for almost 4 months now. Based on good reviews I got this, desperate to find the right cream. This cream does not do a better job than any of the other fragrance free creams. It's simply labeled for eczema and its pricey, but nothing effective.",2.0
MY sons skin broke out,2.0
Didn't really help with eczema,2.0
"My daughter had no reaction because she's older and her eczema isn't an open wound, but after reading the ingredients list which is on the mustela website and not the packaging I wouldn't have purchased it. The product is mostly preservatives and alcohols plus one distillated oil. I don't doubt the one star reviews regarding burning on open wounds. Skip this and try metaderm organic for eczema or psoriasis.  I wouldn't put this on an aggravated rash if they paid me.",2.0
Worth every penny.  Absorbs quickly and has lasting healing effects.,2.0
"It might work for others, but my son's skin is very sensitive and in the winter he gets very bad eczema.  I think this made it worse.  It might work well for others if their skin isn't as sensitive but it did not work for us.",2.0
We use this cream on my two-year old's face because he was having issues with dry skin. It works great for him. However I just tried using it on my two-month old daughternwho was just diagnosed with eczema. She screamed bloody-murder every time I touched her with it.  I'm quite disappointed that I won't be able to use it on her.  I'll have to find something else.,2.0
"I am very ready to love it, I heard it is wonderful from exzema-prone skin.  But it did not seem to work that well.  My daughter kept complaining every time I put it on her, probably it stung her itchy skin a little.  I do love the bath gell from this brand, it works great as soap for body/diaper area/shampoo.",2.0
"I bought the Mustela Stelatopia cream, the wash, and the milky bath oil when my little girl was about 1 month old.  They somewhat worked for a little while, but they don't completely get rid of the red patches....  They work, but they are more expensive and they don't work as well as....

OK, here is what works for my child: (1) I apply a thick layer of Cetaphil cream (not the lotion)all over after bath or whenever the skin looks irratated, (2) I stopped using any baby wash until the condition greatly improved, then only use baby wash no more than once a week, and rinse well.  At the beginning, I applied Cetaphil on her several times a day.  After about two or three days, all the redness went away.  In the past 14 months, Cetaphil cream has been what keeps my little girl's skin looks perfect.",2.0
"I've always used The Body Shop tea tree toner before, but as that ran out of stock I decided to try something different. I found the Herbal Mint Toner after alot of research on the internet. Sadly, the toner does not absorb into my skin quickly, and also leaves a lot of white foam around. I have stopped using it.",2.0
"Baxter of California Herbal Mint Toner smells more like bathroom cleaner.  In terms of what it is suppose to be used for, it works quite well.  My husband really liked using it after shaving.  It soothed his skin and it left him feeling not dried out.  However.... The smell was offensive enough that I would not buy this product again.",2.0
"My husband tried this product.
He applied it without difficulty and it did not cause any irritation.
However, he did not like the smell.

I checked with him a few days later to see how it was going.
He stated that since he didn't have a habit of using a toner or doing anything other than very basic skin care, he found it impossible to add to his routine.",2.0
"I get very intrigued my men's lines of skin care products and loved that this line had body washes in different fragrances.  But upon use I found it to be subpar to the regular brands I use.  It is called ""invigorating"" in its name but it is just another body wash and subpar at that.  I was looking forward to the pear scent but found the fragrance to instead not be natural at all and barely present.  The smell I did get from it seemed to have a chemical base.  Also I understand that heavy foaming with a body wash is not necessary but I had to use many pumps of this product to get enough of a lather to fully wash my body.  I was glad to try this product but for me it was nothing special and will not be a regular part of my showering regiment.",2.0
"I understand the concept of creating a spa line for men. I respect that. This body wash could be used by a man or woman. The scent is bad. It reminds me of cheap imitation perfumes. it actually gave me a headache. It does clean the body. Other than that, I do not have anything good to say about it.",2.0
"How can one review a body wash? Well, really, there's three major things to consider. 1) The biggest of course, is that it works to actually clearn you. 2) Does it foam up well so that it's easy to use and 3) How does it smell.

Well in regards to 1), I guess this does get the job done. But when combined with 2) and 3) it just fails -- while the smell isn't that big a deal, it's always nice to have a more pleasant smell when washing oneself. But 2) is the biggie. If you're using body wash, having it not foam up too well doesn't really help to get you all that clean, because you either have to end up using more of it, or do more work to try and get it soapier. This is where this really fails, and while when you DO get it on it seems to work fine (and not feel weird afterward)....add that to the somewhat high price and you've got IMO a pretty lousy result.",2.0
"I expect soaps to have some lather, but this just seemed to kind of disappear when I rubbed my hands together to work up a lather.  I found it best to pump the soap onto my hands, then rub onto my skin without trying to make a lather.  I think this body wash still got me clean, but it was weird to not see any lathering.  The scent is a bit on the feminine-side as it has a light floral smell.  Not unappealing or lingering, but definitely noticeable.",2.0
"PROS:
brightening effect lasts all day.  although i am uncertain as to whether or not this serum repaired my skin at a cellular level, i will say this: within seconds of applying, a noticeable brightening effect is achieved.  i received several compliments on my all-day youthful glow!

CONS:
as others have stated here, the serum appears to be watery and grainy, and not at all what you'd expect from a $100 product.  with that said, given that amazon is not listed as an authorized reseller on jan marini's site, i suspect that i purchased a knockoff.  more troublesome is the fact that despite dispensing a tiny amount each morning, the bottle finished in 6 days.  i am more inclined to believe that i received a half-empty/used bottle than to say it was all my doing.  serum is tolerably scented.

FINAL THOUGHTS: overpriced, possible counterfeit, research shows that one of the ingrediants (DMAE) isn't as amazing as many purport.",2.0
"I've loved this product for about 5 years.  However, with the last two bottles I purchased, I noticed an awful, sweet fragrance akin to a rotting body.  I can't use it under or on top of my nose with gagging occasionally when I get a whiff.  As a result of the new ""improved"" product with the higher price, this will be my last purchase of this product.",2.0
Is a great product.  Been buying for two years- leaves my skin smooth and soft.  But now it is $99?? Are they out of their minds??. It used to be around $50. I'm shopping elsewhere,2.0
Was hoping for more of a miracle with this product....  I've used it several times now and I don't feel any tingling or notice any exfoliating.  The disappointment is that my face does not even feel clean after using it.  The fragrance is great and I generally love Jan Marini products so I will give it a few more chances.,2.0
"I purchased this eye cream and had high hopes for wrinkle reduction.  I use it 2 times a day and have seen little to no results.  I recently went to a class and they suggest Emu Oil.

Does nothing for the circles under your eyes.  Waste of money.,2.0
"When I first started using this product, I thought I had found a miracle.  The bags under my eyes were noticeably smaller and the skin around my eyes seemed smoother and moisturized.  After about a week, I noticed swelling around my eyes, but chalked it up to a hayride, although I've never had that reaction in years past.  After continuing to use the product, my eyes continued to be more and more swollen.  I still didn't make the connection that this cream was causing the swelling, and, by this time, flaky, dry patches, because the initial results were so good.  Anyway, in the end, I had to take a round of prednisone and discontinue using the cream.  After a week, my eyes were finally back to normal.

I'm sure not everyone would have the extreme reaction that I had, but I thought I should give people a heads-up that this product has the potential to build-up in your eye tissue and cause a delayed allergic reaction.",2.0
I still had a lot of acne around my nose.  This product did not work for me and it did not remove all of my makeup.,2.0
Don't waste your money. This product did nothing for my under eye puffiness. It is an expensive moisturizer and you could get that for half the price.,2.0

You are paying alot for this small bottle which doesnt help . Its light in weight and no smell.,2.0

I am in my late 20's and have dealt with dark circles under my eyes for my entire life. It must be hereditary because I'm already noticing them on my four year old daughter.

Moisturizer temporarily helps small lines

Cons:
Does nothing for dark circles
No better than most eye creams
Expensive",2.0
I used this product in the hopes it would diminish the dark circles under my eyes. I have used it daily for over a year now and I see no difference in the dark circles. It works okay for wrinkles so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. I could have saved a lot of money. My recommendation...try something else.,2.0
"I have not seen any change yet but I am not giving up yet. I am only 31 years old and look young everywhere except for my eyes. Very puffy and starting to have circles as well.

"I have hereditary dark circles and a hereditary wrinkle under my eyes (been there since I was a kid) that puffs up often.  I saw a slight change at first but nothing significant.  I stuck with it though as a part of my daily regimen, and a little over a year later, I think my eyes actually look older.  I switched back the neutrogena eye boost at 1/5 of teamine's price and my eyes looked 5 years younger in minutes. I do need something for the aging I am seeing though so I am going to try restalin silk since boost is really just a quick fix.  So my final review of my product is that I ended up in the other 50% that it doesn't work for.  My recommendation is try some samples first and if it's working pay the $50-$75 for the pot, don't go for it right away because it doesn't work for everyone.",2.0
"Of course it may be too soon, but this product did not work for me.  In fact my eyes look more puffy.  Perhaps, I'm allergic to the ingredents.",2.0
"I wanted to like this. It sounds perfect in descriptions and user reviews. Was not for me, however. It made my skin work overtime making extra oil. The feeling of oil mixed with mica on my face was irritating. I also broke out in itchy spots here and there. I guess my skin is just too sensitive. In fairness, it's probably linked to the pharmaceuticals I use on my face at night. I know that makes my skin sensitive to the sun, probably minerals too.
Hope this guides somebody in making a decision...because I assume you can't return used makeup. :(",2.0
"I did not realize that this was a refill. Otherwise the foundation is a perfect color, hopefully I can carry it in the plastic container that it was sent in",2.0
I bought this with high hopes after reading all the 5 star reviews. It made me look weird like a yellowish tone. It did last all day I usually have to reapply I have oily skin but when I looked in the mirror It was such a strange color like I was sick.,2.0
This really is a wonderful powder. I just had a bad reaction because apparently I am allergic to the white pine extract in it. That said it did cover my pores and make my face look smooth.,2.0
In my opinion it is not what it says it is. Its like a thick base coat.,2.0
Worst base coat I ever used. Manicures last two days.,2.0
"This bottle will not open.  Not sure if it works of not, but I had it for a few days now and still cant get it open.  Ive tried many times and I tried soaking the top in acetone but it still didn't work. Also disappointed because the bottle arrived loose in a giant cardboard box. Im concerned of the bottle cracking. Definetly not worth the price.",2.0
They don't work too good.,2.0
"I have used an inexpensive base coat for years and have never had a problem.  I recently purchased the OPI because I was buying some other OPI products.  However, the first time I went to change my nail enamel after using the OPI, I realized that my nails were stained by my nail enamel (also OPI).  I have always used a base coat and have never had my nails stain until this time.  I'll go back to the cheap stuff.",2.0
"Fast shipping, but DOES NOT look like how it does in the picture. The one I received is clear, with not even a trace of pink in it. The writing is off on the bottle, the handle is smooth which authentic OPI bottles have a textured handle. There's no OPI printed on the top of the brush (all authentic OPI should have one). The brush is very flexible, which authentic OPI brushes do tend to bend a bit, this one bends WAY too much. I fear I have a fake. Extremely disappointing, especially because I paid almost $7 for it. Buyer beware!",2.0
"I was hoping it could protect my nails from staining nail polishes, but it really does not do a great job. It made my nails yellow instead of protecting them against stains from nail polishes. I had to switch to china glaze, which is a bit better.",2.0
I find it peels quickly,2.0
My nails chip three days after application. I've had other base coats that have held up for a week.,2.0
I received a bottle of clear base coat.  It is not remotely pink.,2.0
"I was so excited to get this base cost. I got it not even 4 days later, that was awesome! However, I've been using it for a month now and it makes my nails peel really bad :( so much for a base cost for natural nails. I'm so disappointed with it. I've never had this problem.",2.0
"Got goopy within a couple of months. Cannot really use anymore. I even tried to put some nail polish remover in there to un-goop it, but to no avail. Beware!",2.0
the polish comes off so easily with this. I have no idea why I purchased it.,2.0
I use OPI base and top coat. My polish still chips in a day for two. Probably would not buy this again.,2.0
"I usually love my opi nail color, and this is why I figured that this would also be a good purchase. It's not a good formula, because it is very hard to achieve an even coat without streaks, even with two coats. And I use a base every time I paint my nails, as well as a top coat and for some reason this stuff just wants to flake and chip off. I don't even use it because I was so disappointed with it. The color is not anything to write home about either. Super bland and flat color. Nothing that I would expect from opi, but no one is perfect all the time. I usually don't need to even use a top coat with most of their polishes, but this one sucks with or without.",2.0
"a family member has been using this daily for years -- and then was diagnosed with an eyelid infection.  probably had nothing  to  do  with this product, but stopped using it just in case.",2.0
Didnt like the way it felt on my face but they took it back with no hassel.  Thank You.,2.0
"I ordered this product after getting a sample in a Birchbox.

When I got the full size and used it the other day, it felt like I was applying a thick glue-like substance to my face. Maybe I used too much but I was suddenly regretting I ordered the product.",2.0
The product arrived in an open and crushed box. I thought someone had tampered with it. Seriously sketchy. Picture shows it right out of postal box.,2.0
Made me break out after two uses,2.0
"Apparently, this moisturizer has about five different parabens in it.  If you care about that sort of thing - this moisturizer is a major no-no.  I didn't read the label - this thing has about eight different chemicals that will make you go ""hmmmm."" With 300-some-odd companies signing the cosmetics compact, Baxter of California should be ashamed, considering parabens are normally present to help something either not be rotten after a while, or SMELL GOOD.  Obviously, it wasn't for the second reason.

Oil-free it might be, but I'm not really sure what everyone else is talking about with the ""amazing finish.""  It left my face looking shiny, every time.  I don't really need a moisturizer leaving my face looking like I dipped myself in olive oil.  The smell is definitely ""fragrance-free,"" as in they left the chemical smell in it.  It's positively foul.

The reason this thing gets two stars is that I didn't break out.  That's a miracle in and of itself.  The moisturizer, as moisturizers go, was likely being supplemented by my serum that I use daily.  I'm not sure it's all that great.  It just didn't ruin me.  So, two stars.",2.0
"I am extremely prone to breakouts, which is why I have to use oil free lotions on my face. Not all oil-free lotions prevent my skin from breaking out, though. This is by far the thickest oil-free lotion I've ever put on my face. I liked it and hoped that it would work for me, but after two days, I started breaking out. I had to stop using it. I gave it to my sister who loves it, so it really depends on your skin.",2.0
"If you have acne prone skin and its dry do not even bother with any kind of lotion oil free or not. I use every BOC product multiple times daily and they all work better for my skin then products my derm gives me. I had this sitting in a drawer not even opened yet since I bought it for the winter when I get dry skin and now its winter time. I pulled this out rubbed on my clean washed and acne free face, the next day BOOM! Small white-heads everywhere at least 10 or more, and a fair amount of blemishes. I will forgive baxter for this products since the only reason my face was clear to begin with was daily use of there skin toner, and facial scrub. If your like me acne prone and have dry skin I would recomend using aftershave, even if you do not shave. Of course my recomendation is Baxters after shave balm.",2.0

The only reason I gave this product 2 stars was because the return process was very efficient!  Other than that I saw NO difference between this gloss and ones you can get at CVS for much cheaper. Also it definitely does NOT plump your lips at all! So NOT worth $16!!",2.0
"I was expecting something...better. For the price and the hype I thought it would leave my lips super moisturized, maybe looking healthier, more plump. Nothing! It was heavy and sticky.",2.0
"Such a tiny tube, and to be honest not really worth over 10 dollars. I frequently apply it and haven't really noticed much of a difference at all. I don't really mind the smell but others tend to complain about it.",2.0
This product doesn't do what it professes to do.  It's really just a really expensive lip moisturizer.,2.0
I use chapstick constantly and have tried so many brands. I was not impressed by this product for the price point. I felt like it was more drying than moisturizing. I would not recommend.,2.0
Ok. Can't tell much of results and I've been using it as directed for the most part. It smells like grandma and is overly glossy. Kinda looks like you drooled all over your lips.,2.0
Did absolutely nothing!,2.0
"No difference, might as well use chapstick.",2.0
Really thick gloss. Like really thick and made my lips look juicy. However I saw nor felt and plumping effect...,2.0
It's good for moisturizing not for plumping.,2.0
"I've used a variety of lip balms and hydration solutions, and I found this one to be sub-par.  It felt heavy on my lips, and didn't seem to sink in like other treatments.  It also felt sticky.  After about half an hour I ended up wiping this off, because it felt like it just sat on my lips.  As far as moisturizing lip treatments go, I'll stick to Fresh's Sugar line.  It's more expensive, but works so much better.",2.0
This the second order of this product.  It seems more difficult to apply and thinner than the first order.,2.0
Not sure if this really works.....but they sure are comfy and warm. Great for winter feet is wager.,2.0
I can't believe I paid $8 for this little tube of hand cream. I was suckered into the Bliss name and had to try it. I needed to re-apply more after less than an hour. I'll save my money and next time buy three tubes of my Nivea Sooth Indulgence Hand Creme. The product puts the expensive Bliss product to shame.,2.0
Doesn't work,2.0
Not as named high intensive. It is not better than regular drug store hand cream but costly.,2.0
"gave it away, as it was much darker than sample shows when ordering..didn't want hassle of return..",2.0
"This is NOT a lip stain, it is a lip gloss! There is no color residue at all and it fades away in 2 hours even with no eating or drinking. The plastic case is cheap, and the product has a horrible greasy Vaseline feel. I gave 2 stars only because it does have  SPF. I am going back to my old standby for approximately the same cost, Fresh Sugar lipgloss in Rose. The case is nice and heavy and has a screw top so it doesn't fall off in your purse. The Fresh Sugar has a yummy lemonade scent and a normal lipstick texture.
 ADDED-12/15  I dropped the plastic cap on the bathroom floor and it split in half. I am peeved-a lipstick from the Dollar Store would have had a sturdier cap. I had to use Duct Tape to fix it and boy, does it look awful. Never again will I buy this product!",2.0
Doesn't stain at all. It is fine as a lipstick but it is not a stain. I am disappointed.,2.0
I really wanted to like this but it made my face break out everytime I used it.  I guess I will be giving this away.,2.0
"I bought this soap to get rid of my brown spots, well I been using it for about 4 months I don't see a difference. However, even though I have dry skin I was having issues with some pimples showing up around my chin all the time. Thanks to PCA they are gone! So I am giving 3 stars because it didn't work on the spots.",2.0
"If it not working, you can't return.
Also, this item soooo expensive!
Marshall store: $20 same size",2.0
I did not like the scent; this may be a personal preference issue and have nothing to do with the quality of the product as I have not compared it to a store-bought sample.,2.0
The product is great but it is highly overpriced. I've gotten twice as much for $25 less. YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS PRODUCT. Beware.,2.0
"This thing is overrated. Yes, I like that the smell isn't overwhelming. However the scent doesn't last very long and the scent also isn't even that great smelling compared the my previous perfumes. Wouldn't buy again, mainly because it's overpriced for something mediocre.",2.0
Beautiful bottle but it did not smell good on me. Wanted to love it but after a couple of times I still didn't appreciate the scent.,2.0
Way smaller than what I had envisioned :(,2.0
"I guess the Lolita Lempicka perfumes are just not right for my body chemistry. I smell it on everybody else and I love it, when I smell it on myself it smells like bug spray. So just wasn't for me.",2.0
"I usually LOVE this perfume, but very disappointed with the bottle I have received. I don't know the reason but the smell is very light, it smells slightly of alcohol and doesn't last 5 minutes. Nobody can smell it on me, so what's the point?!. The one I had before was prefect  and could smell it on me for ages but I don't know what is wrong with this one?? Maybe an old bottle or not the original?? It really bother me and will probably won't order it from Amazon again.",2.0
"This has an unpleasant smell, certainly not as described.  Waste of money--gave it away.  That person didn't like it either",2.0
"I think this is the sort of smell that you either love or hate. From all the reviews I was convinced that I would love it and took a chance, which is something I normally wouldn't do. Unfortunately, I was just not a fan of it and neither were my friends. We all agreed that it smelled unique and interesting, but beyond that didn't find the scent very pleasant.

The initial smell is what really gets me. For whatever reason it reminds me of perfume mixed with vitamins. It eventually becomes a much better smell, a little powdery and sweet, however this is not enough for me to like it.

My old friend used to wear this perfume, which also may be why I'm not fond of it, since it was all over the room we shared together. I didn't know that until the perfume arrived and I smelled it. So that could also influence my feelings on it. But overall, I think it's definitely unique just not the perfume for me.",2.0
"I don't know if I got an old one or what, but this perfume smells like spray starch. Or like a cross between spray starch and those old, unscented hairsprays (like ""Aqua Fresh""...do they even still sell those??).

Was totally bummed because everyone seemed so happy with this scent and I bought based on the reviews.

I ordered the ""L"" by Lolita at the same time and it smells great! Nothing at all like this other (and reviewers said they were close sisters), so maybe I did get a bad bottle.

Update: After 2 hours of smelling like spray starch, I scrubbed my skin with a hot washcloth. THEN it still smelled, but it smelled good! Musky/powdery/vanilla like people described. Still smelled strong, just no spray starch. And it smelled almost identical to the way the ""L by Lolita"" smells right out of the bottle.",2.0
"After reading all the reviews on this fragrance I cold not wait to try it. Unfortunately I must disagree with most of the reviews. I can only explain this as it must smell different on different people due to body chemistry. On me it smelled old fashioned like something my grandma would wear. It is sweet, and powdery, and not at all spicy. As they day goes on the scent fades into something that reminds me of that old cheap bath powder I got for Christmas as a kid. You know the one in the pink plastic container with the big fluffy powder puff? By days end I could not wait to wash it off. I would definitely test this and not buy based on reviews only. The most positive thing I can say about it is the bottle is very cute!!",2.0
You have to be a fan of the Green Tea smell to appreciate this scent.  For me personally I do not like this scent and it sets off my allergies.  I would recommend you go and get a sample at your closest Arden counter and then try it out.  As it also changes dramatically from the bottle to your skin.,2.0
"Ive been on the search for an authentic green tea fragrance for the longest time, so today I went out of my way to acquire the uniquely popular Green Tea by Elizabeth Arden.

First off, I am extremely picky regarding chypre fragrances, the combination of citrus and labdanum on a bed of oak moss has the potential to smell like synthetic floor wipes to my nose. And unfortunately this seems to be the case with GT; theres something commercial about this fragrancethe citrus and mint are horribly sweetened and smells processed to boot.

This is a frag that I have smelled before; like being inside one of those retail stores such as Origins and The Bodyshop. Its generally the same: start off fresh, and then settles into something sweet and Lysol-ish.

When I think of green tea I think of oriental tea leaves with a good balance of citrus and mint, it should be refreshing but not aggressive. Personally if you are in the market for a tea fragrance try Creed's Asian Green Tea. However, if you're not keen on Creed then Elizabeth Ardens Green Tea may be a sensible substitute.

"First of all I guess you get what you pay for. I learned my lesson the hard way here. This was to be a gift. The product said, "" new condition "" when I purchased it. The box was an old advertising campaign from some time ago. It came to me opened were the box had been opened and the shrink wrap torn around it. It also looked slightly used. Looks like I got a tester. It does smell like Red Door but I do not were it. So that is why I gave them two stars. I know it is not a knock-off but they were not truthful about the rest.

"Red Door puts Poison & Giorgio to shame. One spray will do or it will announce your arrival before you.

It opens with honey-drenched white florals. Morphs into a rose, just a bit soapy, eventually a bit powdery. Takes a long time to dry down. Pleasant & wearable for me ... in about 2 hours.

We've only been through one bottle together, but I thought you and I would be a 'forever couple'. Your Super Sculpt and my curly hair seemed like the perfect match. Everybody thought we looked great together. But I found out you've been hiding something from me. Propylene Glycol.  Really, Paul?!

I know it's an inexpensive ingredient, and lots of products contain it.  But I thought you were better than that. Who wants to put anti-freeze in their hair?  Not this girl.  I'm leaving you, Paul.  I hope you'll consider changing for me and all of the others out there who've fallen for you.  But until then, you and I are done. I really hate to do it, because my hair will really morn your loss.

I was so excited to open the package, so I sprayed it on my wrists immediately!  I took a huge whiff and was quite surprised.  It still has that incredible dreamy smell of Obsession, but it also had an alcohol and chemical smell.  At first I wondered what I was thinking when I was younger that I would wear this.  Then I read some reviews and discovered that the formula had been sold.  I understand companies try to find cheaper ways to make products so they can make more money.  However, I wonder if they took into account the amount of customers they would lose because of this change?!?!!?  How disappointing!!!!",2.0
My wife found it to sweet  smelling for her,2.0
It didn't smell the way i remember.  It smell more like perfume for men,2.0
"For those of you who do not know Obsession is now formulated by Coty and made in USA. Not France. I knew it had been reformulated but was desperate for a bottle also kinda curious and at this price i took a chance. The smell is really off. Especially if you have wore this for years you will notice immediately. Those new to it probably wouldn't notice. I compared it to my old bottle before the reformulation and you can definitely tell a difference. I would say the longevity is about 3-4 hours vs where my old version lasted all day. Basically it smells like a version of a drugstore knockoff of the old version with better staying power since it is EDP. However, this is the new formulation and this is just the new scent i guess. Boo.
****The telltale sign is the gold rim around the bottom of the lid.  The reformulation does not have this.  The reformulation upon the first spray is vile imo and cannot compare in any way whatsoever to the original but the dry down isn't so bad. I will be searching for the older version from now on.",2.0

I have used Obsession perfume many times over my lifetime.  This perfume had a much darker amber color and I did not think the fragrance was the same.  It was just okay and maybe because I am 80 years old my sense of smell is not as good as it used to be!,2.0
Not too sure it the original.  Smells a little different. I'm using it though. Next time I will for sure buy it from Macy's.,2.0
"It was very different from what I thought it would be - No, I do not like it. I should not have ordered it.",2.0
This item came to me on time and packaged well. The issue I have was the plastic top was missing.,2.0
Well I bought this for my girl . I had sampled the men's and thought it had a great scent so I assumed the women's would as well. The women's has more of a powdery smell not to my liking. I prefer a vibrant deep scent not sweet that makes you remember the lady who is wearing it! So beware I'd advise you to go and check out the scent before you buy! The shipping process was great.,2.0
"In looking at the bottle and description you would think this was Obsession.  What I received was considerably different.  The bottle is not shaped anything like the one picture here.  It is not a round/oval shape it is more of a star shape and is entitled ""Secret Obsession"".  This is not the same thing.  It has a different, not unpleasant, fragrance.  I advise caution to ensure you get what you are expecting.  As this was a gift it was not returned.",2.0
"I been using this cream since may 2013 it had wonderful Reviews but as of today it those not do what it said , I will not buy or recomend this at all.",2.0
"i can not l believe when i receive this stuff it was opened. i must to said this was too shock for me, it was first time i bought the new stuff but has used.",2.0
It burn my eyes and never saw any real results. This is the second time I tried it and won't be using it any more,2.0
"I ordered this product (at the full price of $59) because the photo showed the Strivectin Eye Cream in the Black and White tube, and in a different shaped tube, depicting the ""Original Strivectin Eye Cream Formula."" But I received the new formula instead. I had tried a tester of the new formula in a store, and for me, it stung and left me with a mild rash. I used the original formula for several years, very satisfied and wanted more. Does anyone know where I can find it?",2.0
"I'm using all the Strivectin products with a few of the Hydroxatone ones. Out of all the product creams, this is my least favorite. It definitely doesn't live up to the hype. You only need a tiny bit, so it will last a long time- maybe it's a good long-timer product (months). After a few weeks, it's nothing special though. I'd skip it and stay with the regular facial cream and get close to the eyes, it doesn't irritate my skin in that area and I'm extremely sensitive to products out there.",2.0
"I have been using this for months and I have had no results as far as helping fine lines or crows feet. It says to use morning and night, but it does not absorb well, so you cant wear it under makeup. It may work better for someone that doesnt wear makeup and can use it twice daily. I don't think it is worth the price though.",2.0
"I started to have lines under my eyes two years ago when I turned 26. It was about 0.5 inch long under each eye. I was totally freaked out and wanted to do something about it. I started to fight these lines two years ago with Clinique's Advanced Stop Sign. After 2 jars and no result, I had to call it a quit.

Since then, I've tried StriVectin-SD Eye Cream, Kinerase, and Creme de La Mer, which also didn't work for lines. I have to say StriVectin-SD is the worst from the bunch. It is greasy and doesn't make my skin any firmer. On a bad day, I would break out. Kinerase is a little better in that it's not greasy. La Mer was really good for firming and making my skin look dewy and soft, though it may not improve lines.

I have tried using Estee Lauder Perfectionist and Advanced night repair and they both seem to improve the lines pretty well. I think I'm gonna continue to use Estee's products until I find anything better.",2.0
I love this product but the one that I received seems like it's old. It was very thick and hard to pump. I used to purchase this at Ulta and was my favorite.,2.0
"My all-time favorite is still Brown Sugar, which you discontinued. I wish you would think about reissuing this fragrance.",2.0
"I've used the Archipelago Botanicals Milk bar soap and I don't think this smells much like that.  Not very fond of this fragrance.  It's kind of mild and not terrible, just not like the bar soap.",2.0
"Okay, this is a very expensive soap.  We originally got it as part of a set that comes with hand lotion as well with a nice holder.

I've bought this separate hand soap bottle before with no problems, same tall, cylindrical bottle.

But I notice now it's more expensive...  hmmm.

It arrived today.  I will say this, it's a 10.x fluid ounces, more than the advertized 8.x.

But the bottle is a short square thing that isn't going to fit in the holder.  So I've got to pour all this stuff into the old bottle.

Is this a small gripe?  Yup, I'm picking nits.  But at $20 per bottle, well, I didn't get what I paid for.",2.0
"This stuff was okay...it definitely made my hair feel nice when I rinsed it out.  However, it seemed to ""spoil"" quickly.  I used this probably once a week or so, and about halfway through the container I noticed it completely dried and tangled my hair.  Thinking it was the shampoo I used, I tried it again the following week and the same thing happened.  That's pretty crappy.",2.0
Not sure why I purchased this.  I have other cleansers which do a better job.,2.0
"Have had this for about a month, but have only used it 3 times. I like the grainy consistency, it's not too rough, and scrubs nicely. However, what I don't like is that it leaves a lotion-y film on my skin after I've washed it off; I need to use a cleanser after it.",2.0
"I first ordered the Juice Beauty Exfoliating Cleanser. There were barely any exfoliant particles in it. And it didn't really wash off any of my makeup or normal daily grime so I further researched the product and contacted Juice directly. They explained that it isn't really intended to remove makeup, which seemed odd, and recommended I try the Cleansing Milk instead. Well, the Cleansing Milk isn't much better. It only smears my eye makeup around and doesn't completely remove my foundation. If I use a makeup removing wipe afterwards, there's quite a bit of foundation leftover.
I do not recommend these cleansers but do love the following from Juice: Nutrient Moisturizer, Smoothing Eye Concentrate, and Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 30.",2.0
"Really creamy, smells like seasame oil. I feel like it barely exfoliated my skin.",2.0
"I was hoping this would be a better product given the price. After a few weeks of use (twice per day), my face was really dry and I had to switch back to my previous cleanser. For this reason, I would not repurchase the product.",2.0
"I buy this product every 3 months.  Usually you have to remove the foil safety seal on the inside of the bottle, however when I received the lotion from them this past Friday, there was no seal, and it felt like half the bottle was missing.  I will be filing a complaint with Amazon today.",2.0
"Long time user of the Billy Jealousy Hydroplane shave cream.  However, the new formula for Hydroplane shaving cream is not as good as the original formula.  The new version has a flowery smell, has the consistency of lotion rather than a shaving cream, and now leaves me with razor burns/skin irritation when I shave with it.  The customer service rep. at Billy Jealousy admitted that they changed the formula and that other customers have provided similar negative feedback on this new formula Hydroplane.  I will not purchase, again, unless they go back to the old formula.",2.0
"It was a good lesson to buy it. Never again. The fragrance smells like when you walk in a barber shop. The consistency is very liquid and seems like diluted with water so you will run out of this thing very very quickly. There are products out there that are way cheaper, smell much better and last way longer than this product. Be wise!",2.0
"I have never written an Amazon review before, but this time, I felt it was necessary to warn others against a product that I felt was a waste of money. (And quite a bit of it, too, as you can see from the price tag on this body wash!)

I was very excited about the body wash when I first ordered it -- I thought that the high price tag, professional design, and amazing claims made by the company and other reviewers would obviously mean a superior product.

But I was wrong. So hopefully I can be the sole voice of reason here to tell you: Don't buy this product!

When I first tried the body wash, I didn't see much of a difference in my skin from the cheap-o Dove soap I used before. My skin wasn't softer, or any cleaner feeling. I thought to myself, ""Maybe it's because I've only used it once. I'm sure I'll see a difference after a week or two.""

I've been using this body wash for two months now, and I still haven't seen a difference.

The other surprise I got was just how SMALL the amount of soap in the bottle is. Read the fine print -- there's only 8 ounces of soap in there! Most other brands have 18-24 ounces of soap per bottle, AND they cost less! Why is this one not only more expensive, but also has less soap?

Even more ridiculous is that the problem is confounded by the fact that this soap does a TERRIBLE job of suds-ing and spreading, so I have to use TWICE as much of it just to get myself clean! After applying a quarter-sized amount to my hand/body sponge, I find that it's only enough suds to clean my upper body, and I have to squeeze out ANOTHER quarter-sized amount to clean my lower body. I've never had this problem with any other soap.

To put it in perspective, I've used this soap for 2 months, and it's almost gone. My last bottle of body wash from a different company, however, lasted 10 months. Yet was only a fraction of the price and did just as good of a job.

The thing is, it's not that the soap is BAD, per se -- it cleans, it smells nice, and it didn't turn my body into a giant allergic rash, which is always a plus -- but it's just way too expensive to only deliver average performance and a very small quantity of soap.

So don't get too excited by the fancy dragon on the front and the promise of endless sex-scapades from having the softest, sexiest smelling skin this side of the Bengal Bay, as the description leads you to believe. If you've got a ton of money and don't know what to spend it on, then buy this soap. If you're like the rest of us, just get a normal brand, pay a lot less for it, and stick a dragon on the front to make yourself feel special. Thanks.",2.0
All the hype!  no slip or glide unless you use the size of a ping pong ball.  Lid/cap was cracked.  Nice idea but needs perfecting.,2.0
"Not a fan of the product. Didn't work like I expected. The lather was poor. Even after I used more of the product and added water as the directions direct. Felt some irritation and wasn't that smooth a shave.  I've used way better products. I'm back to my Taylor of old bond street sensitive shaving cream with badger brush. It's the best. After that I liked jack black triple shaving cream. And third I would say proaso menthol cream.
Seems like I feel shaving creams work better than this expensive weird gel.",2.0
Waste of money,2.0
"Well, I bought this as a gift with an electric razor for hubby. He loves his electric razor, but this stuff didn't do anything for him. I bought it based on the recommendations. Hubby has a VERY thick beard, and this didn't work for him. I guess it works great for men with average beards. It didn't gunk up the razor though. This stuff rinses right out.",2.0
"I took the risk when I saw this with a lightning deal in Amazon and the numerous positive reviews. Still with the deal (around $8), I still found this too expensive. The label is spot on when they said that it improves razor glide, it does, but with a drawback of not improving shaving at all. It just glides my razor literally without getting hair. Shaving experience is mediocre at best. Another downside is it clogs my razor to the point that I had to throw out some blades after only 1 use as it is hard to clean the blades with running water. That is really a waste of blades. The positive sides to this experience is its cool name and its container..hence the 2 stars (or am I being too generous?)..Do yourself a favor and stay with your current shaving gels or creams.",2.0
"I've never tried a ""premium"" shaving cream and got this on a lightening deal.  Overall I'm not that impressed.  If you want it to work effectively you need A LOT, way more than you'd use for the standard foaming cream.  I also don't notice any improvement in how my skin feels, I'd say it feels about the same as when I use the foam.  Basically what I'm saying is it costs more, and for me, doesn't add any benefit over a can of 99 cent barbasol.",2.0
"First day I used this product, it did seem to work as it said. But whether it's just my skin type or what, I could not comfortably shave with this everyday without irritation, I used this product exactly as it said and I still had a lot of irritation.",2.0
I was swayed by the great reviews.  I wouldn't purchase again.  There must be some trick to using it because I can not get as good a shave as with Lab Series or Headslick.,2.0
"I was given a container of this product as a gift. I am glad that I didn't pay for it because I would have felt like a sucker. As far as the performance of the product, it's okay, but I did not find it to be as good as other high-end shaving gels I've used. I have found King of Shaves Alpha Gel to be the best of these non-lathering shave products; it's available in many drug stores, Target, etc., for $5-$7. Billy Jealousy costs three times that amount and in my opinion wasn't as good. I guess they're marketing the funky name...but I don't know why someone would pay $20 for this stuff.",2.0
"It's good but completely overpriced! I thought it was really good until one day I didn't have it with me and needed to shave and used my Nivea body wash instead and that worked surprisingly well. Now I use the Nivea Active 3 and it works much better than the hydroplane; it produces less friction, giving me a less irritated shave (I use a Panasonic wet/dry electric shaver). The hydroplane feels really smooth when you first put it on, but after a few passes with my electric shaver, it starts producing friction and I have to reapply another layer; I don't have that problem with the Active 3 plus it's dirt cheap compared to the hydroplane.",2.0
"I bought this product, based on the recommendation of a few reviews, when I bought my Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano Men's Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver on Amazon.  It does no better than Gillette's gel foam and costs five times more.  The bottle is made of such thick plastic that it is very difficult to squeeze even a ""quarter size"" blob into your hand.  Stick with your grocery store favorite, Billy J. is no improvement.",2.0
"I bought this product when I purchased a Panasonic Electric shaver.  I typically use Aveeno shaving gels; however, in a momentary lapse of judgment, I splurged on this product.  The Billy Jealously shave cream is extremely slick, but this does not translate into a closer or more comfortable shave.  The product costs 4 times the price of an already premium Aveeno product without any clear benefits.  I personally believe the Aveeno product provides a closer and more comfortable shave.  Do not waste your money on this product unless you have a personal trust fund and prefer a designer name to a premium product (Aveeno).",2.0
"This ""cream"" does not lather well, it's too liquidy or something.  I tried it a several times and was could not help getting cut.  While the scent was pleasant, it is definitely not one of the better creams out there.  I have a tough beard as well and this did nothing to make the shave easier.  I even used their hot towel treatment, but nothing.  To be frank, it is not much better than a canned shaving gel at a drugstore.  Overall, it is overrated and should only be used if you want to pay a lot of money for under performing product.",2.0
"THis product was touted to be the best lubricant available. Sorry, not even close. I use Lush Razorantium and it is far superior. It is a better lubricant, odorless, virtually nick-proof and efficient.

I have tried virtually every brand available from luxury to inexpensive and Lush tops them all. It is a lotion style cream...not foaming.

My beard is tough and my skin is somewhat sensitive if that helps for informational purpose.",2.0
"This stuff is okay, but not worth the price for me. The heat feeling is nice, but it doesn't do anything for the comfort of the shave itself. I expected a better experience.",2.0
"Don't waste your money on this. It does give you 5 seconds of warming sensation but then it goes away. The hydroplane shave cream is decent but there are better brands out there (proraso, taylor of old bond st). The best thing about this brand is that it rinses off very easily from my razor and from the sink- doesn't clog up anything.

SHAVING- let me save you years of trial and error: take a warm shower & wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser, shave afterwards with a $50 Merkur safety razor handle with good blades (save $100's on mach 3 refills!), use a $20 Tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old bond street (or proraso) shaving cream (you can let it set in a minute), shave WITH the grain DOWN, SLOWLY, SOFTLY (don't press hard- let the weight of the handle and sharp blade do the cutting), lastly rub on a fingertip of proraso pre/post shave cream while your face is still wet and let it dry! Say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs FOREVER! Trust me- I've tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years. If you don't want to commit so much money yet- order the pre/post shave proraso cream online, buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works (under their C.O. Bigelow label) then get the cheap single blade disposables (mach 3's are too aggressive) at a grocery store and you'll notice a difference overnight.",2.0
"This was a father's day splurge, purchased with the more highly rated hydroplane shaving cream.  Although the hot towel treatment cleverly creates a burst of exothermic heat on my face, the sensation is fleeting and unfortunately not worth anything near what I paid for it.  If you get your face wet enough, and you put enough of the cream in your hand, and you get the cream to your wet face, you will feel two to five seconds of heat.  Not a chemical kind of burn, but genuine heat.  I found that it is almost identical to splashing hot water on my face.  Now, the second aspect of this product is that it feels like a clean, lightweight lotion.  I've tried shaving with it and without it, with dull blades, with sharp blades.  I think it might improve my shave, though minimally.  Lastly, the product smells good.  It smells better than the hydroplane cream.  That's it.  Neat how they did that, but don't buy it.",2.0
"Like many,, I succumbed to the selling hype and the promise of a real ""hot towel"" experience and the smoothest shave ever. No matter how I applied the Billy J. Hot Towel Pre-Sahve, I could not get more than a seconds' worth of warmth. The warming sensation was so short that I never could feel it over my entire shaving area. I suppose I would have forgiven the unfulfilled promise of a hot towel if I had gotten the smoothest glide possible with my razor but such was not the case. At best it was equal to all other similar products with the exception of King of Shaves Kinesium which is head an shoulders above any other pre shave products regardless of price. If there is a theoretical limit to how smooth a shave can be, Kinesium comes closest to approaching that limit. You don't always get what you pay for unless you like to impress your friends with the colloection of expensive products you have in your medicine cabinet.",2.0
There is lots of thick liquid mascara in the tube. So much that the brush comes out very wet and caused the lashes to stick together badly. I have  to wipe the brush clean with a tissue in order to use the product. I am wasting most of the mascara when I do  This was not what I expected from a premium product.,2.0
I love Borghese but this arrive dried out.,2.0
Products should not be put in mailbox when temperature is above 80 degrees.,2.0
"The mascara comes out on the brush in globs.  It subsequently goes on my lashes the same way.  It seems that when it comes out of the bottle, there is nothing that cleans away the extra product on the wand.  I end up cleaning the tip of the wand on the edge of the mascara bottle and then trying to roll the extra product back into the container when I'm finished.  I'm sorry, but it is not like the product I used to buy in Costco.",2.0
really dissapointed.  i bought the shaving cream which is great but felt let down after this purchase first of all when first opened all the soap spilled right out because like water not visous enough. then with what remained did not kkep bumps or pimples awa and did not improve my shaving experience.  not the quality i expected.,2.0
"I am a 42 year old female who is an admitted lipstick addict. :)  I am constantly trying new beauty products in an attempt to find the perfect lipstick color.  I saw this product on a Home Shopping network one night, and decided to order it on Amazon.

I alternate between both lipstick and lipgloss in my routine.  I have medium skin tone, and thought that this color would be great as I like a plum/berry but neutral color.  I found this to be very heavy in the color of the lipstick - it was very dark and not what I was looking for.  Also, the thickness of the liptsick was different - it was very thick.  I guess that this would make it last longer (which is a good thing), but I never got the chance as the color was so heavy and dark that I took it off upon trying it and never wore it again.  I wish that I had returned this - now, it's just part of my ""makeup graveyard"".

Note:  Although this looks pink, it actually has more of a brown tone to it.

In summary, if you are looking for a lipstick with a heavy, saturating color, and don't mind the thickness of it, this may work for you.  If not, I would suggest a different product.",2.0
"Sorry, I chose the wrong color. It is much too vibrant and dark. Didn't know if I can return it. Can I? How?",2.0

Works good but not really worth the money. I bought these and the same ones for my feet and the foot ones after about seven or eight uses started to have the jell oose out the soles of the feet and they were very slippery to walk on.

It was bulkier than I thought. Can't bend your fingers so my fingers get stiff from wearing it too long.,2.0
"Too rich for my skin.  I broke out from using.  I don't think the product is bad, just not right for my skin.",2.0
"I heard some good reviews from friends and online... but to be honest, it does nothing for me. My skin doesn't feel any different or look any better. The smell is also a bit unpleasant for my taste. I guess I'm just happy I didn't break out any more after using it for a two-week trial period.",2.0
"Well, this was disappointing. I have used Replenix for quite a while and been really satisfied. However, this time, the product  was runny and not even close to the appearance of other orders from other suppliers. I thought it was just a dud and used it for a short time until a replacement came. But, just as I was about to throw the container and remaining product away, I noticed a very, very, faint, clear sticker with almost indecipherable letters on it. The light hit the newly discovered label just right and I was able to read ""SAMPLE NOT FOR RESALE""--what the? Fluke? I could barely see it, maybe the supplier couldn't either. But, I'm sharing this as a cautionary tale (to look for indecipherable labels, I guess). Good luck.",2.0
Can't really see any difference after weeks of use. Will not repurchase again.,2.0
"I was really hoping to have good news to report about Replenix because I read nothing but positive and glowing reviews. I have to be honest and say I see no change since purchasing and using this product. I have been using it for quite some time now, being patient and waiting too see if there was even just a slight change in the appearance of my skin. No change. I was quite disappointed that there was no results especially for something so expensive! I just got a prescription for Renova and will be using that instead.",2.0

When I first went to apply it, the serum came out much darker than bottles I have used in the past.  This made me worry that the product has been tainted or otherwise compromised.  Bottom line --- if you order this serum through Amazon, make sure you get it from a provider other than Pure Essence Health.",2.0

"The Glytone Mini Peel was a good product, but, it does leave me with questions. (1) What am I doing to my skin? (2) Should I be using something so harsh? (3)I did not like the scaly skin on my face.

I do the full treatment 2-3x's a week and use it as a face cleanser every morning. And each day I can see the clearer, fresher looking skin emerge. It is like each day is better than the day before. I love it and just won't be without it.

"I purchased this product from Amazon since it was about half the price as the one at the dermatologist's office. The strength is too weak to be of any real benefit. For me, it's better just to perform a chemical peel every month. I use a 10% glycolic acid cream at night.",2.0
"I have had the same experience as many others reviewing this product.  I have been growing my hair out, and I recently got it highlighted to cover up some of my newly-acquired grays.  Anyway, I am a former Pantene Pro-V Natural Fusion user, and I liked that product, but I thought I should switch to a gentler shampoo to protect my color and keep my long hair healthy.  When I switched to Paul Mitchell Color Protect, the first thing I noticed is that it doesn't lather.  I am aware that many salon shampoos don't lather the way drugstore ones do, so I certainly could have lived with that.  However, I don't feel that this shampoo is effectively cleaning my hair.  Like other reviewers have said, my hair looks and feels worse after washing than it did before.  With the Pantene, I washed and styled my hair every three days.  Now, after two weeks of use, my hair basically seems dirty all the time.  I'm returning to my drugstore habits, and I'm pretty bummed out that I wasted $30 on this shampoo and conditioner.",2.0
"This shampoo does not spread over your hair well. I have to use a bit for the top of my head then get some more for the middle and bottom of my head (and I have chin length very fine hair so I SHOULDN'T need a lot of shampoo to begin with). When it washes out it feels fine but when it comes time for drying it, it feels like I am running my hairbrush through liquid lead. It leaves a waxy thick residue on my hair and on my hands (when I touch it).

Bright side: I think it is doing a good job at keeping my blonde highlights from fading.

I also think that this would be good to use before an updo. It gives it that stick together feel that is needed to get a nice tight updo or bun. You will just need to wash your hand well after getting it styled.",2.0
"This conditioner leaves your hair feeling more like it was conditioned with a volumizing condition, read: dryer and hard to get a brush through.

Top was leaking conditioner ?,2.0
i couldn't get the pump to work,2.0
I usually use Aveda Shampure conditioner but figured I would try Paul Mitchell. It feels nice to shower with because of the tingle. My issue is that come time to dry and comb my course and thick hair it was near impossible even with an oil added prior. I'm not happy so far. I bought the liter size so I'll give it a few more tries before giving it to a neighbor.,2.0
"About the Delivery: When the product arrived, it was in a box more than 4x the size of the product itself. When I opened the box, the bottle was slightly open and conditioner was splattered everywhere. When I looked at the bottle's pump, there was a piece of tape around it, indicating that this product had been opened before.
About the Product: To top it all off, the pump doesn't even work. In order to use the conditioner, I have to unscrew the pump and pour the conditioner into my hand. I tested it to see if it was even worth it after all of this, and the answer is no. It's just ok. Not bad, not awesome, just ordinary.",2.0
Came really quick. However it doesn't seem to do my hair well. Had to really use spray in conditioner to comb out my hair & a lot of oil  normally I just use a dab of oil before comb out,2.0
"I used to use this item before and I know the feeling when you use it.  When you apply, you feel very fresh and invigorating feeling to your scalp, but this one has a same scent but the feeling is different.  I am just planning to buy same product from CVS and compare them.  If it is different,.. I guess it is not good.",2.0
"Wasn't as good as my normal batch, didn't leave my hair as soft as it normally does :/  It was packed great though!",2.0
"Conditioner leaked in box. It was in a plastic bags, but still was a huge mess and lost product.",2.0
Using this product made my hair texture really dry. I had to use a lot to be able to pull a comb though my hair.,2.0
"Paul Mitchell is a little chemically for my taste in the first place, and this conditioner just plain fried me out. I would not recommend it.",2.0
Comb slides out and low heat output. Basically this product is useless.,2.0
"we ordered this product because it was recommended by a friend. after having it for three months it is smoking on us and is not usable anymore. Considering Amazon only covers the product for one month, what do we do now with it?",2.0
Doesn't work as well as previous Baby Bliss I have owned.  Pulls hair and my hair will frizz 30 minutes after flat ironing it.  That is not usual.,2.0
"It is now 5 months after I purchased this and the product has stopped working.  Disappointed as Babyliss was recommended highly by a hair stylist.  My previous one was a Chi and that lasted me longer.
Product heated to 450 and worked well.",2.0
"To start with for reference, I have type 3a/3b hair. I bought this same product from a walk-in store rather than online, especially as there has been concerns of fakes being sold, and I was really disappointed. This flat iron is very light, and I prefer an iron with a bit more weight as they feel more durable and less likely to break if dropped. The added weight also helps me keep a steadier hand, which is important when you're holding something that gets up to 450 F up near your scalp and face. The real deal breaker for me on this flat iron was the plates. Only one of the plates is a floating plate, the other is not, so they do not ever touch except for at the very end of the iron. This makes for an uneven glide. What should have taken me 20 minutes took me nearly 50 minutes because I had to keep going over every section of my hair multiple times to get even a loose straightness, and the ends would not straighten at all. That's terrible for your hair; using this much heat on it is already not good of course, but having to go over it so many times at an especially high temperature can really tear your mane up.

The only pro I can say about this flat iron is that, even in my old house with questionable wiring, it did not seem to take too much energy to work, which I wish more flat irons were just as energy efficient.",2.0
There is a gap in between the plates of the flat iron.,2.0
"This iron doesn't work like the blue babyliss. It takes to long to heat and it doesn't straight at all... is a pain pass like 20 times on the same portion of the hair to have a medium straight and my hair is fine and almost straight, but  i have frizz and this iron doesn't help even with this... i wish to return and have a refund. Dont buy it",2.0
"This is the second Babybliss straightener I have purchased, 1st one lasted for about three years and seemed be working fine and then periodically it would not be as hot as it should, then next time it would work fine. So I purchased another one because I thought it was starting to go. Well the new one has started to do the same thing in only a 6 month time.",2.0
Is fake,2.0
"So I purchased this straightener a month ago, straying from my norm of the typical Chi brand. The reviews were pretty good, so I was okay in trying something new. It came and even on the first day of use, I realized I should've just stuck with what I knew. It completely dried out my hair, it always smells like its burning, and the ""porcelain ceramic"" plates are anything but desireable.

If you're choosing between this and other straighteners in the same price range, avoid this one at all cost.",2.0
Cheap,2.0
Not sure if I got a knockoff but I had to return as this thing felt like it was pulling my hair out and did not work near as well as my other babyliss flat iron.,2.0
The plastic outside catches single stands of my hair and pulls them as I use it. I don't even use it anymore because of this. Poorly constructed.,2.0
Snags hair.  One of the worst flat irons I have purchased.,2.0
This is not worth the price,2.0
"I bought it for the comb feature, but it was flimsy and fell out repeatedly while using it. After a month, the piece went missing.  I still use it and it's ok, but now I have to use my brush in one hand and the iron in the other, which is difficult with a shoulder injury.",2.0
Only lasted a year and the porcelain started pealing off. It doesn't have an automatic shut off either,2.0
"Meh, wasted my money. I am Caucasian and have thick course hair.  This takes me twice as long as my old different brand iron. I do like the comb attached to it. I wish it was on both ends of the same side.",2.0
Its a good flat iron..but i had to wait three more days to be delivered..,2.0
"It's fine, but best to save your money and buy a chi instead.",2.0
"After all the hype about this product from 2 stylists I see, I bought one. What a disappointment. No better than the Remington I was happy with at less than 1/2 the price. Save your money, this is all hype and no substance. Higher heat setting fried my hair and the lower setting wouldn't straighten it properly. Just not at all what I hoped for at this price!",2.0
It's ok...I hate the curve of the handle. I used it twice and gave it away...hated how it felt in my hand because it felt awkward.,2.0
"I loved this flat iron! It got very hot which is what I need for my extremely thick hair. It curls really nice also.
The Reason for 2 stars.. Bought in 01/2015, stopped working by 05/2015. So it was a great 4 month run. Wish I could have returned for another one ",2.0
This product barely lasted a year. I only used it about 3 times a month. The outside of the flat iron got really hot.,2.0
"This flattener just doesn't work well, and I have Keratin treated hair, so it should. I think it might be a knock-off, because the brand name is reputable.",2.0
"I bought this straightener from Amazon less than five months ago. I give it two stars because last week it just stopped working. Very frustrating. While it worked, it was the best straightener I'd ever used and I liked it a lot. But that's not worth much anymore. Disappointed in this brand because it wasn't cheap, yet it croaked in less than a year. Hey Amazon, is it too late to get my money back?",2.0
"I have fine shoulder-length hair that likes to flip out, so I have been a daily flat iron user for a long time. Picked this up to try a replacement for my older GHD iron with yellow plates (that I have now gone back to.) I liked the Babyliss at first, but over time it has damaged my hair really badly. Now that I'm growing my hair out (trying to) I can see how the breakage is slowing down the process. I wouldn't recommend it. Save your money for a better iron. And remember to use product every time to minimize the long-term damage these heat tools can do! I've learned my lesson: gonna be rocking a ponytail for the next 6 months at least.",2.0
cheap product - pulls your hair and has a cheap design since the edges aren't flat,2.0
"Service from seller was great, but I do not love this flat iron",2.0
When first opening this product I struggled. Paint even chipped off in the process. The bottom plate on the straightner easily is pushed in. It's still usuable and straightens very well.,2.0
"I would never buy one of these again online.  This item arrived and it took a few uses to understand why the thing seemed to damage my hair.  The two sides of the hot pad area are not parallel, the end of the heated area touches before the other 3/4 of it.  In order to flat iron you have to press hard enough so the whole area is in contact with your hair but ... the area that touches first is then too pinched and it pulls your hair.  I ended up putting it in a vice with a piece of wood at the end and left it there for a period of time and both sides ended up parallel.  I used it and couldn't believe how nice it ran through my hair but ... next time I used it, it went back to the original condition and is now once again .. useless..  If not for this problem it would be a great little iron.",2.0
"I have the blue Babyliss Titanium 1"" and was hoping this would be similar. NOT at all. It doesn't heat up like I wanted it to. I originally wanted the 1.5"" since I have long hair, it would help with bigger curls...ehh...not a fan. I would stick to the Babyliss Titanium blue ones...pay the higher price, it makes a difference.",2.0
Fake. Stay away. It causes damage to your hair.,2.0
I bought this flat iron 5 months ago - used it maybe 6-8 times - and it just quit working. My previous babyliss lasted about 5 years with similar usage. Don't waste your money on this one.,2.0
Like the comb but just doesn't get hot enough to straighten completely.  Takes me 2 hours to completely straighten over the 30 minutes it took for my jilbere palladium straightener.,2.0
Worked great for 2 months and then just stopped working out of nowhere. Won't turn on and I can't return or exchange it.,2.0
The high heat setting is too hot as with most blow dryers and was burning my hair but the medium heat setting which on my old blow dryer was perfect is practically cool with this blow dryer. My curly hair that I blow dry straight was turning out poofy and frizzy.  I wish I could return it but it's past the time for me to be able to.  I just repurchased my old Rusk Speed Freak and I'm giving this one away.  Poor design. Extremely disappointed with this purchase.,2.0
"Having owned this dryer for several years now, the rubbery coat on its body has peeled, parts of it became kind of gluey, just a mess. It still works and dries my hair really well, but I simply can't touch anymore. And it looks disgusting in my bathroom. Poor product design.",2.0
"I am pretty sure this is a fake, as the degrees are not sequential. That being said, it works great.",2.0
started smelling like it was going to go on fire a little over a year after purchasing. Filters are all clean so that's not the problem. Very heavy and the controls are in a bad spot. Not very happy with this dryer.,2.0
"This one came with two in the package and one of them didn't work, so we sent it back and got another brand.",2.0
It lasted not even 14 months using 3 xs per week before dying. Ive had cheap conairs from target last 3-4 years. I won't buy again. I have shoulder length thicker wavy hair. When it worked it took about 10 minutes to completely dry my hair,2.0
"Don't like the slide buttons to turn on and change heat settings....too difficult to maneuver with one hand. It is necessary for me to put down styling brush and change settings, and they are difficult to slide., usually have to use my nail to slide up or down.

If I use high speed, which I like for back of my hair, the warm setting is too hot, so I have to switch to low speed.

I would not recommend this product.",2.0
I have thick hair and I wash it about once a week this blow dryer last two years and then died,2.0
Two years ago I purchased the Babyliss straightener and their other blow dryers and loved it so I thought this one would be just as good. It doesn't leave my hair as straight or frizz free like their other hair dryer so I'm disappointed. This dryer leaves my hair poofy. It's not as strong as the dryer I bought two years ago.,2.0
"I really liked his hair dryer...while it worked. It was a bit heavy but I found that my hair was more smooth and easier to manage while using it. I received it for Christmas from my Amazon Wish List in Dec 2016 and just this afternoon when I turned it on, it was making a horrible high pitched noise and started to smell like burnt rubber. I took the back piece off thinking that something was getting caught and burning. That slowly subsided the noise and the smell became less noticeable. I dried my hair quickly hoping it had been fixed so it didn't catch fire on me. I let it sit for a few hours and turned it back on and the noise and smell is back.

I do not wash my hair every day so this didn't see excessive use and its been just over a year. Highly disappointed and will be contacting Customer Service to see if they will fix/repair this under warranty. Will update after I get a response.",2.0
"First I will start off by saying I have really fine, thin hair. Before purchasing this hair dryer, I was using a basic Revlon dryer and wanted to get something a little nicer to see if it will be less damaging. Unfortunately this dryer is worse. I have had it since August and it has fried my hair even on the lowest setting. I literally can see my hair burnt off. I have tried using professional products for heat protectant but it doesnt help. I am back to using my old dryer and already can see less damage.",2.0
"I orginally posted a good review of this iron. But, it snags your hair. I've noticed I have breakage in the middle of my head, right where the end of the flatiorn goes when I am doing the back portion. It snags snags snags. Don't buy",2.0
Blows great but too heavy and flat buttons an issue for me.,2.0
My biggest compliant is that the on/off buttons and temperature controls are very hard to move up and down.  I also find the dryer gets too hot.,2.0
Heating element went out after only 9 mos. and now only blows coolair. It dried my long hair super fast up until it broke.,2.0
I bought this 2 years ago to use at a summer home. I dry my shoulder length hair max twice a week. To say I've used this 60 times would be extremely generous. I'm on Amazon looking for another hair dryer because this one has started sparking and smells like the motor is burning. I have another Babyliss that I paid twice as much for and it is way better. I didn't think I needed to spend over $100 for a hair dryer that is barely used at the lake. Often I air dry my hair. The other thing I always hated about this dryer is that it's SO heavy. I would recommend against buying this one.,2.0
This is an ok product.  When reading the reviews on here I thought it would do a decent job but I have to go over my hair 3 or 4 times just to get it straight.  I do like being able to control the temperature. It doesnt compare to my old flat iron but it does do its job just takes a little longer to get there.,2.0
"The only reason I got this iron is because it has a comb attachment which apparently is hard to find. I have fine, wavy hair that gets frizzy after I wash it. However it has only a single comb that attaches on ONE side of ONE arm of the iron. Really, what's the point? It just doesn't work. It took numerous attempts to straighten my hair. My current 20 year-old iron has an attachment for BOTH sides of one arm, and it works great and takes only 5 minutes to do the job. Unfortunately the cord is starting to break so I have to replace it. The other thing I didn't like about this iron is it doesn't have a swivel cord which I thought was standard with new irons. The only thing I liked is that it's light-weight. I'm going to keep searching for another iron or try to fix my old heavier, sturdier iron because it works! Will return.",2.0
"This hairdryer was great for awhile. However, after some time the plastic shell developed a sticky residue that was impossible to clean despite best efforts. I suspect there is some issue in the type of plastic the manufacturer chose to use. Because of this residue, I had to throw the hairdryer out.",2.0
"Just 3 months down the road this dryer started to misbehave. Still works but every day I'm afraid is going to be the last one. Buttons are very uncomfortable to use. The only plus is fast speed and long cord. Overall, a waste of money. Will buy something different once it dies completely.",2.0
"The iron looks then in the picture but it's really thick , I thought it was 1 or 1 1/2 inches",2.0
Stopped working at 6 months. Worked well until it died. Checking warranty,2.0
I returned this dryer. It was too heavy and I didn't care for the heat settings.,2.0
Too heavy,2.0
When I received it was clearly slightly used. Some of the text was rubbed off and had lint in the back. Worked well enough so didn;t want to hassle with exchanging for new. Quite working after 6 Months of light use. Overheated and then would never start working again.,2.0
It does not perform as well as advertised and it isn't what i thought it was going to be as Well,2.0
"Not sure If I will keep this, it's heavy and doesn't get hot. This hair dryer is similar to a leaf blower, blows your hair everywhere, only to tangle.",2.0
Loved this hairdryer until after about 5 months it started smelling like it was burning and making a very high pitch noise when turned on.,2.0
I originally thought this was a great blow dryer until just recently the area where the screws are and the on/off and heat buttons get really hot when I am drying my hair.  So hot that I have to put it down.  Maybe it was only meant to last for 1 year and less than a half?,2.0
Smells like it is burning up electrically. Cumbersome heat switch. We think the product should be returned for credit. One of the 2 hair dryers works perfectly.,2.0
"This is the 2nd BaBylissPro Ceramix Xtreme Dryer that I have bought and has gone bad just past the warranty period.  I love the way it handles, dries my hair fast and doesn't get too hot.  But a $50 dryer should last longer than 2 years!!  It started sparking while I was using it and scared me to death.  The cord had worn through close to the base and I could see the wires.  So frustrating and will have to find another dryer this time as I'm tired of replacing it!!",2.0
"My hair stylist recommended this brand and I thought this looked like a good deal.  I am so disappointed in this.  The moment I removed this from the package, I was leery because it was so light and plastic-y feeling.  When I went to use it this morning, it was awful.  The plates are way too light and they pulled my hair with each try. It's definitely being returned.  It replaced a Remington flat iron that was great until it stopped heating after a couple of years.  I've also had a Chi. This was NOTHING compared to either of those.  Don't waste your money on this one.",2.0
"I may have a defective model, but I ended up returning. It did a great job straightening my hair, but would randomly shut itself off. I tried multiple plugs in the house. Was defiantly the product. Also after just a month of use, the paint/covering was chipped and peeling and the ceramic plate had a big chip in it. No damage that I was aware of just sitting on my counter. Sad to have to return this. After reading other reviews it looks like I may not be the only one. Will be looking for a different model to replace this.",2.0
I bought this hair dryer a few years ago. It worked great until about 3 months ago.  The handle gets hot and will almost burn your hand.  Now the button has a short or something (probably from burning) and is quirky about turning on. I know I should not still be using it but  I really love the way it work. I am disappointed it did not last longer.  Debating if I want to get another one or not...,2.0
"I've owned this about a year. Day 1 I thought this dried my hair super fast but texture felt weird. Didnt want to buy a new one so I just dealt with it. My hair began breaking, and became so brittle I didn't want to believe it was my dryer. I finally broke down and bought the conair pro ceramic, in one use i felt the difference, it uses far infrared that heats inside out. My hair is getting healthier again. If you lighten your hair stay away from this dryer it sucks all the moisture out and fries it. Buttons are annoying too.",2.0
"Nice dryer. It's quieter than my old one. It has a very long cord, which at times is annoying when trying to put it away.  Update: Lasted less than 2 years, never dropped it and cleaned it (the screen on the back) and the motor didn't last. The cheaper ones I bought lasted much longer. Won't buy this brand again.",2.0
"The BaByliss that I previously had was so much smaller but it threw so much heat and air. I loved it. The cord was a good 10 feet long, which made using it awesome, I could stand in my hall way to make sure the dogs were not getting into trouble.

This BaByliss is so much heavier, I can barely hold it away from my head. I get tired holding it in one hand. I can barely dry one hair strand before having to switch sides. I have to keep going back and forth to dry.

The rubberized grip is so slippery. After getting out of the shower and using lotion or hair products, holding this super heavy hair dryer is so hard. It keeps wanting to slip out of my grip and I'm nervous I'll drop it.

It definitely has enough air flow. It really blows out and it seems to get my hair dry faster than my old BaByliss. The heaviness and worrying is too stressful.

I love the BaByliss but this one is not the right one for me.",2.0
"I owned another babybliss iron that died I was excited to get this one, but unfortunately it didn't work for me.  It could have been defective but I decided to give fhi a try..",2.0
Packaging was horrible. It was nearly impossible to remove the product out of the box as it was tightly secured with zip ties. So tight that no room was left to be able to cut them off causing scratches on the iron.  Very disappointing...,2.0
"Can't decide if the odor I smell when I am done is just a new factory smell or my hair burning. My daughter has a byliss
And took it with her to school so ordered this one for myself. It is a less expensive one and that's probably why it just doesn't cut it. It straightens perfectly but think it is damaging my hair",2.0
I bought this mid February and now it doesn't work.  I was nervous about the brand and I am very disapointed. I would NOT recommend this product. I can't return it or exchange it because it is past the return window.,2.0
This is one product i wish i could return. Its very cheaply made and pulls your hair. Dos not straighten very well either.,2.0
"Bought the straightener a year ago in Decemeber after having read such wonderful reviews about it. The ceramic paint started chipping off on the sides after about 7 months. Now it will not heat up. I'm not sure if there is a fuse blown, but I looked over their website, and it appears they have no warranty. I never want to get one of these again.",2.0
"I have coarse wavy Asian hair. The comb doesn't give a sleek straight look. Makes my hair look like an end of a broom stick instead. When I use the iron without the comb, my hair catches in the iron. The plates are not smooth and does not press on contact with the hair well. Also it is difficult to straighten close the roots.
I did not expect this kind of quality with this brand, however for the price you get what you paid for. I'm sending this back.",2.0
"I had to return it. Had a weird smell coming from it. Did try to use it a couple of times. The air flow is pretty legit, but it doesn't get as hot. I have curly, thick hair, so I need the flow but I need the heat a lot too. I've used other Babyliss hair dryers and haven't had an issue. This just wasn't for me.",2.0
"Quick bacjground on my type of hair for reference:
My hair is naturally curly, I have never worn it curly in the last twenty years, I color it at home with box dye, and have had a Brazilian straightening on it. With all that you'd be amazed at how healthy and shiny my hair looks because I use heat protectants and all that good stuff.
So as a person who has been blow drying her hair straight for twenty years, I know a good blow dryer from a mediocre one. This one sadly was mediocre.

This isn't a bad blow dryer per second, but I was underwhelmed at its performance and am returning it.
So the product looks very nice with a sleek matte look, but as soon as I turned that bad boy on I knew it wasn't going to perform that well. The flow of air isn't strong and it doesn't seem to get hot enough. A professional dryer gets so hot, you couldn't bear to keep it in one section for too long. This one did not even get close to hot enough... I was going over the same section over and over again...
Also as far as air flow, a professional dryer makes your hair FLY.  This one barely moved my hair...
So again I don't think it's a bad dryer, for hair that is easy to straighten . For us curly, frizzy haired chucks, we need something with more oomph.",2.0
"This was not as powerful as I was expecting.  I have had other Babyliss dryers which I have loved for their heat and power.  This one was more like a drugstore variety 1875 watt dryer in power. I unfortunately had to return it because it was not what I was looking for, especially for the price that it was.",2.0
Too heavy but works good,2.0
"I bought this straightener for my wife, based on largely positive reviews at the time. It worked well for her for two years. In December 2012 it stopped heating. The light changes from red to green when ""ON"" is pressed, but heating elements are not warming up. So that's it. Babyliss is dead.
I suppose the logical argument is: ""You shouldn't expect prolonged use out of product sold for $32 (which is what I paid in October 2010), and is made in China"". However, I bought other products for me and my family made in China for household use, such as coffeemakers, MP3 players, hairdryers, clothes irons e.t.c.
A clothes iron we bought in 1999, made in China JUST STOPPED WORKING! This thing that we bought 13 years ago for $19.95 made in China was used, and abused, and abused again, and again, and again just worked over a decade. And when it finally died, guess what we did? That's right, we went and bought another one for $49.95 made by the same manufacturer.
Yes, we didn't buy any irons for the last 13 years for ourselves, but we bought three made by the same manufacturer as gifts for our family and friends, and at least two other people (that we know of) bought the same irons on our recommendation.
I work in manufacturing, and I'm a quality specialist, and I can tell that Babyliss either has no quality program at all, or its so sloppy, that its NOT worth the money Babyliss is spending on it. Either that, or this company's bean counters are telling its Engineers which parts to design in their products, and choose the materials purely on costs (lowest cost it is).
I really hope someone from Babyliss's corporate reads this, as this was our first and likely last product made by Conair group.",2.0
"This dryer is weak.  I bought it because I thought it would be more gentle on the hair.  However,
although I do not have thick hair,  I have to use this on the highest temperature and fan speed
to dry my hair.  Amazon recommends the next model up (which I was very satisfied with until
I dropped it and it broke) and I wish I had bought that one
instead.",2.0
"I admit I'm a flat iron novice, but this did not work well for my hair. I have thin hair, but a lot of it and it is long.  It is naturally straight, so I wanted to use this for curling spirals and under.  I couldn't get it to work right, probably because I needed very, very small sections and had to go over the same strands multiple times. The iron heated up but not to what the temp read. I had it on 400 and it felt much cooler. I returned it.",2.0
"This is the second BabyBlissPRO Ceramix Extreme Dryer I have owned. The first one that I owned lasted for over 4 years and was wonderful! I bought it at a salon supply store and never had any problems until the heating element wore out. This blow dryer did not even last me six months. The fan makes a loud squeaking noise and the dryer smells like something is burning on the inside. I am so disappointed with this purchase because this is a great blow dryer, and the first one that I owned lasted for such a long time. I wish I could return the one I bought in June for another one, because the BabyBliss PRO does a great job drying my hair quickly. :(",2.0
"My daughter has long thick hair, it kept grabbing her hair and it smells like it is burning.
I bought two of them, we aren't using either of them.",2.0
I liked this flat iron for a while.. but I bought in July 2012 and it died in December 2012.  I've gone through several flat irons over the last 10 years or so and they all seem to break at some point.  But I tried Babyliss thinking it was a good brand - I did not expect it to die after only 5 months.  It turns on now - I see the light - but it does not heat up.  I am now going to invest in a more expensive flat iron so hopefully I don't have to buy a new one so often.,2.0
"This hair dryer lasted 11 months!  Up until this week it worked great!  This week, a burned smell began coming from it and the next day, it began making a very high pitched squealing noise.  Needless to say, it has been thrown.  I had purchased this brand since it was highly rated.  It lasted for less time than cheaper brands did.  I would not recommend it.",2.0
"I really loved this dryer while it lasted, despite how heavy it is. It dried my hair fast and made my hair very smooth. It lasted about 4 years. About a year ago, the heat switch broke off. The dyer still worked, so I would just use a small tool to push the heat indicated up and down as needed. But after a while, it started smelling like something was burning, so for safety I tossed it.

Also, I had to use electrical tape to make the concentrator stay on, because it connects to the dryer with a little ridge that eventually wore down. I like to use a concentrator about 90% of the time, so the only way to keep it on was with the tape.",2.0
I just want to say that I bought this because it was the Porcelain Ceramic I was looking for so I orderd it it had the sleek look not to bulky as some are an how ever I was attempting to do my daughter hair with it an the HEAT SUCKS on it it doesnt get as HOT as it says it does I wouldn't order this if you want the stlye of shine an flow this is not the ONE for hair,2.0
"I was very excited to receive my product but after one use the iron started peeling. So needless to say I have a product that I can not use. I will not buy this product again....I am now searching to purchase another flat iron. Like many, I do not mind paying for good products but I HATE to have to repurchase something so soon.",2.0
I bought this in April and after 5 months it is making a loud noise with a smoky smell.,2.0
"I loved this flat iron at first. It was excellent. After a few months, it stopped getting hot enough to straighten. Waste of money!!",2.0
"I was unimpressed. The plates did not close down enough to remove all of the frizz from my ends. I have naturally curly hair, not too thick...like medium and my coils are medium.  I had to have made at least 6 or 7 passes before I just decided to take it back. I will say this, the plates and the glide were super smooth - that was a good thing about it; and it also heated up as fast as all other flat irons i've had.  However, it also did not have a swivel cord which wasn't something I was thrilled to discover.",2.0
"Loved the hairdryer, but it only took 4 months to crash and burn.",2.0
**I have to amend my review.  11 months after purchase my dryer stopped working. It had a rattle for a couple of months that concerned me but was still working properly. Tonight it started smoking and stopped working. I went to the warranty section for the product and the site is not secure. My antivirus protection advised me not to enter. So I didn't. I'll contact Amazon for help. The warranty info listed and the warranty included with the product conflict each other also.,2.0
"Based on the reviews, I expected to love this product. I did not. First, it is really heavy. Second, the air flow is just too strong (and I usually like a LOT of airflow) -- I have never had this problem before and usually wish air flow was stronger. Unfortunately, this hair dryer left my hair tangled. Ceramic apparently does not equal ionic. Finally, the hot setting burns your scalp off and the medium is just not quite hot enough. Sadly will be returning.",2.0
"Its nice an light,wish it went from hot to cool itself like my last dryer. great price.",2.0
Purchased this hair dryer just over two months ago and it has started to smell like it is burning. Makes me nervous to use it.,2.0
"Very heavy. Rubber exterior has a terrible smell to it. I switched to the T1, which does a better job of smoothing out the frizz. I don't recommend this.",2.0
"I have fine, thin, with little wavy hair (so I need little straightening) and even with the temperature control this straightener left my hair dry and brittle.  My hair was frizzy and looked awful after using this for just one day.  I did give it another chance and got the same result ... It definitely got my hair straight but also made it look really bad ... I returned it.",2.0
"This product does not work on my hair or my daughters hair as well as i thought it would. It does not seem to straighten it beyond a wave. My hair is not curly, it is only wavy, so i figured it would actually straighten my hair, but the performance is just not there. We are not satified with this product.",2.0
"Disappointed. Purchased based on reviews. It didn't cut my drying time in half or eliminate the frizz any better than my old Conair which I've had for years.

5/2017 Update: stopped working.",2.0
"A friend of mine had this hairdryer and I used it and loved it so I ordered my own. About a week after I started using it, it started to smell horrible when it was on. I figured maybe it was just because it was new and ""breaking in"". Now the smell has gotten worse and it makes this horrible squeaking sound for about the first 30 seconds that it's on. I feel like its actually going to blow up in my hand. It's not a cheap dryer and I was expecting better from a product that comes from a good company.",2.0
Heavy,2.0
too heavy,2.0
After 5 weeks of use each morning the GFI plug makes a loud popping noise if the dryer is left plugged in.  This is not good...,2.0
The heat seems too intense...  I never used it on the highest setting and still fried a section of my hair.  I've never had that problem with any other blow dryer.,2.0
"This blow dryer was too powerful for my hair. I have long thick hair so I thought this would speed up the drying process, but instead it left my hair a tangled mess. Too much air being pushed through for my liking.",2.0
Was to heavy for me.wish I had known the weight of it before I bought it. Would return but don't have the box it came in.,2.0
"I purchased this dryer because my mom loves hers.  I am not a fan of this dryer because I puts my hair in knots which can be damaging to my long hair when I try to brush them out.  I think it is because the nozzle is so powerful as I don't experience this problem with my other dryer.  Additionally, it almost always will trip the circuit breaker.  Which is problematic as my circuit breaker is annoying to access.  A hair dryer should not be that trying on electricity.  Bummer because my mom likes it, I just cant spare breakage from the knots it creates.",2.0
Extremely heavy; the back filter continues to fall out so I finally just removed it and left it off.,2.0
"I started out as such a big fan of this hair dryer. It worked well for about 3 months. My hair looked fab. But 3 months in the low setting stopped working. That's cool. I could deal. Then about 6 months later, it started making an awful screeching noise and started to smoke. Not so cool. The product comes with a 3 year warranty. I contacted customer service, who wanted me to jump through about a million hoops after which it would take more than 2 weeks to get a new hair dryer. Not cool BaByliss and Conair. Instead, I went to Target and bought a similar version by Revlon.",2.0
"Even on low setting, blows way too hard.",2.0
I have owned this dryer for around 2 years now and the first year it worked great. The last year it has been burning my hair to a crisp. I started using the medium heat setting but it is now as hot at the hottest setting. My guess is that it no longer blows at the same velocity as it used to and it is just getting way to hot.,2.0
"I was looking for a powerful blowdryer and knowing that Babybliss has a great reputation, I decided to try this blowdryer because of the ""xtreme"" in the title and the 2000 watts listed.
Unfortunately it was weak and did not have much power at all. My 1745 blowdryer was much stronger and more powerful.
My second issue with this dryer was the buttons to power it on and off. They are flat and very hard to slide on and off. I found myself needed both hands to turn the buttons on/off cold/hot.",2.0
I hate that the on /off and temp button is flat. Its difficult to turn on and off when I'm drying each section of my hair. Ive broken my nails every time I use it. The heat element is great but I wish there was a comb attachment.,2.0
"I relaly wanted to like this dryer. In fact, I wanted to like it so much I accidently waited until 3 days beyond the return window to try and return it. :( Things I like: It's comfortable to hold. It has a low-pitched sound unlike my previous dryer that whined at a very high, annoying pitch. It dries my hair very quickly.
What I don't like, and it's only 1 thing, is that it TANGLES my hair terribly! I didn't change anything about how I do my hair (same shampoo, same way of drying, etc.) except that I got this new hair dryer. It must just be the wind pattern, but it puts tons of knots in my hair that are so difficult to untangle that it results in a great deal of hair breakage. Only 1 issue, but it's a really big deal. Wish I hadn't waited so long to return. I'll probably swap dryers with my son, since he has short hair and the tangling shouldn't be an issue.",2.0
Some other review called this a disposable hair dryer. Could not be a more fitting description. I've probably owned 5 of these hair dryers over the past 6 years. It's fairly reasonable and works well at first. But it starts shorting out while drying less than a year into each purchase. My last one was purchased in Nov 2014 from Amazon and it just started shorting out in the past couple weeks. I can jiggle the cord for now to finish drying but that will stop working soon. This is obv a common problem based on so many other reviews so I don't understand why they don't switch to better parts? Finally switching to another brand...,2.0
I bought this hair dryer in shop where it cost $70 and it sucks for curly hair.,2.0
"It worked OK at first, a bit heavy but good power to dry my hair.  Unfortunately, the motor only after only a little over a year of having it, has started to burn out.  When I turn it on, it is slow at first, then kicks up.  Now I have a burning smell coming out of the unit on the heat setting.  Not worth spending $15 to send it back to get a new one if they would even replace it at all.  Too bad.",2.0
"to big for my comfort, designed for heavy duty work, may be in a salon.",2.0
I didn't even try the dryer.  It's too heavy and there is no way I would be able to dry my hair with it every day.,2.0
"I rated it a 5 star the first month I had it. however, after 2 months, the concentrator attachment became loose and lost its grip. It would attach but it was constantly swiveling in different directions. In addition, it burned out after 6 months.",2.0
Love the Dryer...Power and Heat are Perfect but the Nozzle does Not stay in Place...it either Pops Off or Spins Around and it is Super Annoying :(,2.0
Bought it in September and it stopped working.  Doesn't turn on. Now I have to pay to ship it back to the company and pay $3. While it worked I liked it but for the money I expected it to last longer,2.0
"I tried to use the hair dryer for the first time this morning.  The wind power was strong which is good (took a minute to get used to) but the air never got hot.  It was like it was on the warm setting.  So I changed it to the warm setting just to see, and that was like it was on the cool setting.  My hair turned out really frizzy and I had to flat iron it after.  It was also heavier than I thought.  Maybe mine is defective and that's why I didn't get any hot air.  I'm going to return it.  Not sure yet if I'll try it again to see how I like it with actual hot air or try something else.",2.0
I liked my previous babyliss pro but it wasn't as hot anymore. When I got this one I was disappointed. Maybe because it wasn't the turbo or super turbo version. It just wasn't hot enough for me. It did dry hair fast but after a while my ends were frizzy like I had never done them. This dryer would be great for shorter or thinner hair but I did not like it and returned it. Get a turbo version and something over 2000 watts. Another thing that bothered me was the handle and placement of the knobs. The handle was too slick and no place to put your fingers and my thumb would end up pressing the cold button without meaning to so it blew cold air.,2.0
"the blow dryer sucks! after a while your hair gets frizzy, it does not dry fast enough, horrible!",2.0
It was great however it died in less than two years.,2.0
Powerful hair dryer but way too heavy and buttons are not only in the way but can't be slid without using two hands. Returned.,2.0
"3/17/15  I waited awhile to post this because I was hoping the problem would correct itself but it hasn't.  The dryer dries my hair quickly so I would give it 5 stars for that but I took away 3 stars because the on/off button is so hard to turn on that it takes both hands.  My big, strong husband agrees.  A toggle button would have solved the problem but this is a slide button.  It just will not slide easily.  Save your money and buy a Conair. It is a much better and cheaper dryer.",2.0
"I was so excited to get a ""nice"" hair dryer! However, this one does not live up to the Babybliss name. The high setting is much too high and knotted my hair, however, the low setting takes three times as long to blow dry my hair. Also, I have had this hair dryer for three months, and the dryer will no longer go to high. The bottom is stuck. I plan to return it, but it costs $15 to have them fix it. Not pleased with this dryer.",2.0
"This hair dryer got WAY too hot and the airflow was WAY too powerful.  My hair got so tangled from the intense airflow and my scalp was burning on the Hot setting.  On the Warm setting it was ok, but would take way too long to dry my hair.  And it's heavy!",2.0
"Doesn't get very hot, but good airflow.  The plastic broke after a few months of use and I had to tape it together to hold the plastic in place.",2.0
"This dryer blows really hard, which leaves my hair frizzy. But if I put the air flow on low, it takes forever to dry. Additionally, I can't turn it on and off with one hand- the power switch is just awful. So basically this would be a great dryer if all I needed to do was dry a lot of hair fast, but for styling hair it is awful. (And heavy.) I'm hoping I can return this one.",2.0
"My professional dryer from France that was originally $300+ fell out of my hand, hit the floor and broke :(  I went on a search and read several reviews and because of the reviews on this one and the price, I went ahead and bought it here on Amazon.  I have long, extremely thick, and curly hair which takes a while to blow dry, so I figured with the wattage of this one it will dry faster than most others...well it does dry pretty well, but the major problem I have is the attachment on the end does not stay on and it falls off all of the time while blowdrying.  I need the attachment on because I use it against my brush so it flows properly.  I also don't want my hair that close to the heating element so it doesn't fry my hair.  The way the attachment piece is designed, it is supposed to go on the inside of the end of the dryer, but the heat melts the plastic and it doesn't stay in place.  All other dryers I have had in the past, the attachment piece goes around the outer edge of the dryer, which makes much more sense to me.  I am going to contact the manufacturer and see if they have a fix for this issue.",2.0
"Bought this dryer in March 2014 - as of January 19th, 2015, it died. Motor struggled and then it started smoking. If I left it on longer, I'm pretty sure it would have caught fire. When I looked inside after turning it off, it was sparking. It was so disappointing that this didn't even last a full year. I have very long hair and searched out a dryer that could help me cut back on drying time since I wash and dry my hair every day. This was a wonderful dryer at first - taking off a full 7 minutes of drying time compared to my previous dryer. Now I'm back to my old dryer and looking again for a better one. Perhaps I got a bad one - but I won't be buying this again.",2.0
"I bought this hair dryer back in early 2012 and was very satisfied at first. It's considerably more powerful than one of the 1875w hair dryers that are common in stores - this is definitely a more professional model and it shows in a couple of ways.

1) It is very heavy. I guess I got used to how heavy it was and ignored how sore my wrist/arm got holding it while I blew my hair dry. But now that I've replaced it with a cheaper hair dryer, I realize just how cumbersome it was.

2) The cord is ridiculously long. It has to be at least 3-4 feet, which is insane, but makes sense if you're using this hair dryer in a salon. I found the cord incredibly cumbersome both in storing the hair dryer and using it - over time, it twisted and twisted until the whole thing was kinked and it was totally unfixable. Annoying, but I lived with it - until one morning the hair dryer shorted out and shot sparks at my head.

My husband looked at it and surmised that the twisting cord caused a short at the base of the dryer and one morning, the wires within tore while I was blow drying.

Overall, the dryer lasted a little under 3 years, and I liked it up until this point - I have thick hair and it got the job done quickly. But the cord was a real hindrance, and obviously led to the untimely demise of the dryer. I ended up replacing it with a cheap Tresseme dryer from Walmart, as I knew I wouldn't want to buy this particular model again because of the issues listed above. Disappointing as it is a powerful machine.",2.0
Heavy and makes my hair smell burnt.,2.0
"This does dry your hair faster.  But it also torched my hair.  It made it very dry!  So, there's a trade off for the speedy dry time.  I did not put the heat on high, either.  Lightweight, quick dry.  But I tend to have dry hair anyway, and this made my hair much more dry than my other blow dryer.",2.0
"It worked 1.5 years and now it won't go above low. It was so incredibly hot so many times on high. There is no middle ground though, low or high (and now just low). The buttons are harder to slide than other blow dryers I've owned.",2.0
"Very nice dryer but after only one year, the dryer shuts off several times while drying hair.  I do want to return it but it says it's not eligible for return even though it has a two year warranty.  I do not have the box anymore to return and would like to know how to return this so I can purchase another hair dryer.  Thank you",2.0
I bought this almost one year ago and loved it...so powerful.  Cut my hair drying time in half. About 2-3 weeks ago it started blowing my outlet's fuse and Id have to reset them. Happened every other day unless I dried my hair in 1-2 minute segments and never let it get too hot. Today it blew it's own fuse and is completely dead. I'm so bugged that this $40 hair dryer lasted 11.5 months.,2.0
"I bought this hairdryer in October 2013.  Aside from it being quite heavy (which I was expecting based on other reviews), it worked great.  For about 2 months.  Since then, the High speed setting only works about 5% of the time.  There is no rhyme or reason to when it works (i.e. I've tried it in different outlets/homes) but most of the time, it doesn't so I just have to use the Low speed setting.  The times the High speed DOES work (I try it every day) - it works well and my hair dries fast.  But again, most of the time it does not work.  I'm not an electrician by any means but the fact that it works some of the time and doesn't some of the time makes me think there is some loose wiring in the unit?  I've never dropped or banged the unit so am assuming just faulty manufacturing.  Will never buy again.",2.0
"The dryer works fine, but is extremely heavy and is difficult to turn on and off. So, if you are trying to section dry your hair with a round brush, it is terrible. If you are looking to over all just dry your hair, it's fine.",2.0
Very heavy.  I ended up buying a new hair dryer at Target within a few months that I was much happier with.,2.0
"I purchased this hair dryer from amazon on Dec 25, 2013.  It worked very well for alllllllmost a full year until it just died in the middle of use.  Sadly, I can't imagine that it was from over-use as I only used it maybe once a week, and even then I rarely dried my hair all the way (I have very thick hair, and this dryer is pretty heavy).  After reading several other reviews I have decided that I will need to go through another manufacturer and will send this one to the scrap heap.",2.0
"I'm not a daily hair dryer user and this wouldn't be the unit to convince myself to become one.  It's unevenly heavy, vibrations actually start to make my hand hurt. I've gotten to the point I wedge it in my hand towel bar in the bathroom. I'll eventually just give in and buy a different dryer.",2.0
"Warm-ish, at best. Not very powerful. Super disappointed.",2.0
"I had another BaByliss hairdryer (Babylis Pro BABTT5585 Tourmaline Titanium 3000 Dryer), but the cord became all twisted, so I decided to try this version. Woah, this hairdryer is heavy! Much heavier compared to my previous Babyliss. I returned the day after I received it. I'm sure it's a good hairdryer, but I couldn't deal with the extra weight, particularly because I have lots of thick hair. I went back to my old version.",2.0
"I loved this blow dryer. However, after having it for about 7 months the nozzle began to lose it's grip. It falls off every time I put even a small amount of pressure on the nozzle while blow drying. I know that the nozzle is really important to help prevent heat damage, so basically I have to buy a new blow dryer cause I cannot use it without the nozzle. I'm really disappointed cause this is the second blow dryer I've bought within a year and half.",2.0

This stopped functioning properly after 2 1/2 years.  I expect hair dryers to last much longer than that - especially one that retails for $40.,2.0

This hair dryer was unable to completing take away the fly always. I had to use my old 1500 watt dryer in order to get the results I wanted.  I wouldn't recommend to someone who has curly hair.,2.0
"This dryer is heavier than the earlier model I have and doesn't get very hot. Recently it blows cooler and cooler air regardless of the setting. Overall I like BaByliss products but this one didn't make the cut. In retrospect, should have returned it.",2.0
Had for six months-was very heavy and loud but seemed to work ok. Then the high blow setting crapped out and that was the end of that--Guess someone has to get the lemon-But You can do better considering the weight and noise,2.0
"It did dry my hair fairly fast. However, it made my hair extremely static-y, to point where touching my hair made it stand up. Ended up returning it for that reason.",2.0
"Performed okay when it was working. But the controls can be difficult to use if you have any lotion on your hands. The dryer stopped working after 6 months. The on/off switch was intermittent just prior to failing. I called customer service and they said they would send me a box to put it in. I called back 2 weeks later and then they apologized and said, no, I need to first send it to a different location and they would reimburse me for shipping.

I ended buying another dryer. This one is going in the trash. I don't want another one.",2.0
"I bought this hairdryer because it seemed similar to one I had used while staying at a friend's house. Unfortunately, this dryer was different from the one I had tried in a few key ways. First, the noise emitted during operation is low pitched as other reviewers have mentioned, but that low growl or rumble causes the dryer to vibrate uncomfortably. Second the dryer seemed very heavy to me. Some people like heft as an indicator of quality, but combined with the vibrating it caused my hand to go numb after a few minutes of use. I returned this dryer and bought a conair at my local store. It's not great, but it doesn't make my hands lose feeling :/",2.0
It was a nice looking blow dryer and was great at drying my hair but it was just too heavy for me.  It hurt my wrist and I have short thin hair that doesn't take long to dry.,2.0
I had high hopes for this hair dryer bc I've heard good things about the brand and it had good reviews. It's super heavy and doesn't dry my hair particularly fast. I do like that a diffuser was included,2.0
This blow dryer vibrates terribly in your hand while using and that makes it very uncomfortable. I returned it and got a refund.,2.0
"I like to wear my hair naturally wavy and bone straight and with a large brush to give it smooth body- so I needed a dryer that was light weight and had a variety of speeds and heat levels. If I don;t have time to air dry, I need a dryer that helps me replicate the drying process. I wanted three speeds- but most have only two, including this one. The weight is OK, not great- but the controls are hard to move with a quick flick- i often have to pull dryer away to find the leverage to change a speed or heat setting. Also, a good thing is that it really does smooth your hair and dry it quickly- but sometimes i want my hair full and wavy (with an expected amount of frizz, and delayed drying to encourage curl) and i am having a hard time achieving that with this dryer. It did not come with a diffuser and my two old ones don't fit it. So if you only want straightened hair- this is the dryer for you. If you like more variety- the switches, no diffuser and tourmaline insistence on eliminating frizz- also pulls out wave and curl in your hair. not good for me.",2.0
"I purchased this dryer in Oct. 2012 and it worked fine till July 2013 and then it had an electrical issue with wire burning. Up until then it seemed to work well. I called Conair ( the parent company) and was told it would be covered under the 3 year limited warranty. The catch was I would have to pay a $3.00 service fee plus S&H to the state of Arizona. Between the two cost it would be almost half the cost of the hair dryer. Beware of the warranty with this company. Even it is a manufactures defect they will not
pay to ship it back to them. I would not buy again!!",2.0
This product is definitely better formulated for a dry scalp and did nothing for my oily scalp.,2.0
"I liked the power, heat, and weight of this hairdryer. Unfortunately, it suddenly stopped working after 11 months. I don't expect an appliance like a hairdryer to have a long lifespan, but less than one year is unacceptable. It seems the company honors its warranty, and the dryer is very nice for the price, but I've decided to move on to a different brand.",2.0
"The drying time was cut in half most definitely, but the heat setting on here was way too hot, it dried my scalp and caused it to flake. :( loved it otherwise!",2.0
"I'll start by saying I had extremely high expectations for this hair dryer. I used it one time in a hotel room and loved it. I bought it and have used it for 6 months and here's what I have to say. Drying my hair has never been faster. I have relatively long hair and it's thick. So if you are looking for fast drying it works well. With that said, it makes my hair tangle very easy and dry/brittle. The hot setting is HOT but the warm setting wasn't warm enough. I switched back to my Hot Tools dryer and my hair is sleeker and feels so much better. It's not as fast and takes longer to dry, but I don't have nearly the fly aways that I got from this one.",2.0
"When it was working, this was the best hair dryer I've ever owned. But before the year was up, it started cutting in and out, apparently with an electrical short of some sort. It has a three year warranty, but the manufacturer requires me to pay for shipping and they do not stand behind their product by immediately providing a replacement. The representative said it could take six to eight weeks. So for all practical purposes, I'm forced to buy another dryer as I cannot go that long without drying my hair. This means that if I exercise the warranty, I'm going to end up out as much as money between the shipping and buying a temporary replacement that I'm better off just buying another dryer. So buy this dryer if you want something that works great but may end up being trash before you know it.",2.0
"This hairdryer worked great when first purchased - very powerful for its price.

Unfortunately, 8 months later, the high speed setting no longer works. With long hair, this makes the dryer all but redundant unless you want to commit your entire morning to your hair. The rubber around the handle has also started to fray and peel. The dryer was never put under any more stress than you would expect - used to dry hair once every other day, stored in the bedroom away from steam and humidity.

I can't recall if it came with a warranty (I assume it did; although the box, instructions, etc were lost during a move). If you do buy this dryer, I recommend keeping hold of all that information just in case. I emailed the seller to see if they could help on the warranty situation but never got a response.",2.0
"I bought this dryer in August, 2012, by December it stopped working. I contacted Conair's customer service and was told that since it was still under warranty  they would fix it, but I would have to pay postage for their defective item, which was $16.00. It has been a month since I sent it to Conair and I have still have not gotten it back. When it worked it worked great, Conair = Con-job.",2.0

"I'm being generous with my two stars. I have pretty thick, wavy, highlighted, long hair. This dryer just doesn't have the airflow needed to dry my hair without frying it.

I am SO disappointed.",2.0
"Let me back up, I have extremely dry hair.  For anything to leave me greasy feeling/looking is rare.  Ive used on both towel dried hair, and dry hair.  When I use on dry hair, it looks like Ive applied Elmers Glue.

"Initially,  I got this product as  promotion/trial size item and liked it. Then I ordered it. But what I got , ) don't like it. Smell is stronger, consistency is different,  this one is more liquidy  and most important does not add any shine to your hair, in contrary makes them dull looking",2.0
"I purchased this dryer less than a year ago and I loved it.  As the other reviewers note, the high setting is seriously high, and I've been able to dry my hair more quickly with this dryer than with any other.  Unfortunately, in the last several weeks it's begun to act up:  when I slide the switch to high, the dryer shuts off rather than kicking into the high setting.  I contacted Conair (the actual makers of this dryer) and was told that I will receive a replacement for the dryer, as long as I am willing to pay to ship it back, pay for the return shipping of a new dryer, and wait two to three weeks (AFTER they receive my dryer) for the replacement.  As I told the customer service rep, that's a long time to be without a hair dryer.  I'm giving this item two stars because it's great when it works, but the durability is questionable and the warranty is far less than stellar.",2.0

"After trying my daughter's blow dryer of the same make/model, we liked it so much that we purchased our own.  We've used it for the past few months and have had no problems.  It's powerful, dries my thick hair quicker than other blow dryers I've had (Conair, Vidal Sassoon, etc.) and appears to be sturdy and well built.  We are happy with our purchase!

11/8/15 UPDATE:  The first blow dryer lasted about 2 years when it stopped working.  Because we liked how powerful it was and quickly it dried our hair, we purchased another one of the same make/model in March 2015.  Well, it's been about 8 mos. and now this new blow dryer is not working properly.  Lately, there seems to be a loose connection because when on, it shuts off mid-use depending on the angle of holding the dryer; sometimes it turns on after shaking it, other times it doesn't.  Definitely frustrating!  Note, it gets normal use and has not been abused or dropped.  After browsing previous reviews, I see others have posted similar complaints.  I just wanted to warn other consumers, this is a great blow dryer WHEN IT WORKS but I expect a blow dryer to last longer than a few months!!  So disappointed.",2.0
"This is a very sturdy dryer and I'm sure would be good for a professional, but for me doing my own hair it is very heavy and unweildy.  And I wasn't able to maneuver the buttons with just one hand.  It may be a very good dryer but for me was just too hard to use myself so I had to send it back.",2.0
"When I first received this hair dryer, I thought it was great.  It is not as heavy as I was worried it would be, and it dried my thick hair very fast on the high setting - manageable and with a shine.  However, as I continued to use it on an almost daily basis, I noticed my hair getting drier and more brittle, less manageable - it just seemed damaged and unhealthy.  I bought new shampoos thinking that might help, but it didn't.  Finally, I resorted to using a different hair dryer, the Conair Infiniti.  It takes slightly longer to dry, but my hair has quickly returned to its healthy state.  Perhaps the high-heat, high-blower setting on the BaByliss was too much for my hair, but the lower settings took forever to do the job.  At $50, this was an expensive mistake to make.",2.0
"I like the way it dries my hair. It gets very hots and dries fast. However, the black covering is peeling off the dryer and every time I dry my hair I have black pieces all over. What mess!! It is heavy too.",2.0
Brought this for my wife because of all the good review and it was a bad idea. She complained that it was so heavy that she had a hard time drying her hair. Feels like there is a small lead weight inside. No idea how a hair styled could hold this al day. It is quieter than the old one probably cause less airflow.,2.0
"This dryer is average.  It doesn't dry much better than other dryers.  It weighs a TON.  If you have long hair like I do, your arm will be ready to fall off after 10 minutes.  If I try to dry my hair AND my daughter's in the same night it is nearly impossible.  Do yourself a favor, and buy a lighter dryer!",2.0
"I ordered this dryer because BaByliss has a good reputation, and everyone else seems to like it. So I was kind of surprised to find myself hating this hair dryer...

Pros:
Hot is hot
Good power

Cons:
Heavy
Really loud
Vibrates a lot

Because it's heavy, it tends to slip in my hand until I am pressing the blue cold air button. I feel like I'm fighting with it all the time! Needless to say, I will be looking for an alternative...",2.0
"I just recevied my BaByliss Pro yesterday and I love it!  The speed and the heat is perfect and it cut my drying time in half.  I would have paid much more for this dryer.  Less than $40??  This is a an amazing deal!  Throw away your wimpy Revlons and Conairs and Vidal Sassoons and get this dryer!
Only 4 months later and my beloved BaByliss has stopped working.  Sometimes it will turn on.  Sometimes it won't.  When it does decide to turn on, there is no telling how long it will stay on.  And once it shuts off it won't start up again for several minutes (if at all).  Very disappointed because I really loved this dryer...for the few months that it worked.",2.0
"UPDATE:  During travel, somehow the air filter on the back of the dryer came loose and disappeared.  ConAir doesn't make replacement parts for this dryer so after only two months, I'm out another dryer.  Trying to use the dryer now, it sucks my hair into the back of it haphazardly.  Seems a simple thing to offer to replace yet they don't do it.

LAME.  Now I have to buy ANOTHER hair dryer?  I have to adjust my review for this.  : (

EARLIER REVIEW:  This is the second one I've owned.  I dropped my other one so many times, it had cracked and didn't really seem safe to keep using.  Also, the ""hot"" temperature had become so darned hot it would almost scald - so clearly it was time for a new hairdryer.  I was so happy to find this on Amazon because when I originally bought it in a local beauty supply store, it was $90!  The guy said he was giving me a great deal when he gave it to me for $75.  Wow.  Total rip-off as it's half the price here.  That nonsense aside, this is a great professional grade hairdryer and I LOVE IT.",2.0
"If you buy this thinking this is a 2000W dryer, please keep this in mind.  Mathematically that is not possible.  A 2000W hair dryer running on a 110 circuit would draw 17 Amps of power.  The cord and plug used are designed for a maximum load of 15A.  So either their marketing folks have lied, which I hope is the case for SAFETY reasons, or this hair dryer is designed to draw more current than it's socket was designed for.  To truly draw 17A would require a 20A circuit and a 20A rated outlet with the weird plug that has a keyed sideways prong.

This is probably a good hair dryer but truth in marketing is gone.",2.0
"My old hairdryer finally sparked and died. Decided I needed a new hairdryer with a bit more power than 1800W so looked for one with 2000. Shopped around (not for long as I didn't have a hairdryer!) and found this. Arrived in a couple of days (thanks Amazon) and it is fabulous. Some had complained about the noise but it is much quieter than my previous hairdryer (my husband agrees as he listens to it early in the morning) and some complained about the weight - I don't find it heavy but think I am doing a minor workout in the morning without going to the gym! With the concentrating nozzle on, it is a little cumbersome (would be great if it was a little shorter), and I frequently push the ""cold shot"" by mistake which is right at the right-angle of the handle and air shaft - a good reminder not to fry my hair! The hanging loop is big and in the right place and the longer cord is ideal. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on a decent hairdryer. Hopefully it will last a LONG time. I disregarded all the ""Ceramix"", etc hype which I think is a lot of BS!

I posted this review April 21 2010 - Fast forward to June 2013.
About a year after I bought it, the nozzle started coming loose and falling off all the time. So I super-glued it on as I always use it.
Several months ago, it has started to stop working, mid-drying. Sometimes it is hard to turn on so I jiggle the cord a little and it starts again. I fear there is a short in the electrical wiring which may have come loose from hanging up by the loop that it is supposed to hang by ( I did mention it is fairly heavy so prolonged hanging may be the cause - if so, don't have the loop for hanging it right at the connection of the cord to the dryer! Thought this would last a long time - 3 years isn't a long time in my opinion. Will go back to the disposable hairdryers - so much for trying to be ""green""! :(",2.0
"I was so excited when I recieved this hair dryer in the mail-I spent hours looking up reviews to find the perfect hair dryer, so I really wanted to like this one. Unfortunately, I tried this hair dryer 4 times, but just couldn't get myself to like it. I have naturally straight, medium thickness, color treated (dry) hair so I'm looking for shine/moisture and body in a hair dryer. This hair dryer gave me neither. In fact, I compared it to my old conair travel hair dryer (blew dry half my hair with the conair, half with the babyliss) and I found the babyliss side of my head to be much dryer with many more flyaways than the other side of my hair. The babyliss did nothing for my hair body either, and instead kind of gave it a weird square shape. All in all I would say that maybe this hairdryer works for people with curly or very thick hair, but if you do not have this hair type BE VERY WARY OF LISTENING TO THE OTHER REVIEWS ON HERE.",2.0
I have had it for only 6 months and the switch to turn it off broke so I have to unplug it every time I am finished using it. The handle gets really hot also. I wouldn't recommend it.,2.0
"My order took a little too long to come, so I went a picked this up at Ulta before it arrived.  I have to say that I did not get the results that everyone else here claims.  First, the smell was too strong and like pure alcohol.  It felt like I was spraying hair spray in my hair.  I used with the Rusk flat iron I ordered (which got returned), and my hair felt stiff, hard, and dry.  Unfortunately, I can't return this because its a flammable product so I guess it'll add to my collection of unusable products.",2.0
Not impressed with it at all. It didn't really deliver a shine and seemed like it was full of alcohol rendering the hair dry and harsh.,2.0
I don't like it very much!,2.0
"Haven't tried the mask yet. But when I received it, it is already opened and used definitely.",2.0
"I bought this item at the same time as the Face Brush by Dermotologia, & they cost about the same. The packaging on the Dermotologia is sturdier, but the brushes themselves are about the same size & weight (very light-weight). Both brushes are far too soft to exfoliate in & of themselves. In other words, if you use a cleansing product on the brush that doesn't have abrasive qualities, these brushes will not provide any degree of abrasion by themselves. If you plan on putting an abrasive exfoliant on them, they will be effective in applying the exfoliant. The Dermotologia brush is made in China (isn't almost everything these days?), but at least Dermotologia advises the consumer of the country of origin. The MenScience brush has no indication of country of origin, either on the brush itself or on its packaging. The MenScience brush indicates that it ""combats ingrown hairs."" As soft as its bristles are, I don't see how that would be possible. Perhaps ""massages ingrown hairs"" would be more accurate? The Dermotologia brush has the company's logo on the brush; the MenScience brush has no markings of any sort on the brush, so seems to be of a generic variety (aren't most good companies proud to put their logos on their products?). The MenScience brush has their logo on the case, but if case & brush become separated over time, you'll be hard put to recall what company made this brush that you either like or don't like. For effectiveness as a face brush, they are equal. For packaging & other non-performance areas, the Dermotologia is superior. My recommendation is to buy whichever one you find at a cheaper price, but only if you're looking for a soft, gentle, non-abrasive brush. I will be posting this same review on the webpage for the Dermotologia brush.",2.0
"I was hoping this would be stiffer than most face brushes, which are way too soft to do anything other than push soap around your face. The description of this being able to exfoliate and prevent ingrown hairs on men is misleading - maybe if the bristles were more firm. Nope. Going back.",2.0
"I have been a person struggling with acne the past three years and I thought maybe I wasn't thoroughly washing my face well enough, so I thought a scrubbing brush would be able to go deeper inside and get the impurities out. I've used this product for about two weeks, and I absolutely no difference in complexion or tone. I still have the blackheads on my nose. This product really costs a whole lot for something that doesn't really do what it says it will do. I gave it two stars simply because I'm sure it cleans, it just doesn't clean any better than your hands would.",2.0
"Bought 2, one for me and one for my son, both are broke now ,not from use bought dropping less than one foot , like 8 inches above sink , the head breaks off CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP. Made in CHEAPVILLE......

DO NOT PURCHASE! Waste of Money!",2.0
"The gloves aren't bad, however, I realized they equal quality gloves at my local supermarkets, ie., Von's, Albertsons for 1.99-2.99! I gave two stars because I feel they're way over priced and can get several pairs for the price of these.",2.0
"I paid three times the price for these gloves compared to another pair because they were called ""MenScience"" gloves. I figured if they were for ""Men"" they would be a larger size. Not so. In fact they are smaller than the other pair I bought. These gloves are tiny. They stretch to fit to a certain degree. But they are way too tight on my hands. Don't be fooled by the ""Men"" label. I mean no disrespect for small folk, but these should be labeled ""LeprechaunScience"" gloves.

I will be returning them.

EDIT: 7/21 OK, I used the other gloves this morning. The ones that were larger than this brand. They too were small, but not as small. A tight fit on my hands, but they loosened up a bit when wet and soapy.  I suppose the MenScience gloves would too. But still, they are not for big hands.",2.0
"I bought these because I was suckered by the ""manly"" marketing. These are no better in quality than a $1 pair of pastel shower gloves. Sure, being a guy, I prefer having black gloves, but these are fraying after a couple months and were WAY overpriced.

Save your money and buy something cheaper.",2.0
Rather thin and no loop to hang it to dry.  You can get better products for less at Walmart.,2.0
This is an excellent product when bought fresh; trying to save money I ordered it online and what I got was just old and withered enough to disappoint me.  It's back to retail for me.,2.0
Not product that is listed on the web site.,2.0
The Product is very Bad it has a hint of Aramis But the smell works less than three Hours,2.0
Priced way too much for what you get.,2.0
"I,ve been using aramis products over 50 years,and this is no where near as good as antiperspirant stick.",2.0
"I ordered this product by accident.  I have always used the antiperspirant stick, not the deodorant stick. I didn't use the product right away so when I discovered I had the wrong one I could not return it.  So I just started using the deodorant.  I have to say that I don't like it much.  It is a bit cold and sticky when you apply it, and it does not perform as well and protects as long as the antiperspirant. I'm going back to antiperspirant.",2.0
"I am a big fan of the PCA line, it has been the only thing to work on my adult acne (mainly the A&c serum, BPO cleanser and nutrient toner). However, I have been using this product for over a month and I do not see any change on the lines under my eyes. I am so used to having fast results with their products that I expected to see some kind of change after the first month. What I can say about this product is that as small as it is I still have A LOT left,PCA products can be expensive but they do last a long time. I will write another review on my third or fourth month.

UPDATE I am a big fan of PCA skin products and I had to update this review because I really believe I was sold an expired toner and other PCA products. I stopped buying PCA products on amazon after comparing them to the ones I bought with my dermatologist or @skinstore.com. I noticed that while everything was the same the expiration dates on the products I bought on amazon where different and where able to come off. Sadly I can't remember the vendor but there must be a reason why they are cheaper here when other sites like dermstore.com or skinstore.com will not even give a small discount on PCA products (PCA products are always excluded from promotions).
The A&C serum I bought came in the old container that had a defective pump if you buy this serum on other skin care sites they have  the newer (better quality) container which is a bit taller and has a better pump.
With that said choose the vendor carefully.",2.0

"I have been using this product twice a day for over two weeks and have not see any results. I got this item because it claims to eliminate dark circles under the eyes. I will give it a full month before the final verdict, but so far can't tell any effect from its use.

After trying if for awhile, I find I cannot say that I have seen any of the dramatic results found in other reviews. Perhaps looking at the situation with unrealistic expectations.",2.0
"While I like the way it curls my hair, I cannot recommend this product to anyone.  The design makes it very awkward to use.  There is no spring action on the top handle, so while holding the main handle, you have to use your fingers to lift and lower the top handle to hold the hair on the wand.  AND, there is no rubber tip on the end of the wand (Every other curling iron I've used had one), so you have to wear a heat-resistant glove to be able to touch the tip of the iron when rolling the hair onto it.  Because of the awkward design, it takes me twice as long to curl my hair as it does with my other curling irons.  Dee",2.0
"This is a great curling iron as it heats to extremely hot and provides super smooth curls.  However, I am not coordinated enough to control the swiveling clamp mechanism, and the end doesn't have an insulated contact to hold, so it all has to be done one-handed while swiveling around. I'm not able to manage it without burning myself.",2.0
Small lever busted in less than four months. :(,2.0
We had to return  too big and not easily to handle,2.0
I picked this curling iron because it is the choice of many celebrity hairstylists but upon inspection I realized that it is too cumbersome to use and very complicated for a curling iron so I ended up returning it.,2.0
"I love the product - whitens veneers - and hate the price. . hence the 2 star review. For $56 on QVC, I got 2 each of the Supersmile tooth paste and accelerator and 2 pre rinses. Do the math! This is a rip off!!",2.0

I liked how clean my teeth felt after using the product but they were no where near as white as they said they'd be.,2.0
This is the toothpaste and comes in two different tubes.  I have been using it for two weeks and see no change in the color of my teeth. My review is that it is no less and no more effective then regular toothpaste and for $22 is about 5 times more expensive.  Definitely not worth it.,2.0
I see no difference and started using this product one month ago - I hope to see a change soon,2.0
"I would not do business with this company again.  Not only is the product substandard (teeth look bright on the day of the weekly swabbing treatment but that's it) but the company doesn't stand behind the product beyond the 60 day return policy.  I called and specified ""No more shipments!"" 3 months ago and another shipment showed up today and my credit card was charged. They refuse to send me any documentation evidencing my cancelled order. This is a hassle and rip off. Use peroxide and baking soda the old fashioned way - better results and NO HASSLE!!!",2.0
"No different than over the counter toothpaste, noticed no change in the color of my teeth,

Certainly does notwork like the informercial. A waste of money! Get a professional treatment instead that does work! Save your money!,2.0
"I had high hopes for this product when I read the fantastic ""can't live without it"" recommendation in New Beauty magazine - my go-to magazine for everything.  I have been using this product for several months and it is, in my opinion, not worth the price.  It just doesn't seem to do anything.  I wanted it to and kept on with the automatic delivery direct from the Supersmile web site, but I do not see any difference at all.  My initial kit came with a color strip so you can compare before and after using the product - there is no difference.  Let me state I am not a smoker and do not drink gallons of coffee but mostly I did not notice any color change.  It is suppose to work on crowns, capped teeth, veneers, etc. but it doesn't, in fact, a few times it seemed to actually yellow my teeth.  If it works for you that is terrific but for me it was a costly investment in time and product ... a very big disappointment.  I did not expect my teeth to ""glow"" like so many people who whiten their teeth to the ""glow in the dark"" status and there are plenty of folks walking around with these overly bleached teeth (think Ross from Friends).  I just wanted the color to be better as promised which it did not deliver.",2.0
"I had high hopes for this system, but didn't notice much of a difference... if any difference at all.  Definitely not worth the money in my opinion.",2.0
"so far 2 weeks no changes on my teeth....color same...disappointed

Didn't really work as well I thought. Regular whitening toothpaste would do just as well. I expected better out of this product.,2.0
hoped to see SOME whitening.  used as directed until it was gone and saw nothing.  very disappointing since I cannot have my teeth whitened at the dentists office due to extreme sensitivity.,2.0
"My teeth tend to be a little on the sensitive side and this system definitely made it worse.  I gave it 2 stars because your teeth definitely feel clean afterwards, but having to brush for 2 minutes is a little annoying.",2.0

"I have used this product for a couple of weeks and see NO difference. Not only that, the mint flavor is very weak and I don't even feel like I brushed my teeth. I have much better results with Optic White Colgate. Very disappointed when taking into account how expensive this is.",2.0
I did not see the results promised and you are suppose to use equal amounts from each tube but the tubes do not contain equal amounts so you will run out of the accelerator first.,2.0
"I got this product and was excited to try it out. I don't smoke/drink coffee/sodas, so my teeth are not really stained with anything from what I choose to eat/drink. I thought I'd give it a try and see if it would work for me. After the first try, the rinse was a bit painful because I had a couple of teeth that were sensitive to the rinse. I haven't noticed any whitening to my teeth. But my teeth have gotten stronger, in that I no longer have any sensitivity and my teeth feel clean after I've started using this. I think it would work better for smokers/coffee drinkers/people with real stains on their teeth. Since I don't partake in those things, I didn't see much of a difference. The old stains I've got around a few of my teeth, haven't gone away. So for me, this product didn't give me the results I thought I would get. I'll use up what I have and go back to my baking soda/hydrogen peroxide routine. Maybe get a tan cuz that always seems to make my teeth look whiter! :-)",2.0
I have followed all the directions  and I did read the reviews prior to purchase but I am disappointed in the results. Will buy another product and see what happens,2.0
This item was not as advertised...most unhappy with it...I fail for the hype of much whiter teeth...bully to that save your money..DO NOT BUY.,2.0
"The title says it all.  Some of us, despite our regular trips to the dentist, brushing with the latest device, and flossing, will never have the whiter teeth we seek.",2.0
"I like the fact that using it does not cause me any physical pain, as other products do.  However, if my teeth are whiter, I cannot see it.  Kinda bummed........",2.0
"Didn't see much difference in my teeth. Would not buy again. Not worth it for the money. Found out the Crest Dental Rinse I was using was staining my teeth. Quit that, had my teeth cleaned by the dentist and threw the Crest and the Supersmile away.",2.0

"Been using this for a month and notice some whitening, but not what I expected. Too $$$ for what it does.",2.0
"I purchased the whitening system and the accelerating mouthwash all together. I have not been impressed with the level of whitening they have delivered, and they did make my teeth hurt from time to time. I have finished all of the products and have not seen any real noticeable results. My teeth are not terribly stained, I just need a pick me up every 6 months or so from my coffee and red wine habits. This definitely didn't do it.  I have had much more success from Crest Whitestrips and will go back to using those when I need whitening.",2.0
I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and I am still waiting for my teeth to whiten. I thought I would see a difference by now but nothing...I am super disappointed but i will continued to use the product till i finish it because I bought it... I don't want my money going to waste....don't buy this product go to a denist for a professional whitening.,2.0
"I must say I am so very disappointed in the Supersmile Whitening System Set - 3.6 & 4.2 Oz each.  I have used both faithfully, exactly as stated in the directions. I just completed using the entire contents.  I took a before & after picture, and see no difference after completion of products.  Not only did I use exactly as directed, I also brushed my teeth for twice as long as recommended, and at times, 3 times a day.  My husband & son said they see no difference what-so-ever.  For the price of these 'toothpaste'. I expected at least some good results.  I'll return to my dentists' whitening gel.  Wish I had something better to say.",2.0
"The first two days I could see a difference but then my teeth started to get darker instead of whitening it. Not buying this again. It kind of worked for my mom though, it probably works for people with very yellow teeth. It tastes so weird and it leaves your tongue feeling slightly strange, like numb or something.",2.0
"I tried this product after reading the reviews. I truly wanted the product to work for me. I used it as directed for close to  a week. My teeth became so sensitive that breathing actually HURT. I saw no lightening in my teeth either, so I discontinued use. I wish it had been a workable product for me. However, it was a waste of money in my experience. :(",2.0
"I read the reviews before buying this product and it looked very positive.  However, after 3 weeks of using it twice a day, I don't really see a difference at all.",2.0
"I wrote a terrible review for this after my first use but now I'm feeling better about it. In fact, I'm using it as I write this. At first I didn't think it heated my whole head, but it does. It's just not as powerful as the old bonnet dryers I remember from my youth. It works OK though. I can't seem to alter my rating but I'd give it three stars instead of two.",2.0
"I bought this dryer about two years ago, and I used it for deep conditioning my hair after washing.  I have thick, kinky hair and this dryer didn't get my hair completely dry.  They dryer was quiet which was good, but it also wasn't very powerful.  About a year ago the plastic ring that attached the hose to the bonnet began separating from the bonnet. It eventually came apart entirely. Unless I tie the opening on the bonnet around the hose, the dryer is now useless.",2.0
"I had high hopes for this dryer, since my previous experiences with bonnet dryers were with ones from the 1960s and 70s that I found used. I've bought several old ones for around $6-$8 over the past several years, and have ended up giving some away to friends who liked them, and using others until they died. In general, I've been really happy with the performance of the old ones, but I figured getting one new could only be better.  Wrong.

I respect the opinion of the other person who wrote a review, but I have to differ on several points-- the dryer is neither particularly quiet nor powerful. True, it's quieter than a regular hair dryer, but the air output is absolutely lousy.  Even on the highest setting, it can't fully inflate the bonnet, even after I made sure the plastic wasn't sticking to itself.  I found because of the weak airflow, the front of my head gets getting absolutely NO air.  The plastic is just flat against it. I've tried rearranging it, and finally have found that the only way to dry my hair on all sides is to rotate the bonnet regularly, defeating any ""convenience"" this product might have had.

The other point I must disagree with is about the length of the tube. It's simply not long enough unless you're sitting up aginst the unit and not moving.

Pros - Despite the fact that I overall don't care for this unit, there are some positive things about it.  The cord, tube, and bonnet store inside the actual unit.  The tube is sturdy. Also, the unit kicks out a decent amount of heat.

Cons - Weak airflow and short tube. Not worth the price. Also, the dryer is not very tall, but has a really large footprint. It takes up about a square foot of space on my counter. It's larger than any of the even the clunkiest vintage dryers I've had.

I highly recommend finding a vintage bonnet dryer in a thrift store or on Ebay. I've owned several, and have never been disappointed in the settings, airflow, or performance. Those things are workhorses, and they come with really neat ""hatbox"" type cases for storage.  Plus they're so cheap that if you do get a bum unit, you can afford to replace it easily.",2.0
"After using it one time it stopped working at the start of my second use.  Thank goodness I still had my old faith Vidal Sassoon Ionizer hair dryer to finish drying my hair.  Unfortunately the bonnet replacement has been discontinued therefore I'm forced to buy a new product.  I returned the Hot Tools Professional for a refund. to put it kindly, it was a waste of my time and money!",2.0
"I was disappointed in this dryer. The bonnet won't stay connected to the hose, during a thirty minute dry it comes out at least five or six times. So annoying.",2.0
"Already broken, tube doesn't want to stay locked in place. Struggled to keep it in, now broken.  Very loud machine, not discreet at all.",2.0
Hose tore during first use.  Had to return.,2.0
The hose would not stay connected,2.0
"The dryer seems great but the bonnet is defective, the part where the hose attaches just fell off while I wad using it. I'd recommend a better constructed bonnet.",2.0
"I don't particularly like it, but since I purchased it, I will use it for awhile. I'm going to replace it!  It's so very NOISY!!  It makes this awful noise when drying my hair.  I don't care for the bonnet on it either; the bonnet has too many holes in it and the air doesn't circulate well inside the bonnet .  I would not purchase it again nor would I recommend it to anyone.",2.0
Worked great for a year.  Then the bonnet stretched so that the hose would not say in.  I don't  believe I will try a Hot Tools product again the future.,2.0
"i read several comments on this product. several were very negative on this product,but i thought that i'd give it a try anyway.was i ever wrong. even on the lowest setting it was too hot.the tubing won't stay on. i would certainly not recommend it to anyone.",2.0
"I have owned a hot tools hair dryer -  model 30001 -  but could no longer use it because the bonnet attachment to the hose broke.  I was very happy with this hair dryer and therefore expected the same results from a newer hot tools hair dryer.
However -  the thermostat setting is too too hot..  I cannot use it at all on high  setting and barely on the middle setting -  I have  managed to ""get the job done"" by starting on the middle setting as long as I can stand it and then switching to the cool setting  and then manually pulling  the bonnet to a peak over my curlers.  My Model 30001 had five heat settings.

In addition to this the new dryer is very nosy - almost has a whistle to it.  The bonnet is heavier and not as flexible.
In short - I am not happy with the new dryer - do you have another model with more heat settings?

A problem with both models -  the hose easily becomes detached from the bonnet while in the process of drying.",2.0
"I don't know if my unit is ""ionic"" but it's by Hot Tools and looks almost identical. Like others have stated in their reviews--the front of the bonnet hardly gets any hot air; so there is an uneven distribution of heat. The hose will no longer connect properly to the bonnet. The bonnet detached from the round piece of plastic where the hose attaches. But even before this happened it was always a struggle to fit the hose in and it always fell out easily.  This entire unit is poorly designed and awkward to use. The settings are on a black dial with tiny raised letters that I can barely see; and the dial is on the opposite end of the unit from where the hose comes out; so I have to pick it up and turn it on it's end to see or change settings.

I've used packing tape to re-attach bonnet to plastic hose receiver and used a silver pen to color over the settings so they're more visible. Then I just fiddle with the hose to get it to fit and try to sit extremely still so it doesn't fall out. But obviously, this is a lot of rigamarole to go through and should not be necessary! And the results are mediocre at best. So, I came on Amazon looking to replace this disappointing piece of garbage; but it appears that there aren't any other brands that deliver satisfying results either. So--manufacturers out there, if you're reading--there's obviously a huge void to be filled here! Can anyone produce anything efficient, intelligently designed, and of decent quality that lasts anymore? And would you mind making it in the USA?",2.0
"Despite rotating the hose until it clicked solidly in the bonnet, the hose constantly fell off when I tried to use it. To reattach, you have to remove the bonnet from your head, and redo the connection.  Very annoying.  Heat:  Even the ""Low"" setting is very hot.  I had to turn it down repeatedly to the cooler setting, then when it lost the heat, turn the control back up to the low setting. Not a good design.",2.0
It worked Ok in the first 5 uses and the it just fell apart till it died. When working heat in the bonnet was not equally distributed.,2.0
"I bought this dryer as a temporary dryer until I can afford to mount a professional dryer from the ceiling. Anyway, this dryer is HOT. So HOT that children shouldn't use it. I have to put a big thick towel around my neck otherwise I get burned. It's LOUD and the hose does keep falling out. Other than that, it's OK. I'm just trying to hold on until I can get rid of it.",2.0
"I've been looking for a new dryer with a soft bonnet after my last Vidal Sasson dryer broke.  This dryer gets very hot on the middle setting but doesn't dry very well. The low setting while cooler doesn't dry your hair. I  thought the exessive heat would make your hair  dry in half the time but it doesn't. This dryer also makes loud straining noises, which I am hoping doesn't mean the motor is about to quit.

My old dryer is no longer being manufactured and this was the only alternative I could find. What can you do.",2.0
"After 3 uses, the bonnet ripped away from the where the air hose attaches.  I sent an e-mail and called company's 800 number and got NO response.  It also leaks hot air where the hose attaches to unit.  I would not recommend this product.",2.0
"This would be a great iron if the clamp that clutches your hair was tighter and also seem
To heat up only to 210 , not enough for coarse hair,",2.0
"Terrible!  Plugged in the product & got nothing! Had the same iron for 5 years, best one I ever owned. Got really hot & lasted a long time so that's why I was shocked to find that the new one was such a piece of junk! I purchased my previous one from a hair dresser. One thing I will have to add about this experience. ..the return was fast & easy.",2.0
"I bought another GO that was blue for a bit more and it heated fine, still a bit too long. Not worth the price of return. will have to make due for now. I also bought the travel chi (I thought it was made by FHI  too?) from QVC but it was sold in a set and I did not want both. The new chi travel with new the plates and colors was great! Perfect size and heating with dual voltage. Please sell alone !!!",2.0
"I bought it because  love my fhi runway flat iron and I had an amazon gift card worth 50 bucks. Unfortunately this curling iron doesn't properly grip the hair for a proper curl. The tip to the middle of the clamp, clamps fine but them middle  to the bottom of the clamp will allow the hair to slip right out. So if your hair is medium to short(shoulder or shorter this mightn't bother you.  However for those of us with long hair an need the full barrel to curl the full strand in a time efficient manner this is a problem.  I have modified the way I use it. I wrap my hair around it like a curling wand so  its not a total waste of money. When I get a chance I plan to take it somewhere and pay someone to remove the clamp.  So it really becomes a wand or tighten the clamp so its a better curling iron.

***Oh yeah it does go up to 210 Celsius which is 410 fahrenheit.  I read the instructions for how to switch the display form celsius to fahrenheit but never found that feature.",2.0
"This is my second solano.  This one doesn't seem to have the HEAT my previous one had.  The control switches are in direct line of achieving a firm grip on the rather heavy appliance,therefore, I tend to change settings by mistake.  I wouldn't buy this one again, Sorry.",2.0
I used to love this dryer. Last two broke within 7 or 8 months.,2.0
"Bought this for my wife 2 years ago and it quit working just a few weeks after the warranty ended.. It blew like crazy but obviously not reliable. Now if I want to repair it, I have to send it in to Solano in Atlanta, Georgia..pay shipping to their repair shop and write a check for 30.00. Given how much it was used and what I paid for it, this isn't acceptable. Just not happy with the product.",2.0
I had one of these that was several years old and broke.  Then ordered this new one.  Product quality just isn't the same.  Doesn't blow hard with good force like the older model.  Feels lighter too.  Its as if product quality has gone down and in the newer models--must be more plastic and a lower quality motor.  Very disappointing for the price.,2.0
Plug broke after 2 years. Otherwise it was great. Very powerful.,2.0
"I when I first plugged this hair dryer in it was making these horrible screeching noises! Immediately repackaged it and sent it back for a new one. The 2nd one came in great, I absolutely loved it. Dryed my hair quickly with no frizz. Unfortunately it fell from my counter top into my bathroom sink and those horrible screeches started again. I was so upset, I feel for the money I spent this Dryer should be way more durable than that. I will not recommend this product to anyone. I only had the 2nd dryer for 3months.....",2.0
My wife used it for about 15 seconds and decided that she didn't like it not enough volume of air flow,2.0
"Note from a hairstylist.  I've tried many driers over the years and I randomly like to try new ones just to make sure what I'm using is still relevant.

As a solano lover since I began doing hair, I was excited to try something different than my usual (Super Solano.)  This one looked promising, even though the differences between Solano driers aren't very clearly depicted.  <They all seem to have the exact same features, nothing drastically different between their other models.>

Let me just say I wanted to love this, yet it was returned three days after I received it.  I was thinking something was different, but when a client mentioned: ""wow... is this a new dryer?  It's barely blowing anything..."" I immediately unplugged it and switched back to the super solano.

Long story longer: I could probably wave two leaves at someone's hair and have it dry quicker.  No thanks.  Super solano is..... well, super!",2.0
"I had another Solano blow dyer for at least 10 years that I purchased from my hair stylist and loved it,until it recently died.  That model had a reostat knob on it to better control the speed. That model is no longer made so I bought this one. Solano dryers are typically heavy, as this one is. Excellent quality and easy to remove filter screen. One big draw back is, when set on ""hot"" and ""low"" speed, it isn't hot enough to dry and straighten my hair, and I have fine/wavy hair that's easy to straighten. I have to turn it on high speed and the ""hot""setting....that's 1875 watts!!....way too much. My hair gets fried pretty fast now... I'm shopping for a different dryer.",2.0
"I suggest that you change the photo when selling this item.

The metal piece is crucial for hair straightening. I was disappointed :(",2.0
"I purchased this hair dryer for my wife after she used her sisters dryer that looked very similar but had a different manufacturer name. After my wife received it and used it a few time she told me that it was too heavy and that the side mounted control buttons were not in a convenient placement for holding. It does get very hot and has a lot of air flow. Bottom line,she does not like it!",2.0
Very disappointed with the controls having been changed from all the previous Solanos I've had. Was very awkward for me to use and I returned it.,2.0
"This blow dryer is quieter than others, but heavy and bulky to use.

The worst is that it sparked & quit on me only a few mos. after I got it; should be under warranty, but what a hassle. Too expensive for that!",2.0
"Drys fast, but I have very thick coarse hair. First time I spent so much on a dryer and thought it would help with the frizz. It actually didn't do anything for frizz at all. And now that it only blows cold air after having it for 3 years, I went back to my cheep dryer and found less frizz using it. Only difference is cheepy takes a little longer to dry.  Save your money or go with something else. Just bought sedu revolution. We'll see",2.0
Bought my first from the local beauty Salon Supply.  It last about 14 months started intermittently not heating then quit heating altogether.  Bought the second one here exactly 13 months ago.  Same thing started intermittently not heating about a week ago and now no heat.  If you want an excellent hair dryer and are willing to pay $100 per year...  I am going back to the $20 dryer that lasted 2+ years.,2.0
"Agree with the other reviews posted. Heating element broke approximately 1 year and 4 months after purchase. Not worth it for the high price. Previously purchased a CHI hair dryer that lasted 5 years! Wish I had read these reviews prior to purchase. Recently had a CHI straightener also die after less than one year of use. Used to love CHI products, but am now considering switching to another brand entirely. Too bad.",2.0
I have enjoyed the Chi brand hair dryers for several years but it seems the elements tend to burn out early. The last two Ultra Chi hair dryer elements have failed early. The first one at 13 months and the second one at 8 months. Not gonna bother with the warranty procedure. I am giving another brand a chance to shine.,2.0
"I've had this hair dryer for a little less than two years & the heating element went out on it. You'd think for the price and the name it would last longer than my cheapy hair dryer I use in the other bathroom. Amazing, isn't it? The blow dryer started spitting sparks, so I turned it off and checked it over. When I turned it back on, it only blew cold air. Very frustrating. Guess you DON'T get what you pay for in this instance....",2.0
"I am a professional and used this blow dryer for a year.  There were a few pro's: 1. It was quiet, I could talk to clients while I dried their hair  2. The attatchments included with the dryer were decent  3. Nice and light weight.  However its con's exceed its pro's: 1. On/Off switch placed in a spot that caused me to accidently turn the dryer off while drying  2. Air would turn cool if dryer was placed directly onto the brush while drying  3. Drying time increased by at least 20 minutes per client because of low air flow  4. Absolutely NO power!  Being a hair stylist, I wouldn't bother using this dryer on my own hair (and never have).  The drying time is so horrible it would take a half hour opposed to 10 minutes to dry my hair (long, mid-back length).  Mix drying time in with humidity and you will for sure have a disaster.  To end this review, I hated the dryer. The only time I would suggest this is with FINE short hair or curly hair that you do not wish to have dried, but only partially diffused (because of the gential air flow- friz is not too bad, but good luck drying your hair all the way!)  If you are on the market for a professional blow dryer I suggest a Sedu or FHI.",2.0
"Nice in that it is very quiet and doesn't burn my hair.  However, I've had two in the past 3 years and they both did the same thing - stopped blowing hot air.  I will never waste this much money again on a dryer.",2.0
"It looks great and it works great when it works.  The first two times it was used it worked great.  On the third attempt to use the dryer it would not turn on.  The GFCI appeared to be working correctly as it would trip when the test button was pushed but resetting it did not help.  The dryer was completely dead.  I am returning it for a refund.  This dryer is way over priced for this kind of quality (lack of quality)!

Update: September 08, 2011
I purchased a replacement for the first dryer that failed and it has been working fine for 3 weeks nows.  I did purchase it from a different vendor but that should not make a difference.  I raised my rating from 1 to 3 stars since the second unit is working fine.

Update: January 04, 2012
After 4 months the replacement dryer is failing.  The cold air button quit working so that you could not press it to cut off the heat.  Then it changed so that the cold air button had to be pressed for hot air.  This keeps changing all of the time so it is probably just a matter of time before it fails completely.  I also found out that the 1 year warranty is only valid if you purchase from a hair salon which is an authorized dealer.  I don't have much hope for a warranty replacement but I will see.  I am dropping the rating from 3 to 2 stars.",2.0
I heard so much about Chi and I decided to pay the extra dollars for it. I t worked fine for the first year and then one day sort of exploded while I was holding it. So as you can imagine- I don't use it anymore and will not buy Chi I guess since I've read similar stories even about their 1 inch flat iron. Too bad- you'd think Chi would deal with their problems given the frequency of very similar experiences. Thank you for people writing about these problems though.,2.0
I have purchased 2 of these hairdryers now and experienced same result with both dryers.  After 18 months or so the heater cores went and they only blew cold air.  Definitely not a good long term investment as I found out twice.,2.0
"This Chi\Farouk professional hair dryer is of Uniquely Superior design. As such, it is a favorite among higher tier salon hair stylists--when they can get a well assembled, working unit.

Recently, stylists have had difficulty getting this model from professional beauty suppliers. When they are available, this model runs from $134 to $149. You can get one off eBay for $65 to $80 plus shipping. You can buy one here at Amazon for $94 and free shipping. You take a huge risk buying one from an eBay seller.

I say huge risk for Two Reasons. Chi got good quality build from Korea. About two years ago they switched to China, which proved a nightmare for retailers, & for buyers. The quality was random. Chi\Farouk may have talented engineers but marketing needs some basic ethics training. They flooded the market with the shabby made in China  hair dryers but carefully protected Chi's high profit margin by doing something shady. Their one year warranty is good ONLY for units purchased from AUTHORIZED retailers. Most buyers do not know this until they get a defective unit.

In the fine print, Chi informs buyers of this and lists the narrow category of retailers they license to sell Chi hair dryers, specifically professional beauty suppliers and select hair salons! Yet, they liberally market & sell them to any retailer who wants to sell them, pass on their official marketing photos and advertising pitch and warranty, minus any mention about limiting warranty to only units purchased from authorized sellers!! Fly-by-night is the word for this scam.

I knew the risk of getting a made in China unit from Amazon but I also know Amazon's stand up refund and exchange policy. My wife & her hair stylists needed new dryers as their 2.5 to 3 year old Korea made dryers were dying. They were using retired backup Chi units.

I ordered one from Amazon, kept the box & packing material. The initial test went well. An hour into the first work day, the unit began making a strange noise and the blower began blowing too hard. The professionals know that a Chi dryer that does that will breakdown within 30 days. When the beauty supply rep stopped by, he listened to it and agreed. ""Send it back."" We repacked it. I got a return for refund label online and dropped it off at a UPS store. Amazon paid return shipping.

Its like this. If I knew a product buyer at Amazon. Com, I would advise the company to return all these made in China Chi dryers for a refund. The quality control average is low enough on these China made dryers that Amazon stands to lose a lot of money on them. In effect, their return policy & Chi's gymnastic warranty leaves Amazon the de facto warrant-or of these hit & miss assembled hair dryers.

Soon, USA made Chi/Farouk dryers will be available. We are waiting to buy them.

If you decide to risk buying one be sure to buy from Amazon. Be warned that Amazon's liberal return policy is good for 30 days. Make sure you read it carefully and follow it to the letter from the moment you receive your dryer. You also need to be aware that many of the China made dryers work fine for ONE to THREE months before failing.

SIDE NOTE: This dryer came poorly packed, an issue I have heard from other Amazon customers. One told me of a $300 camera he received this year. The manufacturer's retail box was simply tossed completely loose into a significantly bigger Amazon box. Our dryer came with just one short air pillow strip on ONE END, leaving the box free to rattle. Fortunately, Amazon doesn't ship via guerrilla mail. Past experience as an Inventory Control officer tells me Amazon may have serious labor problems (of the negative attitude type) at their warehouse(s). Its wise to check packing. If it's loose, examine the product closely.",2.0
"I bought this hair dryer for a Christmes present. It stopped working last week. It started making noise, then smoking, then it quit. It has a 1 year warranty. I need to know how to return it for a replacement.

Thanks, Kelly Keels",2.0
"I bought this hair dryer about 18 months ago and within a year's time, the hair dryer started to give intermittent heat, which is very frustrating. It would emit heat and then switch automatically to cool hair while I just waited to switch back, very poor quality and very disappointing.  On top of that, the diffuser attachment would not stay on!  Farouk will not stand behind their product if you bought it anywhere on the internet, which is unfortunate because it's still their product and should have some means of satifying customers.  Most of the reviews for this hair dryer are consistent to this and maybe one or two get lucky and don't have problems, but if you're spending $100 on a hair dryer, you don't rely on luck!  This product just doesn't deliver!  I would not recommend this product, it is not reliable, poor quality and not worth it.  Try the T3 Featherweight or the T3 Evolution, they are more costly, but if you are serious about your hair dryers and want something that will last, try one of the T3's, but do NOT buy the CHI Farouk products.

This is a CLEAR polish with green glitter. I was thought it was going to be green polish with glitter,2.0

"This polish didn't go on with complete coverage with the first stroke, like other opi polishes.",2.0
This color looked like such a great shade but honestly I just didn't like it. The paint is very streaky and smells strong of alchohol. And the color was just not flattering. Really regret purchasing this item.,2.0
Color was what I wanted and was perfect. I used a non OPI base coat and my nails got stained an off yellow color for months requiring me to have my nails painted constantly because they looked gross. I'm not sure the opi brand base coat would made a difference or not.,2.0

"I was so excited to see this color available that I ordered it without reading the reviews.  It arrived, and I immediately noticed something off about it when I unwrapped the bottle.  It is very runny and seems to be thinned out.  Maybe this is the way the polish was intended, but it isn't like any other OPI glitter polish I've used, and that includes several from the Muppets line.",2.0
This color was clearly blue. Not like the picture at all. I like it...but it wasn't what I wanted at all.,2.0

"I was impressed with the texture and pattern of the Navy Shatter, so I purchased this color, loving how it looked in the bottle. Well, this DOESN'T SHATTER. It took me several tries of removing polish and reapplying it (a big waste of polish and time) to get the effect I wanted. I found that I had to use very little of it to get it to shatter and even then, it barely had a pattern.

VERY disappointed. I would never have expected this from a well known brand like OPI.",2.0
Really disappointing. It would have taken at least 5 coats to get full coverage. It's a little cheap looking--I'm very bummed.,2.0
"I was convinced that I was going to love ""Fresh Frog of Belair"" because I love Kermit and I love OPI. I was sorely disappointed. I had used ""Gone Gonzo"" and apart from its difficulty of removal I did think that it was a pretty color, but even though this is the ""same"" line, the formula is not similar enough to make this a great polish.

Like ""Gone Gonzo,"" ""Fresh Frog of Belair"" is a clear polish with green microglitter and large silver glitter in it. It took SEVEN coats of this polish to cover my nails, and the coverage is still not good. It looks like a cheap drugstore polish and does not cover the edges of my nail or the tips. It looks like I have been digging in gravel and the manicure is brand new. Like other OPI polishes that have this large silver glitter, the ends of my nails were sharp enough to score glass and I had to file them after they were polished. I had to use two coats of Seche Vite topcoat to make the polish smooth enough not to catch on denim, and these NINE layers of polish will take a full thirty minutes to remove, even when using pure acetone.

The color of the microglitter is a bright, leafy green. The glitter is the same color that you can get in the cheap glitter for arts and crafts that you buy at the grocery store. It is not a deep green, has a yellow undertone, and the silver glitter all but disappears and looks like clear spots in the polish. My boyfriend was not impressed.

I don't recommend this color. ""Gone Gonzo"" and ""Gettin' Miss Piggy With It"" would be better options from the Muppets collection. There are far better greens available from OPI.",2.0

It also smudges easily; don't count on it to last throughout the day. I really wanted to like this, but I won't be repurchasing and would not recommend.  Bummer!",2.0
"I bought this specifically to use on my waterline to make my eyes appear a bit wider. When I first tried it on, I was impressed by how pigmented and creamy it was - except I had applied it with a heavy hand, so I had to blend it out (off) a bit. It turns out I like it better blended out because the color is too bright for my taste (I have a medium tan complexion). However, after several minutes and, presumably, a lot of blinking, I noticed that the color had faded out even more. I don't think I have extraordinarily watery eyes, by the way.

I used it again the next day, this time careful with how I applied it. I manage to put it on not as heavily as the first time, and it didn't get blinked off as fast the first time either. I went about my day as usual and checked it after several hours, and I was left with but a hint of color on my waterline.

I admit I'd rather find something for my waterline that isn't as bright, but if it turns out there's nothing out there that's more suited to my skin tone, I still wouldn't buy this because of its rather disappointing staying power.",2.0

Great coverage but... Its kind of cakey and is hard to make look natural and it very thick so its just okay I won't buy again but it is very moisturizing,2.0
I don't know what I was expecting but it was not this.  It's ok just not as great as I hoped.  I honestly reach for my covergirl/olay concealer more than this one and think it does a better job.,2.0
"Product is very drying on the delicate under eye area .  Ironic that it's  suppose to be a  anti wrinkle product  , it made my  creases look worse and did nothing to help cover under-eye circles . Would never purchase this item again .
Fast shipping , good service from seller .",2.0
rated this product because it doesnt work that great..the yellow concealer my physicans formula works well and cheaper..would not recommend,2.0
"I had high expectations for this concealer given the great reviews and high price tag. I ordered light but realized that was not light enough - this has a bit of pinkish/brown tones and is a bit heavy for my pale complexion with red undertones. I did find even with the color difference, it blended well. Anyways, my undereye circles have become more and more prominant and figured this would do the trick. Even after applying two layers with a brush, this was no better than store concealers. I've been sticking with Neutrogena 3 in 1 and Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Erase Dark Cirles. The combination of both (yes, I need layers and layers) tends to do the trick for now until I can come across something that is better.",2.0
"this concealer is quite cakey when applied under the eye i do love the color it matched me well if only i can figure out how to make it work for me so its not cakey and looks smooth, it can only be applied under the eyes though cause if i apply it anywhere else on the face i grow a pimple on that spot",2.0
"When I read the description for this product and all the wonderful reviews, I thought I finally found my dream concealer! But I was wrong... It covered fairly well and looked good at first but it ended up settling into my fine lines soon after. Exactly what it's not supposed to do! Even after I tried setting it with powder it still ended up creasing just not as bad. As the day went by it looked cakey...

I'm only 23 but have dark circles and fine lines and this product does not do the job. Don't believe the hype.",2.0
"I tried this because my roommate raved about it, so I tried it because I naturally have very dark bags under my eyes.  Unfortunately I found this product way too this to cover the darkness under my eyes.",2.0
"I just recently started noticing my eyes getting darker underneath. I don't know if it's due to stress, age, lack of sleep or a little bit of everything. So, I started researching the best cover ups cause the cover girl concealer stick was not working at all anymore. Found this product with pretty good reviews. Decided to try it even though it was expensive only cause I had a amazon gift card. When I opened it at first I thought omigod it's tiny for $18. I really didn't think it would be that small; it's like the size of a half dollar, maybe smaller and only an inch high. Anyway I am not that pleased with the results. I wouldn't even consider my eyes that dark yet just dark enough to bother me. But I use this concealer and my old cover girl stick concealer in order to get coverage that I am ok with for now. I don't think I would purchase this product again only cause it was expensive and works just ok. It was worth it for the $3 after my coupon though. :)",2.0
"I usually wear Ivory in several brands (everyday minerals, revlon, cover girl, maybelline), but the Lighter Than Light color was much too dark. Sadly, I had to send it back.",2.0
"It's cakey, not so easy to blend, needs to be reapplied throughout the day, and doesn't match many of my friends' skin tones (we have varied skin tones)",2.0
"It was easy to apply and the right color, but didn't do one thing to conceal my under eye circles... Worthless as a dark circle concealer.  Have tried so many dark circle concealers over the years and have yet to find one that actually works... :(",2.0
"Unless you already know the shade of this product that you want, I would recommend purchasing at a bricks-and-mortar store so you can try it out first. Way too expensive a product to experiment and get the wrong color. I am very fair, and purchased Shade B, but it was way too light and too yellow. Seems to cover well, but that's a moot point if the color is wrong. I buy almost everything on Amazon, but I regret this purchase.",2.0
"Saw this in a fashion magazine...and thought wow that bottle looks cool. The name Euphoria very different for a perfume.

Sampled it...didn't like it at all.

Gave me a headache! Too woodsy, strong from the minute I sprayed it on. Several hours later still strong...Finally I took a shower and tried to get this scent off of me.

If you like strong, bold, woodsy scents like Opium or Aromatics Elixir by Clinique...then you'll love this.

If you don't like strong scents please don't buy this it will save yourself some money and a headache!

Only reason I gave it a 2 was again...because of the bottle and the name.",2.0
Scent is not sticking and seems almost watered down,2.0
"This is NOT the same as the tester at Ulta.
I gave it away.",2.0
$88.00 is way too expensive.  Walmart has it for $45.00,2.0
I purchased this product with the belief that is was real original. I recently found the same product in store on sale so i purchased to compare. This product is not as strong or last as long as the store bought one. Very disappointed in the results.,2.0
Mine didn't smell like the real thing. I think it was a fake or a bad batch. I gave it away.,2.0
"Thought this was priced well.  But the product is not the same as I have purchased in a store.  Everything looks the same, but there is very little fragrance.  I've worn this fragrance for years and it is NOT the same.",2.0
"Why does this smell exactly like calvin klein obsession? Had the tester smelled like this I would not have ordered it because I am allergic to obsession, and I can smell/taste this in the back of my throat...fail.",2.0
"I get compliments every time I wear the original purfume!  It was literally half the price as the department stores, but thats probablly because it was a knock off and watered down. I went to the dept store and bought a smaller size and I could tell the difference.",2.0
The lotion is fantastic but using it makes you smell like an old man.  My wife and sister both commented on the terrible scent.  Sadly I had to give the lotion away it was so bad.,2.0
Really like Jack Black products. This was a special gift for my husband. However the bottle arrived with a broken pump. This makes it difficult to get the lotion out of the bottle. There was very minimal packing in the box.,2.0
"Warning, Amazon is seeking counterfeit products... again.

1) The product felt and smelled different than the other bottles of the same lotion I've used over the past 4 years.  2) Looking on the bottle, the ingredient list is different than what is on Jack Black's website and THIS AMAZON PRODUCT PAGE.  3) No problem, I'll just return the high dollar lotion. Nope!  Amazon says that even though they sold me a counterfeit product, they will not take it back. 4) Even if that was a policy, nowhere on the product page does it say that this lotion cannot be returned.

TLDR - Amazon took my money and sold me a fake product, see the photos.  Old bottle on the right which matches Jack Black website in the middle and the new bottle on the left with different ingredients.",2.0
Disappointed by the smell. Smells too strong... The smell irritates my nose. Couldn't return it either.,2.0
"Didn't moisturize, too light.",2.0
Jack Black products are usually of good quality. The lotion is pleasant and non greasy with a eucalyptussy scent and feel.  Unfortunately the spout broke off after about 2 uses. It still functions if I set it on just right.,2.0
scent too strong,2.0
"This product is very watery (thin) and doesn't moisturize very well. Because of this, fortunately, it's not very greasy, but still, I expected a richer lotion. Another problem is it stinks like cologne. If I want to stink like cologne I'll spray some on. They should tone that down.",2.0
"The fragrance in the bottle I received is overpowering, and difficult to remove, even with soap. It's not a displeasing smell, and the lotion works well, but the fragrance is very strong.  If you prefer a fragrance-free environment, this product is not for you.  If you don't like it when people around you wear an invasive fragrance, you would not like this product because it would make you one of those people.",2.0
"I bought this online despite its high price point because it advertises natural ingredients and some reviews state you don't need a lot of it for each application.
My own experience is that you need more like a dime sphere than coin to have enough to spread after shaving. Even then, my skin still feels irritated and not smoothed much.
Looking closer at the ingredient list on the bottle, you also find a whole lot more than the 3 advertised ""natural ingredients"", the 2nd ingredient being PEG-8...
Overall, it's quite expensive and not nearly as ""natural"" as marketed, so not worth the price imho.",2.0
"I love love love the Jack Black Shaving Cream, but this ""cooling gel"" needs improvement.  It doesn't smell very good and leaves my face feeling sticky.",2.0
Way overpriced. It has a pleasant scent but it's sticky. Lose the aloe. There are better cooling gels out there.,2.0
"Not a bad product but just don't like the way my skin feels after I apply it.  My face feels sticky for several hours after I use it, regardless of how much or how little I use.  Like it never really dries or absorbs into the skin so it just sits on the surface of the skin for hours and feels tacky.",2.0
"Always on the lookout for a great razor burn treatment, I decided to give Jack Black a whirl--I found that I have used better and more soothing products than this one.",2.0
I have super senstive skin for a white dude.  This stuff doesn't really seem to do much for razor burn considering its high price :-/.  Two stars for the fact that it smells good.,2.0
"Small travel size. Works OK, but for the money there are better products available. I was planning on purchasing other ""Jack"" products, but will reconsider that plan.",2.0
"I should have listened to the reviewers comments about  the sticky substance.  This stuff doesn't absorb into the skin, it
feels like you varnished your face.  It doesn't feel refreshing it feels as though you put a thin coat mask on your face.  Also,
it doesn't even smell good.  Smells like some type of industrial bug killer.

I am very familiar with after shaves, face creams, all sorts of shaving products,  believe me I am sorry that I wasted 20
bucks or so on this product.  Don't believe me?, order some.

Yes your face will feel smooth, like you have a slick sealant on your face.  No, it doesn't cool or clam your skin, it coats
it.

P.S.  If you want a refreshing cooling great citrus scent, absorbs into the skin with no oily or sticky film and heals nicks,
scraps, razor burn, order some; Lucky Tiger After Shave and Face Tonic, it is amazing.  I just thought I would try this product
that I just reviewed.  Now, I know...",2.0
"I like JB products and am a big fan of the Dragon Ice, so I tried one of these. I have older, sensitive, dry skin. A pea sized dab massaged across my face resolved nothing and felt like sticky film nearly all day. A few days later I tried a bigger coin-sized glob and massaged it across my entire face with the same results. Sticky, tacky feeling all day! I elected to wash it off several hours later and had slimy feeling which dissolved with more water. Apparently, my skin is not absorbing this stuff like it does the Nivea/Neutrogena types. The JB gel smells okay and feels okay gong on, but I will not be continuing its use.",2.0
"I have sensitive skin. I like to use a balm after shaving. When I use this, my neck gets really red. Could be just me. YMMV.",2.0
"I've had red bumps on my arms all my life, and I've tried a handful of remedies for it.  Mostly I just live with it and try not to be self-conscious about it.  But, I decided to give this one a shot after purchasing a strapless wedding gown.  Shortly after I started using it, a couple people commented that my arms looked better.  But, I honestly can't tell any difference.  After using it every day for 4 months, my supply has run out, and I don't think I'll purchase it again.  I'll just get some make-up for my arms on my big day.",2.0
"The product works fine on my skin or hair, but I can't stand to be around myself after using it. It smells like my grandmother's cheap perfume. Really, it's awful. I've polled other people and they all hate the smell.",2.0
"I don't think this is for me. The smell is HORRENDOUS in my opinion. It smells like the worst old lady perfume, like White Diamonds. I don't feel like returning it so I'm going to give it to my mom.",2.0
Loved the way it makes your skin soft but I don't like the strong smell so I hardly use it.,2.0
Very strong neroli  and ylang ylang smell.  I returned it - did not appreciate the scent.,2.0
needs a lot of time to see the esult,2.0
"Absolutely did nothing. I'm a fan of oils and have tried many. This one caused a slight breakout on my face. I didn't find it particularly moisturizing or effective in any way. Used it on my body instead, just for the fragrance.",2.0
"Nothing special, not worth the price. The spray gets clogged easily, leaks. Won't buy again.",2.0
smell is too strong can not use it,2.0
cannot get passed the strong 'old lady' floral smell and it hangs around for awhile!!!,2.0
"I was so excited to try this product as the French truly know skincare. I rubbed it on my hands and within 5 minutes noticed that they were softer and silkier than ever before. It really works. However, I couldn't get past the overpowering smell. It gave me a migraine. I've read many reviews here that say the smell dissipates within 20-30 minutes. Not so. I waited a couple of hours and the smell was very strong -- and I on only put the oil my hands. I had to rub lemons on my hands and wash them several times before I could get the smell off. It's an amazing product though. It's too bad it isn't available unscented.",2.0
"I love almost everything about this stuff.  However, the exfoliant beads that feel like sand appear to be made from plastic, according to the ingredient list.  No I feel like I am littering every time I wash my face.  I'll be looking for a new face cleaner.  It's too bad, because I liked this  stuff so much.",2.0
Not for me,2.0
"I have been using this scrub for years, and found it the best product for exfoliating and setting up my beard for shaving. For some unknown reason, the company abandoned their formula and replaced menthol with peppermint. In the process of doing that, they changed the consistency of the particles that were the source of exfoliation. The new formula no longer feels like a scrub, more like a regular soap, and it isn't a useful pre-shave product.  I am now searching for a replacement product. Too bad they couldn't leave well enough alone.",2.0
Surprised and disappointed they removed the menthol.  Menthol does amazing things for my skin. I will not be buying a third bottle.,2.0
"This is no longer the original formulation. Somewhere between the end of 2016 and start of 2017, Jack Black changed this product. If you liked the crisp menthol scent and the dense, gritty, scrub of the previous version, you'll not find it here. The exfoliant has changed from what I assume was silica (sand, basically) to bamboo and requires much more time and effort to get a similar level of exfoliation. It also, as some have commented, feels a bit like putting gritty toothpaste on your face because of the minty scent and new texture.

It's not an awful product, it's just no longer the product I was willing to pay extra for because it stood out after years of trying alternatives as the BEST facial scrub I had found. If this formulation is what Jack Black wants to use going forward I can't recommend this product any longer. There are cheaper, better, alternatives to THIS specific formula.

To Jack Black - Bring back the original formula or I'll be moving on. This version just isn't good enough for what you charge. You'll get a few more purchases out of me while I search for something new, but I'm definitely looking. Based on other reviews I've seen, I'm not the only one.",2.0
"Jack Black changed this product recently.  Used to be with Vitamin C and Menthol, now it is Vitamin C and peppermint.  I liked the menthol cooling feel of the original version.  New formulation does not not clean my face as well as the old version.  I discontinued using this product mainly for that reason.  Too bad, really liked the old version.",2.0
Pretty sad that the consistency of the face wash feels more like lotion then it does like bead (how it used to).,2.0
Decent product but should be half the cost,2.0
"This product smelled great and I've had success with other Jack Black products.  Unfortunately, this scrub inflamed by razor burn instead of soothing it.

 I've found a non-soap based face wash followed by a wash cloth, for exfoliation, then shave oil, then shave soap, lathered with a badger hair brush, minimizes my  razor rritation.  I keep the force to a minimum; from face wash to shave.",2.0
I think the product may be past its date. Seems clumpy and odd when I opened the lid.,2.0
It is cooling however I do not believe I have used the product long enough to see a difference.,2.0
"I have only been using this product for about 3 weeks. I use it morning and evening. I did feel a cooling sensation after application, but as far as making dark circles disappear, it has not, so far. And I still have the same amount of wrinkles as when I started. Time will tell. I will continue to use it til its gone, but probablly will not buy again, unless I have significant change in my eye appearance. I am 56 years old, so maybe I am expecting too much.",2.0
This color was fine as a bright alternative to my usual look.  It goes on paler than in the pan and is a great color for fuschia lipsticks. But it streaked like crazy on me.  I also hated the packaging.  Somehow the compact is really hard to open.  Not a keeper.,2.0
Arrived without a cap so I'm fearful it's a knock off,2.0
"I received several weeks ago: 1, the product came without cap, with only a tape to seal the nozzle,  it looked like a used one, not brand new. 2. It used to be my favorite styling gel, but I didn't work the way it used to do. 3. I subscribed it to expect receive it every two months, but I canceled it.",2.0
I have very fine and thin hair.  This product doesn't work well on my hair.,2.0
Didn't give me smooth waves at all,2.0
Nope,2.0
Helped smooth hair but nothing too great for the price. Way too expensive.,2.0
Just makes my hair feel greasy.,2.0
Great marketing ploy.  Didn't really feel like it did anything.  I wouldnt buy it again or reccomend anyone to buy it.,2.0
"They have changed their formula! When I bought my last bottle, I noticed the color had changed from a light gold to clear and didn't think much of it. But it doesn't work as well. The ingredient list is different too. After blow drying, my hair doesn't feel as soft. It works ok, but not nearly as awesome as it was and definitely NOT worth the price now. So sad.",2.0
Low stars for expensiveness. This stuff is WAY expensive. Not just on Amazon - everywhere. Not sure it's worth it.,2.0
Not very happy with this product. It made my hair greasy. To be fair I do have very thin hair so this product would be better for someone who has thicker hair.,2.0
Nothing special it Dru's hair out,2.0
"I believe this is fake.  It works okay, but the real product works much better.  This product is clear, rather than having a slight yellowish tint like the real stuff.  It is also a thinner formula and doesn't have the distinct cologne smell that the real product has.",2.0
I suspect that this is a diluted or fake product.  I have not used CHI silk infusion from the salon in years but this product is thin & clear.  I remember the original being amber colored and much thicker.  It smells the same but another red flag was the new paper barcode placed over the old one.  I tried to scan it with my Makeup Alley app and it was not recognized.  I gave it two stars because it does help with the frizz and tangles but don't expect the salon quality.,2.0
"I got a counterfeit product. The real Chi Silk formula is clear, the one I got was the color of Vegetable Oil. I wouldnt be surprised if it was half authentic/half vegetable oil. My forehead broke out in zits after using this. It usually never does with this stuff when I purchase from a store.",2.0
I have been using this product for years and its always had a yellowish tint to it.  This particular products is clear and thinner that usual.  Also the fragrance is not as strong.  Dont think its the real CHI product.  Will try and return.,2.0
My hair was in no way silky after using it.  It had a straw-like feel.  I plan to return it.,2.0
I've been using Chi Silk Infusion for 5+ years and continue to do so because it works great and smells amazing. This bottle barely had a scent at all telling me it's shelf life has probably expired. I definitely won't be purchasing this at amazon.com again. :(,2.0
"THE SERUM WAS LIKE GOLDEN YELLOW AND SPELLED LIKE, ONE OF THOSE CHEAP 99C STORE OIL THINGIES.

IT SMELLED LIKE A VERY CHEAP FAKE ""COOL WATER"" AFTER SHAVE

UM IT DID MAKE MY HAIR SHINY-ISH LOOKING BUT I DIDNT FEEL THE SILKY PART. SO THE SHINY PART DOESNT REALLY COUNT BECAUSE  I COULD HAVE USED ANY OIL FOR THAT.

SO NOT BUYING THIS AGAIN. WASTE OF 30 BUCKS >:/

I COULD OF BOUGHT MARKERS FOR THAT OR SOMETHING BETTER.",2.0
"Updated: I also noticed the bottle cap was sealed with tape and did not sense anything fishy. But when I tried opening the seal it was already carefully opened at one end. It seems that some junk was sent in a CHI bottle! Also, as mentioned below it doesnt even add any shine, absolutely worthless and just leaves a stink. If it worked, I won't mind the stink!

I have asian wavy hair and based on reviews from people with curliest hair i expected the product to work very well. It hardly gave shine and did not help straighten my hair. Not sure if the reviews are for a wrong product since the label does not claim to do any of this sort. Its just a rejuvenation and is specifically designed to work with another CHI product. Waste of money considering the cost for such a small bottle. The only nice thing was that it was silky in my hands and detangled my hair easier than usual.",2.0
"For the first few weeks or so of using this product, I was really pleased with the results. After a while, it left so much build-up on everything I used... My flat iron had a disgusting brown film around the edges and even my hair started feeling dirty... I would only use a dime sized amount and I have long hair. Even washing my hair a few times wouldn't get it as clean as it should have been. Needless to say, I've stopped using this product.",2.0
"I started using this product a year ago and was amazed with the results! I didn't have much complain about my hair but was using it to improve its quality and add extra shine and softness during straightening. Well, I stopped using it at the begining of the summer then purchased it again because my hair was in bad condition (dryness). So, all pumped up and excited to get back to it, I exprienced the biggest disappointment. I realized it was drying out my hair and didn't give it any shine even after flat iron. I honestly don't know why this had happened, but considering my second try, I do not recommend this product. By the way, I have fine, slightly wavy hair with a frizzy and dry section on top",2.0

"I had high expectations regarding  Replenix  since Dr. Bailey is so highly regarded.  However, this product did absolutely nothing to reduce or alleviate my rosacea.  I was mighty disappointed.",2.0
I used the product twice a day for two weeks and did not notice a significant difference in wrinkles or the texture of my skin.,2.0
I don't think this does anything for my skin. If anything my rosacea appears slightly more red after applying. I will not be buying again.,2.0
"I love Replenix, BUT I'm suspicious of this product and may return it. This product has a different color lighter brown than the darker brown I'm used to from purchasing at dermatology offices. I would like to have more feedback from the seller. This seems fake but I am not 100% sure",2.0
I have used the cream in the past and ordered this by accident because I thought it was the cream. I decided to use it anyway and am pretty disappointed with this. It didn't really help my redness and almost seem to irritate my skin. I will go back to using the cream.,2.0
"Bought this product to soothe slight redness and irritation from using acne creams, as it is highly recommended on paulaschoice.com (which I'm coming to find out is quite biased!)
Haven't noticed any difference or improvement from this product other than leaving the skin soft and slightly moisturized, never greasy. No changes in irritation or redness, certainly no changes in anti aging or wrinkles.
Okay product. Not the best.
Elemis pro collagen serum is way better I would have to say.",2.0
"I bought Replenix based on the online review of a dermatologist who suggested it's use with the Obagi system (which can be drying and irritating). I found Replenix to be just OK- not cooling and soothing as advertised. I paid $43 and the bottle is quite small. I can see already, that I'll have to dismantle the bottle to get all the product out of it. I wouldn't buy it again.",2.0
"This product was highly rated so I ordered.  After two months of daily use and following the bottle directions, there is no visible difference on my face.  Fortunately Replenix offers free return shipping, to their credit.",2.0
"Calvin Klein's Eternity just isn't for me.  It does have a floral smell, but it's harsh.  After wearing it for a while, I felt like taking a shower.  I kept it onto see if it would change over time.  While it did mellow out some it still wasn't appealing to me.  I know that some people have a different body chemistry, so I tried just wearing it on my clothes.  It actually was even less appealing that way.  My husband and my daughter didn't like it either.  I know that this is a beloved fragrance, but it is not for me.",2.0
"Calvin Klein Eternity was a fragrance I used quite regularly in the mid 1990's.  I was so happy to receive a sample to test for review and revisit an old friend.  Unfortunately this is not the same fragrance I remember.  The original Eternity was a distinctive sexy, clean, floral scent that is hard to forget.  This new formula is musky, masculine and made me nauseous after wearing it for a few minutes.
I had to take a shower to lose this scent and feel better.
This had me curious enough to research this further, after all maybe its just me.  Perhaps I don't remember the scent or my body chemistry has changed.
Nope, turns out this was sold to Coty in 2005 and the formula was changed.  Anyone searching for the original Eternity will need to search for vintage bottles for sale.
I'm very disappointed in the changes to the one time beautiful scent.  I can't wear this, I no longer like the scent and I certainly don't want to feel sick all day.",2.0

"I've been using this cologne for 2 years now and absolutely love it, so when it was time for a refill I decided to order from Amazon.

I just received it and to my surprise, it smells...off. Is this a legit version? Did they change the formula in the past couple years?

This doesn't smell like the cologne I've been using, it has a sharper, almost sour quality to it.

I don't think I like this at all, I'm going to go into a store and see if I can get a sample to compare, because I think what I received is all wrong.",2.0
Smells like something your grampa would wear. I'm sure this cologne would have been a big hit in the 70's. This reminds me of a quote from the movie anchor man. Smells like big foot's ----,2.0

"The lettering on the bottle looks wrong. It is all smuged and tilted to the side a little. Other than that, it smells okay",2.0
This John Varvatos has only remnants of the smell of the one they sell at department stores. A watered down version. Has a strong ethanol scent for its top notes. Base notes resemble JV but only lasts for a couple of hours. This may be fake. I should've spent an extra $20 and bought at Sephora.,2.0
This cologne in not too bad if it is applied very lightly.  It has a hint of whatever scent that is used in ant spray.,2.0

"This is another favorite and decided to buy the large one. However, this has been altered since the scent does not last. From the moment I spray to the moment I get to my location...1/2 to 1hr, the scent dissipates and is no longer vivid as once you applied. This was noticed by friends as well.",2.0
"This particular 1.6oz bottle sold by ""GA Wholesale Liquidation"" seemed counterfeit.
The rating is for this particular one, otherwise I would give it a 4/5.
The bottle and the perfume looked a bit unusual, considering my wife buys these regularly.
Compared to one similar bottle I bought in an airport, the ""touch of pink"" inscription on the bottle is much lower (to the base of the bottle).",2.0
"It starts off very strong with an alchohol smell, but the idea is definitely a pleasant scent... however, even sprayed into fabric, it goes away quite quickly.  I have to assume this is a knock-off or just very cheaply made by Lacoste.  I'm very disappointed.",2.0
"I love the original, store-bought version of Chrome...but this bottle unfortunately is not that. It may not be a knockoff-- it might be watered-down; but, in any case, the smell is not really the same. And, it really doesn't last very long.",2.0
I've used pink sugar for years and love the perfume but I did not care for this product. It doesn't smell like all the notes of the perfume and it leaves the skin feeling slightly sticky rather than conditioned.,2.0

Soft fresh smell that lasts all day.  Make skin smooth to touch.  A fragrance everyone would enjoy.  Just love it...,2.0
Smell is different from when I used it few years ago.  Feels like it's either a different formula or old one.  It just is not pleasant smell anymore.  Feel just too strong yet unpleasant.,2.0
"I have been a long time user of this product and decided to purchase this online via Amazon (Prime). The price deal caught my eye and the positive reviews sounded convincing. After I received the product in the mail and using it for the past week, I felt like the smell of the cologne was not official. Something was off from when I took the first spray. It also did not last as long as what I usually get at the mall. The fragrance stayed on for about an hour and then it was no longer noticeable. The one's I would get at the mall would last all day and the smell would be stronger. The product I got from Amazon felt like it was ""outdated"" or ""defective,"" so to speak.. I guess I get what I paid for. If you are looking for quality and long lasting results, I recommend buying this product at the mall. Like what I read on another review here, the product may be too costly at the stores but I feel like it's way worth it. If you don't care about how long it stays on and are looking for a cologne that can last a short period of time, I recommend buying through Amazon. I think it's good for people who may be low on funds or running on a tight budget. Always consider before buying.",2.0
"I bought this through Amazon - Prime.  This product is NOT the real deal.  I have been duped.  As a buyer of this product for nearly 10 years, I know the genuine article and this is not it.  Caution is warrented if you can't smell/try it first hand.",2.0
"I've been so tempted to buy this here. What's not to love? The spaceship bottle is awesome and the price is right. Thankfully, I managed to find a sample first.

Tocade surprised me. Some people say Tocade is dated, and I have to agree, at least at the opening.

Complex? Not to me - just too much going on to make out any structure, theme or notes. It's a muddled, sweet mess on me, probably due to the deadly mix of jasmine, LOV and freesia, which I infrequently wear well. Yah, I catch the amber-vanilla base, but there's too much going on otherwise in this cloying, sweet, white floral.

Rose? Orchid? Orris? Magnolia? Really?

As it dries, Tocade is almost hysterically sweet and on the edge of cloying. Tocade seems to be the mother to Roucel's other over-the-top sweeties, like Lolita Lempicka's L & Coral and Dunhill Desire for Woman. Of these, I can tolerate Dunhill Desire. Hardly a ringing endorsement. Yet, I'm growing quite fond of Roucel's other affordable masterpieces - Oro & L'Instant.

I've been tempted by good prices on the spaceship bottle, and I'm so glad I didn't blind buy this one. I don't like this. Not. At. All.

Try it before you buy it.",2.0
"Long story short.  This stuff doesn't really smell very nice to me or to my girlfriend.  It smells like old people.  So, if you are an old person who want to smell like an old person, this might be right up your alley.  But otherwise, regretfully, I'd recommend that you skip this one.

Great bottle just a shame that what's inside doesn't do it justice.  Not good.  2 stars.",2.0
"I ordered this for my lady friend at her request. She likes some other Burberry fragrance but hadn't tried Weekend before.  She claims to like it but I don't believe that.  To me, it smells like the potpourri spray people often keep in their bathrooms.  I would use it for that, but after I sprayed it, my boss asked me if I had hugged an old woman recently.",2.0
"It's hard to write a review for something so subject to personal tastes. I will start by saying that the bottle is unique and has a sprayer. Not particularly beautiful, but not bad. The scent, however, for me started out ""OK"" and as the day wore on it got more and more cloying until I couldn't wait to wash it off. I'm not a perfume expert, so I don't know the proper terms, but it's way too sweet-smelling to me. I was expecting something more light and citrus-y but it's sweet and obtrusive. I suspect office mates would not appreciate it.

You, on the other hand, may love it, though. You really can't tell without sniffing a sample.",2.0
This is not original. It doesn't last,2.0
"Yes the frangrance is long-lasting but It smells very sweet, very similar to Joop, personally this is not my type of cologne.",2.0
Not good wiil call because the sprayer does not work properly  fragrance y good but does not sprays properly thankyou,2.0
Very good fragrance but sadly it doesn't last very long. Don't know if it's been reformulated or it's fake.,2.0
Not as good as the xfusion fiber hold... Fiber doesn't stick really good.,3.0
Coverage was good but it made my head itch after a day or so. Would still use it.,3.0
It's hair spray,3.0
Good,3.0
So far no result.,3.0
"it is what it is, an updated container which is different than pictures on Amazon actually makes this better at holding and delivering the spray to the surface",3.0
The spray is a little strong. And has an odd smell,3.0
"It works good ,but i don't like how it sprays.",3.0
Smell good but I don't think that attache the fiber to you hair it's just like hair spray,3.0
"I only purchased this product, because they say you have to use this with the Toppik product.  I find that it makes the area that you spray too stiff, and sometimes sticky.",3.0
I have used this a couple of times I find that it doesn't really help that much with keeping the fibers in place.  You're fine with out it as long as you don't scratch your head.,3.0
The product itself was good.  My problem was the spray and the container. It did not have the nozzle that a normal spray bottle should have. You have to squeeze the container so hard which did not give an overall even effect.,3.0
I do not find any difference between this and regular hairspray and did not notice a difference by using it.,3.0
This product is just like hold spray. It doesnt really hold the fiber any better than a spritz so its kind of a waste. Its just the name that your paying for.,3.0
Product works just like any other hairspray but the scent could be improved.  Also tends to make my hair feel stiff to the touch;  I couldn't say it works in conjunction with the hairbuilding fibers because I have used my own hairspray and my hair looks just the same.,3.0
I would compare this to a mild hairspray which I can get for a cheaper price. I usually go for a stronger spray so hair stays through wind/rain.,3.0
Got it for my boyfriend!! Holds the toppik fibers amazingly well!!! definetely recommend it! Its not messy and it doenst feel thick like other hold sprays,3.0
"I have been using this product for the past year and half.  I originally bought it from the actually manufacturer but they no longer ship the product internationally.  As a result I have had to buy the product here.  The cost of the product is pretty much the same as what the manufacturer charges.  However, the shipping and handling costs for this product here is absolutely astronomical!!  If I could find somewhere where this product can be shipped for a far more reasonable price, then I would buy there.",3.0
"Holds well, except in hot situations.
If you work in an environment where you sweat a lot(food industry, Wall St, athlete), it doesn't hold up well.
You will start dripping green sweat from your head. So that covers going swimming as well. DON'T DO IT, unless you want to embarrass yourself.
If it's just a dinner or something, it works very well...unless you start getting nervous and sweating. lol",3.0
"this foundation is extremely ""dry"" and for some reason the bottle I received seemed to be half empty??
so not worth the money in volume for sure. However, the ""illuminating"" part is just not true
it is as flat a color as I have ever seen. No illumination at all! So, again not sure where they get off
calling it ""illumination"" at all! So to give this purchase three stars is generous to say the least
the shade is nice and that is the best part of this dealio.",3.0
"Ok, I'm 57 years old. Maybe this foundation is for younger women. That said, I had higher hopes for it. It is illuminating, but with sparkles, which I didn't want (thought they were not noticeable on my face, I saw them on my forearms, where I had checked the color.) And not anywhere near enough coverage for my blotchy spots. And considering how thin the product is, it did stick on dry areas more than expected--but not more so than some (especially drugstore) foundations.

The color 20W was nice for my fair, but not pale, neutral (but on the cool side) coloring.

About the scent, it seemed off--or something. Don't know why that is, but I was a little concerned.

Will be returning. Still, I can see that this may be a great foundation for other skin and age types, and maybe the off-smell was a fluke for this particular order.",3.0
It's subtle and a little more orange-y than I expected.  It's okay for cheeks.  Looks like chalk on my lips.  I won't get it again.,3.0

THE PRODUCT IS GOOD THE COLOR IS WAY DARKER THAN PICTURED,3.0
The color is not the same as it was before. I bought it in the past form another vender and the color was a little darker. what i like.,3.0
Was orange than I expected,3.0
Nice light foundation. I may like a little thicker make up but this feels very nice on my skin and gives good coverage . The color matched perfectly and it stays on all day.,3.0
"Good product, quality is about the same as any dept store brand. Seems to last most of the day.
I would consider buying this again.",3.0
This color doesn't stay on the lips at all. It washes away quite quickly. I keep it as a backup in my car in case I need some blushes on my cheeks.,3.0
"I love this product by Stila and have other colors.  This color was too bright for my face.  I think it would look very cute on more ivory toned skin, and younger girls.  I am 43 and it looked a little aging on my face.",3.0
Good,3.0
"All reviews said WOW amazing!!  incredible stuff, I got it and is tiny compact soo small, is the size of my watch face.. and thew color super red ..I have olive skin and doesn't give you the sun kiss effect like someone said more clownish than anything , won't return it because it will cost me,  I  had an awesome creme blush that I just lost along w makeup bag  ouchhh .. I got that blush a year a go at marshals way better, oh well, is ok but won't be that excited in recommending it",3.0
I haven't yet found a good way to apply this blush so for now it will be only three stars.,3.0
excessively BRIGHT and hard to spread smoothly,3.0
Doesn't show up as well on my fair skin.  Peony remains my favorite.,3.0

lasting color but much darker and not as natural looking as I expected.,3.0
"Darker and bolder than I thought, I did end up liking the color after a while.",3.0
"I like this ok.  It applies well with a stipple brush and the colors gladiola and gerbera are gorgeous.  Only problem is that gladiola seems to fade within the hour on me, and gerbera kind of ""sits"" on my cheeks and looks very unnatural.  For the record, peony doesn't do that and I like it just fine. For the money, I prefer tarte's stains which look more natural on the skin.",3.0
This product is creamy. It doesn't blend well in the skin. I have to really rub and rub it in for it to look sublte. Not worth the price at all!,3.0
"It is a great colour however it's a bit difficult to apply this blush. Also it is very expensive, not sure if value for money.",3.0
"This is a pretty pink that layers well, I use it under my the Nars highlighter to enhance the color and save the Nars ($!)  I like the packaging and it's handy to keep in your bag, opens nicely, the mirror's a plus and it works on lips; I use a layer of gloss on top to give a more natural look.",3.0
I love thi8s!!!!! I love the color and everything about this. You need a lip brush to apply and it would be nice if one was included but other than that you will enjoy it.,3.0
I ordered 3 of these items to give as Christmas gifts and I was disappointed when I opened the box and learned that the products delivered were in plastic tubes rather than the glass bottles as pictured in the ad.

Ok,3.0

Ok,3.0
"Something of a generic smell, but it is still a good smell. Very powerful, which is nice if you use it sparingly but you are gonna give people asthma attacks if you use it like most other colognes.",3.0
"Thought it was a great deal for the price but when i got it, it did not smell like the ones you get from the store i beleive it may have been watered down.",3.0
Not as good as I expected it to be. The fragrance does not last long.,3.0
"Good product, but certainly not as great as 'One' or 'Be'",3.0
"The aroma of the perfume does not last very long. I remember buying this in the 90s, but the aroma lasted all day long. I lived in New York City then and people used to ask me to tell them what I was wearing. This must be an imitation, perhaps that explains the low price.",3.0
"I like the way this powder feels. It is not cakey, dry or flaky. The coverage is decent (light to medium) but not long lasting, reapplying is necessary. Also it is not ""illuminating"" at all. It covers period. There is no dewy, shimmer, supple, highlighting anything to this. It is matte. I find the title misleading",3.0
"Its was cheaper and now I know why. By and large its fine, just not the staying power for the fragrance that I'm used to.",3.0
"I mistakenly ordered this on-line. I had expected to order Eternity Aqua by CK. I have very acute sinuses and this is just a bit too strong for me. I ordered it early for my husband's birthday and never opened the package until the night before to wrap it as a gift. When I realized I had the wrong item, and it was my fault, I immediately e-mailed the seller and reordered the correct item. They were gracious enough to accept it back as long as I paid for the return postage and a restocking fee, which I was more than happy to do since it was my mistake and long past any return dates. Either way, it was a great deal, I just wasn't able to keep it.",3.0
"It does what it's supposed to do.  The fragrance is nothing better than others I suppose, but it gets the job done.",3.0
"Just like most things today. Watered down, less coffee but looks like the same to the purchaser. LET THE BUYER BEWARE THEY SAY. Have to carry it with me if going out after work to have the fragrance again",3.0
Too expensive for the amount of wipes you get.,3.0
A little expensive for my taste. Smells very good,3.0
Not keen on the smell.,3.0
"I read about these on a blog and that they were ""the best"". Yes they are pretty great, and I have to admit they smell AMAZING...but the J&J ones at Target are less than $3 for 25, work and smell just as good, and I think those are the better value. I also tried the Target brand and don't like those as much as J&J's hand and face wipes. Basically if money is no issue and you can just buy whatever, these are great. If you want something that works just as well and is significantly cheaper, try the J&J ones.",3.0
I feel the smell is pretty strong and sometimes scares me to use it on the face specially around lips area,3.0
"Not my favorite, I think I prefer the liquid, this are handy while traveling but the smell is really really strong ... so I mean its okay",3.0
"I used to buy these five plus years ago & was crazy about them. They smelled great, left no sticky residue & were perfect for quick clean ups.  I just bought these for our baby & they left a filmy residue on him, still smell great but he felt like he needed a bath after using them.",3.0
"I hope it will work, don't know yet! The smell is not amount my favorites, but it doesn't get absorbed well.",3.0
"I don't know if I just don't know how to put it on, or it just goes on to thick, sorry I couldn't help more.",3.0
Not as dark as expected and doesn't stay all day like my inglot,3.0
I can't wait to order the black! I will caution that this doesn't work well for winged eyeliner looks. It smudges by the end of the day. Great for regular eyeliner or doing your brows.,3.0
"I am not sure why this liner gets such good reviews. It's not bad, but I I found nothing special about it. A couple drugstore gel eyeliners I've tried and found to be just as good as this one are L'oreal Infallible and Maybelline Eye Expert. As fa as high end products go, I'd take MAC Fluidline over this one any day, even though it dries out rather quickly.",3.0
"This is a very glossing, finishing serum. Lightweight.
I have naturally curly hair which i straighten with a flat iron, so i have the classic little hairs in the middle that stand by themselves like i've placed my finger inside an electrical outlet...anywhooo, this product for my hair requires frequent re-applying. Unless you're gonna leave the hair split in the middle and not touch it all day - which is not my case.
I guess it's okay, i'll just carry on with it on my doorway so i put a drop of magic on the way out.",3.0
"The first one I got was dried out, contacted the seller and they quickly sent me another one. I was pleased with how much they care about their customers, but even with that, the product still isn't up to the standards I expect from this company. This is very hard to apply with the glitter in it. Unlike the black one, it doesn't just glide on. I was disappointed because the color looks so cool. If you have a good brush it will still work. Just take a lot of effort and not as sleek or crisp as the plain black colour from this company.

In the future I won't buy this style but I still love this brand.",3.0
Way more sparkle than I expected,3.0
Nice color but a dry piece always ended up floating around in my eyes.,3.0
"It's expensive for what it is. It takes couple of pumps for each use on my short hair and although it adds shine, it doesn't tame straggly hairs.  I went through a half a bottle in just 3 weeks or so.  I thought it would last a lot longer.  I am not putting excessive amount either but just enough to cover top and end of my hair when it's slightly damp.",3.0
"I usually want to shout from the rooftops how great the Phyto products can be.  However I'm sort of iffy on this one.  I've used other finishing serums before - Biosilk - I like the light weight but it's so darned runny it's hard to keep it from dripping everywhere - frizz ease - quite similar to this product and probably less expensive.  I honestly can't say that this is much better on my hair.  I have long straight hair so perhaps it's better for curly hair?  If I change my mind I'll let you know, but for now I just can't rave about this stuff.",3.0
It's great at first but after a few months it dries up and you can't apply it anymore... :(,3.0
This is fabulous for the first week after you open the pot.  Then the product dries and becomes unuseable.,3.0
The Black Cat version of this has sparkles.. I much prefer the basic black.,3.0
I thought this was a soft pink but it's more of a sparkly gold and goes on cakey.  It wasn't what I was looking for and I don't think the online description is very accurate.  it's too bad because I do line most of the Stila line.,3.0
"I've been using the Stila Smudge Pots for the last two years. I love the bronze color - it's not too intense for daytime wear. Beautiful and definitely stays on. However, the last two times I've purchased the Smudge Pots on Amazon (most recently from the seller: The Beauty Box), they have been dried out and flaky. That's no good. I'll have to buy these @ Sephora to make sure I'm getting a fresh product, because they do tend to dry out after a couple of months even if you do get a good/fresh batch.",3.0
"It stays on and I like that part - but it dries out to fast in the pot, even though I close it every time I fill my brush.",3.0
Shipping was very quick and I had no problems with the seller. The product color is beautiful but it's a little dry and doesn't last long on my eyelids even with primer.,3.0
"I really wanted to love this product. It goes on smooth and creamy but I have doubts about its staying power. It seems to flake away easily unless you put on 3 or 4 layers. Anyone have tips on how to make this stuff stay on all day? I do put on eye shadow primer first, but it doesn't seem to help.",3.0
"I got this is brown.  First, I want to note that there was weird glue on the jar and the glue melted (my bag was at my feet in the car and I guess the heater melted it) so now I have a messy jar.  I'm wondering why there was glue there in the first place.  I wasn't too pleased about this.

The color is okay and it goes on nicely and looks great at first.  I've always preferred brown eye liner over black because of the softer look.  Unfortunately, this is too soft so I'm buying another in black.  Not sure if I'll go with this brand again, though.  I tend to get slightly oily and this doesn't last as long as I had hoped.  I never rub my eye or touch my eyes throughout the day so I can only assume that it's rubbing off as I blink.

Previously, I had used the MAC eye pot in blitz and glitter and that would stay on even after a shower.  Anyway, I hope I have better luck with black.",3.0
"I'm giving this 3 stars because while I didn't have success with it, I think other people will.

I used an eyeliner brush to apply this, which worked fairly well. I got a nice line, although it was quite smudgy (as the name implies). This is nice if you're trying for that look, but less so if you want to line our upper eyelid. Still, it was okay.

But, it was gone in about an hour. I must have oily eyelids, because this happens with nearly all liners. I'm still searching for one that will stay on. This seems to be a problem with me, not the product. I have had more success with liquid than this type.

Overall, I would say that it was just okay. I've used other brands that seem to do a better job.",3.0
"I lover this liner because it applies smoothly, you can wing it out with precision for a killer cat eye, or just keep it simple.  Either way, you get a crisp, dark, defined line that will last all day.  I have had my Smudge Pot (I call my Smudgie. haha) for several months now and it is still creamy as it was on day 1.  Also, you get a good amount, totally worth the price.

HOWEVER,  I am a contact wearer, and have found that this liner, in particular, finds its way to my eyes and clouds up my contacts with a waxy film.  I have tried applying liner before putting in my contacts, but the liner still waxed up my vision.  I even tried to ""blot"" the brush on my hand 1st, so I apply a very thin coat, but that didn't work either.  I did not have this problem with the L'oreal H.I.P. gel liner, but I have have since replaced all of my makeup with products that are not tested on animals; the L'Oreal had to go.  It was a very good liner, though, no problems w/ contact lenses.  I am going to have to try another brand.. MAC Fluidline, or Bobbi Brown....

If you do not wear contacts, then I would definitely recommend this liner, but beware if you do wear contacts.  Be prepared to clean (scrub, almost!) your lenses a few times to clean them up.  It can get really annoying. =[ The liner still looks great, though. Wah-wah. =[

Oh Smudgie, why can't we get along... I love you. ='[",3.0

"The foundation is very light weight. I loved that it didn't even feel like I had make up on. The part I didn't like was that it didn't cover well for me.

"I got this foundation through the Amazon Vine program to review.  I am always looking for new and interesting foundations.

This is an interesting foundation that is in a neatly sealed package that keeps the foundation moist.  It is very pricey for the amount of foundation you get.

It feels a bit weird when you put it on, very cool on your skin because of the water in it.  I applied it with a foundation brush and you really have to dig the brush into the foundation to get enough product on it.

The color, Bisque, was great for my winter (sun-deprived) skin.  My skin color is usually light to medium.  When I first put it on I was super impressed.  It doesn't give great coverage, but it does look very natural and glowy and does a decent job evening out your skin tone.  It feels great too once it dries, very light...you barely notice it's there.

Unfortunately I was really not impressed with the staying power.  After a couple hours I noticed it had rubbed off my nose and was starting to wear off on other portions of my face as well.  It dismally failed the ""nap test""...how my make-up looks after I take a nap.  The whole side of my face that was on the pillow was rubbed off.

I tried putting my favorite winter primer right now,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Palladio-Herbal-Foundation-Primer/dp/B003KPIIKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Palladio Herbal Foundation Primer</a>, on underneath it but that didn't really help the staying power.  I tried using my summer primer,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cotz-Face-Natural-Skin-Tone-SPF-40-1-5-Ounce/dp/B0073P01RC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cotz Face Natural Skin Tone SPF 40, 1.5 Ounce</a>, under it and that worked better.  The Cotz product provides some coverage by itself and this foundation sat on it nicely and seemed to stay on a bit better.

I have somewhat oily skin and definitely needed to use a powder to set this.  I ended up using both&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neutrogena-Healthy-Skin-Pressed-Powder/dp/B0033PSM54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neutrogena Healthy Skin Pressed Powder</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rimmel-Stay-Matte-Pressed-Powder/dp/B001KYVOC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rimmel Stay Matte Pressed Powder</a>&nbsp;to set this...both powders worked fine and helped a little with staying power but not a ton.

I don't think I will be using any more of this foundation.  The coverage is just too light and the foundation rubs off way to easily.  The water in the foundation also makes my foundation brush get all clumpy and goopy.  I will be sticking with my current favorite foundation,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tarte-Cosmetics-Amazonian-Clay-12-Hour-Full-Coverage-Foundation/dp/B00FU6U6LC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tarte Cosmetics Amazonian Clay 12-Hour Full Coverage Foundation</a>.

Pros:
- Smells nice
- Initially provides a nice/natural and glowy looking coverage
- Neat packaging to keep the foundation moist
- Good for sensitive skin (didn't make me break out)

Cons:
- Hard to get good coverage, isn't very buildable and doesn't cover redness or age spots well.
- The foundation is wet which clumps up my make-up brushes
- Horrible staying power, rubs off easily even with primer and powder to help set it.
- Expensive for the small amount of foundation you get.
- No SPF, so you will have to either get primer/moisturizer/powder with SPF instead",3.0
"Although I'll use the rest of the bottle, I probably won't buy this again. It goes on nice and light, but during the day when I sweat I get a greasy feel on my face.  It takes about six pumps for enough lotion for my face, ears, and neck. Probably better for winter use than summer.",3.0
"I love experimenting with make up and sometimes think I have tried just about every foundation on the market - from drug store brands to the uber high end cosmetic lines. I was excited to try the Vincent Longo creme to powder foundation and have been using it for about a month. The Bisque color is a nice neutral shade with a soft warm undertone. While it goes on nicely with a damp sponge or brush, I found the coverage to be sheer  - too sheer for my tastes. Directions say to layer and use the damp sponge method for more coverage but even that delivers minimal coverage at best. I find myself using it simply as a finishing powder over another foundation, which is fine but not the intended use (and pricey at that). The cost is also a factor for me - this is an expensive foundation that did not come with any sort of applicator sponge, which is extra, as is a proper compact to carry both in. Add those three things up and you are talking about an $85 product. I would gladly pay that for something exceptional but unfortunately this is a nice, sheer foundation that isn't much different than any other creme to powder foundation on the market.",3.0
"I've never used a creme-to-powder foundation before, but have heard the benefits and figured, why not?  While I get the appeal of the concept, I might not buy it again--at least not this particular product.

I was very pleased when I put it on the first time.  I liked the method of application, I even liked the learning curve required to get the right look, and I was delighted with my face after all make-up was applied.  Smooth coverage, pretty and natural glow, and heck if it didn't match my skin tone quite nicely.

But, as the day wore on, I wasn't as pleased. Please note I was never miserable, but the staying power wasn't great (I did use the company's primer with this that was great with my other foundations yet only pretty good here--bad combo?) and I felt my face looked a bit cakey.

Okay, not as good as application as I thought.  Yes, there's a learning curve, but on the subsequent days of practice I still had the same results.  Sheer or a stronger coverage, this still has an odd cakey look to it I just don't care for.",3.0
"I was lucky enough to get this product for free, as I would never spend this much on foundation. I was really excited to try it but I just don't see that it is superior to other, cheaper products. It's okay, but I was expecting more.",3.0
Don't like the sponge applicator. And the mirror needs to be clean every time before using.,3.0
Not that good for dry skin.,3.0
"This lotion has a pleasant, subtle scent, and it rubs into the skin nicely, without creating an oily feel on your skin. But, in my experience it has not been an effective moisturizer. I've been using it every day for the last month or so and I'm still getting patches of dry skin on my face. I'm going to try a few other brands.",3.0

Good product but should have been advertised as travel size. Small tube,3.0
"Once again Jack Black retunes with another over priced moisturizer. It works as described, has no scent, goes on evenly and smoothly, but It's no better than other SPF moisturizers that I've used. It isn't greasy at all and gives good coverage, but next time I will find a less expensive moisturizer that does the same thing.",3.0
So small for the price. But I love the smell and it seems to do the job. Not greasy. Bought this for my boyfriend. These are my observations.,3.0
"This is a good product.  Feels very good on my face and skin after application.  However, I love the Neutrogena Triple Protect Face Lotion just as much, maybe even a little more,  and at $18 less for the same quantity Neutrogena is a no brainer, for me anyway.",3.0

Not what I expected. Not really seeing any difference in my hair.,3.0
"It's simply alright. No more matte than anything else which says it is. By the middle of the day my face is just as oily without it. Goes on somewhat wetter than I was expecting it to be. Does rub in clear, but without the cap on it feels like the lotion would just spill out on its own. SPF 20 is good, but the size of this container is grossly overvalued for the price for which you pay for this. Doesn't smell at all in my opinion. Stuff like Every Man Jack, Nivea men, Dove Men will do the same job for way less per ounce you spend.",3.0
"I'm sure this is a good product, but it irritated my face a little so I stopped using it.",3.0
Disappointed because this leaves my face very greasy.  For the price I expected a better product that wouldn't leave behind an oil slick every time I use it.,3.0
"It's not oily like others have said which is a plus. Also, a little can go a long way. I'm not a fan of the ""unscented"" scent. It reminds me of cheap, discount store lotion which is unacceptable for a product in this price bracket.",3.0
It helps a little with new hair growth but not a huge improvement.,3.0
Too small amounts for the price.,3.0
Just ok. My skin still felt a bit dry after applying. Not worth $28.00 price tag.,3.0
"I moved to the dry desert 3 years ago and have been looking for a facial moisturizer that actually works. For the price, this product is a subpar moisturizer. Your face feels dry in about 5 minutes after using this product. I appreciate the size and durability of the bottle - nice to keep in my travel bag. However, I will stick to ""Yes to Blueberries"" (which is rather thick sadly, but you feel moisturized for hours!) while I try out other moisturizers before spending $17+ on this little bottle again.",3.0

"I don't mind it, but I like their other moisturizer: Jack Black Epic Moisture MP 10 Nourishing Oil - that stuff is the bomb! I decided to try this out to see if i would like it better. It's okay....but the MP 10 Nourishing oil is way superior.",3.0
The lotion has the same smell as my Lubriderm dry skin lotion.  I've used a couple time now and don't see anything wrong yet besides that it smells and feels same as the Lubriderm.  That's odd.,3.0

"This is really a beautifully formulated moisturizer, probably one of the best I've tried. Unfortunately, it did not match my skin in the most unfortunate way. The moisturizer is very light, goes on beautifully matte, and is one of the very few lotions out there that did not make my skin greasy throughout the day, even though it has sunscreen. It has a very gentle and classy fragrance that is almost imperceptible. I'm not sure if it was because of the retinyl palmitate, a precursor of retinol, that my skin got blotchy and red after using this. I know that retinol can be sensitive for some people but not all. I would still recommend this moisturizer highly to others to try out especially because of the quality ingredients, the mattifying nature, and the inclusion of SPF which is a critical anti-aging factor. Just get a sample first from one of the department stores and if your skin doesn't react, you've found gold.",3.0
"Better than average product, however pricey - product burst open during shipping.  Would recommend shipper to bubble wrap product.  Option to return product -however I had less than half the bottle after spillage.",3.0
A little heavy.,3.0
"Good, but not moisturising enough for my dry skin.",3.0
"While the product is very good, I have an issue with the packaging of same. The bottle/ jar it comes in has a very bad applicator/ nozzle. Whenever you press the nozzle, the cream basically spills all over the bottle neck itself. It would have been nice if the nozzle was a little longer so that one could get the cream on their hands and not to wipe it from the bottle itself.",3.0
"Product arrived with a huge white sticker covering the label. Not a great first impression.

After removing the sticker there is sticky residue covering the whole bottle, and also loosened the 'pull here' back flap. For an expensive product it should be presented nicer. Product itself is nice and light and the SPF protection is great. Note the units I looked at in store do not have the white inventory sticker on them.",3.0
"I love that the Hydra-stick is eminently portable, easy to use and super moisturizing. But its scent is downright nauseating! We are a no-perfume family  everything from our shampoo to our laundry detergent and dish soap is fragrance free  so we are particularly sensitive to perfumed and scented products, especially synthetically scented ones. This product has a strong, long-lasting, cloying vanilla-like scent, and even just a dab of it on my hand was enough to trigger a profound headache. My 4-year-old won't use it. If you don't mind scented products, you'll likely love this little moisturizing stick. But if you're the fragrance-averse type, I'd advise looking for something else!",3.0
"Works good for moisturizing, especially for sensitive skin with facial hair. The smell takes a bit getting used to, but it smells good, kind of a cedar-esque scent. My biggest complaint is it's pretty pricey for such a tiny bottle!",3.0

It makes it super easy and mess free to use.",3.0

This is an average moisturizer.  Nivea for Men is probably a good equivalent.  Its always good to have tthe SPF protection butt at this price poinnt expected more moisturizing.  There is not much of a scent.  Not worth the price.,3.0
"It's light, ingredients are nice, smell is much stronger than people say it is and is almost a Brut like mens type of cologne smell which I don't love..but it goes away pretty fast.  My huge issue is the SPF.  I don't understand why I can buy something like a Garnier or even CVS knockoff moisturizer with spf and be fine but every mens one I seem to find says to apply every Two to Three hours!!!  This one says that!  That to me is the same as putting on a spray or oil/lotion at the beach.. That is a joke.. I want something you put on in morning and you are set for the day.  Read the back of the bottle and you will see it says to apply that often. That makes me really unhappy with it overall if it is only going to protect me for 2 hours.  It takes a good 5 pumps to do just my face, so if you did put this on say 5 times a day as suggested you'd never last a month.. that's crazy at this cost..",3.0
"Bought the medium 3.3 ounce bottle.

The bottle is cheap plastic not glass as I had thought by photos.

The dispenser doesn't dish out a use. You have to pump it multiple times to get enough to cover face.

Haven't noticed an immediate change after 5 days.

Has a baby powder feminine smell that should be replaced with a leathery/oak/man smell.",3.0
It was somewhat pricey for what you get but as a big bonus I don't believe I had any break out acne as a result. Would purchase a cheaper alternative in the future.,3.0

"It's great this comes in a men's container, which made my has been more likely to use it. But it smells like the Cetaphil high spf face lotion, save your money & use that one instead.",3.0
"Doesn't feel as ""premium"" as I was expecting at this price point- applies at first like a heavy moisturizer, almost like a light sunscreen (probably because it is) but it does blend and absorb more easily than expected and doesn't have that sunscreen smell. It doesn't have any smell actually. And once rubbed in, it does not have any ""weight"" or feeling to it.

Haven't noted any significant difference in skin appearance but my skin does feel soft and my face has not dried out using it.

Unfortunately, because it does have sunscreen in it, if you apply above or around your eyes and/or your forehead, you are bound to get some in your eyes during the day either by rubbing or sweating and then your eyes will sting. Now I apply it all over my face, neck and ears but stop short of my forehead at my temples- this seems to work well and it no longer bleeds down and stings my eyes- for what its worth, I'm a big fan of OSEA Atmosphere Protection Cream (APC), very pleasant smell and doesn't sting your eyes, though it does not have a sunscreen in it- so there are trade offs.",3.0
"feels great but leaves my face looking very very shiny.
i was hoping this product would not leave my face shiny and greasy looking as most SPF lotions do, but this does as well, if not more.
several people mentioned it leaves a matte look, but it definitely does not.

the product itself feels great. great light weight moisturizer. i just hate the shiny look it leaves behind.",3.0
Would have given it 5 stars but apparently it has ingredients that are comedogenic and irritating to the skin. I have whiteheads which I've been trying to treat for a while now and I'm not sure if this product is helping or making matters worse. I may be wrong and this product might actually be good for my skin but there are articles across the internet that do not approve of the ingredients in this product.,3.0
"First, I was a little surprised by the size of the bottle. It's very small container, but very easy to dispense. Jack Black produce quality products so I bought this feel confident. I would say this is an above average moisturizer. When you apply the product to your face, it leaves a white residue that takes about 30-45 seconds of massaging into your skin prior to disappearing. Very similiar when you apply sun screen/block. After using for about ten days, both morning and night my skin feels ""okay."" Overall rating for this product: just okay",3.0
"I wanted to love this.  I want to love it since it cost so much and for the brand name.  The truth is, I end up using more lotion on my face than I have with other brands.  I don't feel oily with it, but you can tell it's there.  For my skin type (dry) it does fine for moisturizing and the smell is not noticeable.  It dees have broad spectrum SPF 20, which is good. Nothing wrong with the product, but probably going to look at the Kyoku brand or someone else.  For $27 I want to love my facial moisturizer, and this is not love.  Not even lust. Not even puppy love.  More like a mild interest if there were no other options on a deserted island.  Get the picture?",3.0
"As an asian with oily skin and having some acne problems, I thought this might be a good sun-screen/moisturizer to use.

It is a good moisturizer and sun block. My only gripes with this is that it basically has the same ingredients as other moisturizers but it feels worse than them. What I mean by worse is that it's almost like liquid. So when I massage it in, it's like I'm massaging a thin oily substance. I prefer moisturizers that seem heavier.

So this wasn't the moisturizer for me but it might be for you.",3.0
"I'm asian and have normal to slightly oily skin.  This product made my face very dry, even after I applied double layers.  I didn't mind the smell though it isn't the best smelling moisturizer out there.  I really wanted to like the product since it's relatively cheap and combines SPF protection.  I went back to my LAB SPF lotion which was fine, but pricier.",3.0

I like to try Jack Black products due to their usual high quality and natural ingredients. However I feel like I need to use a decent more amount if this moisturizer then I do with other products.

"Hello,

So, I decided to purchase this product after reading the reviews.  I'm generally pretty skeptical about some products when the reviews are generally too glowing, but I figured that I'd try this.  I could always give my own objective negative review if it hasn't met the hype.  I'm posting a 3* review to keep things real. Will upgrade if I notice that it starts to match the hype of other reviews.  So far, no problems. I don't notice the smell that some have mentioned. I don't find it greasy.  It applies and absorbs well.  No complaints at all.  I generally apply at night. I've noticed softer/smoother skin.  Haven't noticed any improvement in terms of erasing/minimizing creases in my forehead or other areas.  Just started using about a week ago though, around 4/15/12.  I will update this review in time.",3.0

"Let me start off by saying I love Cargo blush. I had the blush Bali for months and used it until it went kaput. The color was perfect and easy to layer for a slight flush or full-on pink-cheek gorgeousness. It also stayed put through rain, southern humidity, sweat and freezing temperatures. After reading great reviews of Tonga, I had to try. Eh. The color is not nearly as buildable as Bali and does not impress me with its staying power. A few hours of work and my face looks like it did when I woke up - no cute pink cheeks! It just blends with my skin no matter how much I put on. Wish I had ordered another Bali....",3.0

"I have been using 4-5 weeks and can't tell a big difference. You're supposed to use at least twice a day--what new mom has time to do that? I use once a day, but rarely get to apply more than that; perhaps that is why I haven't seen results.",3.0

"After having my baby, like many moms, I was out on the hunt for a ""miracle"" product to help keep my flabby postpartum body in check. I followed application instructions and used it for the recommended period of time. To be honest, I really don't think that it made much of a difference in any of my problem areas... but it did feel good on my skin and had a nice smell to it. I think you'd be better off investing with something less expensive because simply put, it's just not worth the money. The other thing is, if you are battling with putting on stretch mark cream and using this at the same time, it doesn't feel like your skin is even absorbing this due to the over saturation. And when I used it alone, I felt like it left my skin too dry and made my stretch marks worse! Hope this helps!",3.0

it's okay product,3.0
"I ordered this for my 2 year old with very sensitive skin when we couldn't seem to get our favorite, Yes to Carrots, anywhere anymore. I love the Mustela lotion and I've heard good things about the other products so I figured I'd give it a try. Meh? It wasn't terrible. It seemed really thick, almost like you should be using it with a bath poof to work it into a lather. It didn't irritate my toddler's skin but it didn't seem to help it any either. We made it about half way through the container before my husband said ""what happened to the other stuff we used? that was better."" So I ordered our old stuff directly from the manufacturer and the half empty container is still sitting in the bath.",3.0
"I think I'm starting to buy this more because I love the smell on my toddler. I used to think it helped with his excema or little bumps on his arms, but it doesn't, I do love the smell and although it is expensive you need very little",3.0
I love the foam wash for newborns and thought it would smell the same. It's a stronger smell. Still nice but not like the foam,3.0
Smells like chemicals. Used only a couple times.,3.0
Not sure why this came so highly recommended. I think it smells nice but that's about it. Not a user friendly container considering your have to keep your hand on a baby for most of their bath and you need two hands to get the soap to come out. Wish it had a pump. Not worth the price. I just don't think it's that special.,3.0
"This is a strong smelling wash. I thought it would be pleasant like the Mustela no rinse wash and the foam shampoo, but it's much stronger. It smells very strong like an old lady's perfume. It was not what I wanted my baby boy to smell like. He sneezed in the bath when I was using it. I wish I could return it, but I used it once.",3.0
"Some describe this product as natural, however these products contain parabens and other preservatives. Spend a couple more bucks and get some California Baby products.",3.0
"I heard a famous tv mom raving about this product online so I thought I would give it a try.
I didn't think it was anything special and I went back to using Phisoderm Baby which has a
wonderful scent and cleans really well.",3.0
"Smells wonderful but it squirts out quickly.  Also when you go to use it again there is a sharp point left from residual deodorant lotion that dried.  So if you remember to wipe off after use it's fine.

Love the frangrance but weird issues",3.0
Does the job but the consistency of the product is like a lotion. Very thin and watery. It does smell wonderful and no sweating.,3.0
This product did not work for me. Not as effective as blue grass,3.0
"I really wanted to like this deodorant, but it is just too messy!

First of all, the deodorant I received came without the green top. Then, I kept turning it, and nothing happened to the point that I thought that I received an empty tube. Then all of a sudden, it spewed a tablespoon-full of the cream. The ""leaking"" continued afterward. Maybe it is summer heat that is making the cream slowly crawl out of the tube, maybe it is poor design, but it keeps squirting whenever I slowly turn the base (and then it oozes out when I am not using it).",3.0
does its job but has a manly scent :(,3.0
"Just received,the head is broken!",3.0
"The smell is amazing, as well as the texture of the cream. I would give it 5 starts, but the bottle it comes in is very cheap. For me, it broke after 10 uses? I was very gentle with it and am disappointed with the screw mechanism within this bottle.",3.0
"The smell is amazing and it works great to keep me smelling nice, but the packaging is horrid. It has a little hold at the top, which gets clogged up immediately. Now every time I go to pump it out it'll twist twice with nothing then explode up. Because of this I'm always super wary and always have to end up putting it on with my fingers, which is annoying.",3.0
"The cream is a little too runny. But the smell is as always, very sweet and refreshing.",3.0
The cream doesn't want to come out. The little that I could get was efficient the whole day.,3.0
good,3.0
Its okay. Smells good.,3.0
"I bought this thinking it was a roll-on. It's more like a lotion and is difficult to smear on evenly. I am not an overly sweaty person (that I know of) so it did work as far as covering up body odor. The scent started to give me a bit of a headache after a few days of use, however. It's just a bit strong, in my opinion.",3.0
"The item arrived quickly. Unfortunately, the applicator is defective. I am still able to use the product, but it's frustrating each time I use it that it doesn't work as it should when dispensing the product. Thanks.",3.0
"I do like this product - it smells nice, works well and goes on well.  But I dropped it once and the lid cracked, and now I have to keep it in a baggie so it does not leak.  Seems pretty cheap to make a lid that will not break so easily.  Otherwise, good product and one I would purchase again.",3.0
"Just like the other reviewer said, its thin gel. Its not enough for my sensitive beard.  I'll stick with Bump patrol shave gel I found on Amazon around the same time and works really well. Much cheaper too.",3.0
"I know various men's grooming sites/blogs will argue that you don't need a thick, foaming lather when you shave, but this gel was way too light for my facial hair. If you get a daily 5-o'clock shadow like I do, then you need something a little more potent than this. It goes on clear so I found it hard sometimes to determine where I had shaved and where I hadn't. On several occasions I'd notice that I missed a patch after rinsing my face.
However, if you have very light growth then it might work better for you.",3.0
"Made my lips look dry, hard to blend on my cheek, and the color was much darker than I expected. Not a fan.",3.0
"I was so happy to find this on Amazon. I've used this for years but it was discontinued at the site I used to get it from.  The Liquid  Kiss shade that I received is a deep plum, which is so different from the ones I got before. I tried to reorder thinking the one I received was a ""factory"" mistake.  The second one I got is still the same.  I wish they would stick to their original shade formulation.  I would give this 5 stars because I love the feel and consistency (not thick) ,  but the color change is a three for lack of quality control.",3.0
This item is 'okay'... It does not not last in a way that is meaningful... It is dry to the lips....,3.0
"I love the stain, but bought this particular color mainly for the middle lip area, as I need a softer, more plummy tone at the lipline.  It really does stain everywhere BUT near the center of the lips (it comes off there when you eat or drink).  Just a heads up, since it's pricey.  It would be a GREAT lip stain if it stayed on after eating and drinking.",3.0
"I love the color, but...this lip stain gets flaky and leaves little crud all over my mouth. Has anybody else had this problem? It's possible I just got a bad tube, but I get obsessive about rubbing off the flakes and then it looks uneven and gross and becomes totally useless. I need a replacement asap.",3.0
"I made the mistake of buying the new formula accidentally, without realizing it wasn't what I have purchased for years. I now reserve the two new ones for cheeks only since they are more gel-ly/less drying but they won't last to save your life if you put them on your lips. If you want a stain for your lips that needs touch up in center of lips only after an oily meal, seek out the original formula. To identify it, look at the ingredients list and it should fill up the entire side of the package, the first few ingredients being: Water, Glycerin Triethanolamine, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Ethyl Vanillin. Followed by the ""May contain"" section. I always look for the TriETHANOLamine (remember, you like alcohol/ethanol!) because that is not in the new one but it is in the original. I hope VL figures out that this new formula is not being purchased so I don't have to deal with this hassle every 4-6 months when I reorder! Find the original, you won't be disappointed!! :)",3.0
"I have been using this stain for years, and I love it. However, this last bottle I purchased is like a totally different formula. The stain disappears within minutes of applying it, and the color is much lighter than the last bottle of the one I just finished using. Hmm...this is very different than my previous experience with Vincent Longo Lip Stain.",3.0
The stain is too translucent for me.  I was hoping for a more opaque color.  It does look nice over another lipstain.,3.0
"The color is beautiful and completely natural and not to harsh, the only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because someone said it lasted hours but for me it only lasted an hour or two and if you drink or eat then forget it, you are re-applying I don't care what anyone says.",3.0
"I have this in Liquid Kiss and Neo Aura. As for color, I prefer Neo Aura, which I initially thought would wash out my face since my skin tone is brown. So Neo Aura is my natural color and Liquid Kiss is when I want to be more bold.

I really love how it looked on my lower lip (one swatch is enough), but not my upper lip. I do have a pretty pigmented lips although my upper lip is a bit on the pale side. The color just won't stick on my upper lip no matter how many swatch I did. It did show up with Liquid Kiss after so many swatch, but it looked too bold on me. Also, on my upper lip, it gathered on the lower line of my lip, which made me look like I have blood on my lip.

I do want this lip stain to work for me because I don't like gloss since the shine made my lips look thicker and it has no staying power. As for lipstick, I don't prefer to wear it if I have to eat since it will transfer to everything. This lip stain staying power is superb and it won't transfer to anything, which made it easier for me to apply lip balm on top of it whenever my lips feel dry since the color won't transfer to my balm.",3.0
"I was excited to order the lip stain and spent more than I normally would for it. Unfortunately, the shade of the product and the color pictured are quite a bit different. It ended up being more pink-ish than it appears in the photo. Obviously the two are not going to match up perfectly but it was a little too off for me. I guess this is a product to buy in person and not online so you can see exactly what you're buying.",3.0
"I personally did not experience any noticeable results after 30 days.  Also, the smell is just horrible.  The company claims that it is peppermint, but to me it smells like that plus rancid oil.  Not pleasant at all. It would have been bearable if it had worked at all!!

But the good news is that I contacted the seller from whom I purchased the cream through Amazon.com and they initiated an immediate refund.

That is commendable.",3.0
"I have been using it for more than 2 years. it's rich and creamy because I have a very dry skin. However, It doesn't do as much as it states ( wrinkles,... etc).",3.0
"This was the only StriVectin product that worked for me and did not irritate my skin. Unfortunately, it is no longer manufactured, so the company told me that anything out there is old and probably outdated (the one I purchased from Amazon was produced over a year-and-a-half ago, and the shelf life is not that long)! The new ""improved"" product irritates my skin. I haven't tried the one for sensitive skin, because I haven't seen any good deals on it. It's pretty pricey. I'm so disappointed in Klein Becker for discontinuing this original product. I used it for years and loved it!!!!",3.0
"The item is really no more than okay, the 3/5 fits perfectly for it.

The cream must be used for a very long period of time (talking about months) and all it does it to make the stretch marks the same color of your skin, no more than that. If once you stopped using it the marks stayed the same it'd get a 4 maybe even 5, but they get to be what it looked originally.

So, what's the point? You have to use it everyday for months so it starts having some kind of effect and you stop using, the effects are gone? No, thank you.",3.0
I expected to see a change in my skin tone since I read so much about this product and it is expensive.  It works good but Olay regenerate works just as good as this.  When I first used Olay it change my skin and made such a wonderful difference in my skin. I thought this product would somehow work better.  It has only been a month so maybe if I give it another month or 2 I will see a difference in my skin.  If I don't I doubt it if I will buy this again.,3.0
I don't know how well this realy works got it for my fianc. but hey it came in on time and was cheap but not too cheap. hope it works,3.0

However, as I wrinkle reducer not so much, my skin appeared to be more parched and my fine lines seemed more pronounced not less so I will continue to use this product for spot treating only and go back to the cream I was using.",3.0

I bought this originally for stretch marks and of course it did not work. But I still had it when I got dark circles under my eyes. It really did improve the color and I still use it for discolorations. I now use it for skin discolorations because I am African American and I sometimes hyper pigment. I am sure that there is something much cheaper for what it does. I certainly wouldn't recommend it because I can use Oil of Olay or some over the counter product that would do the same thing.

"I have been deligently using the Stri-vectin SD, HD, and eye cream for over 3 months and unfortunately I do not see a difference in my fine lines (also used the serum that lasted about a month).

I am a healthy organic eater and drink lots of water - I do not understand why they would claim something so adamently.  Oh well - silly me.
So I'm wondering if it just my skin chemistry not agreeing with it. I really belived in the product due to their high claims of results.  If anyone else can refer me to other creams, please do.",3.0
"I received a bottle as a gift and I've been using it for a couple of months now.  I really like the way it moisturizes my face.  I use a small amount because a little goes a long way.

I haven't noticed any decrease in the fine wrinkles in my face.  From my experience with the product, the claim that this cream is better than botox is false.  As a moisturizer this product is excellent, but I think it's a little overpriced for what it really does.",3.0
"I've used Strivectin for over a year. I held out a faint hope for miracles, but no such luck. (Those fine lines are still there.) Still, it's a very rich cream at a very good price. (When you consider how much you get, it's substantially cheaper than most anti-wrinkle creams you buy at department stores.) A little goes a long way. It does smell minty; I'm thinking people must have gotten an old/bad tube if it smelled ""rancid."" I can see, however, how the aromatic oils might be a bit strong for some people to put around their eyes. I gather that's why they came up with the eye cream that's milder. (I haven't tried it.)",3.0

The bottle lasts a long time because its leave in i guess but for a leave in it really makes your hair feel coarse not soft idk if thats because its a texturing conditioner but i didn't care for it. and also id like to say it smells great and pretty i use it after the shower to the tips of my hair just because it smells AMAZING,3.0

Also, according to their website, this company still tests on animals ""where requested by local law,"" so I definitely won't be reordering.

It's a pretty peachy/pink bronzer that we're finding everywhere from makeup companies lately, and the bronzer is just your normal matte bronzer. However it's not *quite* as pigmented as I'd like it, and it doesn't seem to build well. The clasp also broke a few days into receiving this.

When I received the spray, I put it in my fridge and let it cool overnight. The cool mist feel nice and refreshing on the skin, however this is not a skincare product that gave me any results. I could see the product feeling good on a sunburn, however, it is overpriced for what it is. Water Spray. I would not purchase this item again.",3.0

The product is fine. Bought two as gifts. They were so poorly/carelessly packed with NO protection that the containers banged together and were so ugly looking I didn't gift them.,3.0
"Here's the thing: it's refreshing. That's about it. I remember when I was in high-school my girlfriends and I used to buy a similar product from Evian. We thought it made us chic. And, it was really nice in the summer. But the effects were short-lived (as most would imagine). This reminds me of those times. I used this after the gym and it had a nice relaxing effect for several seconds. But, outside of that, it has a limited usage.

Now, I did show this to my dermatologist and she confirmed that while it cannot do anything to improve skin quality (look to peptides and retinol for scientifically proven improvement), it is not harmful (in any manner) and will not interfere with the efficacy of other products.

So, if you are seeking a little pick-me-up after the gym/workout or even on those extra hot days, this is nice. Outside of that, it seems to have very little purpose (clinically speaking).",3.0
"If it was cheaper, I'd add an additional star to my rating. It's cooling and refreshing. The water sprays out from the can in about as fine of a mist as you can get, which is nice. But it still seems a bit high priced for what it is. It's very nice moisturizing water, but pretty pricey.",3.0
"This spring water is refreshing and leaves my face feeling cool.  I'm not sure what the point of this is, as it seems to be pointless to spray some water in a can on your face.

"My normal facial skincare routine is currently owned and operated by Boscia. I use their toner, gel peel, and sake balm moisturizer. This Thermal Spring Water seemed to be a semi-moisturizer, semi-toner sort of product, so I tried it on both a washed face and then during the day as a ""pick me up.""  Honestly, I could see no results from either method. It was no more soothing than just misting some distilled water on my face, maybe slightly more moisturizing. I will say that it is easy to apply - just spritz and go, and it didn't muss up my make up where heavier moisturizers may.",3.0
"This is supposed to be used in place of a toner.

"In my opinion, this is just okay. I thought it would leave my face feeling refreshed and clean feeling when I used it but instead it left my face feeling dry and a bit itchy.

It has pictures of the back showing where it can be applied and it says it can be applied to babies as well. I sprayed it on my toddler and he thought it was the coolest thing ever.

Yes, a fine mist feels nice, and in our dry Colorado climate, I'd mist my face all day long if I could.  Reading the many favorable reviews, it appears a hit for most; however, I'm not quite convinced it's worth the cost.

Avoid over sunning, get your rest, de-stress, no smoking, take a steamy shower, use a quality moisturizer, stay well hydrated, enjoy life, and you decide if you want to add this simple treatment to your regimen.",3.0

"I actually really like this product very much.

Yes, it does seem strange to buy an aerosol can of water, but this is pH balanced at 7.0, and has no SD alcohol, witch hazel, fragrance, or other irritating ingredients.

But how is it different from tap water, assuming yours is also at pH 7 level?  It's in the delivery.  This dispenses (for a while) a very fine mist of water continuously.  It dispenses extremely fine water droplets very gently.  I've tried using plastic bottles, but can never get them to dispense so effectively.  It's very nice to use just before applying moisturizer.  I can (well, could) get a very fine layer of water on my skin, which makes it easier to apply moisturizer, and use less as well, offsetting the cost of this product.

I was in love until I got halfway through the can.  I always keep it capped, but the nozzle is clogged.  I've wiped it dry, tried shaking the can, wiped it dry again, but it keeps clogging.

This I find very disappointing, because it's difficult to find any product resembling a toner that doesn't have noxious ingredients.",3.0
to Start with the packing for this prodcut was horrible i got this one with a broken lid . Used this product for one and half weeks continously..nothing spcl just like normal water.. no improvement of skin.. however it might be useful on a suuny day ..for its price its too expensive .,3.0
"Soo good product, but someone needs to test the dispensers which arrived broken or just not working. Very poor, that, but the product is great. So I use a q tip to get the lotion out of the bottle, or shake it like ketchup. I really tried everything to get the dispenser to work. This lotion is much too expensive for the dispenser not to work.",3.0
"I tried this moisturizer for a few weeks.  However, the product caused my sensitive skin to react, and I was forced to stop using the product and return it.

However, over time I started noticing that my hair was looking a little dry, less shiny, and I began to see more breakage. I realized it must be the Toppik and stopped using it. My hair improved a great deal after I stopped. Since then, I have found better options that give me just as much volume, but without sacrificing the shine and without drying my hair out as much. I currently use John Frieda Luxurious Volume Building Mousse, which is much more gentle for daily use.",3.0
"I am on a lifelong quest to add some volume to my fine/thin hair, so I've tried more products than I can count. This one seems to work some days and not others. Like many of this type of product, if you use too much it will have the opposite effect. So, it's nice that it will last a long time because I use so little at a time.

"Rated three because my issues are probably due to me. Bought this because I have been breaking out in small bumps when in the summer sun, and I wanted a product that didn't include unnecessary chemicals that may actually cause the bumps.

Spent two days in sun with no sunscreen or sunblock- no bumps at all but a little red.

"I have mild acne and last autumn I also developed what I think may be rosacea. My skin has been dull, redness prone, and flushing for a long time. I read about this moisturizer at Dr. Cynthia Baileys website during a time when my flushing and redness was particulary bad, and she recommended it for rosacea skin. Later I found it on Amazon and I decided to purchase it. The first time I put this cream on I was amazed at how vibrant my skin looked. It made my skin glow like never before. Unfortunately it made my skin very oily (especially around my nose) and after a couple of days I started to get some pimples on my cheek (I usually don`t get so many pimples on that area and because of that  I suspect it may have been the cream) This is why I only give it a 3-star review. If you`re on the oilier side it may be a bit too greasy and if you`re acne prone it may possibly not be the best choise. If you don`t struggle with oily and blemish prone skin, but have a dull, lifeless complexion or rosacea (without a co-existing acne condition) you should definitely give it a try!",3.0
I love HotTools its the only brand curling iron I have bought for 20 years now but this curling iron doesnt get as hot as my previous ones have and that was the selling point for me. Because I need the high heat to curl my hair so I was really disappointed this particular curling iron doesnt heat properly.,3.0
THE SPRING IS TOO LOOSE AND i CANNOT GET A GOOD GRIP ON MY ENDS OF MY HAIR---NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM IN THE PAST WITH THE SAME PURCHASE----AND IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE TO NOT WORK PROPERLY,3.0
"This tool gives a nice effect of volume and salon blow-out.  I'd give it more stars, but my clamp doesn't shut tightly and my hair falls out if I go to the ends.  Also, the clamp squeaks and drives my husband crazy when we're getting ready in the morning.  Wish the clamp was better!",3.0
To be honest this is my third curling iron I'm looking to buy and under 10 years. It seems like I have to buy a new one every two years. it just stops working. No warning. It just stops heating. But I cannot give it a lower star because it does the job and it makes great curls.,3.0
"I am not sure if I am doing this wrong, but I was hoping for a big blowout look and, while the curls hold a little bit and give me a beautiful wavy look, they're still coming out a little limp. So - 3 stars because it isn't a miracle worker and I thought it would be a little hotter, hold my hair better, etc. But - there could be potential for this user's error :)",3.0
"I always use hot tools because they have worked so well with my medium to thick hair but this curler does not seem to work as well my other hot tool curlers. It heats up well but the curls fall right away and do not last, which is a first for me.",3.0
Good curling iron but was disappointed that it doesn't have auto shut off.,3.0
"The curling iron itself is a great product, and I was pleased with the quality.  I gave it just 3 stars because it's just too big around for my shoulder length hair.  I don't know what I was thinking.  I gave it to my daughter who has much longer hair and it works for her.  The curls soften a lot after about an hour so there ends up not being much curl at all.",3.0
"It does not curl like the picture on the package, it can leave your tips curled but the rest of your hair straight.",3.0

"2"" does not hold curl",3.0
It's OK but too big for my hair and didn't heat up as well as my old rusk curling iron.,3.0
"I've bought two of these, and only because it's the only 2"" curling iron I can find!  Both times I've had to replace them before they're one year old because the cord shorts out and the clip looses and won't clamp down on the hair.  I wish another manufacturer would make this size!  This one works wonderfully for a short period of time BUT be prepared to have to replace it.  I have given up on Hot Tools 2"" and gone to Babyliss 1.5"" and am happy!",3.0
"I like the size, but the clip bent from the heat of the iron.",3.0

"Curl doesn't hold for very long, but the handle is easy to use.",3.0

"Gets hot really fast like all Hot Tools, but it's a little too big and doesn't hold a curl too well. My hair is naturally curly and holds curls really well, but this one is a little too big.

"The iron itself is very nice and I'm sure works great. My problem with it is it is SO BIG!!!

"I purchased this curing iron as I have long hair (down to mid-back, not super thick, easily holds curls) and have been looking for a larger diameter barrel to create soft waves. I have a 1 inch barrel curling rod that I have been using for years which gives great curls and was looking for the larger softer curls that a larger barrel could offer. I also have a Hot Tools 1 inch curling iron which I have been very pleased with for a couple years now. For some reason, this curling iron does not seem to get as hot, as I don't really get the large barrel curl that I'm looking for, if anything, it will just kind of give a soft curl to the ENDS of my hair without anything higher up along my hair. I've tried using very small pieces of hair to curl and still end up with the same softly curled end, which is great if that was the look I was going for. Not sure if I should have gone with a smaller barrel (maybe 1.5 inch?) as this may just be a bit too large (is that possible?) Either way, I love this brand, and will keep the iron.",3.0
"This really doesn't get that hot, and I was somewhat disappointed because I normally love this brand. It had almost no effect on my hair.",3.0
"Works great. Barrel is very large, the curl turns is more of a wave when done. Would recommend for longer hair.",3.0
Doesn't curl. Just created a flip at the ends of your hair.,3.0

"I had seen a lot of YouTube beauty gurus use this curling iron and so I had really high hopes, but I was unfortunately a little disappointed.  Didn't hold my curl as well as I had hoped and my hair would get pinched and ripped out by the clamp.",3.0
"I was really excited to get this curling iron I  really was,  I am a hair tools hoarder and i do hair styling as well.
so i had eyed this at my local sally's beauty supply and well that it. I had to finally buy it and i ordered it on here.
Let me start with saying that i have blonde processed hair. so i don't expect for my hair to get that awesome curl, however i was expecting this to add waved body to my hair. It did not. i had to hold over 30 seconds before it gave me a ""swirl"" i would be satisfied with. I tried this on one of my clients ""virgin"" hair if you will and same. I will keep it because i hate the hassle of exchanging but it will not be the first curling iron i reach for. Will serve as a back up.",3.0
"It doesn't have an auto off button. Also the ""stand"" gets pretty warm so moving the stand out of the way once it is heated is tricky. This curling iron is better suited to professionals, who keep it heated and who have metal holders and aren't relying on the ""stand"".",3.0
so big didn't curl my hair well.,3.0
"great size for long hair or if you just want some wave to your hair. I have a bob hair style so I use it to give volume.

reason of 3 star is because the light of On/Off and the Temp control dial are not working.",3.0
"This is a high-quality tool that's easy to use and okay for the price. But, after seeing all the rave reviews, I expected it to really smooth out my hair. Instead, it left my (otherwise-healthy) hair limp and a bit fried-looking. I'm going for a good ceramic curling iron next time.",3.0
"If you are looking for a curler, this is not for you, it mostly straightens my hair adding a little bit of volume.",3.0

I love the curls it made but unfortunately it's not made as well as I expected. I bought my 1st and it just stopped working. My 2nd one the handle spring broke. Very disappointed !!,3.0
"This iron is more for big waves, but take forever to heat up and then doesn't get very hot.  I have another 2 inch curling iron and gets hot quick and stays hot.",3.0
Does what it says it does. My daughter likes it but it seems the springs wear out quick.  2nd one we have bought.,3.0
"I bought this curling iron because Jilbere doesn't make my favorite anymore. The Jilbere was like a flat iron but for curling hair, it had heating plates on both sides. I could curl my thick, long hair in ten minutes! I am not aure why that kind of curling iron isn't made anymore so i went with the best option I could find.

This curling iron heats up lightning fast. But i do think this will work for those who want more of a wave, it will not give you tight curls. My hair is naturally straight. This iron gives my hair more of a smooth, shiny, finished look. It curls my hair at the ends and I do like the sleek look.

After reading other reviews, I am reluctant to crank the heat all the way up. I have it at about 3/4s of the way up. The swivel cord is great and I love the thin handle because my hands are fairly small. I also appreciate the tip of the iron which does not get hot and helps with the process.",3.0
takes forever to heat up not sure why its quite annoying when your on the go not very pleased so far,3.0
"Liked my previous one but the spring for the clamp broke after about a year. Went ahead and bought another one hoping it wouldn't happen again. It came with extra springs so it must be a common problem and known by the  seller/manufacturer. So, as long as I can replace the spring when it breaks I'm happy",3.0
"the product is okay, however the curls drop quite quickly and the different heat setting do not seem to have that much of an effect upon the curl or its durability",3.0
"I usually use a 1 inch curling iron for my long (about 6 inches below shoulders), thick hair, but decided to try for bigger curls and waves. I purchased the Hot Tools 2 inch iron after a friend gave me rave reviews. I have used it a few times and I like it, but don't love it. Sometimes I see small clamp marks in my hair which drives me crazy and I feel the clamp release is a little awkward. On the other hand, the iron gives off nice even heat and most of the time I receive the desired style.",3.0
"I had a curling iron years ago that was extra-hot and it seems to me that it got hotter than this one does. Also the cord on this thing is very aggravating. It has a swivel feature but it gets wound tight anyway, in a skinny minute. I'm always having to unravel it and I find that annoying. Other than that, the performance of this curling iron is acceptable.",3.0
"I have really long hair that is fairly thin. Even on the highest heat setting, the most this iron does is straighten my hair with a light curl at the end. It doesn't even give me any volume. I have had only Hot Tools curling irons my whole life and I love their products. I was under the impression that this woukld give me big loose curls or waves even, but it doesn't. I have easy-to-curl hair too, so it's not just me. I think I'd be better off with a 1.5 inch iron. If you are looking for curl: get a smaller iron. I've used it maybe three times and will probably keep it but not use it very often since all it does is straighten.",3.0
"It's ok, and for the price, can't complain too much.  It is very heavy, and it's not so much the weight as that it is lopsided and being very heavy on one end makes it awkward to hold and use.  I bought this to replace a very old 2 inch barrel that I used to straighten my hair.  I'll need to play around with the heat settings more, but is seems to ""stick"" in my hair and I don't get that smooth easy action that I need to straighten my very thick hair.",3.0
"While this iron heats up nicely, the spring and clip do not hold onto the hair tightly and the hair slips through before you can roll it up.  I have purchased this item twice and same issue both times.",3.0
"Item is heavier than I expected, doesn't really curl the hair but it does give volume and body. Thank you",3.0
"ok, doesn't heat up as well as I had anticipated, I find that a lot in this product. wouldn't buy one again",3.0
"If the 2"" curling iron is meant to just give your hair some volume then this curling does its job.  It won't really curl your hair in a traditional sense.  The barrel being 2"" helps to efficiently curl all my hair in a short time.  I have long hair half way down my back.  The good thing about this iron is that it does tame all my frizzy hair and makes it shiny.  I would have been happy with having just slight curls and some volume except it wasn't long before my hair straightened out again.  It's disappointing because compared to the Hot Tools 1 1/2"" curling iron (that I also own) the 1 1/2""  does a great job curling and it lasts even a couple of days.  Unfortunately I'll have to return the 2"".",3.0
I have already purchased 3 of these and once again the spring is broke.  I love the size and the heat but something needs to be done about the spring.,3.0
This iron is not bad but also not the best. My old Revlon iron did a better job than this one does.,3.0
"I am on my third of these curling irons.  Right there that tells you something, right?  This iron is perfect for my long, wavy hair, because it gives nice soft curls and smooths frizz.  However, they are dealing with a serious manufacturer's error that they're not bothering to remedy.  The spring that allows you to open the iron and for it to clamp down on your hair doesn't last long at all.  So, they give you an additional spring.  That's great, but it still extends the life of your iron to maybe a year, after which both springs are broken and it's time to replace it.  It heats up quickly and gets hot enough for me.  If there was another manufacturer who made a curling iron with a two-inch barrel, I would try it.  Unfortunately, until I find one, I'll keep buying these once a year.  (Then again- maybe that's their plan!)",3.0
"The iron was delivered on time, but when I used it on the highest level it will not put a curl in my hair! I have long hair, almost to my butt, and I wanted a product that would give me big curls. I used a curl busting moose and with dry hair tried to create a curl, although it does give my hair beautiful waves, it will not curl! So if you have long hair and want something that will give you curls, this is not a good buy. But if you want something that gives none frizzy waves, then this is the product for you!",3.0
"I've tried this 2'' iron a couple times now, and I'm still not seeing curls. Maybe the barrel is too wide? I have long hair so I thought the 2'' would work well...maybe not? I have the 1 1/4'' one, and I love that one. I gave it 3 stars because I still like Hot Tool Professional products.

I will give this 2'' iron another shot. There's a GOOD chance I don't know the correct way to curl hair haha so I will see if I can get this to work another time ;)",3.0
"First thing: this iron does not have an auto-off switch! I assumed it did since all of my other ones do and it got so hot through the day when I forgot to turn it off that it burned through its own wire and the countertop. Technically that was my fault, but almost all other brands have the shutoff, it's bad that this one doesn't.

After about one year of great use, the hinge and clamp were no longer tightly closing anyway. It made curling so frustrating. The look it gives when working is great, but check out other 2-inch irons first. Most of my other tools last a few years.",3.0
"I should have listened to the previous reviewers. This curling iron is so big that it straightens the mid section of the hair and curls like a blow dryer on the bottom of the hair. It heats up very quickly and it holds my hair. However, I was looking for loose curls. I suppose now I am going to give the 1 1/2"" curling iron a try.",3.0
"I have used this wonderful iron for YEARS and love it... trouble is the frustrating barrel SPRING! It comes with 2 replacement springs and you'll need them because they BREAK! Once the first one breaks, it's all down hill from there. Although the iron does a great job straightening hair while giving it a slight and flattering bend, it has ZERO long-term durability. I used to be able to purchase replacement springs at Hot Tools, but they would charge over $5 for each spring plus another $7 dollars to ship them--because as you know, the cost of tiny little springs mailed in tiny little envelopes is SO expensive *@#*!  By the time you've purchased 2 more replacement springs, you've paid half the cost of the unit!

I spoke to a customer svc person at Hot Tools and mentioned there was a real issue with the barrel springs on their irons. I asked why they don't address the issue and improve their product, she awknowledged that it was a recognized issue, but said that's why they sell the replacement springs. So basically, they know it's a real issue, but rather than address it and improve their product line, they prefer to make more money off of you by overcharging you for replacement springs--again, not only on the springs themselves, but on the shipping too. What a rip off. This really could be a wonderful product if they would just put their Quality Control team to work over there.",3.0
"I would recommend this iron ONLY if you have thin hair (which I do).  The other reviews are true, if you have thick hair this iron is too big to curl it (even though it gets smokin' hot!  I've already burnt my scalp twice!). The iron is no thrills, but it's cheap, so it's a deal for the money. Thick hair types find a smaller curler, I would recommend a 1 1/2"", which I had before I bought this one.  I'll probably go back to that width once this one blows.",3.0
"The 2"" diameter is also too large for the length of my hair. Although it is well past the shoulders, it does not reach the bra strap line at my back. The result is the ends are curled but my hair is just not long enough to spiral or curl more than once. I have used the highest setting and the curl only lasts about an hour or 2 despite hairspray, perhaps due to humidity.

Not good for travel since this only works on 110v sockets.",3.0

"i personally didn't like this 2"" curling iron bc the barrel is too wide... if you have hair length that's half as long as your torso, i wouldn't recommend this product bc your hair wouldn't be long enough to be curled with this. since i have thin hair, this product didn't clamp onto it very well... it kept slipping out of the clamp when i turn it. also, the heat didn't get as hot as fast as i would like it to. maybe if you had really, really long and thick hair, this product would work for you.",3.0
"This iron did work well. However, within a short amount of time (a few months), the iron started to smell. I thought it needed a good cleaning, but that didn't seem to fix it. If I use the iron, my hair smells (others notice it). I can use other irons with no issues.",3.0
"I bought this item through a lightning deal. Overall,it is a good item. Even though I haven't been able to use this item as often as I should,I think this product will work better if your hair is not too thick. My hair is very thick and I think I should've gone with a  smaller than a 2 inch. I don't regret buying it. Hot tools has great products which is why I bought this item. It is definately an item that I can live without.",3.0
It's okay but I've had better vitamin c products.  It's a little too greasy for my liking and the bottle doesn't even last 30 days if you want to get a decent coverage on your face and neck.

"Style in Play is a nice spring/summer fragrance that is dominated by green apple.  Initially I notice the apple and musk in the background.  The apple note lasts quite awhile actually, more than most top notes do, but eventually I can smell some jasmine, but not much.  On the dry down I get a pretty standard patchouli, vetiver mix.  All in all Style in Play is a nice, simple fragrance that is inexpensive, lasts a good amount of time and produces a nice range of sillage - not too overpowering or soft.  Good for anyone who has decided to begin wearing a fragrance, as it's not overly complicated.  I wouldn't likely purchase this for myself, but I would wear it if someone bought it for me.  I acquired my bottle in a trade for a fragrance I didn't like.  Anyway, not great, but pretty good.",3.0

"I've been through many other cologne reviews and in lots of them I see people complaining about the fragrences quality.
Although I've been really surprised with the amazing scent, I must say that in less than 2 hours the smell is all gone.

"I have been experiencing more age-related skin worries over the past few months. I bought these pads after reading many of the reviews.

After a month of using these (one pad per day), I can't say I've noticed any difference in my skin texture and emerging fine lines. They do sting a little on my face, until the solution dries. I'll keep using them as my skin does feel a little cleaner, and I prefer these over the drugstore cleansing pads, but I'm not sure I would order more.

I'll update my post if I see a difference after this, but otherwise I think these are ""just okay"".",3.0
The pads are easy to use but leave a sticky residue on your skin. I prefer the glycolic creams that absorb into the skin a bit more.,3.0
Ok so I stared with the 10% pads and now moved up to the 20%. There is a sting at first. But ive had no peeling. I did end up with red bumps across my cheeks. I will probably use these every few days and come back and review any findings,3.0

Probably will not repurchase.",3.0
the product is fine but leaves a stick residue on the skin,3.0
Gave it three stars because I can't tell if it is making a difference.  There is nothing dramatic going on.  There is some stinging when I use it 4-5 days in a row--then I stay off of it for a few days.  Sorry I can't be more helpful.,3.0

And they dried out my chin and jaw area incredibly. So I decided to back off and use every other day, and I also make sure to squeeze out the excess solution from each pad before using, and that has seemed to help. Will continue using despite the burn.",3.0
"I usually buy the AVON resurfacing pads but decided to give this one a try since it had more pads. 60 VS 30 for the same price did not seem so bad. This one smells a lot like the Stridex Pads you buy at a drugstore. It did an OKAY job, but I still prefer AVON one.",3.0
"I am giving it a chance, but it does not look like what I ordered....does not look like what is pictured. I am hoping for good results still. Not performing as I had hoped from other reviews.",3.0
"For me, I'm not sure if this product did much, either positive or negative. I bought it seeking results in both anti-aging and anti-acne, and didn't see much impact. However I did find it a more high-quality alternative to using, say, those drugstore acne pads with salicylic acid, which dry out your skin excessively. It felt like a gentler and more effective way to give my face a quick rubdown to remove excess oil.

I will warn that those with sensitive skin should use caution. I was particularly aggressive using the pads on an area of my upper arm (of all places) that had both active acne and acne scars. After using the pads in that area at least twice a day, I found it left the skin there with almost a sandpapery texture. I also used them on my chest, and experienced some redness. On my face, I didn't see any negative effects, but I'm also not sure if there was a tangible improvement to my acne or aging issues (i.e. lines and dark spots).

It seems like the product would work best as a mere add-on to other products you find effective.",3.0
Its ok..its too mild for me. I like the Avon Retexturizing Glycolic Peel pads better,3.0
53 with freckles and several dark spots. Read all the great reviews and ordered the product. Unfortunately I didn't notice any difference. Seems 20% is not strong enough for me.

"Middling price, middling results. I use the pads primarily on my forehead to treat a few incipient wrinkles on my forehead (FYI- I'm 25). I tried using it on the rest of my face, but it was just too irritating.  I would NOT recommend using this product on ares of your face with active acne and / or in combination with topical acne treatment (as I found out the hard way - shame on me for that one). After a few weeks of regular use, my forehead feels a little smoother, and has not broken out.

I give this product a mild recommendation for people in their 20's-30's who are largely past the acne stage in their life and are looking to prevent (or at least delay) the onset of fine lines / wrinkles. Rentin-A or another prescription retinol-based topical may be more effective, though they will certainly be more expensive.

And as always, be sure to wear sunscreen! :)",3.0

This would be a great lipstick if the color were more intense and if it would stay on for longer than 15 minutes.,3.0
"This review is for the color ""Lola,"" which, on me, is pretty close to the natural color of my lips.  It adds a touch of depth to the color, but it's fairly conservative.  If you're not into bold lip colors, or you're playing up your other makeup for the day, this could be a good choice.  It's a warmer color, so it would be best for people with warm or neutral undertones.

I do find this reasonably moisturizing and easy to apply, although it's not terribly long lasting.  I just finished breakfast (I usually eat at my desk and have at least one mug of tea during breakfast) and I am already feeling the need to reapply it.

This has more of a matte finish.  It is probably best to use it on lips in good condition because it shows all the vertical lines in my lips.  (I don't have chapped lips right now but, if you do, this would probably highlight that.  Best to exfoliate a few times and keep your lips moisturized and use this later, when your lips are in better shape.)

One thing to be concerned about is that this doesn't seem too secure in the tube.  So I would say not to twist it up too high when you apply it, or you might end up with it breaking off.  (Mine was in fine shape, but I just felt a little ""give"" so I thought I would offer a warning.)

In the end, this is a decent product if you're careful and your lips are in good condition.  But it isn't perfect, and it may not work for everyone.  Also please note that some colors may contain carmine, which is animal-derived.  Therefore, this may not be a vegan product -- it depends on the color.  I do not know of a way to determine which colors contain carmine and which don't.  (You can see the full ingredients list if you zoom in on the product images.)",3.0
Like the color but doesn't stay on for very long and is not very moisturizing as state.,3.0
"Tends to be drying despite it's name,  but a very pretty natural looking color.
I just  use chapstick along with it.",3.0
"This lipstick went on well, felt good going on, and lives up to the hydrating claim, but it didn't last as long as expected.

My one real complain is the color.  The color (as viewed on my computer which I know can vary) looks like a rich pinkish plum color, but when I wore it it was much more vibrant and hot pinkish and had more of a matte finish instead of a sheen or gloss.  I generally buy colors similar to Whitney so it was a bit of a shock and disappointment when trying this one on.  I guess I also assumed that since it was hydrating that it would have a subtle sheen to it....not necessarily a gloss but not a matte either.

I don't think I'll be getting lipstick online again because there are just too many color variations.",3.0
"Lovely color, hydrating and nice feel, but the fragrance was very unappealing. Reminded me of an old Merle Norman 'cold cream' product my mom used for years and years. Couldn't get past the scent of the product to continue wearing it. Color wasn't the best shade for my lighter tones either. (reviewed by my wife ;-)",3.0
"The formula of this lipstick is quite good.  It claims to be hydrating and it feels nice and moisturizing on the lips.  It did not dry out my lips at all, and it felt good while wearing.  The color, however, leaves a bit to be desired.  The lipstick I received looks entirely different from the color sample on the order page.  The ""Whitney"" color on the order page appears to be a medium pinkish-plum.  What I got was really a light shade of hot pink.  It's the sort of shade that can work for a dramatic evening look, but is not really suited to daywear.  That in and of itself is fine, but when one wears a statement lipstick one needs dramatic, saturated color, and the moisturizing formula means that this color is more sheer than saturated.  In the end, there was no way to make this look good.  My skin had definite pink undertones, and I look good in most pink lipsticks, but this one didn't work.  It's a kind of shocking color that's impossible to put on in a shocking fashion.",3.0
"I was very excited to try this lipstick!  However, the shade didn't really come out on me like in the picture.  On my lips, it looked like a bright, cool, pink/purple.  I have pale skin with warm tones so this was pretty much the worst shade I've ever tried on me personally.  I left it on for a while to see how it felt, and after about 30 minutes my lips felt pretty dry and waxy.  I think if you have cool-toned skin and want a bright shade, you should try this.  But be aware that you might need to apply clear gloss to keep your lips hydrated-feeling.  Hope this helps!",3.0
"I'm little torn in my opinion of this Jouer Hydrating Lipstick, because while it is a nice high-end lipstick, it does not quite live up to its own hype. It applies very smoothly, and the pigment is bright and rich and opaque. However, I don't find it to be moisturizing at all, and that is what the main benefit of this product is supposed to be.

My lipstick is in the color ""Whitney."" Judging from the color on the screen, I expected this lipstick to be a rose color. It is not. It is a bright bubblegum, Barbie pink. This color will flatter a number of skin tones; unfortunately, mine is not one of them.

The packaging is a very attractive brushed gold, with a heft that lives up to its high-end price tag. My one issue is that the bullet of lipstick will not stay up. When I try to swatch the color on my hand or apply it to my lips, the pressure on the tip of the bullet rolls it right back down into the base. I'm not sure if this issue affects all Jouer lipsticks or if I just received a finicky one, but it makes the product somewhat difficult to use.

Overall, this is a nice enough product, even though I didn't care for the color. If the packaging didn't make this hard to use, I would say that it was worth the purchase price.",3.0
"I think that lipstick color, much like liquid makeup, has a tendency to react with the oils and underlying skin tones of each individual, therefore as colors go, one shade may vary from person to person.  I received a tube of Whitney and when I used it I found that the color on me was a very pale pink.  A second and third coat did darken it somewhat, but not much.  The vitamins and hydrating ingredients present in the product lived up to the claims offering not only protection but making my lips look and feel smooth (eliminating that dry, parched look).  As for the ""staying power"" of this product, I found that it wore off easily and had to be reapplied several times a day.

In defense of this particular product, I will say that other lipsticks I have used that had great staying power, also tended to be very drying - so it appears that this is a situation where compromises have to be made.  Either you use a product that you only apply once a day and suffer the consequences of looking like you have been trekking across the Mojave Desert for weeks, or you use a product like JOUER that requires several re-applications, but leaves your lips feeling and looking great.  Decisions, decisions!!  It's up to you.  3 1/2 stars",3.0
"When my wife originally put this lipstick on she liked it fairly well saying that it didn't go on very smooth but it gave a nice matte, saturated and very pink coloring. However, after less than an hour the color had started to fade to the point that it was hardly visible any longer. Having to reapply every hour to maintain the saturated, matte pink look didn't sit well with her.",3.0
"This lip stick comes in a variety of colors. It goes on smooth, looks moist, and does not stain the lips. The problem is that it does not stay fresh looking long enough for me. Every 2 hours I have to check on it. The price is not great either. (Currently it is twenty-two dollars. That is more than most department stores charge for their expensive brands.)

I usually use a Lancome brand. But when money is tight, I have been able to find a few Cover Girls that work just as well - at a lot less cost.

"The color of Jouer Whitney is bright pink in the tube but more subtle when applied, since it goes on sheer.

The texture is fine but not especially creamy.  The color is better for cool-toned, light-skinned complexions instead of warmer complexions.  It's not neutral but it's also subdued enough for everyday or daytime use.",3.0
"This set comes with everything you'll need. Body wash, baby foam shampoo, diaper rash treatment, lotion and no rinse cleansing water. Honestly I don't like the smell. It's too strong for me, and the scent just doesn't appeal to me at all. The foam shampoo works great and so does the body wash. The diaper cream has taken care of rashes. The cleansing water does its job and the lotion we really don't use. We only used the wash for a little bit as I don't like the fragrance. It's good for people who don't mind but I think it takes away from the baby smell and it doesn't smell like a kid it's more of a public restroom handwash smell.",3.0
"The package is nice, and each bottle is a good size. However, the bottles were taped into the box with double sided sticky pads that did not want to come off the bottles, because of this my bottles were always falling over. However, the package comes with 5 baby cleaning essentials. 1 The Foam Shampoo for Newborns, the pump sometimes sticks on the bottle, but it does come out in a nice puff of foam. Washes into the hair nicely and seems to leave the skin flake free and the hair clean and without tangles. 2. Gentle Cleansing Gel does a nice job cleaning the skin and making it soft but makes my bathtub floor slippery. My child has cried every time this soap has gotten in his eyes They say that it is supposed to be tear free, but he reacts as if it burns his eyes. Has a pleasant clean smell to it. Comes out like handsoap consistency. 3. No-Rinse Cleansing Water I have not had a need to use it. But it is to give the baby a bath when water is not near by. 4. Hydra B&eacute;b&eacute; Body Lotion, has a nice consistency to it, had a pleasing smell, and does make my babies skin soft. Doesn't feel tacky or oily when applying. 5. Diaper Rash Cream, I used it on my son who had a little mild redness from a pooh. I applied the diaper rash cream after his shower and before bedtime. The next morning the rash appeared to be the same. I used butt-cream, and it by the next diaper change the rash was almost gone. The products seem to be nice, and the fact that they are all natural and organic is nice. Each product doesn't have a perfume smell which is nice, but rather a soft clean scent.",3.0

First, it's not nearly fragrant enough while burning; second, it produces an unbelievable amount of smoke, and it left a sooty reside on everything in my apartment after burning; and third, it burned way to fast for my liking. I burned the entire thing and I found that it burns like 3 times faster than any other candle of similar quality that I've purchased in the past and I am not exaggerating when I say that I found a sooty reside on literally every surface of my apartment after burning. This candle smells high quality, but I can't say that it holds up to the quality you would normally expect from a candle of this price point.",3.0

I got the powder in ""Cool Beige,"" and it was slightly more orange colored than I was expecting. However, I do like that the Cool Beige doesn't give you flashback and looks natural in pictures. I didn't like the applicator- it is a big, fluffy cotton ball-like thing that is hard to control and know where the powder is being applied.

"While I like the setting powder a lot, the spray does not work very well for me. It makes my makeup last all day, but it is drying and enhances the appearance of fine lines.

"I ordered this for my 18 year-old daughter who loves makeup. She says the setting powder does it's job by keeping makeup from creasing, especially the under eye concealer. However, it's white and leaves a white cast even after it's baked (with a damp makeup sponge). This would probably show up white on flash photos. (If given the choice, she would have ordered a colored powder and given the product a higher rating because it would have been a good dupe for Laura Mercier powder.) You can reduce this by adding more foundation powder but this just causes you to set your makeup twice. My daughter says the setting spray is just okay. The mist isn't fine enough and leaves big droplets on your face. It also smells a little strange. Overall, she says the products work but aren't good enough to justify the price.",3.0
"Being a derma blend make fan when this setting set didn't blow me away, I waited awhile to write my review and continued to use this thinking maybe it would get better. For me, it is just not meeting my expectation of what it should do. For me the spray is worthless. It doesn't hold my makeup in place at all. The translucent powder is a little better, but just a little.

I don't use the powder puff that came with it, I use a makeup brush. I tap some powder into the lid and dust my face generously with the powder and let it sit for a few while I do something else to get ready for the day. I come back about 3 minutes later and gently remove any remaining powder which is usually very little. It gives me a nice matte look,  can't say it set my make up in place well enough that I would say it is a must-have item. Now their makeup is definitely a must-have Item!",3.0

"This Dermablend makeup setting kit has some plusses and minuses.  You first apply a concealer and gently blend over your face.  This is not included in the kit so you get to choose one that best matches your skin tone.

Then tap the setting powder into the cap and apply with the powder brush.  The hard part is just using a tiny amount.  If you go heavy handed youll be shining a spotlight on wrinkles and crevices. Then you use the setting spray by spritzing it into the sponge, tapping the damp sponge into the powder in cap and gently dabbing onto covered facial area. After a few minutes brush the area a few times.

The secret handshake to make this product work perfectly (and it can work perfectly) is to use a light hand  and then back off to an even lighter hand.  It may take a few tries but with practice youll get very nice results.

What comes in kit:  1 jar of setting powder  I 3.4 oz container spray.",3.0

"The secret with this seems to be only putting on very little at a time. At first, my wife really didn't seem to like it, since the powder would show up over her makeup (not expecting that since it's ""translucent"") and concealer and then she'd basically have to wash it all off and start all over (her skin tone is not ultra-fair, with most of her makeup products being in the ballpark of natural to medium). Once she started applying it more lightly and blending, the results were a lot better. It did seem to set things better and didn't cause any issues with her rosacea (no flare-ups and did seem to help conceal it better than her usual concealer did on its own). It also provides a nice matte finish and doesn't rub off easily. It's not her favorite, but for right now, it'll do.",3.0
"Maybe I'm not applying it correctly or something, but it just hasn't worked for me as effectively as I was expecting.

I have a surgery scar on my neck that I cover with makeup. I got this powder to set the makeup in place. But I found that the make-up still gets smudged on my shirt if it comes in contact with my neck. So, I definitely don't think this product is smudge and transfer-resistant, as it claims. I have tried it with both Dermablend and non-Dermablend makeup with the same results.

On the plus side, it does give the make-up a smoother, matte look which I like. So, for that reason, I will likely continue using it, but only until I can find a better product that is smudge-resistant.",3.0

I'm not having any luck with Expensive full coverage make up products the only product that looks flawless an airbrushed is Maybelline",3.0
"There is some definite good and bad about this product for me.  Here is the thing - I received the tinted version of this powder.  If I had received the colorless version this might have been a much better review.

At first glance the powder appeared to be a good match for my skin. My routine includes moisturizer, primer, liquid foundation and occasionally a colorless setting powder.  I subbed this in for the setting powder and ended up looking like a cheeto.  The color of the powder became bright orange when applied on top of my foundation.

I tried again without the foundation to see if (since it had color) it would just sit on top of the moisturizer and primer as a foundation - and I was back to orange.

The good news - it didn't irritate my skin, and as a setting powder it did work really well - if it hadn't had the color involved.  The color issue will keep me from purchasing this again - although I imagine that the colorless powder would work really well - I haven't tried it.  My suggestion would be to try this in the color free version if you are looking for a setting powder.",3.0
"I should begin by saying that my review likely would have been different if I had got the translucent color instead of Cool Beige. I loved the product itself, but really disliked the color of Cool Beige.

Application: This setting powder comes in a standard 1oz plastic jar. The lid screws off and there are holes to allow you to sift the powder out a bit at a time. It came with a fuzzy applicator puff but I felt like that was wasting a lot of product so I switched to my usual brush. The directions say to apply liberally and buff off after letting it set for 2 minutes. Unfortunately, the Cool Beige tint of the powder really darkened my foundation (currently using Dermablend mousse foundation) in uneven patches so I was unable to use as directed. When applying just a tiny amount with my brush and quickly blending I could minimize the darkening and prevent the splotching effect. I was really surprised that it darkened my foundation as much as it did and in such an uneven way. I have used tinted setting powder before and my skin is not at all pale. For reference, I wear an NC35 in MAC.

Wear: After I got over the quirk of it darkening my foundation, I was pleased with how it extended the wear of my foundation. It gave a nice matte look without looking or feeling dry. My skin stayed fairly oil and smudge free for over 16 hours. I expect the results may have been even more favorable if I was able to apply generously as directed. Once I get through the Cool Beige, I will repurchase in the translucent color and update my review.",3.0
"We tested this setting powder on very light skin and in dry, Southern California climate.  It was just a bit too dark, but it did set and maintain throughout the day.

Keep in mind though that the ingredients are not great- parabens were very high up on the list, more so than the color pigments.  Dermablend is not going to be a regular part of our makeup cabinet",3.0
"I use Lancome's liquid foundation followed by their compact, but I was really wanting something to help set my makeup a little better and control shine, etc...

This simply didn't do the job.  First off, my major issue is the design. I use a Kabuki brush for my face and the design of the holes is SO Wal-mart grade makeup... it just is painful to get a proper amount on your brush and not make a mess.  That's my major issue with this one.  So naturally you end up using too little or too much, and once you shake off too much into the top area it's stuck there, there's no getting it back into the bottom.

As far as setting powder, it works, it just doesn't help with shine at all and honestly I saw no difference between this and using my more ""compact"" type foundation as a setting powder instead.  I would suggest using something along those lines with a Kabuki brush, it's easier to control the amount and still does the same thing.",3.0
"applied this Dermablend to half my face, just so I could accurately review my own experience in a comparison with my usual makeup routine. To be fair, note that I don't have the Dermablend foundation and instead used my own mineral liquid foundation, so my results may not be as they'd be with someone who uses both together.

What I found is:
-I couldn't really see a marked difference between one side of my face and the other, as far as how it looked, and I looked under different lights. It may have been a little different but it was so slight that it made it negligible. I didn't want to apply more, but maybe it calls for more, or it calls for the Dermablend foundation to work together.
-The side with the Dermablend powder did set my makeup better. When I took a white tissue and rubbed across both sides of my face, the side without the Dermablend powder had more come away on the tissue than on the side that had the Dermablend powder.
-I didn't see any caking or noticeable powder residue, but I buffed my face really well with a buffing makeup brush after the 2-3 minutes of setting. I will suggest to women who say they have peach fuzz on their face to consider epilators - they run from the gamut of prices so you can find one. Having a smooth face helps your makeup go on smooth, and the powders won't sit atop the skin.
-I didn't feel made up - it didn't sit heavy on my skin.
-it's messy. Be careful opening it the first time, and every time really. The big white powder puff thing is ridiculously puffy-big and you have to work the lid back on over it - I'll likely throw that away and use my big buffing brush on the days I want to use a powder - like if it's going to be humid and I need extra setting (this wouldn't be something I'd need in the dry weather times in the mountains, but I could see needing this when I visit Down South in the humidity!).
-The color looked dark on the white puff when I first looked at it, but on my face it blended nicely.

It's difficult to review this fairly, really, without having the Dermablend foundation. My experience using my own foundation was mixed. But, the Dermablend isn't super expensive and there's enough to last a very long time.

If you need a setting powder and like the Dermablend brand, then I do recommend this. Otherwise, I'm neutral about this product, since I am very happy with the way my regular foundation looks and sets. However, as written above, I'd use this when visiting Down South where it is super humid and I need a little more setting to keep my makeup from sliding off!",3.0

"When I used the dermablend cream with this powder it cracked after a couple hours of wear, making it look like I had a horrible skin disease. It's hard to tell for sure if the cream was the culprit or the powder, but I'm pretty sure it was the cream (which was rated a 1) since it's hard to rate this when it was used with a bad product, I am giving it a neutral 3.",3.0
"Don't notice a difference in longevity of the foundation but it does give a nice matte finish, if you're looking for that.",3.0

Very expensive. Regular powder works just as well and costs a fraction of the price of this product.,3.0
"I have used this setting powder with DermaBlend Cover Cream, as suggested, as well as the Estee Lauder foundation that I use everyday. Here are the pros and cons:

Pros
-Better price than higher end setting powders. I like being able to apply liberally and completely eliminating that sticky foundation feel.
-Does give you the feeling that your make up is totally locked in place
-Lasts extremely well...if I sleep in my makeup (gross, I know) it looks nearly exactly the same in the morning.
-It comes in a large container relative to the price.

Cons
-Makes my face look really white
-Difficult to get much color payout from any powders going on top of this (i.e. have to apply double the normal amount of bronzer)
-I feel like it looks cakey, makes it very obvious that I'm WEARING MAKEUP, nothing looks natural about this (although it's worth it if coverage is most important to you)
-Clogs pores. A lot of setting powders do, just given the nature of what a setting powder's purpose is, this wasn't unexpected but I do feel like it's worse than others I've tried.
-Skin can definitely not breathe in this, but again, not really a factor if your goal is simply the best coverage possibly",3.0
"This powder seems a little thicker than what I've purchased locally in a store... it has a ""starchy"" consistency, almost like cornstarch and I can't help but wonder if this product is authentic.

"This is touted as a setting powder which is supposed to provide smudge-resistance, and enhance the wearability of dermablend coverage products for up to 16 hours.  I bought this expecting that it would do exactly that, but unfortunately, it does not live up to its claims.  My 'regular' power works as well as this does and costs less.",3.0
I purchased this product because I purchasded the Dermablend Cover cream and  the only way it stays on your skin for the 16 hours is if its combined with this. Now I did my makeup at 10:00am and it was still in tact no touch ups at 10:00pm to go out. The only negative is it doesnt change the cover of your makeup but wipes is out so you look pale even if you blend well. So I suggest spraying Mac fix plus afterwords it brings the color back to your face.,3.0

"I tried three Ouidad gels, Climate Control, Tress Effects, and this Curl Quencher.  This one is by far the best of the three.

It smells great and unisex, not girly.  I give only 3 stars because it seems to have zero hold.  Hair looks great wet, great when first dry, but devolves throughout the day into a (healthy feeling) frizzy tumbleweed.  Frizz and nonsense.

If you hate gel, try this one, you may like it.  If you prefer your styling gel to actually help hold your style, this is not a good choice.",3.0

I liked that this product was more mild and natural based then some of the products with harsh chemicals in them.

First, the product says to leave on your face for two minutes, I found this really hard to do, two minutes is a long time to stand in the shower with your eyes shut with a product on your face. So maybe if you are better at waiting two minutes than I am you may see better results.

Second, I think that this is a pretty good product and I would use it again in the future, but I would know that it isn't going to clear my skin, just help it from getting any worse.",3.0

My one and only complaint with this cleanser is that is does not foam into a lather. In a way it's kind of like washing your face with a thick lotion.

I wanted to give the product a try before posting a review on it.  I have been using this twice a day for 10 weeks now.  I know it says to use for 3 months for the full effect but I don't really think a few more weeks will provide any further significant change.  The product is okay.  I purchased it on the recommendation of an esthetician and use it in conjunction with the PCA Retinol Renewal (applied once a day at night.)  I have very sensitive skin and the pigment gel does not seem to bother my skin at all but the retinol does a little if I use it too many days in a row.  I tend to skip the retinol for a day or two if I notice my skin getting irritated and that seems to do the trick.  As for the pigment gel...it has minimally (at best) evened out my skin tone overall but has done NOTHING to lighten my dark spots.  I now totally understand why my dermatologist said that my dark spots can be removed but that it would be very costly and painful - something he did not recommend I try.,3.0
I'm a little disappointed with this product.  I've been using it for about a month and really don't see much difference in the hyper pigmentation.  I also haven't experienced the peeling or exfoliation other reviewers described.,3.0

I bought the Pigment Gel the day after getting home. I followed the directions. On the lighter sunspots, it worked like a charm. After a week, the sunspots dried up and basically rubbed off. My face looked awful during this time. To my dismay, the area on my upper lip barely improved. I have since started using other products--10% glycolic acid and Bremen dark spot eraser. It's getting better slowly. So, my advice is to be patient, try other products. This one, may or may not work, but its worth a try.",3.0
"The pigment gel is ok.  I read the reviews beofre I purchased and it was very true to the description.  I applied to the dark spots on my face and it seems like it burned my skin.

The added bonus is that my skin glowed with this cream to such a point that I can't go a day without it. I hope the new version makes me as happy, but I'm still not sure.",3.0
"Didnt like the oily residue left, did not like scent. Felt like thick sunscreen. Maybe for oily skin.",3.0
"I started using it about 8 months ago.

I've used it just about every night (missed probably ~5 times) seemingly as directed, but still have some of the 6 month supply remaining.

So, even with apparently under applying it I've noticed a benefit from it. I was getting quite thin up front with a wicked widow's peak, and was starting to notice significant thinning on my crown.
I'd say net loss via shedding stopped somewhere around the 3 month mark or so. Over the past couple of months I've seen that the top/crown area is no longer looking on the verge of developing a bald spot. That was never a huge noticeable problem though, so the more obvious improvement has been at the front where the hair line appears to be widening laterally (filling in the widow's peak to a small degree), and then just a general improvement in the coverage. Basically I've lost a lot of the guy on the verge of going bald look, so I'm quite pleased with this product.

The negatives are it of course doesn't smell good, and then also that it takes a long time to work. I've had no adverse/side effects from using this. I've taken multivitamins inconsistently over the same period, but that's about it as far as other types of supplement. Clearly it's not effective for everyone, so there is no guarantee. This is just the account from someone it seemed to work for.

Update: It started causing some scalp irritation, so I've had to cut back on using this product. It's not as useful as I originally thought. Snake oil? Hard to say. My previous gains might have been due to some confounding variable. I'm going to keep giving it a try here for a few months now that I've gotten the irritation under control.",3.0
"March 2014: Will try to update as I go along. Been using this product for about a month every night. No noticeable difference either way, but I agree with most everyone who says it smells and makes the hair oily. I use it before I go to bed, so it's not a big deal to me.",3.0

"I've used this product for a couple of months and it does a good job, but
nothing stellar.  It is better than anything you would find at Walmart or
the supermarket (i.e. Gillete, Colgage, etc) but not too different from a some shaving cream formulas from Kiehls or Art of Shaving.  Believe me, i've tried a bunch of shaving creams and gels and this product TOO EXPENSIVE.
A better bet would be Kiehls shaving formulas which work well to improve my razor bumps and last a lot longer.
I give it 3 stars because of price and also because 1/2 the reviews to date 5/10/08, have come from the South Florida area.  Mens Science is also based in South Florida.  Coincidence - perhaps, but I'm always a skeptic of a small number of reviews.

"My skin type: I have oily skin, black heads on nose and cheeks.  Occasional break outs.
Time using product: 2x a day for the last 3 months.

As the first face wash I've used in many many years I don't have much to compre this one too.  I read multiple reviews on how well this product works and I can't say that it is the miracle cure all some say it is.  It has helped my complexion a bit, maybe by 1-5%, maybe thats all I should expect.  The biggest flaw I have with this face wash is it leaves my skin super shiny, almost like I rubbed polish on my face.  People comment asking why my cheeks and nose are so shiny.  I considered returning the product but figured I'd just use the product in hopes things would get better, things never did.

All in all I will not be purchasing a refill nor would I go out of my way to recommend this face wash.  I understand not every product works for everyone, so maybe this wash just isn't for my bodys chemistry.  I give it 3 stars because I have nothing to compare it too and it has maybe helped my complexion very marginally.",3.0

"I'm not sure how I would describe this product except for very light. It certainly leaves no oily residue and doesn't make your face shine.

"I bought this because of the reviews, and at first I was satisfied. The thing about this is that it leaves a film on your skin. On the face it's not so noticable and makes your skin 'feel' soft, but on your hands it's slick and I always have to wash my hands off as if it were hair product. The other huge downside is the lack of an SPF. I think all skincare products for your face should have at least an SPF15, and I sure did miss it when I went skiing and got burned. I prefer the proactiv moisturizer over this because it leaves no greasy feeling on your face or hands and has SPF15/30. I just don't like giving my money to them, so that's how I ended up trying this product.",3.0

"Alright, having reached a certain age group, I have decided to buy some men's products. I just want to ensure that I age.. ummm.. gracefully. Anyhow, I did notice some unsightly blemishes, freckles, sun spots etc that have popped up on my face and forehead, and reading some rave reviews on-line, I decided to give this product a try. Well what can I say? Does it work?

I have no idea.

I am not noticing any differences in my complexion so I am unable to say so right now. With that said, I am still not finished the product yet and I may revise my review once I am finished however it may be a very long time from now. The size of the container looks small. When I received it, I thought to myself ""$60+ for THIS!!!"", however, it is lasting forever. There is more than enough product contained within to last a lifetime, maybe 2. I have been using this for close to a year and I still have not reached the middle of the container yet so do not let it's size fool you. As far as effectiveness is concerned, for right now, neither nay or yay. Maybe others will have better results with it but I am still optimistic.

As far as the ingredients is concerned, I will not pretend to be an expert, the only ingredients contained that I understand are Purified Water and Aloe Vera, which I am told is wonderful. The scent itself is not too bad or overpowering. I usually put this on after I shower and the scent is mildly pleasant.

But by the looks of it, it may take me 2 lifetimes to finish what is left in the container. Yikes.",3.0
"Very Expensive. I have been using it for about 2 months for the sun spots near the side of my eyes and forehead. So far I have seen them fade a little bit, but that could also be due to it being fall and me not being in the sun as much.  I have plenty left and I only use a little bit on those areas so this product should last me a long time.  So only time will tell.",3.0
"As I have said in other product reviews, I have sensitive skin especially on my face and scalp, so when I try new products, I immediately know whether my face is going to like it or not.

My skin and scalp tends to be sensitive to shaving and gets both oily and dry at the same time.  After using this a few days, this has done well for removing oil, dead skin cells, cleaning dirty pores and left my skin feeling clean and healthier.  This is also fragrance free.

The one thing that does concern me though, besides the price, are the  micro-scrubbing particles that this product uses to provide the abrasiveness.  If you look on the ingredients list, you will see Polyethylene.  Polyethylene, for those that aren't aware, is plastic and in this case little plastic scrubbing beads.  I recently gave up a popular toothpaste after a new report indicated that they were also using similar plastic beads and that there is concern for both possible health and environmental hazards here since this is not biodegradable.  I am not so concerned about health issues since you don't ingest it as environmental in this case.  I like this product but I do wish MS would switch to a more biodegradable scrubbing ingredient.  Considering MS is concerned about such thing as dyes, fragrances, and things of that nature, this should also be a concern to them as well.

Overall, I do like this product but the cost and the micro-scrub ingredients makes me stray from using this product regularly.  4 stars as a product that works well for your skin but I have reservations about using this due to the ingredient concerns so I have to rate as 3 stars instead.

I received this product as a sample for review from MS.",3.0
"As a face scrub for men this is OK. I did not care for the smell (it smells terrible) and I expected more. I have to use face scrub because I have oily skin, but I was dissapointed. I expected more for the price and also it has an awful chemical smell.  I would have to pass on this. I don't understand why they did not add a nice decent fresh scent to it? No one wants to open up a tube and smell a refinery...",3.0
I have oily skin and this cleanses nicely but there are other products I have tried that are better .,3.0
"I needed to start using a face scrub regularly and decided to go with this one as it had great reviews and I've been happy with other Menscience products I've used in the past.  I did notice all the recent reviews were negative, specifically pointing out a change in formula that reduced the scrubbing action.  But I decided to roll the dice anyways given the longer history of very positive reviews.

The scrub feels great for the first few seconds... but then the scrubbing beads breakdown and completely disappear, and it feels like a regular lotion/facewash as someone else mentioned.  You can squeeze more out of the tube but the beads will dissolve just as fast.  It's amazing when it works, and if it lasted I can see why the past reviews were so overwhelmingly favorable.  But for the length of effectiveness it isn't worth the cost at any price (and especially at this price point).",3.0

I think my expectations may have been too high for the product, but I was underwhelmed by the fibers' ability to stick to the hair, especially during any styling after application.

Its okay but not as good as Xfusion. I love that the mini bottle fits perfect for trips but the powder is kinda messy. It will get on my fingers when running my them through my hair (gets on my face and into my makeup) if I don't spray setting enough glue on every single spot.

I didn't like them seeing I had bought ""Suddenly Hair"". I also tried one from the drugstore, but didn't like the people at the register inspecting it. Also, with all of these, I used up the entire large size within two weeks! Then, l saw the CABOKI brand online. You can get a free sample for just less than $3 postage. I love it. The product lasts more than a month (4 - 6 weeks). I have auto-delivery, and my price ranges from $20 to $30 for each delivery. It covers the best, stays in the best, and looks the best.

Excellent for hiding thinning hair,3.0
"I got the Toppik just to give it a try. To be fare to other poducts on the market, I will give it 3 stars. Here is why:
1. Fibers, when applied, do not stick to hair more then they stick to scalp. I would even say, 65%stick to scalp, 35% -stick to hair. The product does its job though- conceals small thinning area. On someone's head with big bald patches, it will look as dark brown soot.
2. The poduct can dry scalp ,if used too often and...can make it itchy.
3. Ingredients : Toppik contains Silica, Ammonium Chloride and DMDM Hydantoin( google for side effects).
4. Toppik is not cheap. There are similar products that  priced much better. $60 content will not last a month with everyday applications and occasional ""oopses"" and misses.
IMHO, to deserve 5 stars, the product has to work as promised, be safe to use, have no side effects, be reasonably priced.",3.0

"It's 3 am in the morning and after thinking for awhile, I decided to write this review. This is considered as my first review ever for amazon, I don't like to write ""stuff"" but I think at this time this review might ""save someone life "" according to my experience with this miracle TOPPIK hair. I'm a nursing student and just in another 3 hours I have to be at Baptist Hospital to do my clinical rotation. So to let me take my hours sleep to write you this review, you have to trust me that I'm honest with my words and want the best for you. I bought this TOPPIK hair fiber at amazon, just like everybody reviewed above, it worked amazing ( I'm Asian, thin and short hair), I felt very confident and was supper happy to find this product. However, everything gone pretty well with first time. On the second time ( today) i went to bed at 11 and woke up in a middle of night with sign and symptom of shortness of breath, and itchy all of my body especially feeling severe itchy, burning sensation all over my head. When I turned on the light I saw redness, rashes all of my body. I know s.t was going wrong ( I almost called ambulance), I checked what I ate for yesterday but nothing appeared as abnormal. Then I started to do some interventions for myself, I washed my head with warm water for 10' , took 10mg Claritin, drank 2 glass of water. After 15 mins, I felt much better now. In conclusion, I'm allergic with this product, so my advice for you is, check your health sensitivity status before using it.",3.0

"This product is a migraine trigger for me.  I tried to use this 5 times, and 5 times I had a migraine start the next day.  It took me a few tries before I made the connection and I found it hard to believe.  So, I would wait a week and try it again and sure enough migraine the next day.  I mean nauseous, vomiting, multi-day migraines.  I finally stopped using it and my migraines were reduced.  I can still have a migraine triggered by other things in my life, but at least I was able to identify this as one trigger and reduce the number of headaches.

"The product seems to help a bit with body and color.  I started with a smaller sized container of fibers, part of a ""deal"" that included a ""patented spray applicator.""  The applicator did not fit the smaller container, and so I ordered this larger size, thinking it must be designed to work with the applicator:  but it doesn't fit either!!  So I have an applicator I cannot use, and am perplexed about why this is so - why hasn't the issue been addressed anywhere?  I sprinkle the fibers onto the needy areas, and rub gently with my palms; but a workable applicator would be nice!  I've been using the fibers daily, and see no build-up nor any residue on my pillow.",3.0

Problem 1. I have patchiness at the front and when I put it on and try to distribute it with my finger it wipes off completely.

Problem 2. And the biggest problem. I put it on my hair and gave it a little spritz of Dove Hair Spray and then went to a street fair. It was very hot out, maybe around 93-95 degrees out, and the sun was shinning when my fiance informed me not to freak out but that the top of my hair was green. For some reason the light brown color started turning a moldy green color. I was mortified.

"I have been dealing with thinning hair for a VERY long time. As a female, it's so hard to deal with losing your locks, especially when you're not even 30!!

Pros: It does work!! It definitely helps with covering the scalp, making the hair look thicker and fuller. If you're anything like me, you avoid sitting under lights, where your thinning hair shows your scalp more- when I use Toppik, I know I don't have to worry, because the ""scalp shine"" is gone. But with that said....

Cons: This product clogs your follicles!! I get little breakouts a day or two after using this product, also I notice when I give myself scalp massages that I have a lot of clogged pores. I feel like this product could potentially cause more hair loss in the log run if used too frequently.

I think this product is fantastic but only use it sporadically! I use it a few times a month when I go out and I make sure to use a purifying deep cleaning shampoo when I get home to make sure I get it all out and not let it set longer than it needs to.",3.0

Beware:  medium brown is actually almost jet black.

After 3 weeks of use - suggest you google ""toppix side effects reactions""  Apparently, some people are sensitive to the chemicals in these types of products.  I must use sparingly or my scalp gets dry and very itchy.  Using very carefully and applying a small amount just above the root area (do not apply to the scalp) these products help make thinning areas less noticeable.  If you put it on too heavily or on the scalp, it can be pretty obvious and not look natural.  The pump applicator makes application much, much easier.",3.0

I have a friend who this works wonders for as her hair is thinning in a more localized spot on the top of her head.  Her hair is night and day after using this product.

"It didn't provide enough coverage for me, and it was a bit too powdery.  It might work better for others.

"I used this product a couple of times and I want to give my take on Toppik. Im in my late 30s. I started losing hair in my mid 20s. It stopped in my early 30s. For me, its a hereditary thing. I have the half-moon bald pattern in the back of my head. For the last 10 years I have kept my haircut down with a #2. I have been pretty accepting of having hair loss. In my late 20s I tried Rogaine with no success. My skin had negative reactions to Rogaine. I also tried Propecia with no results for a couple of years. I have not really tried anything in the last 10 years.
When I saw the YouTube video on Toppik, I figured it would be worth a try. I was a good candidate because my bald pattern does have the small fine hairs left over for the fibers to cling to.
You really need the top applicator to put that stuff on your head. Even with that, it is pretty difficult. It can be pretty messy if you don't lay down a towel to pick up the excess.
The results? I thought it looked pretty awesome. It really does look like you have hair again. Just looking at it you cannot tell there is something there. I gave it a shot the next day and went out in public with it on. I was really nervous about anything getting rubbed off. If a spot rubs off, it is really noticeable (especially when you have super short hair). I went to the movies and shopping. By the end of the day I was feeling pretty nauseous. It was like wearing a beanie hat in the heat of summer. I think it was just trapping the heat from my head. If it was not for that, I would probably try it more often. I would defiantly not go swimming or work out with it on, mainly because of the amount I had to use.
I had to cover a significate area on my head with the product. If you have small spot, I think this would be perfect. It was really interesting to see what it looks like to have hair again!",3.0

"I hope this review helps for people choosing between this & Toppix. I tried both Hair Illusion & Toppix and this is way better than toppix and looks way more natural, and bonds better too with my natural hair. Toppix bothers my scalb and can cause an itch which it is not good to scratch. This hair also looks fuller while toppix hair quality isn't as good, its very dull looking, its like bulky black chalk and very messy to apply but the (2nd step) Toppix Sprayer is good and smells great, but I use it with/after hair illusion. This does lose 1 star for 3 reasons though 1) it comes out very slowly; it takes atleast 5 to 10 minutes or more to apply properly. 2) It also rubs out easily and if I touch it my hair and my hands will show that so I have to constantly remember not to touch it or let anything or anyone else touch it. 3) Most of it shreds out while I sleep which is probably a good thing though. But the end result looks almost 100% natural. I haven't tried Caboki yet but judging by my experience & the reviews I read Id rank them: 1) Hair Illusion 2) Caboki 3) Toppix. Im going to try Caboki later to see if my initial rankings are accurate but so far I think the price of the 3 are very telling, with Hair Illusion the hair quality is much better which is why I don't mind paying a little $more.",3.0

I have a slightly fuller head than typical guys that are looking at this product, but my hair is thin, and my scalp does show in brighter lighting.  I was hoping this product could disguise that.

"I'm still wondering if Toppik ""works"". I can't get close enough to the back of my head with a mirror or phone camera to see any fibers, but the bald spot is less visible. I tried it on the hair on my arms to see if it would build fibers, but it just turned my arm brown - no building of anything. So it's probably safe to assume that it is simply coloring my scalp back there.  I'm just starting to lose my hair from hormones, surgery and stress and though Toppik makes me feel like it's not as noticeable, I may just look like an old lady pretending no one will notice her stained head.
I did try it on the front of my head around my face, but it's difficult to apply without it delineating your hairline. Or it my case my mile-high forehead.
Several key points:  This light brown is very ash brown.  In case you haven't been coloring your hair for a million years, this means that the color reads as green not gold.  There is zero gold. I purchased both auburn and light brown and primarily use the brown to tone down the auburn a wee bit.  If I purchase again I will rethink the colors I choose.
It is also completely matte. More matte than dry shampoo or volume powder. I would use volume powder to help hide the dull roots, but for normal down hairstyles Toppik is noticeably matte.
Be prepared to wipe everything in a 5 foot radius immediately after use! You will find brownish powder on not just floor and counter but your toothbrush and the tiny edges around your sink and the back of the toilet and the top of towel racks - clean up right away or you'll find it on your cuffs, socks, elbows, etc.
Apply before your clothing. See above.
Don't forget to clean your ears. If you play with your hair or scratch your scalp your fingernails can get ""dirty"".
I didn't use hairspray to set, so maybe that helps.
I'm going to try other similar products just to see if there's a difference. Maybe this is the best. I'll let you know.",3.0

"I 've had hair transplants, also tried many other hair restoration medications, vitamins, laser treatments etc over my 64 years.

For maybe $30 a month, however, I can apply Toppick in the morning and sitll look like I have a healthy head of hair.  If it is important to you, it is a good solution if you sitll have a lot of hair to work with.  Toppick fills in the thinning spots well.

I'd rate it 5 stars if Amazon's largest bottle was as large as the Toppick bottle sold by Spencer Forrest.  But the later sells for more, no big deal",3.0
"It looks fake close up but if finessed just so and used under proper lighting - it might not be detectable. I think people who think it's not visible have vision issues - I've checked it seven ways till sunday before leaving the house and it's too obvious most of the time. Then if you attempt to use your fingers to blend it - a natural reaction to seeing what looks like coffee grains on your scalp - it just disappears completely. You have to sprinkle and not touch - very hard to get right.

I bought the attachment which at least gives some level of control. I would not buy this again. You'd get as much coverage putting a little brown eyeshadow on your head.",3.0
"It's a little messy, but overall, it did cover up thinning spots, and it did not come out until I washed my hair.",3.0
I have a thin spot on my temple and it works decently.  Don't look for magic but it is best if you have slight thinning areas. I don't think it would be great for large bald spots because it works best as a filler.,3.0

"I thought I would break down and try this.  I have receding hairline and thinning hair above my forehead, kinda the vampire hairline. My wife thought it would be good and I had my doubts, come to find out I was right about what I thought it would do.  Applying the powdery substance on my thinning areas, like a pepper shaker, it does land on the hair and visible scalp.  I am sure some of it does remain on the hair but what this does more than anything is fall on the scalp and darken it to the color of my hair so as to 'look' less bald.  It doesn't increase hair size but it does mask the scalp in thinning areas of the head... Is this useful?  Sure. I used it twice now when I needed passport pictures and a family photo and because of the darkened scalp the light does not reflect and so I do look as though I have thicker hair.  This is what it does, I will not send it back as I will use it for the occasional picture but that is it I will not be putting this on every day.",3.0

"Toppik was my first product of this sort and I was thrilled with it at first. Yes, it is messy and hard to control the amount being distributed because it wants to come out a lot at one time, in one place, but I was just so happy to have a fast and easy and inexpensive solution to the hair loss.
Then I discovered Caboki. This is how its meant to be. I read another review on Amazon from someone who was concerned about the chemical makeup of Toppik (gave her migraines) and was looking for something without certain chemicals in it and she found Caboki. I went to their website and watched the videos and ordered a free sample. The difference seems to be that the binding product they use has more negative charge and so binds better to hair, which has a positive charge. This stuff actually binds to the hair, while Toppik just sits on my head. I can tell the difference in the amount I have to use; way less with Caboki, and when I stick my fingers in my hair, instead of under my nails being coated with lumpy powder, i have a fine coating of powder on my fingers, with very little on the tips of my nails. Therefore, I conclude the powder is actually in my hair and not on my head. I used to scratch my head a lot with Toppik; I think that is because my head couldn't breathe beneath the heavy coat of powder. Anyway, Toppik is ok in a pinch, but check out Caboki for a real, high quality product. It looks more natural also.",3.0

"I can see how this might work for someone with a minor bald spot in the back of the head. The fibers do stick to the hair and give the appearance of more hair.

Good product for thinning hair.  It disguises thinning by adding color to scalp.  You need to pick a color closes to your hair color.  The product adheres to your scalp and hair.,3.0
"No mess, cleans up very easy , does not stain hands or anything, no smell detected (i need to use only a very small amt.), works great / & looks great.
  The only problem is that after a few hours, i started ithing, after several hours, I was itching A LOT, and had to take an allergy pill. I read it has wool in it, unlike the other 2 brands (Caboki cannot be found anymore except in silver white, at least on here, but it and Xfusion, I read, contain cotton fibers of kerartin vs. wool, like there is in this Toppik-- so that explains it). Don't get this if u r allergic to wool (get Xfusion instead).
For thos of us with woool allergies, we will need to use Xfusion instead (or Caboki if u r silver/grey), even though that cotton-based Xfusion is messier i read (this was not messy at all) and looks a bit worse (this dust looked great).
A couple shakes was all it took to turn me into an wool-itching machine a few hours later. If you must try, or don't know if u r allergic to wool, please order a small/ (travel) size initially & do yourself a favor.",3.0
"This stuff definitely helps, but not in the way it's advertised. It doesn't actually cling to your hair at all. It merely sticks to your scalp making your hair appear darker. It will sit on top of your head while applying but within a few minutes all of it falls onto your head.",3.0
If you're balding then get this along with dermatend. In combination you get nice results just don't expect a miracle or something too natural. Guess it depends on your hair type and color. Tends to fade as day goes on so maybe hairspray will hold it place,3.0

I tried mixing some Medium Blond (too light) with some Medium Brown (too dark). I also have Light Brown, but it is too grayish. Now I have a big mix that I could never duplicate. I ""shoot"" it into my scalp with the spray applicator and hope the hair around it will blend. I am only looking for it to add a fullness to my thinning hair. I can't imagine it working on a large balding area.",3.0
"Meaning that there is some sort of fixative spray available, you probably want to buy that although I haven't.  Without it, this product tends to disappear quickly, although it works reasonably well at the start and blends nicely, the color is right for my reddish brown hair.",3.0
"I ordered my first can of Toppick Hair Building Fibers based on the mostly good reviews by other users.  I agree that this is a good product.  It's not great, it doesn't make me suddenly look like I have lots of hair, but I must say that it is better than the hair I ""naturally"" have now.  Apparently due to aging, my once very thick hair has thinned drasically in the past ten years, and I have tried many, many products in an effort to either regrow hair, or to give the illusion of more hair.  Toppick is applied after shampooing, drying and styling, and on top of any other hair thickening products.  It is a fine powder that is manually shaken from the can. Toppick is sold in several different color shades and ""Light Brown"" is the first shade that I tried, as I have light brown hair with blond highlights, neither of which are my natural shade.  After the first few shakes, I discovered that there were more hair building fibers all over my shoulders, shirt and the bathroom than on my head.  I invested in the applicator made to fit over the top of the can and I urge anyone who is interested in trying Toppick, to do the same.  The nozzle-tip applicator makes it much easier and neater to apply this product.  The major plusses of Toppick are that it hides my shiny pink scalp and I find that the fibers do give the illusion of more hair.  The minuses include:  1.  I need to use a lot of Toppick to achieve the desired results, making this product more expensive than I thought it would be; 2.  I need to use a special ""spray"" to get the fibers to stick in place, adding another expense; 3.  Any time I comb or ""fix"" my hair during the day, the Toppick fibers come out, so I need to reapply which is not easily accomplished when not at home; and 4.  the powder texture dulls the look of my hair.
  Since the minuses are greater than the plusses, for me, I gave the Toppick Hair Building Fibers, Light Brown, only 3 stars.  Will I continue to use this product?  Absolutely - I haven't found anything else that hides my ""naked"" scalp and gives even a slight illusion of more hair as well as as the Toppick Fibers.  Will I continue to use Rogaine as well as other thickening and volume building products?  Absolutely - at least until a magic potion is developed to successfully regrow hair, or my vanity weakens.  If you are a mature woman and your crowning glory has been reduced to just a few strands, I would highly recommend that you give Toppick a try, just don't make your expecttions too high.",3.0
"the value of the product for me was to color my bald scalp so it is less obvious.  the powder is not hair, it offers color to the ""white"" area where you have no hair.  it will get on your clothes and pillow case, but I found no permanent discoloration from it.",3.0
"The light brown version of this product is significantly lighter than I expected.  The color comes out almost yellow and doesn't blend well.  If you dye your hair, don't go with the color of dye that you use.  I also had trouble with the shaker itself - it seems to clog very easily making use quite a workout.",3.0
"I was looking for some volume on my fine hair.  This works no better than a dry spray shampoo, so if you want to save money and boost your hair volume a little, I suggest trying a dry spray shampoo (there are many brands). I suppose maybe this is a product more for people with very, very thin hair and maybe some bald spots?  Maybe they would have better luck with this, not sure.",3.0
I think this product would be okay to use if you wanted to look good for a special occasion.  It could be expensive if you used it everyday and it will rub off on such things as pillows but will not stain.,3.0
i used it in my hair and went to the beach it came right off.if you wash your hair with water it washes out.it' great to use just not when entering water,3.0
I now have let my hair go natual and decided to add the texture I usually like with this product.  It was too light for the top of my head.  I am more white but ordered gray and it was WHITE.,3.0
50 grams was always priced between $40 - $52.. Now it's $45 for 10 grams.. That's almost a 500% increase in price! How do they get away with that? Was approximately $1 a gram.. Now it's $5 per gram. That's not right..,3.0
"Its a good solution for quick fix. it gives you what you need of having thick hair.

"Compare to other hair fibers I have used:
1. color is not really black, looks more like dark gray to me, totally different from my real black hair
2. texture also don't mesh well like the other products I used before
3. can't see through bottle to see the remaining amount inside",3.0
"This is just OK for me. My hair's a bit thin in parts and I sprinkle this in and it makes it look a bit thicker. But I think I need to get the spray to help set it, but this was already expensive enough (I bought it at Sally Beauty Supply). Thing is it doesn't seem to stick and sometimes I get the little fibers on my forehead, as they travel down/shed/however you want to describe it! It just feels icky and like I have lint fibers on my forehead, not where I want them for sure!
Reading the description I thought that somehow the sprinkles would work with my hair, some sort of friction/magnetism deal to bond and puff it up. But spraying in dry shampoo for blondes seems to work better at about a third of the price I paid for this stuff.",3.0
"I knew this wouldn't be the answer to my prayers, but I didn't expect it to be so difficult to use. As I ""dusted"" it over my bald spots, it would stay in one area rather than evenly distributing. Maybe with some practice, I will get better at it. Also, if you have very thin hair, I don't think this will fill in the open areas very well....there are too many of them!",3.0
"A little chalky....have light eyebrows (blonde) and even when ""lightly"" dusting the eyebrow notice a bit gets on nose and eye area.  I actually like using it as an eyeliner!  Gives light lashes a bit ""umph"" more yet lightly highlighting eyes.  Its an okay product.",3.0
"I think I should have bought the mint, or another mainstream flavor.  This stuff is expensive, I obviously knew that going in, but I was hoping for a wow experience, like wow this is worth the money.  It was not worth the money for me.  The Jasmin flavor is a little much, too flowery and
feminine, for everyday use in my opinion.  I might try the mint next or just save my money and buy Crest...",3.0
"Great, unique smell which can be refreshing if you don't like to go to bed with an intense mint smell/tingle from regular toothpaste. It does leave a slightly powdery feel on my teeth after brushing with it and is fluoride free (which is debated for its necessity, but dentists say fluoride is pretty important for renewing enamel minerals). Now I just use it to brush my retainer before I put it in before going to bed.",3.0
If you like jasmine you will probably enjoy. it is an acquired taste for sure. Not for everyone but a fun way to try it in this cute travel size.,3.0
smells great. whitens teeth a little too but way too little for it's price,3.0
"I... Wanted to love this toothpaste so bad. It tastes absolutely amazing, the packaging is beautiful. But. But! I need fluoride. Seriously. I used this toothpaste for a little over two months and my teeth looked terrible. Plaque buildup, fuzzy feeling, and kind of a blackish tinge around the edges which I've never had before. All this with my normal flossing and water pick with Listerine and hydrogen peroxide. So, sadly, I switched back to crest with scope after scraping with some dental tools. My teeth feel much better after just a week. I may just be a person who needs fluoride?",3.0
Expect it to be a fancy toothpaste guess I should not. No cleaner breath in the next morning compared to use normal brand toothpaste. And this one smells fine but not very minty. Will not buy again.,3.0
"I've used Marvis toothpaste before and love it. It leaves my mouth feeling super clean and I'm a sucker for good packaging! However, this flavor was a huge disappointment. It's very floral, to the point that I felt it to be overwhelming. It had an almost soapy taste. My mouth still felt really clean after though! I highly recommend Marvis, just not this particular flavor.",3.0
"Love the lavender taste but it's not a very strong mint favor, so my mouth doesn't feel completely fresh.",3.0
"I was soo excited to try the jasmine mint toothpaste.  It smells more like a grape marker than jasmine or mint.  It tastes kind of flowery and minty, but overall, it's not my favorite.",3.0
Pretty tasty in a toothpaste kind of way.,3.0
"The taste is special but I am not very into this. I have a strange feeling on my teeth after using it, although it is not very obvious. With this price, I probably would not buy it again.",3.0
"Tastes too saccharine for me, it feels like brushing with a field of sugar flowers and I don't feel like it cleans my mouth well. I think I'll stick to the strong mint in the future. If the formula were revised to be more crisp instead of sweet, I think I would enjoy it more.",3.0
"Pros:
- Fluoride free
- Relatively healthy ingredients
- Leaves teeth feeling clean
- Jasmine is an original flavor

Cons:
- Gets watery after about one minute of brushing
- Mint flavor is too strong and quickly overwhelms jasmine
- Expensive

The jasmine flavor is very nice for the first 30 seconds of brushing.  For me that's where the good experience ends.  The watery consistency of this toothpaste and unpleasant mint flavor that permeates after about 30 seconds overwhelms the jasmine.  Give the high price of this toothpaste, the value isn't there.  I'm trying to find a replacement for Tom's Gingermint toothpaste which has been discontinued, but unfortunately this isn't it.  If you love mint this might be an OK choice for you, thought I feel like there are plenty of other natural mint toothpastes that are a better value than this one.",3.0
"Tastes so sweet, don't like it.",3.0
It taste just like normal toothpaste but with a strong scent and my case I bought jasmine so it smell like jasmine and my mouth feels like there's a bunch of jasmine flowers in it after brushed.,3.0
"I'm not sure I like the taste of this toothpaste.  It has a strange aftertaste that puts me off.  It tastes great at first but the longer I brush, the less I like this strange taste.  I wasn't sure what jasmine, which is a flower, would taste like but I knew that there is such a thing as jasmine tea and that it's quite popular.  Most conventional toothpastes are too strong for me.  And I'm not really a fan of strong mint.  But I'm not sure I like the flowery taste of this Marvis flavor.  I tried the Ginger Mint flavor but it's way too strong and makes my eyes water.  I don't think there's such a thing as unflavored toothpaste but I'm going to search for it anyway.  I would rather have something fruity, like orange.  Tom's used to make an orange flavor that was available at the drugstore but I haven't seen it around for years.  That one was great for me because it didn't have much mint.  I will use this Marvis Jasmine toothpaste up because it was so expensive, however, I will continue to look for something without mint and something that doesn't taste like a mouthful of flowers.  I find the jasmine taste very unpleasant and absolutely dread using it.  But for the price, I will have to bite the bullet and suck it up like a big girl and manage to use the full tube, even if it takes me a while.  I don't put much on the brush because I'm not a fan of the taste.  If I get a cavity, it's solely the fault of this strange tasting toothpaste.  I guess if you like jasmine tea, you might like this flavor.  But the attraction of flowery toothpaste is totally lost on me.  In a word: Yuck!",3.0
More sweet and pefumey than I expected. I was a little disappointed that there was no blast of mint as with their other flavors.,3.0
Kinda over priced,3.0
Only thing I like is the smell. Doesn't worth the price,3.0
The taste is weird - Jasmin Mint. I couldn't get used to it - very flowery - almost as if I had accidentally sprayed perfume in my mouth. I really wanted to love it but couldn't bring myself to keep using it.,3.0
Thought it would be bigger considering the price I paid. But I like the flavor.,3.0
"I remember buying this toothpaste from Anthropologie years ago and it was so floral and fresh.  I don't know if my tube went bad but the paste has sort of a rancid taste to it, like sour milk.  You can taste the jasmine slightly, but it's not nearly as potent as I remember it.",3.0
"Doesn't really feel like they're cleaning my teeth that well, but it does leave a great taste in the mouth.",3.0
Tastes is defiantly different,3.0
didn't feel any difference.,3.0
I feel very good,3.0
"I was very excited to find this product - great package design and seemingly great flavor (I don't like minty toothpaste, generally). It looked promising. In reality, this toothpaste is too sweet, sugary almost, which is off-putting. However, it truly does smell and taste like jasmine mint! Second weird thing about it is the phrase ""Sweet, floral mint taste dedicated to women"" on the back. I'm not usually picky about wording but this one stuck out like a sore thumb. Maybe it's a botched translation or something.",3.0
Strong Mint and Ginger Mint are my favorite but this product was not bad. I love all Marvis toothpaste but this flavor is not my favorite. I highly recommend this seller and the toothpaste.,3.0
"While I appreciate the quality of the product, after spending roughly 15$ after shipping for toothpaste, I was not entirely happy with the end result. It's a very delicate flavor, and it doesn't leave your mouth feeling nearly as clean as some domestic products.",3.0
"Best tasting toothpaste hard to fine any where only have found at Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas.
 Do you have more?",3.0
"I didn't really like this toothpaste.  It's smooth and soft, but it kind of tastes like baby wipes.  It's super floral and sweet, but once you associate baby wipes with the taste while you're brushing it all around your mouth, it is no longer a novelty, but something that kind of makes you cringe.",3.0
"A little too different for me. The reviews were good so I thought I'd try, but I won't purchase again. I do like this brand in the mint flavor though.",3.0
"I love the taste of this toothpaste and it's certainly novel, but it doesn't make my teeth feel as clean as more commercial toothpaste.  I don't know if I would buy it again, but it was nice to try.",3.0
"Not bad, i like it; however, it is kinda expensive.

I kinda like the white regular Marvis more.",3.0
The smell is great and it cleans very well but I am just not sure about the combination of Jasmin and Mint.  Like I said its litterally like brushing your teeth with crushed flowers.,3.0
I bought this thinking the pen would be full when I got it...WRONG..it is LESS THAN HALF FULL..and you have to really work and beat and click ot get it out..then its goopy...and thick and is almost invisible...it isn't the pink I thought it would be and its just a gooey mess..I will not buy this again,3.0
"WHY, oh why, would anyone buy this one?  While the product is amazing, the .05 size is 62% as large as the .08 oz size they sell here, yet it costs only 40% as much.  Buy the smaller size -- you can get a full ounce for less than the price of the .08 oz!",3.0
Awesome so happy I received this discontinued product!,3.0
I love this still lip glaze but I wish they would fill the tube with more product. It's not cheap.,3.0

"If the price were only about $5, then I would most definitely love this product! But for $20, it's actually not worth it. It's better than the other lip glosses I've tried, but those had only cost me about $3. Recommend if you have lots of money to spend, but if you're not-so-rich, then don't buy this product!!!!",3.0
To me this was too thick & sticky. I prefer a creamier gloss. The taste is also not great. Just not for me.,3.0
I don't wear this everyday bec it makes my skin break out but most moisturizers do.,3.0

I got a shaving brush from the art of shaving for Xmas. And thought this would be a perfect holder.  But again description was very vague on the website.  So again I would return because it is of no use to me but again the fee to return would be more then the product is worth,3.0
It eventually cracked but at least remained functional.,3.0
Works great but is light weight. It has to be anchored to something to stay in place.,3.0
"ok, but not as sturdy as i would like. does the job though and cheap.",3.0
Does not fit with the travel size brush,3.0
"It's a basic, plastic stand for holding your brush.  Nothing fantastic, but it does the job.",3.0
its ok but feels kind of cheap. it feels like cheap plastic but it does get the job done and has enough clearance for a standard brush. youll need some contact tape if you want to mount it on a wall.,3.0
I got this stand in hopes that it would fit one of my brushes. It only fit my travel brush. I am a little disappointed about that as I was hoping it would fit my everyday brush. oh well. Getting a new metal stand for my razor and brush soon anyway. This plastic one works great for my travel brush.,3.0
"It works fine, but my brush handle was too wide.  I used a penknife to widen the opening and it works fine now.",3.0
"I bought this thinking it would fit all brushes (I didn't know there were different sizes), it doesn't. My husbands brush rests on its bristles and isn't held up like it should be.",3.0
"Got the art of shaving starter kit and thought this was the correct stand for the brush that comes with it. When everything was opened on Christmas, we learned otherwise. I'm sure it would be great if we had the brush that fit correctly in the stand. I would recommend purchasing the kit,brush/stand together, this would ensure the correct brush stand.",3.0
While simple in design it works well as a travel item.  i ordered the chrome version for home use and like it much better.,3.0
did not work for me but smelled good,3.0
"The smell has somewhat of a lemon cleaner smell to it in the palm of your hand but quickly goes away.
The tube it's in has a metal consistency so when you squeeze it you have to be careful because it will put out a huge amount because it sort of dents the tube.  It's nice, but wouldn't purchase it again.  Get rid of the lemon smell and outfit in a different bottle or a pump.",3.0
"Ok after shave, not a big fan.
I read about it in GQ who could not stop raving about it. Last time I trust GQ reviews.",3.0
"good product, not worth $19, not that great...I shave every day and expected this balm to drastically improve my skin. Like i said, its good, but not that good and not worth the money. This would be 5 stars at $10.
I am not affiliated with any company that sells any of such products, i am not a sales person, i do not get paid for reviews. Just a regular husband, father, man, who shaves and needs a good aftershave.
I would recommend trying Eshave aftershave balm. its less ""wet"" and is absorbed quicker.",3.0
OK. but a little overpriced for what you get,3.0
"This balm has the consistency of a light gel. Goes on well and absorbs well. Lots of product comes out of the tube without much pressure so be careful.

In the bottle it smells like lemon furniture polish. On the skin it changes to lemon-honey cough drops. I'm not kidding, it's exactly that smell.

All that said my skin feels amazing after use. Soft but not sticky. It takes a little bit of time for it to smooth any razor burn so don't panic.

If Baxter offered this balm without the lemon smell (or just a different smell all together) this would be a five star product.",3.0
Guess my expectations were to high.,3.0
"Please read as your expectations may be completely different. Prior to this, I used two different Kiehl's moisturizers, both of which are now discontinued. I was hoping this product would replace them. Sadly, it does not. As an after shave balm to close my pores, the product functions well. I like how my face feels after using it. However, as a moisturizer, the product fails in my humble estimation. My face feels dry just after application. If your skin does not need much moisturizing, this would be a great product. For me, it was an expensive experiment.",3.0
"First off, to me, it smells exactly like lemon Pledge. The good news is the smell does not last horrible long. The consistency is pretty thin, but a little manages to go a long ways.",3.0
Not that great. Kinda of thick and very strong smell.  It smells like urinal cakes.,3.0
This is a high quality after balm.  It seems to moisturize but not as much as I would prefer.  it has a light almost medical scent that fades fast. It does provide the healing after a close shave but I will shopping for another product with more moisturizing properties once this runs out.,3.0
"Works good for what it is but has a bit too much medicinal scent for me. It is like menthol, some might like that, not me, but it works.",3.0
I bought this along with Proraso. I have a tendency to try new after shaves as I have some I like but still searching for that perfect one. I did not think the Baxter's did a good job at calming skin from razor burn and irritation so I will not use it again. It might be great for less sensitive skin. I did find the scent was pleasing and not over powering.,3.0
smells like a lemon head.  Not crazy about the scent.,3.0
"Nothing special, as I was expecting a great feel and smell.  First couple of times I used it I liked the tingle, smell was ok.  But I grew tired of the smell, and the tingle became more of a sting.  Maybe not at all bad, but just wasn't for me.  I actually couldn't wait till I finished it.",3.0
"Used it as moisturizer as my skin's been sensitive and acne prone to most moisturizer that I had been using. Someone else who reviewed this product mentioned that it can work as one so I gave it a try.

Immediately after applying the product to your face, you will feel refreshing sensation, kind of like salon pas or something. It does moisturizes the skin but I found myself reapplying on specific areas to rid of remaining dryness/ashyness.

Obviously, it wasn't meant to be used as moisturizer. Though your face won't experience inflammation or break-out, it leaves a messy complexion and color tone on your face. In plain terms, your face looks messy, lol.

It's a good product as after shave balm but you'll have to applying something else on top. It will cause your skin tone to be erratic after prolonged use.",3.0
"I have fairly sensitive skin and need a good alcohol free after shave to avoid alot of irritation. I have used several types in the past and this has been the best. It goes on nice and smooth and does not dry out my face. Nothing worse than have that tight and dry skin feeling after shaving. This keeps my face moisturized for quite some time after shaving. Has a pleasant, manly smell too. I will continue to buy this.

Update- I have used this after shave for over a month and I am not really as impressed as I once was. It is not nearly as moisturizing as Proraso after shave, yet it is 3x the price. I will not buy this again because of the price.",3.0
"I bought it for my man's birthday, and he doesn't use it much. I think he is intimidated by the prettieness of the packaging.",3.0
"A bit refreshing, but I'd prefer similar scents with less chemicals. With over 20 aftershave creams, balms, and splashes now, this one just doesn't stand out.",3.0
"This stuff hurts!  I mean the smell is nice with lemon and mint.  I have used Proraso and other aftershave lotions and this one is by far the most painful when applied.  I mean you really feel it and it wears off slowly.  Skin feels soft afterwards but you have to deal with the pain first.  Also, I received a tube not a bottle as shown.  Don't like that but I am not returning.

Too funny - I get ""0 of 2 people found the following review helpful""

What didn't you like?  My honesty?

UPDATE:
I found out that when you use this product alone it is fine - no sting at all.  However, when used after you use an aftershave your face will burn.",3.0
"The jury is still out for me. They do tan. Most, if not all, reviews state that they don't leave you orange. I have an orange tint after only 1 application. I followed the instructions, which even a moron can follow, and still the orange glow. I think I might go back to the classic and build my tan from those. Happy tanning!!!",3.0
"I purchased these online last year from a different company and loved the product.  However, this year, I'm a little disappointed. I'm fair skinned and the towels last year only took one application before you could notice a difference.  The same towels this year takes two or three applications.  NOt sure if the manufacturing company changed something or if there is a problem with this order.",3.0
"Kinda weird, streaky, smelly.",3.0
"OK, so I've got to wonder how many applications those models on HSN have applied to achieve the dark tan they show?  I've used the towel twice (2 days apart)  and can barely tell the difference between the area applied and my regular skin tone.  They are easy to work with and do not streak or splotch but they really did not provide the tan that I was hoping for. I'm using the PLUS towel so maybe I should have ordered the medium to dark towel instead.",3.0
It won't make your hair grow,3.0

Mixed emotions. You feel nice and fresh after shower but it looks like the hair is dried out. So it looks thicker but not sure if healthy. Definitely good for peeps with dandruff but I feel it lacks nutrition. So now I use dandruff shampoo combined with an alternate moisturizing shampoo.,3.0

I really didn't notice any difference and am now trying another shampoo.  We'll see how that goes.,3.0
"I'm told I don't look my age (61), probably because I take very good care of my skin. I was seeing a dermatologist who helped me discover I'm allergic to a preservative ingredient found in many skin care products, including many ""higher end"" lines. The irritating ingredient for me is stearic acid, and PCA products I've purchased and reviewed don't contain it. I was first introduced to PCA during a facial with an esthetician who used PCA Pumpkin Wine toner. I liked it so much that I bought it from her and then purchased PCA Collagen Hydrator and PCA Eye Excellence here on Amazon (good). In my excitement over products free of stearic acid, I purchased more of the line directly from PCA (NOT good). You can read my reviews for more PCA products here on Amazon.

With daily use, this wash makes my skin feel dry, so I switched to every other day, and my skin still felt thirsty.  While using this product, I began noticing fine lines that weren't there before, and fortunately, my skin restored when I went back to M---d. I don't believe the pumpkin toner gave me trouble - I think it's the wash, especially, that caused my skin to be dry and bring out those fine lines.

Clearly PCA products are not right for me, and that's ok. If you want to find out if they're right for you, try one item at a time, and make sure you buy from trustworthy, ""always there"" Amazon. PCA won't take your calls or answer your emails if you ask to return or exchange for credit. Purchase just one PCA item at a time, and give it a few weeks before trying something else in the line. And buy Amazon because they will ALWAYS be there for you!",3.0
Fair over all cleanser.  Left my skin on the dry side.  Did not see a healthy glow and have been using for weeks.  Maybe better for oily skin,3.0
Nothing special. I went back to using Cetaphil.,3.0
"The day I started to use this product I broke out in a thick rash of small itchy, red bumps. It lasted a week, until I switched to CliniCalm (PCA) and Special Cleansing Gel (Dermalogica). Its been three days since stopping- and the bumps are almost gone. The thing is- I don't have sensitive skin- so not sure why my skin reacted so strongly to this wash. I highly recommend PCA as a line- this product did not work for me.",3.0

"I purchased the Handy mixed bristle brush BN3. I have fine hair. Thin. If you have a sensitive head, this isn't the brush for you. It downright hurts.

Just a brush. Nothing special considering the price.,3.0
"I had high hopes for this brush bases on the reviews. While it is well-made, the bristles are not long enough to get all the way through my thick hair to reach the scalp.

"Not sure what all the ranting and raving is about.  This is a ridiculously expensive brush, and I've been using it everyday for about 2 weeks.  My hair looks and feels the same as it does with a regular generic paddle brush.  Yes, I did extensive research into all the different makes and sizes of Mason Pearsons, so I'm confident it's not because I purchased the wrong model for my type of hair.  It's a nice looking brush, people go ""ooo Mason Pearson,"" it does its job, but it's not worth the price.  Although I could return it, I don't feel comfortable returning a product I've used for this purpose...which makes me wonder...did I get a refurbished brush or a brand new brush?  How could one tell whether it was ""returned"" or not???  There was no shrink wrap or anything to indicate the brush had never been used.  It's just a box that has no sealing stickers of any kind.  Now I'm getting worried...",3.0
"This cream is very thick does not apply easily and it makes my face peel.  I cannot return it because I have had it too long. The first cream that I ordered by Vichy had more pleasant smell and applied with ease, which I believe was Aqualia thermal.  I suppose I can use nutrilologie 2 on my feet or other areas of my body.",3.0
It is okay. Kinda burns and leaves face oily,3.0
This has great reviews but my experience is average.  Cold dry winter so I needed some hand repair. After a week of use a little improvement but not much.  Went back to O'Keefes and hands are much smoother.,3.0
"The lotion is great but the bottle was missing the pump at the top. It must have snapped off and the person who packed it, shipped this anyway. It was not inside the box. Obviously, without the pump at the top, difficult to dispense.",3.0
Gotta squeeze a good amount to get your entire hands feeling smooth.,3.0
"Not too bad but not a perfect hand cream (not like the Others Jack Black products such as after shave Oil BEST ever I had)
...But this one....Not sure if I wouldnt buy it again, and wouldnt recommend it to anyone who's looking for something like this
It doesnt work exactly like it should be.
Just doesnt want to waste my time to keep saying/writing 3 star review what the others perfectly described (by others) already as 3 or 2 stars reviews!
I would hesitate to recommend to a friend!",3.0
Bought this for my husband. He didn't like the eucalyptus smell but works ok.,3.0
"This  cream is good  but it takes about 5 minutes for my hands to absorb the cream. The cream doesn't leave your skin dry but a little greasy feeling.
As some people have pointed out, the formula has been changed and the cream is not as good and fast absorbing as it used to be. I won't be buying this again.",3.0
"So I have extremely rough and dry hands, I've tried tons of lotions, with none really improving anything. I came across this stuff and bought it on here for $15. Honestly this stuff didn't do anything.
Is makes your hands for moisturized for about 2 minutes, and then they're back to being dry.
I wear gloves while I work because I mess with cardboard, but even then it doesn't do anything, it also smells pretty bad like a hair dye or something strong that I just can't remember.

What I have found works better is Gold Bonds Diabetes Lotion for half the price and a little bit larger tube, also you don't have to wait for shipping as it's available at stores.

Just thought I'd share this information and hopefully help others who have my problem.",3.0
"Not as good as Kiehl's.  I was looking for a product that was an alternative to Keihl's Ultimate Hand Salve, as the cost can add up.  I had read good things about the Jack Black product line so I figured I would give this a try.  Not bad,  but no where near as good as the Kiehl's for hands that are cracked and dried out.",3.0

Okay product.  Smells very medicinal.  I prefer Neutrogena Intensive hand cream.  Just thought I'd try something different since I am living in the desert now.,3.0
This product is good but I have not had the experience that encouraged me to purchase. It was stated that it didn't wash off easily but that has not been my experience. It does do better that some I have used but it washes off like any other cream it doesn't in my estimation last any longer than some much less expensive hand creams I have used as a matter of fact I have used some that even did a better job but didn't cost as much.,3.0
"This hand healer does soften your skin, but doesn't absorb enough into your hands if you ask me. The smell is just ok too; it has a bit of a weird chemical undertone, but once I got used to it I didn't mind it.",3.0
"Based on the reviews and the ingredients, I had high hopes for this hand cream.

I love the way it smells, and I love the way it feels on my hands--it's absorbed quickly, unlike Neutrogena Norwegian Formula--but it is not up to the job of keeping my hands soft and smooth. Worse, it did nothing for the cracks at my fingertips, except perhaps to make them worse.

Still, I suspect for most, this product will work well--which is why I'm giving it three stars, even though it did not work for me--but for dry, cracked hands, O'Keefe's Working Hands cream is the better option.",3.0
"Had read a great review on Jack Black Industrial Strength Hand Healer in a magazine, and with a woodworking, cracked hands husband, it seemed a natural purchase.  I bought 2 tubes, so he'd have instant access.  Well, he's used it diligently for a few weeks now, and we're not seeing any HEALING, which is exactly what's needed for the cracks in his hands.  I'm sorry to say I haven't found a magic potion here.",3.0

You NEED a top coat with this unless you want your nails to snag every fuzz or hair.

The way my nails felt with this top coat was hard to explain - they did dry fast at all and I'm still waiting for the shine LOL

So afterwards I did some research and found something else that I am in love with and think all you other DIY manicurists should check out (Essie Good to Good Rapid Dry + Shine) It's amazing, you won't regret using/buying it!

Zoya - will probably end up in my junk drawer :(",3.0
"I have very recently gotten into Zoya nail polish. To be clear, I LOVE their nail polish... Great formula, 5-free, fantastic colors. I'm a big fan.

However, I was not at all a fan of this top coat for a few reasons.

1) This took forever to dry. In fact, it doesn't dry... it driiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiies. I'm talking 1.5 hours later and it still smudged. I even tried ""setting"" it by placing my hands in the freezer for a few minutes. I might be spoiled by Seche Vite (which sadly does not work with Zoya polishes), but this seems like a really impractical amount of dry time.

2) After all that time, the topcoat itself was not particularly shiny. It looked like 3-day old polish (shine-wise).

3) It significantly changed the color of my nail polish. I used Essie First Timer. After applying this topcoat and letting it dry, the color was much closer to China Glaze Four Leaf Clover. I know it says something in the description about ""UV Block."" Maybe this is the cause of this particular issue?

To be fair, I tried it with Essie polish and not Zoya, so perhaps it works much better with their polish. However, since Essie is 3-free, I feel like it should work well. Plus, I don't want a top coat that only works with one kind of polish.

I would give this a pass in favor of a different topcoat, such as the Poshe one.

EDIT: Ok, I'm going to bump this up a star. What I've found is you really, really need to use the quick dry drops on this top coat (I used the Qtica version, but I know they have a Zoya version that is meant to be used with this top coat specifically). Using the drops, I was able to get really good wear with this top coat. I noticed my tip wear is less pronounced than it is with the Poshe top coat. However, I can't fully support a product that requires another product to make it work effectively.",3.0

In fact, I'd done image searches prior to settling on Holly for the green I wanted.  To be honest, what I got looks more like the images available for Giovanna to me, though it's clearly labeled as Holly.

Loved this product the first time I used it.  Stayed on my nails for almost 2 weeks with the base and top coat that goes with the system.  But recently my nails have started to peel and split again.  Not sure why.  My nails grew so much using this system but now peeling again.,3.0
"This was just okay,nothing dramatic .",3.0
"The product itself is nice.  I love Zoya  and use their products almost exclusively.  This color (pepper), however, is not how it appears on my mac.  It looks exactly like the color of cinnamon - much more brown, much less red than I thought.  It's not terrible but not what I was expecting.",3.0
Chips easily,3.0
Ok product,3.0
I was a little disappointed with this product. Application wasn't that great and the color was...well ugly. I was hoping for a grayish army green but instead it kind of reminded me of swampy green mixed with gross baby food green. I was looking for a nice greenish autumn color...instead I got the ugliest shade of green. It could be how it blended with skin tone as well. Still going to keep it and see if it grows on me.,3.0
Very thin polish needs many coats and that causes polish to chip fast only lasted 4 days :(,3.0

Absolutely love the color but doesn't wear as well as the other zoya polish I purchased.,3.0
The colour is not the same as the picture but it's still pretty. It started chipping the day after I put it on though which was disappointing.,3.0
I still like the color but it is not as depicted in the picture. The original color is more pastel.,3.0
More of a washed- off pearl color than not. I just do my own banks at home now.,3.0
Pretty medium blue but not the neon blue I've been looking for. Definitely no where near the color shown in the picture,3.0
I was hoping this color was more hot pink.  It's more of a reddish pink.  Still pretty...just not what I was going for.  The search continues...,3.0
I had a difficult time keeping this nail polish from streaking. The color was a bit Barbie dollish too. It might work on someone with a different complexion and skin tone though.,3.0
"it is weird. When you put it on and it dries, it does look matte, but it kind of fades away. It does look a bit sparkly before it dries, and after it fades also. It's pretty, but not exactly what I wanted, and not description fitting enough to cost so much.",3.0
"Very thick consistency that made smooth application a bit difficult. Also chips like no other. This was my first Zoya polish, and I am unfortunately disappointed. ):",3.0
"Just did my nails two days ago and I now have a big chip in the middle of my index finger.  This polish isn't very durable at all.  It's not even as sturdy as Essie polishes.  This is a beautiful sea green color that I thought would be perfect for spring/summer.  It goes on a little dark, but is still pretty.  It's too bad it doesn't stand up to even the slightest wear.  It went on a little streaky, but once the second coat was on, it was fine.  This is the first Zoya polish I've tried.  Before now, I haven't been impressed by the color selection, but this nice green color spoke to me when I was in Ulta (and there was a sale to boot, lol!).  I don't like having chips and usually do my polish as soon as they start to appear.  But I definitely don't like it when I've babied my manicure and a huge gouge appears in the middle of my nail!  Not cool at all.  I haven't used one of the 5 free formulas before and so far, I don't like it at all.  Give me the chemicals that make nail polish last a week please!  I guess I'll go repair my chipped nail now, and hopefully that'll be it for a while.  I recommend this polish only if you're sensitive to the chemicals in nail polish.  Otherwise, try Whim, Butter London, Dior or even Essie.  All of which last longer than this Zoya polish.",3.0
much lighter than it appears,3.0
"I was really excited to try this brand. I must say that the after effect, was pretty anti climatic. The color is more of a coal, than a true black. The finish isn't matte, either. It even has a shine to it. So it's like a shiny off black....not what I was seeking. Also, the color was rather difficult to remove (as compared to other brands).

I give it three stars because...if you're seeking a nice, off black...this is the one for you.",3.0
"Bought this  nearly 7 mo ago but just now getting around to trying it as I was using some nail hardener polish to try to get my nails long enough to use a colored polish. I also bought the Zoya Anchor base coat and Armour top coat. Yesterday decided I could finally try them all. So washed nailed in hot water with Dawn detergent to remove any oils, dried and started with base coat, 3 coats of color, since the color is a bit on the thin side, and topped with top coat, letting each coat dry more than to touch in between. First thing I noticed is I had to keep shaking up the color polish as the colorants in the polish start settling really fast. But what was worse was that only a few hours after last coat dried, the polish started chipping in tiny chips off the tips, and when I woke up this morning, about 12 hours after polish was last applied, I looked closely and saw 4 tiny chips off the tips.  So I really can't recommend at this time. Will try again in a week and if the polish doesn't chip again, will update.",3.0

"Channing isn't even close to candy apple red (the color I'm wanting).  It's an orangey rust color.  Would look nice with a beige or brown outfit for the Fall.  Reminds me of Halloween.  As for non-toxic?  Nope.  I have chemical sensitivities and my throat is burning and ears are ringing.  But, it does go on smooth like everyone says it does.  I'm wearing the Livingston right now and it's a very pretty red.  Would love to buy more colors from Zoya, but so far the only polish I don't have allergic reactions to is the cheapy PURE ICE from Walmart.",3.0
Pretty!,3.0

"At first I thought they sent the wrong color, but the name on the bottle is correct.  The picture is totally different than what I got.",3.0
"Zoya describes this color as ""warm light coral with pink and orange tones.""  The actual color is definately NOT coral. It is a medium dark orange with no pinkish hue. The photos provided by Amazon are a terrible representation.  Before buying this nail polish I did a Google search for images.  In many of the photos the color looks coral.  They were probably taken in sunlight, which makes colors appear more pink.  If you like orange nail polish, you will probably love ""Rica.""  However, I do like that the gold color is evenly dispersed throughout the polish.  In sunlight it resembles glitter, giving the polish extra sparkle.",3.0
I purchased this base coat to go with Zoya polish I had also ordered through Amazon. I really don't know how well this product works because the Zoya nail polish did not last longer than any other polish I have used in the past. The reviews claimed that Zoya products were superior to other polishes but I did not find that to be.,3.0
I was a little disappointed with this product. Application wasn't that great and the color was...well ugly. I was hoping for a grayish army green but instead it kind of reminded me of swampy green mixed with gross baby food green. I was looking for a nice greenish autumn color...instead I got the ugliest shade of green. It could be how it blended with skin tone as well. Still going to keep it and see if it grows on me.,3.0
The color is beautiful in the bottle but sort of lacks pop when you wear it.  Might be nicer if you have either lighter skin or darker than light olive like myself.,3.0

"I bought a bottle of Farah in the spring and used it once.  It's now August and I opened it again and it's thick and syrupy - as if its been sitting around for years.  Application was sticky and awful.  It bubbled when it dried.  I'm disappointed Zoya, because you do make a lot of fantastic colors, but there are lots of other companies out there doing safer polishes in just as many fun colors...Butter London, Anthropologie, Deborah Lippman, Essie...we have more choices now so I'm officially off the zoya bandwagon.",3.0
The colour is not the same as the picture but it's still pretty. It started chipping the day after I put it on though which was disappointing.,3.0
"I adore Zoya. It is by far my favorite nail polish brand. Zoya normally goes on smooth and lasts a long time. This unfortunately is not the case with Twila. The color is gorgeous and looks great in the bottle. It just did not go on great due to the majority of the bottle being glitter (including ""bar"" glitter).

*layer 1 - Some parts of my nail had glitter, others didn't. It looked awful so I decided to go for another layer.
*layer 2- Now Twila is starting to show up blue and glittery. It looks kind of weird though like there is no polish, just glitter. The glitter is hanging off of my nails in a couple of spots since there are glitter ""bars"" in this polish.
*layer 3- A few spots looked like they needed a third layer, but after trying the first nail I gave up on layer 3. It was too clumpy from layer 2 to fill in the spots.

The night that I painted my nails I was wishing that I hadn't. I was losing glitter everywhere and they just felt wrong. My nails were clumpy, bumpy and frustrating. By the end of day 2 my nails were highly chipped and it was time to remove the polish. While this one looks gorgeous online and in the bottle, it is not efficient. Skip it.",3.0

It chipped with in two days of the manicure.  I had already received my products which I ordered, so I applied the chipped nails.  The product is OK if you have time to coat at least three x's and wait to it dries.  I have inquired with others at work and they state the same thing.

the finish is very matte so you definitely need a clear coat (i use sally hansen quick dry). the color is nice though,3.0
I like this nail polish but it is not at all the color in the picture. I thought I was getting a beautiful bright blue but it's really not that bright. Still a nice blue but very disappointing after spending $10 dollars on it =(,3.0
"I was looking for a rich royal blue nail polish. Had seen swatches of Essie's Bouncer It's Me on the interwebs and thought this was the one! First coat was thin and very watery. Not at all what I expected. Second coat...still watery and sheer. I'm a fan of L'oreal's Miss Candy nail polishes. They're sheer and gel looking. I thought this would be something like that, but it dries matte-ish. A coating of Seche Vite improved it and gave it plenty of shine, but was still quite sheer. If you want a more opaque look, you'll definitely need at least 3-4 coats.",3.0
"At first I thought they sent the wrong color, but the name on the bottle is correct.  The picture is totally different than what I got.",3.0
"Zoya describes this color as ""warm light coral with pink and orange tones.""  The actual color is definately NOT coral. It is a medium dark orange with no pinkish hue. The photos provided by Amazon are a terrible representation.  Before buying this nail polish I did a Google search for images.  In many of the photos the color looks coral.  They were probably taken in sunlight, which makes colors appear more pink.  If you like orange nail polish, you will probably love ""Rica.""  However, I do like that the gold color is evenly dispersed throughout the polish.  In sunlight it resembles glitter, giving the polish extra sparkle.",3.0
"The color is pretty, after 3 or 4 coats, but it is more of a dull pink.  I expected it to be brighter.  I am a pink lover, so it worked.",3.0
"I loved the way that this looked in the bottle but once i placed it on my nail i hated it, it made me look like i had barney hands. I may look a little better on fairer skinned people though.",3.0
The color is beautiful in the bottle but sort of lacks pop when you wear it.  Might be nicer if you have either lighter skin or darker than light olive like myself.,3.0
"Shipping was fast and overall I can say nothing bad about the shipper. The product itself is horrible. The neon color applies streaky and when it dries it almost looks like candle wax, even when applying a glossy top coat. I heard that you should apply a white color nailpolish base first and then apply the color. I am going to try that. The product itself is a little hard to work with. I love the color though.",3.0
"The color is a fun, bright summer color.  Neon without being ridiculous.  However, it was very thick and not smooth.  It was difficult to put on smoothly.  It also took three coats and dries matte.  I put a top coat on so its shiny anyway. It's ok, not great.",3.0
"The product itself is fine.  However, I hate getting a polish and finding when I use it that it's got sparkles or is marbled.  There was inadequate description of the product on your website.  If the seller doesn't provide that information, then Amazon should request it.",3.0
"First off I love the color of this polish in the bottle.  However, as is noted it is translucent---so I bought the Essie Blanc--which is recommended as a first coat.  It still took about five coats for the polish to look ok---not fantastic just ok.  I am not expecting this manicure to last long as it required so many coats to look acceptable.  I will have to try it without the white undercoat maybe it will look ok but I doubt it.  I would not buy this color again.",3.0
"Based on what I read, I expected it to be stronger in flavor and effect. It's a nice mint flavor, but I expected 'curiously strong'.",3.0
"I bought a bottle of Farah in the spring and used it once.  It's now August and I opened it again and it's thick and syrupy - as if its been sitting around for years.  Application was sticky and awful.  It bubbled when it dried.  I'm disappointed Zoya, because you do make a lot of fantastic colors, but there are lots of other companies out there doing safer polishes in just as many fun colors...Butter London, Anthropologie, Deborah Lippman, Essie...we have more choices now so I'm officially off the zoya bandwagon.",3.0
"I adore Zoya. It is by far my favorite nail polish brand. Zoya normally goes on smooth and lasts a long time. This unfortunately is not the case with Twila. The color is gorgeous and looks great in the bottle. It just did not go on great due to the majority of the bottle being glitter (including ""bar"" glitter).

*layer 1 - Some parts of my nail had glitter, others didn't. It looked awful so I decided to go for another layer.
*layer 2- Now Twila is starting to show up blue and glittery. It looks kind of weird though like there is no polish, just glitter. The glitter is hanging off of my nails in a couple of spots since there are glitter ""bars"" in this polish.
*layer 3- A few spots looked like they needed a third layer, but after trying the first nail I gave up on layer 3. It was too clumpy from layer 2 to fill in the spots.

The night that I painted my nails I was wishing that I hadn't. I was losing glitter everywhere and they just felt wrong. My nails were clumpy, bumpy and frustrating. By the end of day 2 my nails were highly chipped and it was time to remove the polish. While this one looks gorgeous online and in the bottle, it is not efficient. Skip it.",3.0

The toothpaste is great but the price for this is way too much for a small tube of toothpaste. I want to love this more but the price is the deal breaker for me as an every day toothpaste. I just save mine when I want to travel or something special and use my Tom's toothpaste as my daily.,3.0

"I bought this because I thought the tube was going to be old school style aluminum toothpaste tube which could be recycled in a more earth friendly way. it arrived and the bottle appears to just be metal colored plastic. I don't think its completely fair for me to rate lower because of this because I am probably among a very small minority that would even care about this but just in case anyone else was thinking they were getting a non plastic container it should be known that this is not the case. Tooth paste seems good, not sure what makes it worth so much more than any other though. its okay. nothing special. Id love to see either biodegradable or properly recyclable tube.",3.0

Not as good as you think,3.0
I have used these for a few month now. This is a lot better than regular toothpaste. Strong mint flavor plus very refreshing after brush.,3.0
"Taste: it's OK.  It's a bit different than your standard types of toothpaste.  Has a unique aftertaste compared to my past toothpastes.  Overall, not bad.  At this point I would be giving this product 5 stars...

Then you take price into consideration.  WAY to much money for the quantity you get.

Then there is the packaging.  Sure, it looks great.  But the functionality leaves something to be desired.  The lid requires 1 1/2 turns to be removed compared with the two other toothpastes I had in my house which are 1/4 turn.  This sounds silly as a complaint but if you are holding your sonicare in one hand and the toothpaste in the other it is annoying to take the cap off as you must twist, release, twist, release etc... causing you to drop the lid on some occasions.  Such a minor thing.  But it makes a difference in every day use.  Plus, why reinvent something that is tested and true?  It's cool to make the lid all fancy looking but don't mess up the functionality.

Beyond that it is odd but you have to squeeze the tube much harder than my past toothpastes to get the paste out.  The toothpaste itself doesn't seem significantly thicker than other toothpastes.  The hole in the tube seems smaller.

All in all I will not be buying this again.  I may, in the future, buy a different flavor just to try another one out.  But I don't see me paying this much for this toothpaste on the regular.",3.0
"The aesthetic for this product is what you're paying for. The quality of the actual toothpaste is mediocre at best - not as minty or refreshing as expected. The packaging is gorgeous, but that's about it.",3.0
Tube is unpractical with the screw on top.,3.0
I was expecting STRONG mint flavor. 3 stars are given because it leaves a chalky aftertaste in my opinion. It's mint flavoring is weaker than the standard Crest or competitor brands. There's no wow factor. Perhaps Marvis has been around for a long time but their product is very OVER PRICED and OVERRATED,3.0
"I am a product junkie and really love to try different oral products just for the experience. I find myself having to brush my teeth twice to feel the strong mint toothpaste take effect. I think it's far too overpriced for the 3.8 ounces. I absolutely love the packaging and the tube it comes in, very classy. This classic strong mint in my opinion is ok. I still have three other flavors to try. I can't say I would purchase again.",3.0
"Heard a YouTuber RAVING about this toothpaste, and I love a fresh mouth as much as anyone, so I gave it a try. It tastes nice, freshened my breath, but no more than standard toothpaste from the drug store at a fraction of the cost. While it was nice, and served it's purpose, I likely will not repurchase.",3.0
"Okay product, I think this product is little expensive for its quality.",3.0
"I ordered the Amarelli toothpaste a while back and thought I would try this one too.  Yes, it leaves your teeth feeling REALLY clean, but the flavor was lacking.  I thought this was going to be a huge blast of mint and it really isn't.  It does taste good, and like I said, your teeth DO feel really clean.",3.0
"OK, FANCY PANTS TOOTHPASTE........EXPENSIVE. NO MORE....FROM NOW ON I STICK WITH ARM AND HAMMER

It's a quality office but not as great as reviewers made it seem. I was slightly sad after my first brushing experience with it. I was expecting more :-(,3.0
"It's just ""eh"" for me...... This is definitely not what I would call a ""strong mint"". It tastes vaguely of altoids, but not nearly as strong, which is what I was hoping for. The tube was not sealed at the end, which sort of throws me off a bit. It feels like it would be very easy to tamper with. The paste itself is smooth. Not gritty like a lot of pastes out there. My teeth feel clean, but at 10.50 a tube, I don't think I would purchase this again.",3.0
"Although the Aquatic Mint toothpaste tastes phenomenal, it only last maybe 2-3 seconds in my mouth. The taste is sweet, minty but mildy so. More refreshingly minty than harshly minty. I think Aquatic works as a descriptor because it does make you feel refreshed and cooled like the ocean.

Thankfully the menthol does seem to linger as my mouth feels more refreshed than when I used the Colgate whitening toothpaste.

The toothpaste cleans as well as my old Colgate toothpaste. What sets it apart is the taste and texture. This toothpaste is silky smooth, not gritty at all. I would give it more stars but the short lasting flavor really was a huge dissapointment, especially when I am paying $7 more than I would for a tube of Colgate twice the size.",3.0
Just OK. Taste is ordinary. The cap is kind of big which makes it harder to handle.,3.0
"It wasn't as strong of a mint as I thought it would be. It leaves my teeth feeling smooth, but it has an aftertaste of slight ginger to me.",3.0

"I got this toothpaste because I love the look and I enjoy using higher quality products as far as my skin and hair so I figured my teeth are just as important. I read the reviews and thought it would be great but it was just alright. It wasn't very strong and maybe that's just because I'm used to a more intense toothpaste but I wasn't impressed. I
l'll finish my tube but probably won't repurchase. I may try a different flavor like jasmine mint or the whitening but I'm still not sure,",3.0
"The strong mint flavor wasn't strong in my opinion, was like regular mint paste. This product does not contain fluoride so doesn't provide cavity protection, just breath freshening.",3.0
"From other reviews I was expecting a rush of Altoid like cooling and flavor.  Instead, this is a basic peppermint toothpaste with the texture of baking soda toothpaste (not sure if it actually contains baking soda).  It reminded me very much of the peppermint Tom's Natural which I can get from Big Lots any day of the week for less than $3 for a full size tube.  I bought the travel size as a trial before buying a full size tube.  Now I know it's not worth the extra compared to basic Crest Tartar Control (original paste) or Tom's Natural of any variety. .",3.0
"It's hard finding a good pomade for African American hair, and while this balm will mostly keep your hair in one place, it gums up and is hard to remove later. Because it gums up, throughout the day, it would look like I had little white balls in my hair. I hate that! Then, I would have to use even more of the Wen Conditioning Cleanser to get it out. Frustrating!

I used it after I used the cleansing conditioner and oil, but I would rather use my grandma's tried and true pomade than the balm.",3.0

"If you have soft curly hair this product will do the job, but it may not totally tame your frizz. I used this product with the wen cleansing creme which leaves your scalp feeling oily and dirty. Overall I think there are better products out there like the Bumble and Bumble calming creme or Curl defining.",3.0
"First of all, I watched the videos on the Wen website, to make sure I was using this correctly.  I have long, fine, wavy hair , and work out daily , sweating a lot.  I WAS just rinsing out my hair 5 out of 7 days a week , using a conditioner the same way as Wen , and using shampoo only a couple of days out of the week.

Honestly,  I am not crazy about the way my hair feels after I use this.  It feels soft , and clean...but a strange kind of soft.  Like soft wool, or cotton ball soft.  Odd. It does not feel strong and silky , just kind of a squishy soft.  I have been rinsing it out really well, and even stopped putting the extra on it for a leave in...but the strange texture continues.

This may be great for certain types of hair, but not for mine.

For the money, the results I got were  just not comparable to what I was getting doing the same routine with my Nexus Pro Mend.  I will not be reordering.",3.0
"I bought this in hope, but it's not for me. I have thick and coarse hair. Also, my hair is long, wavy, and voluminous. I have a lot of hair!!! I watched on youtube the instructional video on how to do the whole process, and I did everything, but it only left my hair as the same thing as it was. Maybe it didn't work well because I bought the sweet almond mint , and about the conditioner it's writen ""a universal cleasing conditioner beneficial for all hair types. Works exceptionally well on fine to medium hair"" Then, the styling creme is for the same kind of hair as the conditioner!!!!!!!Also, I saw the wen instructional dvd styling creme video on youtube, but Chaz Dean said that Wen conditioner adds ""body"" to your hair. Well, that's not my case! I do NOT need more ""body"". There are more types of conditioners/styling cremes that work differently acording to your hair type, so BE CAREFUL!(sweet almond mint, tea tree, cucumber aloe, lavander, fig)-  the last one it says ""wonderful for medium to coarse, wavy to curly, and ethic hair. works exceptionally on dry,dehydrated,color-treated, damaged hair"". Maybe, the FIG condioner and creme would have been better for me...

The styling creme is OK, but it didn't show any amazing results to spend so much money. My previous creme does the same thing  and it's cheaper. Maybe, one day I can buy the FIG and see.",3.0
"Well after all the hype and reading the sparkling reviews I have to say I am underwhelmed. I find that if I use this product two days in a row my hair appears greasy and unwashed - not what the manufacturers are going for I think.  I have carefully followed the instructions and cut back on the instructed amount to use and rinsed and rinsed and rinsed - still had the same result. First day my hair is shiny and healty, but if I use it again on day two...
To be fair I think I present two challenges. One is that I almost never blow dry my hair. I have extremely fine hair and try to minimize the amount of heat applied to lessen damage and breakage. Perhaps this causes the product not to dry? I also live in the extremely humid Southeast corner of the USA and was hoping this product would help calm the frizzies caused by said humidity.  Not really.
Ah well, looks great on the infomercial.",3.0
"i think the same result could be accomplished with any nice conditioner.
it emulsifies the oil on your hair so you can rinse it away with hot water - but you've got to use a ton -
and the stuff is not cheap!
if you have curly hair - you will still have frizz if you only use this as your styling cream.
not a bad product - but not really what chaz claims it should be.",3.0
"I bought this like expecting a lot but in the end, it's just a normal hair product.  It DOES clean my hair- but so does regular shampoo.  Although there aren't any sulfates in it, there is alcohol which strips and damages the hair like so many other products.  I'm still using it because I spent the money, but I won't reorder it when it's gone.  Overall, an expensive product for what it claims to do.",3.0
"I am a HUGE Wen fan now after recently starting the cleansing conditioners. The styling cream, however, I haven't noticed much difference if I use it or not.

I bought this product for dark circles and thus far it hasn't worked for that. It feels great and seems like it will last a really long time however I've been using it for almost 3 months (twice a day) and haven't noticed much change.. I'm still pretty young and don't have a ton of wrinkles around my eyes so I'm using it more for wrinkle prevention than wrinkle removal. I don't think I will buy it again once it's empty I want something that's better for dark circles.,3.0
"So I did a fair amount of research before purchasing this product.  It's touted as one of the best for wrinkles and puffiness. With my experience so far, half of that statement is applicable. Puffiness is greatly alleviated by DERMAdoctor Wrinkle Revenge, but I almost see a worsening of the wrinkles because it does not hydrate enough.  I have been using it for three weeks now, twice a day. I had to get an extra under eye moisturizer to have the full effect needed. I definitely will continue in my search for a cream that does it all in one...",3.0

The cream goes on nicely and smoothly and seems to help with some of the middle age winkles but don't be deceived to think any cream will get rid of wrinkles for you permanently, only a face lift can do that and make you look stretched out.  I haven't decided to keep it because after looking at the packaging, the last 5 ingredients out of 53 ingredients!  are all parabens which are NOT good for you and carcinogenic.  Hard to believe it's dermatologist and ophthalmologist tested and APPROVED?",3.0

I've used Dermadoctor products for over 2 years and have found them all to be very effective. So it's no surprise that after using this product for only a couple weeks I started to see a difference in the apperance of the dark half circles under my eyes. The skin under my eyes seemed very thin and worn out like. I also had deep lines at the corners of my eyes right where my eyeliner line ends. This product has definitely helped reduce the appearance of these lines and the lines at the end of my eyes in a short amount of time. At this point I can only give it a 3 star rating since its only been a few weeks but Im anxious to see if there will be anymore visible results in the future.

"I bought this concealer mainly for under my eyes but it works well for scars and blemishes too. It's not worth the $20 I paid for it though. It's an extremely small container and I had to double check to see if I had gotten a sample sent to me by accident.  It really is that small. This wasn't the case though. The advertised ounces and the ounces printed on the container were the same. Judging by the picture, I thought it would be the same size as the compacts. It's 1/4 the size of the compacts. It didn't budge when applying make over it but it did fade within a few hours, exposing my horrible imperfections on my face.. The more I use Glo Minerals, the more I wonder if A) I'm getting a fake product or B) It's getting way more credit than truly deserved. I have used the compact pressed powders, liquid foundation, blush, and concealer. Judging by the price and reviews, I was prepared to be amazed. Sadly I wasn't. Now that's I've tried most of their products, I do believe I will be searching somewhere else for a better quality product.",3.0

My other round brushes can be used with one hand - press the brush into my hair, rotate the brush a half turn, lift, and it grabs a section of my hair for blowdrying.  Maybe because the bristles are so stiff, I have to use two hands and put down the dryer, section off a piece, wrap it around the brush, and then blow dry.

It had tons of great reviews so, despite the high price, I ordered one. I got it yesterday and had the chance to use it this morning. I found it to be way too grippy, meaning the brush tightly holds the hair and doesn't come out easily, even when you want it to. It's hard to describe., All I know is it took way too much effort to do the same blowout that is done with ease with my Olivia &Garden round barrel brush.

This is some of the more expensive stuff out there, so I would expect for it to be consistent for the whole container, but that's not the case.",3.0
Its OK!!! its very waxy and hard to wash out of hands and hair!!,3.0
"I had a jar of this from several years ago that I didn't use very often but really liked.  I don't know if they've changed the formula or if it's just that my older jar has dried out a bit due to age.  This one is more greasy and doesn't feel like a 'dry' wax at all but still works if you only use in very tiny amounts.  Otherwise it just makes hair greasy.  I should add that I have short hair.  I'm thinking of leaving the lid off this one to get it to be more dry than greasy, I think it would be much more usable.  I wish I could have found the exact same formula I have in my older container but I've looked everywhere.  If anyone has a clue about a similar product with the dryer type of texture I'd love to know about it.",3.0
"This Shampoo(Paul Mitchell:Shampoo One) is ""ok"",and was---what I used to use;until,I ordered and actualy got---in a reasonable time frame,a MUCH better one! Which...is ""Neurogena CLEAN Volume(body enhancing shampoo)""----WOW! Was I impressed!
 When,this ""Shampoo One"" finally arrived from the very ""slow"" seller I ordered it from,I just stuck it---under the sink area where I shave(etc.). Besides, Paul Mitchell's ""Shampoo One""---does irritate my scalp and causes pimples to form...at least for me.",3.0
"I've used this product for years and I love it!! The reason for only 3 stars is the shipping; it was fast but not packaged very well. They didn't protect the nozzle very well, when I received the package it was soaked and the bottle was only a little more than half full. Very disappointed with the way they shipped the item.",3.0

I am not impressed with this. It doesn't hold my hair all day. I probably will not buy this again.,3.0
"This shampoo is excellent. However, the 33.8 ounce bottle does not have a leak seal like the gallon size does. This 33 oz bottle arrived with a piece of scotch tape over the lid, wrapped tight in bubble wrap, with about a cup of shampoo already leaked out. Buy the gallon jug instead, cheaper and no leaking during shipping.",3.0
"The actual product works great. True to firm hold. Smells amazing. However, the functionality is highly wasteful and dysfunctional. The spray really does get stuck at every downward push and you end up with a lot of sticky hairspray on your fingers and hand as you're trying to adequately spray your hair. Paul Mitchell has the resources to rectify this essential functional issue so I am disappointed.",3.0
Leaked.  inside of package was wet.,3.0
I like this product. When ordered the picture showed one gallon however when the company sent the order it was broken up into four bottles which became more difficult to store. I have ordered this in the past and it came as one gallon container.,3.0
"I love this hair product.  It holds my fine hair all day and gives it great shine.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was due to the shipping.

"This hairspray was recommended by my hairstylist. She said it held all day and wasn't sticky. I didn't find that to be true on either count. It's ok, but I've used much better sprays that are cheaper. I don't like a pump as it is hard for me to distribute it evenly in my hair. I get a glob here and nothing there. I also noticed that rather than make my hair shine, it made it look darker. I have sliver salt and pepper hair and people started asking me if I had colored my hair because it looked darker. I get compliments on my silver hair all the time and this spray turned it to a darker, dull gray. I wouldn't buy it again.",3.0
"I've used this product for years and I love it, but I think I'll stick to purchasing at the salon. This bottle came already opened and did NOT have the smell that I'm used to. Maybe it was old, not sure, but did not seem like true Paul Mitchell",3.0

I bought this shampoo at the liter sale at beauty brands and personally didn't care for it or the matching detangler conditioner it didn't lather and my hair completely stuck together. I'm really dissapointed because the awapuhi line is typically amazing for all there other products like the hairl oil and the shine spray. So Idk what the deal was with this one but it wasn't awful just not as good as I had hoped. All the other reviews are really good so maybe it's just me idk,3.0
It was ok.  I made a mistake and got the wrong Paul Mitchell conditioner so it was my fault not the provider,3.0

"I first discovered this shampoo about 12 years ago from my hairdresser. The scent is really amazing. It truly is the best-smelling shampoo I've ever found. It also makes my hair full and leaves it clean. When I saw it listed on Amazon I was excited and ordered the biggest bottle available. The shampoo still smells the same, however it is much more watery than when I used to buy it from my salon 12 years ago. I suspect this is purposeful and a way from the company to make more money, but I was disappointed. Not cool, Paul Mitchell.",3.0
"The bottle was broken when I received it, so I lost 25% of the product and I had to pass it to another container",3.0
Does good but there are better shaving creams out there,3.0
"Wonderful menthol & eucalyptus fragrance & effect... but if you don't use enough water, this stuff turns to glue.  I know I could use more water, but the truth is there are better shaving creams out there.  I've used several with many of the same ingredients-- they're easier to rinse and they give a nice smooth shave.  I love the smell of this one, but I won't be getting again",3.0
"I don't know what all the hype with this shaving cream is?  I am so spoiled by Henry Cavendish Himalaya Shaving Soap because it is so much better than this cream.  I really, strongly don't care for the medicine smell of the Proraso Shaving Cream and the lather I got was not nearly as thick as I would like. Next time I will use less water than just the water than was in my brush in my mixing bowl.  I will use this because I can not really afford to waste the tube but I am not going to like it .!  I gave it a 3 because it is better than Barbarsol in a can, but not by much !",3.0
It's okay but my husband says it's tough to rinse. He much prefers jack black,3.0
It's ok.  I had heard many good things about this cream and had to try it.  Not finding it entirely different than a few other brands I've tried.  I usually need to had an oil to my face before or with the cream to get a smooth glide.,3.0
Love the smell and feel but I use this to shave my head and it burns my eyes. Headslick for me.,3.0
Husband likes it fine.,3.0
"Not crazy about the scent, but it works and lathers well even with my funky water.",3.0
"The tube is covered in writing in another language-- there's absolutely no English instructions or information. For a product that's being described in all English, that's a little misleading.

It's also got some chemicals in it that make your skin feel cold, similar to cooling mint gum. It isn't horrible, but I wish I knew that would happen, so i could have avoided purchasing it.

Overall, it's a fine product, just misleading.",3.0
A decent shaving cream but nothing great about it as reviews said. It usually leaves my skin dry after use. I will try some other product next time.,3.0
It's okay but I wouldn't buy it again. It doesn't lather as i had hoped. Smells good though.,3.0
Beware airport security!!! Ive lost 2 tubes because they are over the 3.5oz limit for carry on liquids. My fault for not realizing but Proraso needs to make smaller tubes to deal with this. I won't buy anymore until i can find smaller tubes!,3.0
I can definitely say that I like any good italian soft soft FAR more than I like this.,3.0
"Very hard to get a. Foam lather with and without badger brush very strong menthol smell AMD feeling  worked great once lathered leaves residue in sink must scrub off I prefer just a rinse with water  clean up not a scrub after every shave .
Hard to get remainder of product out of packaging once 3/4 is gone it's a metal tube so yeah difficulty storing it once it's squeezed . I have ocd if the products I use don't fit under the sink or in the medicine cabinet like Tetris it irks me

This stuff lasted me forever almost a year and I still have a bit left
Over all I'm sticking to Gillette prolong shave gel  and prolong power razor u just can't beat it yea it's expensive but after wasteing over 300$ on all sorts of safety style razor products

""I was trying to go all dual edge safety razor badger brush shave oil and shave cream style ""
Stupid idea",3.0
"This product performs it job very will-- on par with the more expensive creams, in my opinion. This is my first purchase of a Proraso product. I rated it 3 stars only because I don't like the scent and the menthol. this was my first trial of Proraso, and I am looking forward to the other Proraso creams.",3.0
"I love the Proraso shaving products lineup - especially the green label. I usually purchase the Proraso shave soap, but gave the cream a try this time. Scent and consistency with the rest of my Proraso products is very good. My only complaint is that it is often hard to get a full lather out of the cream. I've experimented with various amounts of water and technique, but still haven't found the right combination. Perhaps it's just me, or maybe it's the product, but since I can't get a good, rich lather out of the cream, I'll probably stick to the my Proraso soap & brush in the future.",3.0
"I loved the way the product felt, but the instructions are in Italian. The cream is very thick and clogs the blades. This would be best used with a single blade razor.",3.0
Good one.,3.0
I want to like this product however it arrived with no protective seal and about a third of the tube squeezed out. I bought the pre shave cream to go with this and that had no seal and smells just like Noxema.  I want to like this but not even sure I am getting the real products.,3.0
"I bought this for my husband; it smells great., but dries out his face so he will not use it.",3.0
"Smells nice, but didn't lubricate enough for me to get a clean shave. I lathered it with a brush as should and went on well. I also applied again on the second run, but still was missing the extra to give a perfect shave. I got a better shave with another brand's shaving gel.",3.0
"I really enjoyed the scent of this, and the coolness from the mint against my face while shaving, but had to stop using it because I noticed my acne was more active from this. Not sure what was causing it, but I've heard mint can do that.

I've since switched to Proraso's Sandlewood scent. The scent is still good and it doesn't trigger my acne. As a sidenote, I have the sandlewood as a hard soap, and like it more than the cream that came out of this bottle.",3.0
"Poraso in the green tube has a very light menthol and eucalyptus scent. Tried it for the first time today, $10 for a 150ml / 5.2oz tube. Peanut size drop on a Simpson Duke Best Badger, made decent lather, enough for 4 shaves and then some, one tube will go a long way. Used Long handle 23c Merkur with Balzano blade. Cream performed well but nothing to rave over. My favorite is Nieva Shave Cream in a tube, can't buy in the States, only Europe and South America, (I travel), $2.45, lathers better, very light scent. Overall a better buy, if you can find it, very rare to find in the states normally can only buy the Nieva in a can, no where near the same quality.  We really do get the short shave in the states, lower quality products at normally cost,",3.0
"I like it combined with the proraso-pre-shave, but the eucalyptus fragrance is rather weak by itself in this cream (minus two).",3.0
"The bottle is far bigger than I thought, a good thing; the smell directly out of the bottle was subtle, not overwhelming  also a good thing.  And the amount I needed to work up a rich lather was very minimal so this will last a long time.

That's about all the positives I have to say. The menthol smell became way more apparent when creating the lather, almost too overwhelming. After taking a shower and using a brand-new Derby DE blade,  it took three full passes  to get an acceptable shave. On my previous products it only took at most two passes. And then I had to go back a fourth time in select areas. It was not a comfortable shave and I was left with multiple knicks  and a overbearing menthol smell I wasn't too comfortable with.

The Proraso sensitive skin product that comes in the bowl is far superior for me. It smells better and works better for me. My most recent shaving cream purchase was Cremo which worked really well also, and the smell wasn't too bad, and only smelled better as I used it.

But I've used this product twice so far and have had poor results both times. I'll continue to use it because there's just so much product left and I'll hope that things improve.

Otherwise it's back to be sensitive skin version or the other brand, Cremo.",3.0
"Tried this and cella.
This one is just not slick enoguh for me. Also it leaves my skins feeling a little dry.
Also, the menthol/eucalyptus smell isn't going to be favorite scent for many.  I didn't find it pleasant as it was too strong and I found myself picking up cella tub over this one a lot.

It is nonetheless a great value because you will get so many shaves out of this tube, just not my cup of tea.",3.0
"I like the scent.  For the price, can't beat it.  Just not ask good as other stuff.  TOBS!",3.0
"I have been shaving for 60 years and it is only comparatively recently that multiple blade razors have been available. Before that I used the only razors available--the safety razor. I have a MERKUR now and its adjustability is somewhat helpful to find the blade angle you wish, but it would probably  would stay there. The shaving cream is slippery and protects the skin but clogs the razor unless you use less but then the skin protection factor is reduced. Additionally, it has an odd smell and the wintergreen burns the skin if you use too much. The effect part is its slipperiness and thick coverage only.

For 35 years I have used a product made by AMWAY CORP.--L.O.C.-(Liquid Organic Cleaner.) Sounds peculiar but it works better than anything else. It has a pleasant smell, is a clear liquid and most of all works by ""making water wetter""--this is why it is also an effective cleaner.

As usual, use very warm water and rub in the LOC. As you shave, you will notice the beard may need rewetting because it  has absorbed the water; try it. At 73, I've shaved longer than almost all of you who are looking at this website.",3.0
"It certainly does NOT smell anything like eucalyptus, that's for sure.  It does lather pretty well, and has a slippery feel making shaving rather easy. However, the odor leaves much to be desired.  It also doesn't come out of the tube much like a paste, but has too much liquid character for my taste.  I'm disappointed.",3.0
Don't get all the hype on this product. Its ok. The scent is not to my liking,3.0
"It's not a bad shaving cream, but doesn't provide the cushion that some other's do. The size is good for travel, though. Most of my other creams come in large tubs that don't fit well in my shaving bag.",3.0

Great shave,3.0
"It is good shaving cream but not great. Has a nice scent. I would like to use other Proraso shaving creams also, especially sandalwood and Shea Butter.",3.0
"With all the hype I've read regarding Proraso, I thought it was going to be something really special. It's not - some reviers wrote this and I agree.  It's okay.  Lather is good but dries quickly and leaves skin very dry. Makes the razor blade hard to move.  It does have strong menthol cool effect much more than the barber shop does.",3.0
C.o. Bigelow is better!,3.0
"I was really stoked about trying this product, because it has received such rave reviews. I've used it for a few days, and I have to say I am not incredibly impressed. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad shaving product by any means. I was expecting something thicker, though, and this has more of a shave soap consistency once it is lathered. I have tried using varying amounts, hoping to get a thicker consistency, but to no avail. I do like the menthol, however, and will enjoy using the rest of it--I just don't see me buying it again.
Bottom line, if you're used to a shave cream along the lines of Burt's Bees shave cream, which has a thicker texture, this is not for you. If, however, you are used to shave soap, but want something slightly thicker, then this is probably a good bet.",3.0
"Proraso is cheap, so there's that. And it's Italian, so it's Euro-exotic. On the other hand, you'll probably have a strong reaction to the smell -- positive or negative. I grew tired of it after two tubes and moved on to other products. Your results may vary.",3.0
"An okay shaving cream, but not even close to Taylor of Bond Street. It is certainly less expensive, but some of that benefit is lost by the fact that more of the cream is required.

Proraso is certainly acceptable and is far, far better than the canned creams and even very good soaps.",3.0
I was told it but a review that it didn't have a strong menthol smell but the smell lingered on even after I had washed my face after shaving. I however was a good shaving cream.,3.0
good.,3.0
"I've experimented with a couple of different shave creams and tried Proraso since it seemed to be popular. Further, I liked that it came in a tube since I prefer to lather in my hand to lathering in a bowl, and the bowls tend to dry out (sometimes I accidentally leave them open and sometimes just from lack of use since I only shave my neck and then only 2-3 times a week).

Anyway, I find Proraso to be a little thin compared to other creams. Taylor of Old Bond Street, for example, is very stiff. Proraso will cling to your hand and keep together, but seems a bit ""runny."" It lathers fine as far as it goes, but I found that the lather it produced tended to be a bit thin, even after experimenting with varying amounts of water/wetness in the brush prior to lathering. For that reason, it doesn't buffer quite as well as some others and takes a bit more to work to get the lather you want. The lather was closer to what I got from triple milled or glycerin soaps than what I usually get from creams. I don't use it any more since I quit using soaps for this reason.

The scent is fine. Nothing special here. If you don't like menthol, probably steer clear. It's not particularly strong in its menthol scent, but it's by your nose. I've also spoken with a friend whose skin didn't like the menthol. I have somewhat sensitive skin and having had a problem. YMMV.

All Told: Proraso is fine. It costs less than TOBS and Geo F. Trumper creams and doesn't, in my opinion, perform as well. But, it costs substantially less and is a reasonable value for the cost.",3.0
"Honestly, this shaving cream is mediocre in my opinion. It does not lather well, you have to use more than it seems needed, and the smell is just so-so (plain mint that lasts a half hour at best). It may be a ""classic"", but so is Barbasol, and that is mediocre too. If you're looking for a shave cream that is not expensive and has an accompanying aftershave that is classic too, look to Pinaud Clubman for Men. Now THAT is some good stuff. It lathers so well, is not pricey, and the smell is both classic and wonderful. It lasts and lasts, and to me is a much better choice. So go with this stuff if you desperately want to try something different, but I don't think it's work the 10 bucks. Go with Clubman; you cannot go wrong there!!!! Cheers.",3.0
"I bought into this product due to the rave reviews. I've no real complaints (other than the cost), but didn't find this cream to be all that fabulous compared to cheaper creams.",3.0
"I bought this because it received really good reviews.  It does lather well and it provides a smooth enough shaving experience, but I have found that other creams and gels have provided a better glide (like Tea Tree's shaving gel).

I am really not a fan of the scent.  It has a slight minty scent (which I like), but there is a hint of potting soil to the overall smell.  I took a whiff a few times to make sure that it wasn't my imagination, but it is real.  It isn't overpowering, but it is enough to turn me off a bit.",3.0
"its an old school smell, it smells like a cleaning product. i didn't like that. works well, excellent lather! just didn't like the smell.",3.0
"I had heard a lot of good things about this cream and decided to try it out for myself. I found that it's great for sensitive skin, but after awhile I noticed that the lather was not the greatest. But, overall decent! For an alternative, try the cream from The Real Shaving Company.",3.0
"Great product, great price as compared to other similar products.  May have to stop using product however due to burning sensation throughout the day, most likely due to the eucalyptus as reported by others.  Burning has decreased with every use so hoping I am building a tolerance.",3.0
"Has kid of an unpleasant scent- the menthol smell is very subtle, but the overall smell is not as nice as I would have wanted or expected. I find it works best when I use more than I think I need. I will probably continue on my search for the perfect shave cream and not but this again.",3.0
this shaving cream is ok. I've been using for about 6 months but only because i still have some left. it can be rough at times and it will dry out your face if you don't wash it after shaving with this. i do however love the smell.,3.0
"I like this stuff because it is a convenient alternative to using cake soap with a cup and brush.  Very easy for shaving in the shower, or for travel.  It doesn't work up to a big frothy lather, but it does give a nice smooth coat that works well.  I've been using it for years, and there are others that I like better, but there is always a tube of this in my shower.",3.0
"I might need a new brush but even after whipping and watering a dab of this (or even a larger amount) in my bowl it still isn't a thick, luxurious foam.

I'd like to think my technique isn't that awful but I usually don't have trouble getting peaks on my shaving cream.

The Proraso is much better than the various soaps I was using prior and much easier to build up. It smells very nice but doesn't give me enough foam using the standard amount. The search continues.",3.0
"That's really all I have to say. Doesn't smell like the aftershave at all. Not my favorite shave cream, but a lot of people like it.",3.0
"I shave slowly and carefully, so it was bothersome when the lather dried out before I was done shaving.  Would not recommend to slow shavers.  It's great before it dries out, though, so if you shave quickly it's a great product for the price range.",3.0
"overall this shaving cream is OK
* Good leather but leaves the skin very dry after shave, should have more moisturizers",3.0
"The lather just collects in brush and leaves little in the mug to work with.  I find that I have very little to work worth on the 3rd pass and have to add another dab in the mug and relather.  I was not happy with the film it leaves on on the razor, I felt I had to wash with soap and water afterwards.  I did like the smell and cool sensation when using it.

I'm new to brush shaving and using a safety razor.  This was only my second shaving soap I have tried so it very well be I need more practice with this product and develop a technique that works for me.  VanDerHagen plain jane soap works better for me.  For now I'm off to try a different brand.",3.0
"I like the smell and it gives the razor a smooth ride. But it takes too long to lather up. I also find that I need a lot of cream to get the right amount of lather. I will try the sensitive skin cream from Proraso next, but I will not get this one again.",3.0
"This stuff will last you forever. Got a real strong odor of mint and feels really invigorating on your skin. So cool.

I'm not a huge fan about the menthol/eucalyptus scent but the product is good. Although I feel this cream REALLY dries out your skin compared to other creams and soaps I have tried. So idk I'm not a huge fan so far but it's a classic among the traditional wet shaving community so maybe I'll have to try their Sandalwood scent.

But overall not bad.",3.0
"Have only used this cream a couple times now and it works very well overall.  Lathers up nicely
and leaves your skin pretty soft.  Only reason I gave it 3 stars versus 5 is simply because I havn't used
it enough and also havn't done any head to head comparisons to other creams and shaving soaps??

Im a newbie to the safety and straight razor world. Prior to my recent purchase of an old school safety razor
I have only used disposables all my life and I'm in my forties now.  Wow was I missing out!!  If I knew how
great the older school safety razors worked all these years I would have made the switch a long time ago!!
Not to mention the hundreds, yes I said hundreds of dollars you will save by not buying any more of those
over priced disposables!!??  For only about 22 bucks I have a supply of 300 double sided safety blades!!! OMG!!
And I can get about  10 shaves minimum out of one blade if not more!!  So in other words I have enough blades to
last me a couple if not three years for only 22 bucks!!  I was spending on average about 60 to 75 bucks a year
if not more easily on those disposables!!  what a major ""RIPOFF""!!",3.0
"With all the hype I've read regarding Proraso, I thought it was going to be something really special. It isn't - it's no better than Palmolive, Ingram, Arko,etc. In fact Arko which can be purchased for about 1.98 on line is probably my favorite. Ingram is good too, and is more mentholated than Proraso and half the cost. The most important thing is the brush and the proper mixture of your lather. As far as blades, I've seen little difference - they're all good and I recommend Derby which are very reasonably priced on Amazon.",3.0
"I figured I would step up to the brush and cream method of shaving. So, I picked up a nice new single edge razor, etc. I continued to use my old, cheap, Gillette Fusion for Sensitive Skin gel, and it was working rather well. Then I moved *up* to a fine brush and this cream, and that's where things went downhill. The shave was about as close, but not as consistent (uneven spots). Moreover, my skin was highly irritated afterwards. Not every cream is for everyone, so this doesn't make it a bad cream, it just really does not work for me, at all.",3.0
"I chose this product specifically because it's in a tube, and I was tired of dealing with the mess of soaps in a bowl.  Unfortunately when my item arrived it was Proraso in a bowl -- not a tube as pictured.

I really didn't want the hassle of returning an $11 item so I kept it, and it works great.  I just wish they had sent me the item described and pictured.",3.0
"This may be obvious to many of the people purchasing this product, but this isn't the best cream to use when you're using a standard cartridge razor with moisturizing strips (i.e. Schick Hydro or Gilette Fusion).  The cream, coupled with the moisturizing strips creates an annoying goo.  I'm sure this cream is great for old fashioned straight razors, but I would not recommend it for most modern cartridge blades.  If you're looking for a good cream to use with a cartridge blade, try out the American Crew shaving cream.",3.0
"Amazon states at the top of this page that I purchased this product in July of 2010. Proraso was my first real shaving cream. I used several brushes with it and for the first couple months it was a mediocre performer. It probably would have been better if my wet-shaving techniques were better. After switching to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taylor-of-Old-Bond-Street-Sandalwood-Shaving-Cream-Bowl-5-3-Ounce/dp/B0007MW2ZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce</a>, I went back to my Proraso tube this past May, so it was LESS than a year old. I opened up the tube and tried to squeeze some out and it happened to have hardened into a paste-like clay. I cut the tube open to get some out, but it had become unusable. Proraso was a good starter shaving cream. I liked to vary it between this and TOBS Sandalwood. But my recommendation, having wetshaved for about a year and a half now, is for a beginner to try a scent of Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream. I feel like it is much easier to lather up and it is a bit more personalized with different scents of your choosing for the same price or only two dollars more (depending on scent).

Summary: Proraso was an adequate performer but didn't last more than eight months. It is important to note that I bought this as an introductory cream because of its price, but there are several creams that are just as affordable, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taylor-of-Old-Bond-Street-Sandalwood-Shaving-Cream-Bowl-5-3-Ounce/dp/B0007MW2ZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Classic-Italian-Cella-Shave-Shaving-Creme-Soap-150g-Hard-Plastic-Travel-Container/dp/B0015IXM4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Classic Italian Cella Shave Shaving Creme Soap-150g-Hard Plastic Travel Container</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speick-Shave-Cream/dp/B001583QRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speick Shave Cream</a>.",3.0

"I purchased Poraso's shaving cream after reading some of the other reviews and seeing that it is very highly rated.  I was generally satisfied with most creams/gels I have tried but I figured I should try one of the best products to see the difference.  After about 1 month of using Poraso, I beleive most other reviewers are overly complimentary about this product.  I admit that the cream is better than most commercially available creams and gels in that it smells nicer and lathers better, so if price is not an issue, stop reading this review and buy the product.  However, for the other 99% of us who are not made of money, I don't think the extra quality justifies a price of almost 4 times as much as most other common creams and gels, per ounce.  In my shaving experience I was not able to use noticibly less Poraso cream than my normal brands (both Edge progel and Barbasol) so I did not factor that into my price calculation.",3.0
"Proraso just lathers up too thin and runny.  Im having a hard time figuring out how wet my brush should be and how much cream to use. This morning I just said screw it and resorted to what was left of an old jar of Art of Shaving that I had laying around. They want you to use a thick opaque lather and leave it on for at least two minutes...right after the shower with shave oil on, I once again am having the hardest time having this stay on.

The cooling soothed feel you get with a splash or two of cold water is nice, but just wish the stuff lathered up a lil better.",3.0

For the price, this should never have been an issue!",3.0

When I first received this blow dryer I was completely in love with it. It was the first dryer I could use without needing a flat iron to finish. Its been about 2 months and it does not get as hot and does not have as much power as it did. I am back to having to rely on my flat iron. Pretty disappointing considering how pricey it is.,3.0
"Not the same as the original! Break easily and short cord. Won't buy again. My first one lasted 9 years, this and the other 2 I bought on Amazon didn't last more than 1-2 years! Either it's a fake or not made the same as it used to be.",3.0
"I have had this blow dryer since October 2014, and in March it stopped working.  I have to pay for shipping TO and FROM the manufacturer for repairs? What a load of B.S.",3.0
I would have liked a lower level blower setting.  It's almost too much making it harder to handle. It's just OK. Was disappointed for the amount it cost.,3.0
"It's okay, but for the price it does no better than my $15 Walmart dryer. Except that it's quieter, which is nice. It in no way helped tame my long, slightly curly, very coarse, thick hair, which I've now chopped off into a pixie because I was tired of struggling with it.",3.0
"Worked well for 9 months, then the heating element went.  They fixed it for 12.00 (for shipping), which is cool.  Really, for this amount of cash we should not have to send it back for two weeks, but it's great they stood by their product.",3.0
The color was not the same pink in picture and the nozzle was black.,3.0
"My previous dryer was a Revlon RV544 Tourmaline 1875 dryer.  I was looking for a faster hair dryer and so I settled on this Elchim.  Some notes:
- While the Elchim pushes air faster, it's nozzle is somewhat smaller than that of the Revlon, so the overall rate of volume or airflow could very well be the same. For me this was disappointing-- I wanted something with significantly higher airflow.
- The ""warm"" setting is truly warm, and not too hot.  I did like this.
- So far, both high and low settings have sufficiently dried my hair without ever burning it. I like this feature, too.
- I do wish it had a ""cold shot"" button, a button I could press to temporarily interrupt the heat settings.
Overall it's better than what I had, so I'm fairly satisfied with this dryer.

Update- someone asked where it's made. The box says it's made in Italy.",3.0
"I am disappointed for the price.  While it does a decent job of drying hair, the control switches are in the most inconvenient place.  They are right where your hand wraps around the base to hold the drier, so I am constantly hitting them and turning off the drier inadvertently.  It's very annoying.  Do not buy a hair dryer that has switches where these are located as it makes hair drying difficult. It also doesn't seem to get hot enough and the motor isn't as strong as other driers I have used.  I will not buy this model again.",3.0
"This dyer works fine. I am not sure it is better than a drug store brand, but it is very quiet.",3.0
"This is a decent hair dryer, however, poorly designed as you'll accidentally hit the bottom button and switch it to cold air. Also, I would expect the red button to change from cold/hot air and the black button to be on/off, but it's the other way around.",3.0
Unable to take advantage of warranty if purchased fromAmazon.  Disappointing.,3.0

Why didn't I send it back?  Too lazy I guess.",3.0
Nice but was expecting a bit more for the price but is for sure it is a very nice hair dryer.,3.0
I ordered this because I have long hair that takes forever to dry. My hair is also on the frizzy side. This blowdryer is nice but not worth the extra money in my opinion. It might take a couple minutes off my drying time and maybe there is a slight less frizz but nothing drastic. It's a good dryer but I will not pay the extra money to buy a new one if this one breaks.,3.0
"Its not that different from a regular hair dryer, specially taking in account the price you pay for it...nothing special about it except the high price tag",3.0
Not a bad blow dryer but the T3 blow dryer I used to have was better....hopefully this lasts me a while.,3.0
I like it because it dries fast but it's a bit heavier than I would like it to be and it gets too hot.,3.0
"I looked at this hairdryer in person in the store before ordering on Amazon.  Just a heads up, it is supposed to come with a second filter and a yellow warranty card.  Every single one in the store had this card to be mailed in to activate your warranty.  Without doing this, your warranty is void.  I received this dryer without the extra filter or the card.  Returned to try again and ordered another dryer with 1800 watts.  I received a 2000 watt dryer without the screen and warranty again.  Seems the vendors go in and remove the cards before mailing them off to you.  It's a great dryer, but just deciding whether or not to risk it.",3.0

"I purchased this hair dryer to replace and older professional dryer my brother in law gave me years ago, which lasted forever.

I used it no more than 2 or 3 times before the hot air stopped working completely. I am unsure of what has happened if the fuse blow or something but all i get now is ice cold air. I have had to go back to using my old dryer which I had to get repaired as the cord was damaged.
I am very disappointed with this purchase especially since I was so excited to use this lighter more updated drier.

If anyone has had a similar problem and found a solution, I would really appreciate if you can share that info.",3.0
"I'm a beauty professional and I need a blowdryer that makes my job easier. This dryer is better than a lot I've used, but it's not the best. I don't like how small the nozzle on the end is. I have to take much smaller sections and it takes longer. Also, it does not smooth down flyaways when straightening hair. It doesn't get hot enough for my taste, and when you have a dryer that blows as hard as this one, you need heat if you're going to get smoothness. It didn't come with a diffuser and since the nozzle is so small, you can't even use the universal ones from Sally's. I used this dryer for about 6 months until I couldn't stand it anymore and ordered the FHI Nano 2000. Using the FHI feels like driving a Cadillac after driving a Corolla. This might be a good option for the average home user, but stylists, I'd try something else.",3.0
"I can honestly say I prefer my old cheap hair dryer better. This heats & cools well, just not as powerful. It may be better for my hair but just want to dry it quickly.",3.0

"I love that this hair dryer nice and quiet and feels durable. I notice the heat doesnt get as hot as other hair dryers, I assume there is a reason but the label says for professional use only which I'm not !
Also odd that the warrenty is void if you wrap the cord around the hairdryer ?? afraid of melting something the cool air?",3.0
"I have thick, curly hair and need the heat that I have so far only found to be available in a professional model to straighten my hair. This one does not seem to get as hot as the professional ones I've used so I can't get my hair to straighten like I would like. However, it is lightweight with a long cord, so it will be great for travel.",3.0
"I really loved this blow dryer. I bought it about 2 or 3 years ago, the motor still works great. The problem is the cord from the dryer to the AC plug-in doesn't have a protector or whatever you call that piece that reinforces the connection (it does to the handle) and the cord just gradually ripped over time and the wires are exposed and breaking. I tried wrapping it with electrical tape, and eventually had it repaired at a local place but they could basically just do a temporary fix (3 months), so that was a waste of money. If the design was fixed, I would buy another one. It outperformed the typical drugstore dryers I've had in the past, but I can't justify the expense for something that still only is usable for a few years. Plus, the exposed wires are a safety hazard--I wasn't inspecting it every time and only realized the problem after receiving a small shock.",3.0
Notice little improvement for my blackness. For the price I didn't see the value. I would question purchasing it again,3.0

I don't hate the concealer itself, and figure it is probably the best out there for my skin (rosacea), but I really hate the applicator. I wish it were easier to use. I have difficulty controlling the amount, and often squeeze out more than I want to use. It's not the amazing concealer they bill it to be, but I will continue to use it because I only use mineral make-up for my rosacea, and I want the green tea extract for my rosacea break-outs.",3.0

After a month of using these (one pad per day), I can't say I've noticed any difference in my skin texture and emerging fine lines. They do sting a little on my face, until the solution dries. I'll keep using them as my skin does feel a little cleaner, and I prefer these over the drugstore cleansing pads, but I'm not sure I would order more.

I'll update my post if I see a difference after this, but otherwise I think these are ""just okay"".",3.0
The pads are easy to use but leave a sticky residue on your skin. I prefer the glycolic creams that absorb into the skin a bit more.,3.0

"For me, I'm not sure if this product did much, either positive or negative. I bought it seeking results in both anti-aging and anti-acne, and didn't see much impact. However I did find it a more high-quality alternative to using, say, those drugstore acne pads with salicylic acid, which dry out your skin excessively. It felt like a gentler and more effective way to give my face a quick rubdown to remove excess oil.

I will warn that those with sensitive skin should use caution. I was particularly aggressive using the pads on an area of my upper arm (of all places) that had both active acne and acne scars. After using the pads in that area at least twice a day, I found it left the skin there with almost a sandpapery texture. I also used them on my chest, and experienced some redness. On my face, I didn't see any negative effects, but I'm also not sure if there was a tangible improvement to my acne or aging issues (i.e. lines and dark spots).

It seems like the product would work best as a mere add-on to other products you find effective.",3.0

After a few weeks of regular use, my forehead feels a little smoother, and has not broken out.

I give this product a mild recommendation for people in their 20's-30's who are largely past the acne stage in their life and are looking to prevent (or at least delay) the onset of fine lines / wrinkles. Rentin-A or another prescription retinol-based topical may be more effective, though they will certainly be more expensive.

Pros:  when you can get it to work properly, the curls are super smooth and hold beautifully.  For this reason, I absolutely love it, and wish I could figure out how to use it without the issues, below.

Cons:  mainly, the heat setting dial is super easy to turn, so it turns when you're using it, when you pick it up, or more or less when you touch it.  Because my hair is so thick, I need a high heat setting, but more than once I've gone to use the iron and I have inadvertently turned the heat setting way down, so the iron is useless until I get it to heat back up.

A second caveat - you have to be careful not to turn up/down the hett setting as you use it - in twisting the hair you can easily twist the dial and suddenly there is too much or too little heat.",3.0

"I have very fine hair and it is not ""thick"", so when I go outside on a humid day, the places where my hair is naturally curly curl up worse and the rest loses the style I intended when I left the house. Static was a big issue, so when shopping for a blower with high wattage, high heat (yes, I want HOT) and high velocity, I found this one hoping it would meet the requirements. I found it to be like most of the drug-store blowers in my blower-graveyard in the closet, going to the next garage sale. I just did not meet the expectations, not enough blow, heat and I still had frizzy static hair. It works and probably works just fine for those who have thick hair they don't want to damage, but my hair takes 2 minutes flat to dry and style. I did move on and purchased Onei MK-II for about $70 taking a really big chance. It blew me away literally and exceeded all expectations. So for fine hair users, it may be worthwhile to shop around since there are very few resources for our types.",3.0

"I had not purchased a hair dryer in 14 years; I was still using my Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen hair dryer from my youth.  Having worked at Ulta during college, I grew to love the Hot Tools products.  I was waiting to purchase this brand of hair dryer after using other Hot Tools styling tools when my hair dryer finally gave out.  On the day that my blow dryer finally died, I quickly purchased this model.  Sure, it has several speed and heat settings, but it's nothing special.  My itty bitty hair dryer from 2000 did as good of a job as the ion/ceramic/multi-function hair dryers of present day.  I don't think you're going to notice a difference in dryers until you really jump into a different price bracket with the T-3s and Chi's.  i think I could have spend about $15 less and still achieved the same look and quality.  I have very long and thick hair, and unfortunately, the speed of drying has not changed even with a much newer and larger model than the one I chose to use 14 years ago.",3.0

This is a lot lighter than my previous one but it doesn't seem to have the same power and oomph Hot Tools Pink Dragon Ionic Hair Dryer had...it still gets the job done tho...The only thing I'd say sucks is that it doesnt come with a diffuser and the nozzle is an odd oval shape it's not like I can buy a universal diffuser to fit it. =(,3.0

"This curling iron is great. It curled my very difficult hair. I have fine hair that is naturally frizzy and curly and I always feel the need to straighten my hair or blow dry it before curling it to give it smoothness, but at that point, once I curl my hair, it seems to fall flat in a few hours. This curling iron created beautiful big wavey curls, but also can create tighter more uniformed curls. My curls would last all day and if they had fallen a little, they'd still look wavey and good. It lasts on to the next day but by then, they are more like soft waves. For the price, you can't go wrong. It also has 25 heat settings. The only reason that this curling iron gets 4 stars is that it takes a while to heat up to the highest settings, but that doesn't seem to bother me since after 30 seconds, it's hot enough to start curling my hair (regardless of the fact that it's still not up to the highest heat setting)

Great, recommended for sure.

UPDATE: the clamp broke and fell out. What a disappointment.",3.0
"We already have a small 1875 watt travel blow dryer but my son is using it now.  So we needed a second one in the house.  This one has lots of features--multi temperature settings and strengths.

In all honesty, I can't tell the difference between this one, and my previous $10 Revlon one from Walmart. It takes the same amount of time to dry my hair, and to me, it doesn't seem any quieter.  I do like the IDEA of the Ions leaving your hair less staticy and healthier, but I don't know that I can really tell the difference. My husband hasn't been complaining about the noise as much, but I don't know if its because he knows I bought a new hair dryer trying to please him, or if it's actually a lower frequency. To me, with it up close to my head, I can't tell a difference.",3.0

"This product is leaps and bounds above it's other price-range curling irons - it gets very hot relatively quickly and is pretty easy to use.

Unfortunately you do get what you pay for (and I was ripped off paying $45 at the beauty store for it.)  After about 2 days of use, there was a short in the rotating cord and if the iron is held at an odd angle, it turned off.  It was still usable, but I had to modify the way I curled my hair to avoid it turning off and losing heat.  After about 6 months, you can see the ceramic coating chipping off a little - and I used the iron about 3-4x per month.

If you're in the market for a cheap curling iron - I would suggest this because compared to the Revlon, Remington and Conair brands I've had in the past, this is the closest to a high end curling iron among them - most likely you will have better luck with your iron than I did.",3.0

"If you are scouring the internet, searching for sound advice on treating your child's eczema, you have my sympathy. I was there two years ago.  (I can testify that apple cider vinegar baths baths did NOT turn things around for us.) As for this product, the cream itself functions very well -- it did clear up my boy's red, itchy skin, in combination with other treatments. But we had to stop using it. It stung him horribly. Seriously, he would howl and cry. This must not happen with most users, or there wouldn't be so many five star ratings. So we swapped out this product for Vanicreme, which, for my son, seems to work about as well and stings much less. Other treatments we used and liked? At the height of his very nasty outbreak two years ago, we included twice daily baths in Mustela's milky bath oil (which is a great product), a weekly bleach bath and regular applications of prescription strength hydrocortisone. Today, we use the milky bath oil a couple times a week along with daily applications of Vanicreme.",3.0

"Nice smell and feels refreshing but seems to leave a film on my skin, I have quite oily skin though so might just be better on other skin types",3.0
I got this toner without realizing that it is actually meant for men and I am a female.  The scent of the toner is that classic harsh smell of alcohol mixed with peppermint.  It does a good job opening the pores and giving you that refreshed feeling after using it.  I don't see any reason why it would be targeted toward men alone.  The scent of the product and use is really pretty gender neutral.,3.0

"This shower gel is perfectly acceptable. It comes out of the pump nice and thick, and one squirt made a good amount of lather on my shower puff. I didn't realize when I ordered it that this product was intended for men. I suppose the scent is sort of manly, but it's not overwhelmingly so. I don't see any reason why women can't use it too, if they want to.

I saw ""bergamot"" and hoped it would smell like Earl Grey tea. It doesn't. It smells like chemicals to me. I'm not a fan of the scent. (Someone should make an Earl Grey scented shower gel. I'd buy that!)

There's nothing special about this product. You can get a perfectly good, nice-smelling shower gel for way less than what this stuff costs.",3.0
"As a body wash, this Baxter of California product works fine. It cleans without stripping, and does not leave a filmy residue on the skin. If this Body Wash had been a different flavor, I may have liked it. The Bergamot and Pear is not an appealing scent to me. It is all Bergamot, no noticeable Pear. The scent is very sweet, and almost medicinal. My husband refused to use it as a body wash due to the scent, so we moved it to the sink for hand washing purposes. The cloying fragrance lingers on hands, though, and we ended up trashing it because no one in the household liked the smell.

Bottom line - the product is effective as a body wash, but this flavor did not work for me.",3.0
"This should be a great bodywash, considering the price. The problem with this one is that it barely foams (or suds, or lathers) at all. You have to use way too much of this product at once and at its price, it becomes a pretty expensive shower. I have found other natural alternatives that work very well.",3.0
"I really was not a fan of the scent, which was very faint.  Really there is nothing terrible about this body wash but nothing great either.  I did like the pump, the consistency and it did lather well but otherwise a perfectly average product.",3.0
The big problem with this shower gel is the lack of lather. I need to pump 4 to 5 times into my poof  to get a somewhat lasting lather. It's not good enough for that price. I won't be buying it again.,3.0
"The smell of this is really good. Very fresh, pure, and clean. More pear than bergamot in my humble opinion. Only issue is that is doesn't really lather, and no, our water is not hard. I literally need three pumps to wash my Adonis like frame, which is really two pumps too many.",3.0
"This product is targeted toward men, however I think the scent would work for a man or a woman.  As body washes go, this one is pretty thin and doesn't have a very good lather.  The packaging is nice, but since it's pretty expensive for a ""so-so"" product, I doubt we will be purchasing this product in the future.",3.0
"I'm not sure what I honestly expected. I guess that I, like generations of people, have a soft spot in my heart for tea, earl gray. Knowing that there is bergamot in that tea, and knowing that I like the smell of pear, I was really looking forward to this. And I can say that I was pretty disappointed. It turns out that bergamot will totally drown out the smell of pear, especially if enough bergamot is used to make this potent (and a bit pungent). Not something that I would say is appropriate for women, or most men. But if you're into strongly scented personal hygiene products (think Old Spice level), this might be for you.

To find out whether you'll like this soap, perform the following test. First, steep an Earl Gray tea bag in 95C water in a tightly sealed container for about five minutes. Take the lid off and inhale as much steam as you can, paying attention to the almost cinnamony-nutty smell that you detect. Imagine that on your hands and the rest of your body. If you didn't gag (or thought, ""Hey! Women will love that, because they think that I'm a bald, French captain!""), then this might be the soap for you. (And, by the way, you're a dork.)

As a parenthetical note, one is forced to wonder about the legitimacy of their bergamot oil, for two reasons. First, Wikipedia tells me that over three thousand tons of ""bergamot oil"" are marketed each year, while only one hundred tons are actually made. Second, bergamot (and other citrus oils) can apparently induce a phototoxic effect on the skin wherein exposure to sunlight causes the skin to redden. That didn't happen to me.

It is soap, though, so I can't knock it too hard. I didn't get red and itchy after I used it like I do with some really harsh soaps. That said, it doesn't appear to contain anything all that unusual, and I can't understand either the pitch or the pricing. It didn't dry out my hands after repeated use, and it gets normal levels of soil off. (I haven't tried it with engine grease, but I suspect that it would not be sufficient for that.) It does help get rid of the scent of fish, if you have been fishmongering.

As a final note, I haven't personally found it to be liquidy or hard to lather. I think that those people are used to PEGylated soaps and have hard water. But maybe I'm wrong.",3.0
"This review is about the Bergamot and Pear ""flavor"" of Baxter of California's Invigorating Body Wash. As you may know, bergamot essential oil is the flavoring used in Earl Grey tea. Bergamot is a type of orange (citrus fruit), and you'd think its rind would have a tangy/citrus-y bite; but it has only a mild hint of citrus, and that's what's made Earl Grey tea such a favorite over the years.

Most of us know a pear when we see one and smell one. It's one of the mildest fruity tastes and scents ever ""invented""! I love a sweet, juicy pear--especially one that's ripened on the vine and freshly picked, an experience no one should miss.

So it only makes sense that if Baxter put bergamot and pear together, you'd get a mild scent. And that's what you get. In fact, it's so mild that I can barely smell it. I've used it for a couple of weeks, and sometimes I start to wonder whether there's really any bergamot and pear essence in the formulation. Other times I just barely get a hint of pear.

As for applying it, I still like to use my hands to apply things in the shower, whether hard soap or liquid body wash. (Now, how would that work if I didn't use my hands to soap myself up? I'm thinking about it and will update this if I come up with something.) I found that applying the wash by hand brought up no lather at all. Something about being a guy in a shower makes me want and expect that I'm going to get soap lather all over me, and I won't feel clean unless I do. The experience was more like applying a lotion and then rinsing it off. And because of that, I didn't feel like it really cleaned me. Probably just a perception thing, but there nevertheless.

Next time I tried applying it with a terry washcloth. Barely a bubble. Still more like a lotion.

The next day my wife tossed me an exfoliating sponge and said, here, try this. Just a few more bubbles.

Next morning my wife threw a pouf at me and said, here, soapy boy, maybe this will work.

And, voila, it did! Three pumps in that pouf (hmm...does that sound weird?) and I worked up a nice gentle lather all over. It rinsed off cleanly, with no lingering oily or lotion feel, and it was all good. Just as good was the fact that it didn't make the shower floor slippery--something I've experienced in testing other body washes. That's really dangerous, certainly nothing to play around with.

I guess I'm just used to the deodorant soap bars with strong scents, lots of lather, and the squeaky clean skin it leaves behind. I just have to be careful to rinse the bar soap gunk off very thoroughly and then apply lotion to the areas that tend to get irritated. The Baxter wash probably leaves some good oils on your skin, and it's probably better for your skin. But I'm just guessing.

Finally, the price of the Baxter wash is a bit too high for my wallet. Summary: I'd like a slightly stronger scent, I don't like having to use the pouf, it's too expensive for me, but I think it's a good product.",3.0
"I tried and liked this body wash.  The scent was very nice, and both me and my husband liked it.  However, the small size of the bottle and the cost are what turned me away.  When looking for value, I do not think it is worth the extra money.",3.0
"I know this is geared towards men but I thought I would try it anyway. The scent is very light, I can't really smell the Pear and Bergamot. This would probably appeal to men. I thought the packaging was very plain, almost as if it were trying to seem very expensive and something that one would buy at a spa. I just thought it seemed ordinary and the name pretentious. The wash isn't very sudsy and I ended up using more than I would with another product. If I were buying body wash for a man, I don't think this would be something I'd buy. There are other more appealing products out there.",3.0
"Generally, I stay away from scented products. My tolerance for scent is high and scented products make me feel a little ill. So, I approached this product with soem trepidation. But the combination of pear and bergamot is nice. Initially, the scent is strong, but it doesn't linger.

My partner says this body wash hydrates his skin, making it feel less dry and itchy, something he says he suffers from a lot.

In my mind, this body wash doesn't lather a lot, certainly not as much as the Dr. Bonner's we normally use.

Because it costs $15, about $5 more than a large bottle of Dr. Bonners, and it contains about a third as much, I probably would not buy this item.",3.0

"I am 35 years old & have puffiness under my eyes. I bought this after seeing it recommended on the Maskcara blog. It did help the puffiness, but it has completely dried out my eyes! It is now wrinkly, dry, and irritated. I started using it once a day instead of twice, but still the same. I hate to give up on it & am considering using it along with another eye cream, but I'm not feeling too hopeful. :(
Update: I am using only a tiny dab now and only in the morning. I also apply a moisturizer first. I still have a little dryness but no irritation! Better!",3.0
"Great feel, texture and appealing sent. Seemed to accomplish the stated effects but only for a short lived time. If you are looking for a nice eye cream this is fine. But, other brands (more and less expensive) have worked just as well.",3.0
"Seems to be working okay.
I like the consistency of it.
Good under makeup.",3.0
"So far, no miracles have occurred! But I do see some firming. I have extremely dry skin so it is not quite moisturizing enough for me.",3.0
My doctor recommended this but I have used it before and did not get positive results.  I am giving it another try as maybe I didn't use it long enough but I think that I did.,3.0
"I love Revision products and wanted to love this one too, but unfortunately I must be allergic to some ingredient in it and can't use it at all.",3.0
good,3.0
I am a little unsure about this product. My mother said it took away here dark circles in like 2 weeks. I have been using it non stop for about a month. Granted at times I don't get a lot of sleep. I did notice a little bit. It's not as purple under my eyes. More of a lighter redish. I will continue to use this until it's gone to fully see its effects. It dries great and I use under my make up. And Amazon had is cheaper then what my mom paid. So it's a steal!!!!! Give it a try and see if it works for you. I hope to see results!,3.0
Wife has been using it everyday for ~ 3 weeks and she is not all that satisfied as there's not any significant difference.,3.0
"the last two times I have ordered this eye cream there is like a air pocket in the jar where you end up only getting half a jar of eye cream and with the cost of it that is not good. I may look for some other eye cream,",3.0
Expected more from this product. I will not reorder.  Will continue to use cerave under my eyes because it produced the same result.,3.0
I didn't think that it did anything different than usual over the counter creams.,3.0
"I have really really dark circles and have been using this product for almost 4 months. The circles are still there and still very dark, but I believe they are receding, slightly. So I will keep using as long as it lasts and if the circles go away, I will buy more. If they don't disappear, then I can re-review and give it one star or less. Also, during the first two or three weeks of using the product, my eyes burned and were watery, but that problem went away.",3.0
"Nice texture, not greasy but did nothing for my dry under eye skin. Also, saw no improvements in dark circles at all. I've been using it for about two months now. Too expensive and will not purchase again.",3.0
"Not really worth the amount of money. Good results if constantly used but, takes a good two weeks. I would suggest looking at other options before picking this product.",3.0
I have not seen any real difference in my dark rings and puffiness under my eyes. It was pretty pricey for no results.,3.0
"Hydrates great but as far as dark circles and puffiness.... not so much.
You don't need to use but a tiny bit, but for the money, not sure if it's worth it.",3.0
"I give it a 3 stars because I don't see that it does much different than many other creams.  It is OK moist, and for concealment, don't see that it covers dark or puffiness under the eyes..",3.0
"It's not a bad eye cream, I like it.
But I had a big expectation for this ""miraculous"" eye cream, and it didn't lived up to it.",3.0
"I have noticed no difference in my droopy baggy eyes.  I will continue to use it, perhaps I have not used it long enough.",3.0
"I bought this about a year ago and I'm still using it. It comes in a small bottle but last long. I like how it feels once you apply it, and didn't get any reactions I have very sensitive skin. overall I like the product, but I'm not sure if I have noticed a difference around my eyes.",3.0
"Product is not the be all end all but it does definitely reduce puffiness around the eye and brightens(not eliminate) dark circles, only bummer about it is I developed a dry patch on my lid and under eye after using it for a week so I won't get my money's worth out of it..",3.0
"My dermatologist recommended this eye cream and gave me some samples. I decided to purchase it mainly to diminish my dark undereye circles. I have been using it for 2 months morning and night. The Revision website states the product will:
*Visibly diminishes dark under-eye circles
*Smooths the look of fines lines and wrinkles
*Firms and brightens skin and provides antioxidant benefits

The product did none of these things for me. The only benefit was softer undereye skin (so I gave it 3 stars), but I think any moisterizer (for a lot less money) could do the same.  In all fairness, I do not think any product can diminish my dark circles, but I had hoped to see less fine lines/wrinkles and better skin texture with this higher end product - I did not. I do not recommend this product and will not be repurchasing it.",3.0
"Been using for about a month.  It was recommended by my dermatologist for dark under eye circles.  He told me that it was a tad pricey and that it may or may not work for me, but that he had heard positive comments from other patients.  I will not purchase again.",3.0
it does not seem to do much. it is a good moisturizer i guess. maybe i haven't given it enough time yet.,3.0
"Okay, it goes on smoothly and feels nice, but I've not noticed any improvement in puffiness, fine lines or dark under eye areas. Perhaps I'm just hoping for too much? I've been using the product for three months now.",3.0
This was highly recommended by my dermatologist. It makes me feel rejuvinated. There are several out there on the market; but this is ideal.,3.0
"They say Hope Springs Eternal but after almost three weeks I've seen no change in under eye puffiness.  I'll finish the jar (too expensive to throw away)and hope by the time the jar is empty some of the puffiness is gone.  If not, then I've wasted over $50.00 on hype.",3.0
"this product says it takes 1-2 months for a reduction of dark circles and puffiness, its been over a month and so far nothing has changed. a healthy hue is supposed to appear. if there is a hue i can't see it.  supposidly after 3 months there are very significant results and then you have to go on a maintenance regimen.  in the end i think i wasted $50.00.",3.0
I have been using Teamine for about 5 months. I bought it mostly for the puffiness under my eyes although I do have dark circles as well. It has lightened the dark circles but never really took away the puffiness. I am still on my first jar and use this twice a day so a little does go a long way.,3.0
"I haven't been using the product but for about one month.  I have noticed a difference, but want to give it a little more time.  I think it is a gradual change, but any change is better than nothing.  I do think given more time I will have more improvement, although I do not think it will eliminate the dark circles.  I will continue using until my dermatologist lets me know that another product by Dior is available.  That product is supposed to be even better with more antioxidants giving better results.  Will I buy the Teamine again...yes.",3.0
On this one was jiggled around and some of the powder was loose......elsewhere all rest was ok,3.0
Color not at all as shown. Much much lighter in reality.,3.0
"I have been using this base foundation for several years, it is the only makeup can hold up longer than 10 hours, so my face still looks good at the end of the day. The package looks new, and not used, but the package seal is opened, so powder surface looks a bit dirty.",3.0
"The photo is not was you get, you get the refill only. Nowhere on their ad does it say it is refill only. They show a green box which leads you to believe you are getting the holder an the refill. I do not like misleading advertising. The product seems like a high quality item.",3.0
"Purchased this item because of Jessica Alba's ""The Honest Life"".  Thrilled to know it is natural and can do no harm to me, however, it does not last.  Five or six hours after applying my acne shines through.  So far, the best product I've found is Glo Minerals Pressed Powder... lasts all day.  Just thought I'd try Jane Iredale because Jessica Alba liked it.  Back to Glo Minerals.  If you have any acne or pimples stick with Glo Minerals.",3.0
"I LOVE Jane Iredale PurePressed Base make-up. It is the only make-up that I will use now. I wear anything from a little make-up (natural look) to a lot of make-up (more dramatic/covered/professional) and either way it always looks great. I have very sensitive skin and this product has never given me any issues...it is wonderful. My dermatologist recommended it.

Having said all of that, I absolutely recommend this product but the trick is figuring out your color. I wear two separate colors depending on the seasons-darker in the summer and lighter in the fall/winter. I just chose poorly with this color--it is waaay too dark for me. This color is probably for someone with naturally tan skin all year round. (I am more fair skin in the winter but I am able to get a nice color in the summer depending on how much I am in the sun. I am sticking with the suntan color for the summer.)",3.0
"Buy this product all the time, no complaints.  However, it came packaged inside a HUGE box (think small microwave), with another heavy boxed item (about half the size of the main box); the OPI product was rolling around loose, with only a piece of wrinkled up brown paper.  Sheer luck that it made it without breaking and leaking all over everything.",3.0
"Just average product, didn't stay on long.",3.0
"Not as impressed as I thought I would be.  I usually use OPI's Nail Envy, I thought I would give this a try, but it does not stay on as long, and I am not really seeing any difference in my nails.  To be fair, I am pretty rough on my hands at work and at home. I will give this a little more time to see if it really makes a difference in the breakage of my nails.",3.0
My nails just don't do well with any polish or hardener product except for Hard as Hoof and daily filing and buffing with Teva nail kit. Harsher chemicals cause worse splitting and breakage.,3.0
I like OPI nail care.  I expect this to be the same high quality.,3.0
Made my nail polish color go on smoothly but also made it peel off too easily after a day or tio,3.0
"I love O.P.I. items, but when I use this one, whatever color (or even just clear) it changes the color. Not sure why.",3.0
It's an authentic OPI polish and the price was right.,3.0
"I love OPI products but this one is flop simply because of the packaging of the product. The brush keeps separating from the cap, making it difficult to actually use the brush to paint your nails. I've bought tons of OPI products over the years so I have to assume the problem is with the supplier. I've tried to glue the brush to the cap but it won't stick.

The top coat does it's job though. My nails used to yellow with nail polish when I didn't use a top coat. Now my nails look natural without nail polish so it does a good job protecting my nails. Just find it from somewhere else.",3.0
good,3.0
Maybe it's just me but when I use this it makes my nails feel dried out. Starting to skip this step or maybe I'll try Butter's base coat in the future,3.0
Great and works well but the actual bottle dries out easily.,3.0
"It works better than most base coats, but I keep having the same problem with the cap and brush breaking. I've purchased this same product about 4 times on Amazon and from other retailers and every time I get about halfway through, the clear brush becomes detached from the black cap. I finally gave up on the product because it's a hassle not knowing when you won't be able to use it suddenly.",3.0
"I got this because I mis-ordered and bought the acrylic nail base.  However, this is no better.  My nails are stained by the polish and neither seems to help lengthen the time my polish lasts.",3.0
"I do like this, but mine came with some of the brush fibers bent. It kind of makes it difficult to put on because of that.",3.0
The best I've ever tried!!!,3.0
"Didm
Nt like the color it protruded, on the site. I thought it was pink not clear. It tends to dry out my nails, and makes them break.",3.0
The jury is still out on this one. I've not been able to tell a great deal of help in having the polish (also Opi) adhere. It's seeming like not to be that great. I'll be back if I see a difference.,3.0
"I love OPI products and the coat itself seems okay, but the brush bristles were frayed and the bottle top separates from the brush all the time like the glue won't hold it in.  Definitely not what I expected for a high end brand that I normally love.  I don't think it's the sellers fault but something they should be aware of as well as the customer.",3.0
"There is a ton of this - so the price was very fair.  I haven't tested this with a ton of eye makeup yet, but it doesn't irritate my eyes (unless I get a lot on there).  I was disappointed that the bottle came and it was leaking a bit.  I just got Lasik - so I'm not back to my complete makeup routine yet - but it is gentle and seems to get off the little makeup I'm able to wear right now.",3.0
"I've been using this product for YEARS, but they recently change the design of the bottle. I ordered two and one was already leaking when I received it. This never happened before. Bring back the old design!",3.0
"I read an article online about this face moisturizer and how amazing it was, so I decided to try it.  I have fairly dry skin in the winter and from what I read this moisturizer was supposed to be some kind of a miracle.  After using it for nearly a month I can tell you that it certainly is not a miracle, it's not even what I would call ""good.""  My skin stays dry after using it in the morning no matter how many applications of it I use.  I've had better luck with cheaper drug store products and have actually been supplementing my skin with those products because Baxter of California isn't doing the job.",3.0
Love the moisturizer however after time the seals on the outside of the container burst causing cream to spill out of the sides.,3.0
"I have sensitive skin so I'm always careful when I choose facial products. This moisturizer was fine on my face from that perspective, but I found it too heavy and greasy for my liking.",3.0
Its ok!,3.0
A little greasy,3.0
"This is a men's product so I made my husband try it out. He liked it enough to continue using it but he didn't feel it was much different than his Cetaphil lotion. It had a slightly thicker consistency and it did not feel sticky or heavy on his face but he wasn't convinced that it was worth the extra money that it would cost to replace his other lotion.

He tends toward oily skin.",3.0
"This may be bias because it says this moisturizer is for men but I didn't know that when I chose it. Though it's a general moisturizer so I'd say it's more unisex anyway and can possibly be used by anyone for dry skin or after your shower. When I say it's probably not better than cheaper ones I mean you could probably find a cheaper alternative on par with this one for less money that works just as well.  Though the product isn't 'bad'. It has a nice neutral smell and is extremely absorbent. That is one of the areas where it is superior- minute it hits the skin it absorbs quickly and has a very non- oily consistency when compared to other lotions.  Other than that I don't think there's anything really awesome about it, but then again it may be a different story for men but I doubt it. Skin is skin. It comes in fancy packaging or looks pretty well presented and is in a nice tube as well.

Overall, it's a hit or miss- if you want to pay 20 bucks for some moisturizer- it won't not work per se but it's just moisturizer.- Would be an ok/nice gift. But i'm sure you can find cheaper elsewhere that would work just as good. You also get a decent amount but I wouldn't say 20 bucks worth or that aspect is debate able. For men would be a nice gift/ stocking stuffer or something of that sort but too much for what it's worth in my opinion and not blown away by it. Can take it or leave it.",3.0
"I use over the counter oil free moisturizer and thought this high end Baxter oil free moisturizer would be far more superior in its effectiveness on my combination skin, but it is not. It's not greasy or bad smelling, but as one that suffers with combination skin and occasional flakiness, it hasn't performed any better than my $5 drugstore moisturizer.",3.0
"I never used to use face moisturizer, but figured I would give it a try since I bought several other products from Baxter. I really liked how this moisturizer made my face feel smooth and soft. It did not leave any oily residue either. Good product, like all other Baxter products.

-Update- I have used this for over one month and I don't think I even notice a difference. I have actually broken out in a few places on my face and am not sure if it is from this. I will not buy again, too expensive for the lack of results.",3.0
"Dermablend products are the bomb. They cover up scars, acne and discolorations or flaws on your face, but it doesn't feel heavy. If you want to use it as a sunscreen, you will need to apply every two hours. If you want to use as a foundation, you will need  to apply in layers and when done, use the powder to finish the look and set the look. You can also use lighter shades for highlighting and dark colors for contouring to get that perfect face This product has not caused any irritation to my skin and works extremely well. It also comes with a paddle so that you can apply in small amounts where needed.",4.0
"I have Asian light skin, and this color blends in well. It's great to even out skin tone and very slight blemishes. However, it won't conceal red blemishes or age spots that well. So as a concealer, it doesn't work too well. It's best as just a light foundation to keep the skin from looking too shiny. The nice thing about this product is that it does have some sun screen capabilities, so that you don't have to forgo the sun screen when using foundation. As for the product itself, it's extremely hard and dry. I don't use any makeup sponges because it's too dry. I just use my fingers to try to blend it in.",4.0
"This is a maximum coverage cream which can cover scars, acne scars, birthmarks, bruising, burns, hyper-pigmentation, lupus and vitiligo. As such, I found it just a little too heavy for daily wear if you need minimum coverage.

The cream comes with a little paddle which you use to dip a dollop of the make-up onto your hand to warm it. Just straight from the jar, no warming, the make-up is rather thick and waxy.

You start with a light coat then add more layers until you get the coverage you need.  A setting powder is a good addition to make the make-up last longer.  Dermablend makes a cleaner which works well to remove the make-up.

I think it is really difficult  to pick a color match online. The golden beige has a yellowish undertone. The sunscreen is a welcome and appreciated addition.",4.0
"This review is for the Dermablend Professional Cover cream in Reddish Tan.  Dermablend makes a quality product, & this cover creme goes on smoothly & covers well. I have never had a problem with breakouts or irritation while using their makeup. It's nice that is SPF30. I don't usually buy alot of makeup, & once I find a foundation or product I like, I tend to stick with it. I have a hard time picking colors, when I'm in the store, & it's even harder for me online. This one is a little dark for me right now, but when I get a tan, it will be perfect. It covers well, & is easy to apply.  I've attached a few pictures so you can see the reddish tan color to help you decide if this is the right color for you.",4.0
"This product has excellent coverage. Unfortunately, though, this color is too dark for my skin tone. I'm light to medium skin tone and it is at least one shade too dark. This is a very long lasting makeup and stays put. This makes it a little difficult to remove at the end of the day. Coconut oil seemed to do the best job at removing it.",4.0
"My wife tried this on and was a little shocked. First, it comes with a tiny spatula to apply it to your skin. That tells you a lot. My wife says that she doesn't want to cake it on, but she applied it and it did cover, but it went on very thick. She really doesn't need any make up, but she doesn't really see that, so she went into the bathroom and was in there for a little while and when she came out I could see that she had done half of her right side and she asked what I thought. You have to understand, my wife is a very attractive woman, and when she asks me a question she knows she will get an honest answer....not brutally honest, but honest. So, this was my answer.....""If you had a lot to cover up, I think this would be perfect. However, since you had good skin without any real issues, I think this might be overkill for you. You might want to let [name removed in case she reads this] try this, because I think it would be perfect for her."" She actually agreed. She felt it was too thick for her. I asked her how she would rate it and she said 4 stars because it does what it says. Removing it was a bit of a chore and so, one star down.",4.0
"This is not the coverage of the old Dermablend cover up. This is very similar in texture to Pan-stick if you remember that. Strong coverage with some ""slide"". As in, I couldn't have worn this often in my younger years because it feels quite like it would have aggravated my skin.  Still, it covers my skin irregularities but I don't have anything like a birth mark and not sure it would cover something like that. I'd try it in person first.",4.0
It doesn't take much of this Dermablend Cover Creme to take care of business!  I use it for dark under eye circles & to cover freckles.  Just a little will do the trick.  Excellent coverage that lasts!,4.0
"When you need spackle and ladies you know what I mean, this stuff is primo.  You receive a small paddle with it and you use it scoop the makeup.  Don't try using your fingers or a brush.  The foundation is brick but once it goes on your skin, it belts.  Brightens, covers and blends super well.  Wore it all day through 90 degree weather and through thunderstorms.  No touch up needed nor did it run.

Make sure you have a heavy duty makeup remover.  I tried the miscellar water and it did not even touch.  Used the IT Cosmetics melting balm and toner and bam, it got off.",4.0

"I accidentally ordered this in the wrong color, so will pass it on to a friend.  I did try it out, though, and it provides smooth, blendable coverage that really does cover large marks (veins, bruises, etc.) really well.  It also sets nicely, and doesn't rub off on clothes.",4.0
"I really like this product, and it's a thick cream that somehow doesn't settle into your skin in an unnatural way.  While their stick product is easier to apply, this Cover Creme is also pretty fast to apply, and it really stays in place.  The coverage is pretty opaque, but that's what makes it great for covering up things you want to conceal.  Finding the correct color online was a bit tricky, but the color I chose works well with my fair skin.",4.0
"Dermablend has been a consistent product for me. I got a foundation many shades too dark for me to try contouring. I'd say my results have been really good!

The coverage is spectacular, but this product is likely not meant for blending/contouring. I suggest it for hrs to cover blemishes and smooth texture. Make sure you get setting powder as it can be a little greasy.",4.0
"I have tried several Dermablend products recently, and this cover creme is definitely one of my favorites thus. I really like the shade, and it adds a touch of color without looking artificial. I don't have to waste time rubbing off excess to tone it down. You can use the included plastic stick to scrape off some foundation (a little can go a long way, but it's a work of trial and error) to place on your hand and activate by rubbing, then applying to your face.

I also used it simply by using my finger to gather up some and then apply it to my face. The only bad thing about it is that it's only somewhat waterproof, as indicated by the foundation left behind on my towels after washing my hands, and napkins from dabbing my face when sweaty. At least it doesn't all come off the face without a proper washing or makeup remover, however, so it's not completely bad. All in all, I was impressed by this even if it comes off a little too easily.",4.0
"If you want to use this product as a sunscreen, you have to apply it liberally 15 minutes before you get in the sun and then again every 2 hours. If you are using it as a crme foundation, one application is enough for 16 hours of lasting flawless skin. It hydrates continually and is great for sensitive skin. If you are using this as a foundation, make sure you set it with the pressing powder to keep it going for 16 hours.",4.0
"Ordering online is excellent if you know the shade(s) you need.  I would suggest, if it's possible to do so, seeing it in person first so you know exactly what you are getting and how it will work on your skin.  I had to do that.

Dermablend Cover Creme is not heavy and blends easily.  It is great for covering imperfections.  I finally got the setting powder which made a lot of difference.

It's definitely worth a try.  I waited a long time because I thought it was like a heavy cover up.  It is NOT.  But, there is a bit of a learning curve, especially if you have been using, like I was, baked foundations or mineral powders.

Highly recommend!",4.0
"Has really helped cover skin issues such as age spots, faint scars.  Sometimes in hot weather I need to dab a bit more on, otherwise it's a once a day application.",4.0
"Found this extremely difficult to apply - it was hard, thick, and didn't blend well. But, as a professional cover creme, it is likely good for using this to cover scars or other imperfections, especially for photographs. I gave it four stars because even though it didn't work for me, it seems to cover well once it is applied. Would prefer 3.5 stars as it's fairly price and difficult to use.",4.0
"This product was interesting.  It comes in a jar (as shown) and has a little spatula that you use to scoop out the product, warm it on your hands, and then apply it.

You absolutely do need to warm it.  It is almost like a thick paste.  I can see using this to cover tattoos or something similar - the coverage is high.  However, as someone who does have a few fine lines, it wasn't ideal, because the waxy texture of the paste means that when it's actually on your face it does settle in to the lines and create makeup creases.  I might try mixing it with a light BB cream to get a more transparent coverage.

It says that it's ""never cakey"" but after I had applied a thin layer using my hands and my blending brush I definitely noticed it to be more cakey than my normal liquid foundation.  I was expecting a little more from this product as the company has a good reputation.

Also, in terms of the color - go to your local Sephora or other makeup store before you order it.  I randomly got assigned to the Golden Beige and it was just slightly too yellow for my undertone.",4.0
"Excellent coverage and really blends in well.  It can be a bit hard, though, whether using a finger or a sponge.  I rub a little bit between my fingers before applying and that seems to work better for me.  If I get it on right, it looks flawless.",4.0
"This is a very full coverage foundation. It's very thick and almost reminds me of the texture of modeling clay. Before use it needs to be warmed a bit with your hand to make it thin out so it's spreadable. It covers imperfections like redness and acne scars well. I only like to use one layer. If I use more than one it feels too heavy and makes my already oily skin feel too oily. I prefer to use this anywhere on my face except under my eyes. When I tried using it under my eyes it settled into the fine lines and made me look older. I'd suggest something more light and delicate for under eyes but if you just need a good, full coverage foundation for the rest of your face, this is a good one. It did take a few times to fully get the hang of using this makeup since I'm use to liquid foundation. I prefer to use a good quality foundation brush to apply this.",4.0

"It's very lightweight and easy to glide on skin. Offers a great coverage. My only issue, perhaps mostly because of the sunscreen ingredients, is that it has a shine to it, so I don't like to use a lot of it all over my face. Other than that, it's a very nice foundation. It's not greasy at all. I don't have any breakouts from it. It also offers a great coverage for redness and sunspots.",4.0
"This cover creme truly is full coverage.  What I like about these Dermablend products is how creamy they are.  As a result, they are very easy to apply and don't cake up on your face.  I used this and the concealer and I think this actually has better coverage than the concealer.  It leaves a smooth finish on the face.  It's not so easy to tell which color you need, but once you get that figured out you will likely be very happy with this product if you need the full coverage.  It blends very well and caused no irritation on my highly sensitive skin.  Also, it doesn't have any fragrance that will irritate those of you with chemical sensitivities.  This is a good product and recommended for sure.",4.0
"(WARNING- In depth review.  If you prefer a brief summary, please see section marked THE BOTTOM LINE)

As a makeup artist, I have access to some pretty nice products to use for a variety of occasions.  When I saw Dermablend, I was interested to see what it was like and how good it might be to add to my kit in the future.

WHAT IS THIS FOUNDATION LIKE?
Dermablend Professional Cover Creme comes in a flat wide mouthed jar.  The contents are very stiff but creamy, almost like a damp watercolor pan if anyone has ever worked with them.  Inside the box is a little spatula so that you can scrape the contents onto the back of your hand to warm it up and then apply.  There is also an instructional paper that presumably tells you how to best apply this foundation.  There is very little odor and the colors are saturated.  There is sunscreen in this foundation.

HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?
FOLLOWING ENCLOSED INSTRUCTIONS (1 star rating)
Here is where I have a different take than the instructions say.  When applied as instructed, I would give this only a star or two.  It does not provide natural coverage, and it looks quite frankly awful.  It settles in the creases and just does not like to blend either.  So, if following the directions, I would say that this is an awful performer.  The idea is that you scrape some out, put it on the back of your hand to warm it up and then apply - shown with fingers.

MY OWN APPLICATION METHOD (4 and a half stars)
Here is where I have found a much better way to use this foundation.
1.  Make sure to have plenty of good skin care and your skin prepped with toner and moisturizer of your choice- but be sure it is not heavy if your skin is oily.
2,  Get a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/beautyblender-Original/dp/B000HRVC5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">beautyblender Original</a>.  That is of utmost importance.  If you take care of it, it will last for a long time.
3.  Wet the Beauty Blender and squeeze out all of the excess water.
4.  GENTLY dab the beauty blender until you pick up a small amount of foundation on the surface of the large end of the Beauty Blender.
5.  Starting in small sections of the face, bounce the Beauty Blender with the foundation around a section that is about as large around as a grapefruit on your face.
6.  At first it will look like you are not covering over much at all, but be patient, before you know it, you will have good coverage.  GRADUAL IS BEST.
7.  Don't bounce in the same spot over and over, bounce in a circular motion.
8.  After it is dried, then use a small makeup brush meant for cream (usually synthetic) and use that to conceal areas that might be very dark by dabbing gently over the area.
9.  Bounce on the concealed area edges gently to blend with the rest of the face.

SET WITH POWDER?
I use&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guerlain-Meteorites-Light-Revealing-Pearls-Of-Powder-3-Medium-25g-0-88oz/dp/B00HZSOLQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guerlain Meteorites Light Revealing Pearls Of Powder - # 3 Medium 25g/0.88oz</a>&nbsp;in color #3 or#4 for most people.  It is very sheer and with a fluffy brush it adds a beautiful glow to the skin which is very subtle as well.  I do not like this foundation set with heavy powder, it looks overdone and caked on.

DOES THIS SETTLE INTO CREASES?
I did find a little settling, but using the application method that I outlined it is minimal compared to other brands.

HOW WOULD THIS BE FOR PHOTOS?
If you are going to use this for photos such as special occasions, please keep in mind that any foundation with sunscreen in it will often give flashbacks on photos.  It is better to choose a foundation that does not have sunscreen if you plan to have special photos taken with this on.

STAYING POWER
When applied as I outlined, I found that it did last an entire day set with Guerlain meteorites, although a bit of settling once in a while in small spots.

COLORS
I have two colors of this foundation- Sand Beige, and Medium Beige.  Both are as I expected and I did like the trueness of the colors.  they were not too one way or another as is the way with many foundation lines.  Medium Beige is more pinky in tone and Sand Beige a bit more butter cream yellow in tone.  I will update in the future with other foundation colors for comparison when I get the chance to do so.

WOULD I USE THIS PROFESSIONALLY?
I prefer Graftobian HD Creme over this, although this performance does compare somewhat to Graftobian.  I did a side by side comparison with this and Graftobian HD Creme and found Graftobian to have a little better coverage with no risk of flashback and good HD appearance that I would probably stick with that. Having said that, however, this foundation is a decent foundation that is along the similar lines to Graftobian and would work okay in many situations.  Graftobian wore a little better but they were comparable.

THE BOTTOM LINE
When applied as I have outlined, I like this foundation and it does wear decently.  When applied as outlined in the directions forget it.  This does have sunscreen in it which can cause problems in photos with flashback, but if you are not having photos done it does a decent job.  Setting with powder can make it look caked on, but with a powder like Guerlain Meteorites, it seems to work a little nicer when lightly dusted.  You can also use this foundation as a concealer with an appropriate brush.

RATING
Four and a half stars, but only applied with the way I applied it.  Following directions, 1 or 2 stars.",4.0
"While I am not a fan of some of Dermablend's other products (their foundation in a tube products), the Cover Crme line excels.  It applies easily, and a small application covers very well.  You don't really notice it on your face, and it doesn't get cakey.

Like anything else, you need to determine the best shade for you.  It looks like Dermablend has over 20 shades, and the ones I have used tend to match the sample color on the website fairly close.  Keep in mind your tones on your display monitor will heavily influence that.  Dermablend does have a nice color selector tool on their website.  the Reddish Tan is one of the few shades I don't think looks natural when blended in.  It just reminds me of a spray tan.

The broad spectrum SPF 30 properties are, of course, great for protecting your skin.

Like most Dermablend products, the Cover Crme line is pricey, but it is a very nice cream foundation.  It wears exceptionally well, stays put, and also cleans up pretty easy with water, soap, and wipes.  Even though Dermablend recommends using a setting powder, I find it holds up very well for hours without it.",4.0
"I really like this foundation! I haven't tried cream foundation before, and I found it easier to blend than a regular liquid foundation. I found it slightly darker than my skin tone, but I like it and will keep using it. I like that once apply it, it doesn't feel crusty or sticky. It comes with a little spatula to get a chunk out, but I prefer to use my fingers so I can put it on lightly. I use this over my blemishes, you can hardly see them after applying. For the 1 oz, a little goes a long way!",4.0
"I followed the instructions and put a dab of it on the back of my hand to warm it and soften it, although I didn't have time getting dressed in the morning to wait for either of those things to happen and I bet most people won't either. It's easier to just dab it on your face and work from there. It is a little difficult to get out of the jar as it is not creamy. It's like hard butter. But once you start working it into your face, it spreads. These heavy makeups always leave a door open to clog pores, so getting it all off at night is equally important. My face feels a little greasy with it all on, but not excessively so.",4.0
"If you need a full coverage foundation and you do not have very many facial wrinkles, then this Cover Creme by Dermablend may work well for you. It is definitely a thick makeup which will help to cover any pigmentation problems. However, because it is a very thick cream (almost as heavy as the average concealer), if you have the normal lines and wrinkles on your face that are a result of aging, then this foundation may catch in those lines and not give you a smooth finish. One of the important things is to blot your skin after the makeup is applied. The directions also call for a ""setting"" powder, however, that may also just increase the ""caking"" effect in the lines of your skin. Personally, I did achieve a good, matte finish with this makeup and did not feel the need for a setting powder. One thing to note, this color was a bit darker and a bit more orange than I expected. If you normally have fair skin, this color may work for you if you have a facial tan.",4.0
"Dermablend Cover Creme Full Coverage Foundation provides 16 hours of coverage.  While providing full coverage, its also very light.  You apply it with your fingertips.  Dot or dab on and set with powder.  This little one ounce bottle will last a long time if you are using it as a concealer.  It also works as a sunscreen, because it has Broad Spectrum SPF 30.

To get the right color, you might want to go to a store and get find out your shade.

If you have areas on your face you want to conceal, this is the product for you.  Marketed as a foundation with sunscreen, it covers so well its a great concealer.",4.0
"I'm not sure whether my monitor color is off, but when I requested this it appeared quite a bit lighter than what it actually is. So while I was able to test this out for it's intended use I haven't been able to wear it out of the house because the color is too dark for my skin tone. The texture is thick, but smooth.  It come with a small ""spatula"" type tool to remove from the jar.  Although it states you can apply without doing so, I really feel like it does need to be warmed/worked up prior to applying which is easy enough done on the back of my hand or palm. The coverage is good and does feel a bit heavy to me, but I don't normally wear a lot of make-up. I fell like this could easily leave someone looking too made up if you're not used to applying a product like this (like me!), but there are so many tutorials and information online to help with that.  Overall I am curious about how this product enough that I want to get some in the correct shade for me and even at the current price it is worth it because a little goes a long way.",4.0
"I am always looking for an effective sunscreen that does double duty as a blemish cover-up.  Im impressed with the effectiveness of this Dermablend Blurring Mousse.  Its not too thick or clumpy and in my case does an excellent job of covering the age spots that have popped up without permission just under my hairline.

This product comes in a flat glass jar which I prefer far more than a squeeze tube.  I like to be able to actually see the product I am using but that's just me.

I like that there are shades that you can choose and its not a one-size-fits-all like so many other sunscreen products.  You can choose a tone that is suitable for both daytime and nighttime wear.  The price point is a little higher than I usually choose but Ive found a little goes a long way  you certainly don't slather it on.  In fact its basically a high end make up item.  Its very natural looking; not cackey or maskey.",4.0

Some of the pluses are that it is definitely FULL coverage (if that is what you need), and, it has a good dose of sunscreen for protection. I do have some dark circles under my eyes due to HRT, and this cream foundation did a very nice job of hiding them. Still, being over 60, for everyday wear, I found it too heavy to wear on a regular basis, and I definitely had trouble with it caking in the lines of my skin. My preference is still a good mineral (powder) foundation for everyday use. I know you don't get the full coverage that a foundation of this type can give you, but, the effect is more natural and lighter, especially for daytime use.",4.0
"Very good cover cream. Goes on smoothly, doesn't cake and is especially good for undereye discoloration. Looked great after application and stayed that way all day. I didn't even use any setting powder and it looked good and stayed on. Perfect color match too",4.0
This is a full coverage foundation with sunscreen.  It works well to cover some dark sun spots I have on my face and some red marks from blemishes.  It makes my skin tone look nice and even. It is a bit thicker than I am use to wearing but does a much better job at covering up blemishes Than what I usually wear.,4.0
"This Dermablend Cover Crme full coverage foundation came in a good size that will last me quite awhile. It came with a small plastic ""spatula"" for easy scooping. The directions said to scoop a bit out onto the back of your hand to warm it up, and then apply to your face. I usually use a make up sponge for applying my foundation, but this technique worked well. I was able to spread it easily across my face. It felt lightweight even though it contains a suncreen with an SPF of 30. In the past when I've used foundation with sunscreen and it's felt oily or heavy. This foundation felt like a normal non sunscreen foundation. My skin did feel fresh and felt smooth like the description says. Very happy with this foundation and knowing my skin is protected from the sun as well.",4.0
"Good match for my NC 40 skin tone
It is very thick and a little goes a long way
Make sure your skin is prepped - exfoliate and moisturize before applying to avoid it being cakey.
I like it for spot coverage
Or sheer it out with a damp beauty blender and a drop of facial oil
It does contain some ingredients that sensitive skin types may react to, so read the ingredient list first",4.0
"Dermablend Professional Cover Creme Titanium Dioxide Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Caramel Beige is slightly paler than the by far most popular Medium Beige, but it has an interesting application for concealing & neutralizing makeup not by hiding blemishes and discoloration in order to achieve an almost perfectly uniform appearance, which is extremely rare and thus uncommon, but by greatly reducing their intensity to make them appearing like a natural only slight variation of color typical to the rest and vast majority of us additionally intensifying with aging.  It is especially useful to cover darker and more reddish blemishes and discoloration, so the resulting hue, which is a product of making caramel slightly more reddish, becomes typical medium beige.  In other words, of 2 methods: (1) to choose a color matching the complexion to cover entirely the discolorations, or (2) to choose a lighter color and to cover the discolorations with a thinner layer showing slightly trough, the second is much cheaper, as using much less creme, and does not produce artificial, mask-like effect, but requires more artist-like skills and also use of Setting Powder on the top to finish and protect the result.",4.0
"The color is just as expected.
It goes on smoothly - although you do need some effort to get it on your finger or the little spatula. Color is even. SPF works well too.",4.0
"So I received this as part of a program in return for an unbiased review.  My wife and daughter both used it.  Very mixed reviews.  So here goes:

My wife said she'd give it five stars but it didn't cover pores.

My daughter said it's not supposed to cover pores but it was too light.  Both had minor gripes considering the price but raved about the quality, the applicability and how it looked.

In fact, they both said all in all barring their small gripes it's a 5-star product.

Not sure how to rate it but I know this, three days after it arrived, it was all gone and the portion was more than generous.  It's the consumer equivalent of voting  with your feet and one is 18, one is mid 40s, both loved it.",4.0
"Overall, I like this product. It is very creamy and easy to apply. Unfortunately, it was a bit darker than I was expecting but that was my fault.",4.0
"Reviewed by my wife: I have several Dermablend products: the ""CoverCreme"" in several colors; the ""Liquid Camo Medium Coverage Foundation""; the ""INTENSE PowderCamo"". I got them for my daughter to use for stage makeup (she has been doing character makeup for a small Shakespeare troupe in our county). It works amazingly!

This full-coverage foundation is smooth, easy to apply and gives complete coverage with just a very, very tiny amount. It comes with a paddle for mixing colors, but use it with a gentle touch, as just a simple swipe of the finger across the surface of the creme produced complete, opaque coverage on my hand (see image attached - the darkest color by the thumb). It gives a nice satiney finish that is easy to layer with other makeup like blush and highlighter. It has an almost undetectable fragrance, and produces no irritation on my very sensitive skin. It removes well with just soap and water. Truly excellent product.",4.0
"I wasn't expecting this to be so good. I did an amazing make up the other day to go out to a special event and tried this as my foundation. It comes with a small plastic spatula (and first it looked weird, but then I understood) The product itself is creamy with hard texture. It spreads easily providing great coverage to skin. The color fitted perfectly for my skin tone. I ordered the Medium Beige one.

I had no idea that L'Oral USA is affiliated to this, and and very satisfied. My make up lasted longer and with no need for touch ups. It was amazing.

I do believe the container is smaller than expected, but for this great results, I figured there is no need to apply too much product on your face. It covers pretty well and then you can smooth and finish with powder.",4.0
"I think finding the right shade of concealer or foundation online is hard.  I am not sure this is the right shade for me or my daughter, but going to give it a try.  I love the thickness of this cover creme, it will definitely do the the trick to cover up blemishes or under eye circles.  If you don't like thick heavy concealer, this is not for you.  If you need a highly pigmented, heavy concealer, I recommend you try this one.  I am very happy with it, but I might need to try another shade.  Follow instructions that come with it for application.",4.0
"Really nice cover makeup. It is a bit thick, but it glides on smoothly, and it covers beautifully. It even covers pores and makes my skin look smooth and beautiful. After applying a light dusting of powder over it, it has superb staying power even down here in the heat of the South. This is well worth the money. I'll definitely be using this from now on.",4.0
"I got this foundation in golden beige, and it is way darker than the image and swatch on Amazon shows, so it is too dark for me. Just to be sure I applied it when I didn't have to go anywhere anyway. I would caution that you should consider using a beauty sponge to apply this to get a lighter application because this truly is full coverage and looked a little cakey on the side that I used to blend with a buffing brush (when I first try a foundation I usually do one side with a brush and one with a beauty sponge to see which give the best coverage and overall look. This still looked dark on me despite using the sponge to do the lightest possible coverage. Just please beware, the color is much darker than that shown on the Amazon page.",4.0
"My skin color more accurately matches the Linen shade of DermaBlend, but I gave this Natural Beige a try, just to see what the coverage was like. Instead of setting powder, which is recommended by DermaBlend, I used Infallible Pro-Glow powder in Nude Beige. I liked the results -- the combination did lessen discolorations of the skin. But it's hard to keep from inadvertently rubbing off the makeup over the course of a day. But for a temporary solution, this cover creme is a good choice. As to ingredients, it's nice to see that I recognize the first three -- mineral oil, talc and beeswax -- and the SPF 30 sunscreen is titanium oxide.",4.0
"Good coverage with a nice rosy pink color for those of us with fairer skin, but don't expect a miracle if you are older as am I. Good screen protection and not too cakey if you follow directions.",4.0
"If used properly this cover cream will give a light coverage that will not sink into lines, will protect from sun damage, and give a nice even color. Just make sure that you blend first on the back of your hand for the best results. If you are older as am I, you are not going to find a miracle line and wrinkle eraser but rather basically a one step sun screen and color makeup. Check the company's shade chart for best results; I have used two in the fair column and both work well.",4.0
"Great product, still rubs off on clothes even with the setting powder. This caramel color is perfect for tan olive skin like mine, it was previously hard to match (everything was far too orange).",4.0
"This is a review of Dermablend full coverage foundation makeup in shade Natural Beige. This foundation is quite creamy and just a little was needed for moderate to full coverage. This foundation is buildable, however, I noticed that on my nose and cheek bone areas, it appeared very splotchy and cakey and I could not correct this (the description claims it is not). I love that the spf is so high (30) to help to reduce sun damage. I took one star off because it claims to be ""smudge proof"" and ""transfer resistant"", yet a gentle blow of my nose in a tissue, or a light touch on my face takes this product off (even when using a primer and when set with powder). I added 1 collage picture, untouched, with 2 pictured taken in the same lighting. The first picture is after moisturizing my clean face (zero makeup) and the second picture is after applying the Dermablend foundation (I used a foindation brush). I have to say that for the coverage this foundation offers, it is very light and breathable on your skin. Without too much touching of my face, it did last most of the day. I noticed it wore off of my nose and chin more than anywhere else. I am not sure if this product conceals scars, brusises, birthmarks, burns, etc. as it claims since I don't have those to cover. It did even out my skin tone, reduce redness, and cover up some of my blemishes. Overall pleased with the product but not sure how well it will work for those with more significant skin issues.",4.0
"This full coverage foundation works remarkably well on light, dry skin.  We initially spread the foundation directly on skin, and then worked the foundation across the skin manually to even the coverage and to avoid a caked appearance.  Note that a good-quality makeup brush would work as well.  To make the test as fair as possible, we applied on one side, and left the other side clean.  Once the foundation is worked into the skin it almost seems to disappear, but a mirror comparison showed that the difference with and without the foundation was dramatic.  Many minor blemishes were covered, and skin tone was much more uniform.  Darker blemishes showed through, but were reduced in color.

The skin on which we applied the foundation was naturally dry, meaning little oil.  We were pleased that the foundation contained sufficient mineral oil, wax, and other substances that the foundation moisturized the skin a little in addition to providing more uniform color and blemish reduction.  Obviously this foundation is not a moisturizer, but it is great that the foundation provides at least some moisture.

This foundation also has some sun block capability with SPF 30.  Similar to the moisturizing effects, the ability to block the sun is a plus.  While the sun block capability is far less than the capability of a true sun screen, for short term exposure to the sun SPF 30 should be sufficient.

We observe that the price of this foundation is higher than average.  On the other hand, this foundation seems to blend well without caking, and is more than just a foundation.  As with many things, the best way to see the difference between a budget foundation and this foundation is to try both at the same time, one type on each side of the face.  We believe the difference will be obvious and will help determine which kind is best for your skin.

Many kinds of foundation only provide one capability.  In addition to subduing skin color variations and providing a more uniform skin color, this foundation also provides some skin moisture and provides modest sun block capabilities.  We always like multifunction products that perform their primary function well

"I have 2 sunspots on my face that I regularly try to cover, concealer sticks don't work well, they make it a little lighter. I followed the review who said to use this as a concealer and to blend well, well here's the problem, when to try to blend well over a brown spot you're trying to cover up, this thick cream ends up being as useful as the concealer sticks. I tried it with the spatula, with a fine brush and just with my finger tips.

Here's what worked best for me. I took the spatula and put a fairly thick coat on my sun spots and spread the outsides with the spatula, I then used my normal foundation, then I reapplied the cream again with the spatula and used powder to finish.

It did an okay job of covering it up but not as great as everyone that gave it 5 stars made it out to be. It's very hard to work with, very time consuming. If you use too much it cooks cakes, if you don't use enough it's as good as a useless concelear stick.

I figure I spend about $12 for my current concealer stick, this is a good price for the amount you get and the fact that it did work better than my stick, but it still didn't provide full coverage of my sun spots.",4.0
"I gave this product 4 stars only because it is much more dense than I thought it would be.  The color is perfect for me as I have silver hair and a beige tone to my skin.

Where I used this first was on my forearms where I am beginning to get some age spots....as well I should since I AM a certified senior citizen.  Ialso have a Maine Coon Cat that softly nips at my skin to tell me thanks for scratching him under his chin.  Those little bites, however, makes marks sometime on this aged skin.  This cream did cover up both the spots and the nips.  I used my fingertips and just patted where they were and after a few moments I rubbed over the patted spots and smoothed it out on my arm.  It worked quite well.

I have not tried it on my face yet as I wanted to see what it looked like where I needed good coverage the most.  I do think I would have liked a creamier version better but maybe the coverage would not have been as good.  I shall use it tomorrow when I am preparing this old face and
if it covers like it did on my arm I shall try to come back to this review if someone can tell me how to do it.  I shall then raise the stars to the higher level.
I just had more to hide on my arms than my face so I wanted to try there first.",4.0
"Many years ago I learned from a makeup artist that the best way to apply most foundations, and to cover-up one's skin imperfections, it was to apply it in layers. Letting each layers fully air dry before applying the next. I found out that the best way to apply this one is using my fingers, to smooth the cream over my skin. So, following that method I applied three layers of this Dermablend foundation. And while I like the smooth look of my skin, I could still see my freckles. And hiding those it was the main reason I ordered this foundation.

Anyway, this makeup lasts all day, and it feels really silky on my face, and the most important part is that it doesn't look sticky, or grassy. Also, it didn't smear my clothes, which is another thing that is a deal breaker with me when it comes to makeup foundations. Because all of this, I think this it's a good foundation, but it won't hide skin's imperfections.",4.0
"DermaBlend Professional Cover Creme is full coverage foundation.  A little goes a long way with this product.

Blend blend blend, and then set with loose powder.

"I gave this foundation a four-star rating because it seemed a bit thick and dark to me. Having said that I almost never wear make up other than mascara. So my expectations may be impossible to realize considering that I need high SPF as well as good cover-up for occasional film and Skype appearances.  Women who are accustomed to wearing foundation and powder every day very well might find this product relatively sheer.

 I must say that I am grateful for a product that works under heavy lighting and has a number 30 SPF count as well.",4.0
"This full coverage sunscreen has many fine qualities. The color is very nice, though with maybe a hint too much orange for me. It blends beautifully and covers very well. I have a mole on my face that it mostly covered, but it did very well relative to other coverups I've tried.

I used it on my face, one hand and wrist. I was not only impressed by the color and coverage, but by how water resistant it was. I wore it on my face and had to wash it off with a little soap or makeup remover after about six hours. (I tried both. They both worked.) On my hand it lasted just a few hours, but I washed my hands several times and was impressed by how long it did.

There is no smell. It blends well but you can use a drop of water to help it too. It does not make your skin greasy, oily or dry. It has a very natural look and feel.

I love that it's SPF 30. I only wear high-ish SPF skin products anymore.",4.0

Just make sure once you receive your product you check the product inside the box to make sure it matches. Was too late to return the product because I did not check it immediately",4.0
"This foundation offers very heavy coverage. Unfortunately, I got this in too light of a color for my skin, so I can't use it. Also, I was using this to over up some unsightly scars, and one of them is a little bumpy, and I think this foundation made that uneven scar stand out even more. I think if I got this in a color that better matched my skin tone, I'd love it.",4.0
Got the wrong colour but it is a great formula...my sister is now using it and she loves it!,4.0
Bigger than my original tub. Must explain the price. Hope it lasts a year.,4.0
"I used this product years ago and it was the perfect cover for under- eye circles. However, even though I ordered the same color, it was a little to dark but my fault for just not returning. I will say that your face (especially under eyes) needs to be extremely hydrated and/or scrubbed, peeled and moisturized before using this product so it does not cake up.",4.0
I bought a shade too dark,4.0
Probably a good tone for the right person.  Stand by the product though.,4.0
Great shade,4.0
"Works great. Be stingy to avoid a ""cakey"" look though.",4.0
This is a really good product and I was happy to get it a little cheaper than the department store price. It comes in the original box and is the real deal. The most difficult part is choosing the right shade for proper coverage.,4.0
"Dramatic coverage, however it does wear off pretty early in the day, even with the setting powder.",4.0
"It's definitely thick makeup. It's also very sensitive to heat, so you'll need to buy the setting powder because it will melt off. As for coverage, yes it covers EVERYTHING. It's really good, just thick.",4.0
I like it because it has  very good coverage.,4.0
"Little oily, but good coverage.",4.0
Love this product but I needed a shade lighter.,4.0
Works great along with other products. Its a really thick heavy concealer m,4.0
"A little darker than I thought it would be. It also doesn't last as long as I had hoped, but it is a thick concealer that does a decent job covering a new scar I have. If the color was a bit lighter and I didn't need to re-apply during the day, I'd rate it five stars.",4.0
"I bought this color because I had one shade darker and it was a bit too dark and a bit too ruddy in undertone. This was lighter than expected and FAR more yellow. Sigh. Maybe I can mix the two of them together.

Overall, this provides good coverage but can settle into fine lines in the winter if you're not careful. Actually, by the end of the day it would create a crease between my brows no matter what I did. I don't think this product did that in the summer though. Coverage is blendable and very matte, which is nice. It stays put all day and wears well under powder. It can look a little thick at times but what do you expect? This is full coverage makeup. Ideally it's best used for spot coverage if you can blend it out properly and then use a powder to set and blur away any minor differences in shade.

FYI - this stays put better than the body concealer stick. Forget that, just use some of this creme cover and set it with powder.",4.0
love it,4.0
Great product. Did the job.,4.0
I've been looking to cover my birthmark for some time now even though all my life I never have. This was recommended to me for the best coverage since other makeup brands don't even come close to covering my mark. Sadly the color that I purchased was the wrong shade. I plan on visiting a Macys or some other store to get the right color but if this was the right shade it wouldve been perfect coverage.,4.0
this was my mother favourite foundation because of its great coverage! sometimes it's darker than expected so I recommend that you find your shade at a store then buy it here for the next ones.,4.0
"This foundation is great if you're in need of great coverage to hide scarring or marks. However, it does seem to cause my skin to breakout when used for prolonged periods. Even with the use of its powder, I still get really oily though an have to blot my face. It's very thick, almost like a paste and I use a small makeup pad to apply it. Once it warms up on your skin though, it seems to glide easier. I definitely recommend if you need this for coverage but I wouldnt wear this on a daily basis",4.0
"Works pretty good at covering dark spots and redness.  You do have to take some time to get good at applying  I only use it on the spots I need to cover,  then go over my whole face with my regular foundation.  If I use this on my whole face, it looks too heavy and cakey.",4.0
"This stuff is super thick.  You have to warm it up before you use it and then dab dab dab away.  I have PCOS so I am not comfortable showing you what Im using it for, but lets just say my chin looks pretty awesome at the moment.  I used this for my chin and the medium coverage dermablend to blending the rest of my face for an all over foundation.  Feel free to ask questions.  I paid full price and wasn't given squat for this review.",4.0

"I was in love with DermaBlend's Smooth Indulgence Foundation...and then it was discontinued. The Ulta rep recommended this as the next closest option. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and scarring. This product is great because it doesn't break me out and covers everything that I want it to cover. However, it is really thick and heavy so if you're not careful with blending it and slowly building up the coverage, it will look cakey. It also works great as a spot and under eye concealer.",4.0
The product is great! I had to buy a different color to mix to get it as close to my complexion as I could...,4.0
the shade i received was lighter than my complexion. Now i use it on my T-zone to create brightness in that area. you cannot beat coverage with dermablend. it blends and covers like magic.,4.0

"I had to cover up a black eye from an injury, so I tried this.  It was a little too white, and didn't cover perfectly, but did do pretty well, so I used this as a base and then applied some regular makeup on top to give the right color.  I found it hard to guess which color of Dermablend I should buy.  I imagine if I had the right color it would probably work very well.",4.0
"This is a good product, but if you think it will cover completely, don't buy it.  I have horrible under eye circles, so I need to combine this product with other cover products.",4.0
"I really like how easy it is to blend but was disappointed by the shade selection. There are many to choose from but the few undertones offered lower the  selection. I have a pink undertone, freckles, and pale skin so I naturally picked the lightest one, pale ivory. It's undertone/ overall color is orange-pink. I bought this because my face gets flushed easily and I wanted something that could hide that. But instead of hiding it I think it mildly accentuates it because of the orange. I was looking for something that didn't suck the life out of my face while also giving me a somewhat blank canvas to work on. There's a bit too much pigment in this for my taste.

4 stars though because I don't feel like there's anything there and it has a nice dewy finish if you apply a good moisturizer on beforehand. I found that a knock off beauty blender and my recently purchased flat brush works beautifully. I just purchased Veil Cover Cream to see if I get better coverage (Veil has 50% more pigment than other foundations).",4.0
Works well as a cover creme.,4.0
"Long lasting. The color was lighter than expected, but I can blend with another Dermablend product to get the perfect shade.",4.0
"Been using this creme for some years now. This new creme texture is more easier to blend than the old one, but the old creme hold better in place than this new formula. I like this shade it matches my skin tone, it almost cover my dark brown birthmark coin size spot on my face 99% & fortunately this is the only one brand that covers almost my birthmark issue as I've tried so many products on the market available. I'm tired searching for better solution nothing really works only this brand as of now. Going to try the dermablend quick fix concealar also in caramel on top of the creme foundation on my birthmark spot, if this works, it'd be awesome.",4.0
GOOD PRODUCT. COLOR WAS BETTER FOR MY DAUGHTER. SHE LOVES IT.,4.0
more instruction on how to apply would be great. what i need covered up is still visable after application,4.0
I really like this product but the color was too dark.  I will have to get a lighter shade and use this when I get darker in the summer.,4.0
Covers well but hard to figure out what color to get. I am fair skinned but this color is yellowing and still too far. I ordered pale page earlier which was way too fair.,4.0
"I have used this product for a long time and it is a great product specially for someone like me with hyper pigmentation. It is a heavy cream, and it will last the whole day in non-greasy areas of your face like eyes or cheeks when is applied with the setting powder. I have combination skin and  in the summer it tends to melt a little in the greasy areasof the face like in the T-section of the face and you have to clean the area and reapply.",4.0
I need to order a lighter color.,4.0
I have used Dermablend for atleast 20 years.  I inherited a few family age spots and this cream makeup stays on the back of my hands most of day.  I would have given 5 stars except the last two orders have been a little more creamy and less dry.  This might be good if I was using as face makeup but to cover brown spots the dryer version goes on thicker and lasts longer.,4.0
Ok,4.0
takes me two coats plus another foundation coat to cover up my dark spots(beard shadow) but I won;t need to do that much longer as the laser treatments are taking care of that.,4.0
It met my needs very well,4.0

continues to be the desired product,4.0
"I am allergic to everything else, including all other colors, so this is it for me. Pale Ivory. During the summer, it is obviously too light, so I use it extremely sparingly. It is not UV 20,  I always need a separate sun block. It shows up in pictures, so be very careful, It can accentuate eye wrinkles, so again be careful. It gives good coverage, is very smooth to apply, unfortunately it will stick to everything in your surrounding, like your phone, tablet etc. A good idea is to fix it with powder. I use laura mercier as I am not allergic to that powder.. If you have skin allergies, then this foundation is axcellent..",4.0

Thanks,4.0
"I use this to camouflage my vitiligo. It works best for me when blended with another shade, but it gives great coverage, and I've tried most heavy duty coverages out there. This does not look heavy or cake or gather in my pores or creases. Very natural looking.",4.0
"My skin's light ivory but it's neutral, meaning it doesn't have distinct pink or yellow undertones. I had a Dermablend rep color match me in a department store and we ruled out the very lightest shade as too rosy. The warm ivory was better, but when I wear it I can see exactly where I put it on because it's not an exact match. There's just a bit too much yellow/orange and not enough white. If I blend it well into the surrounding area and add the translucent setting powder, that helps and it's as close of a color I can get with this brand.

The coverage is good, but not great. It takes two light coats to completely hide my discoloration. I use the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dermablend-Loose-Setting-Powder-Original-1-Ounce/dp/B0002RI2PG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dermablend Loose Setting Powder Original, 1 Ounce</a>&nbsp;afterwards and that helps it stay on all day without getting on my clothing. It's oil-based, so I remove it with baby oil and a cotton pad.

It does blend very well, stays on well and has better coverage than your average cover-up, but just be sure to order the right shade for the best coverage. If you're not sure or haven't tried this brand before, check out the samples at a department store first because it's hard to tell how it's look on your skin until you try it.",4.0

"This stuff is amazing! I would suggest going in to a retailer and getting set up with the right shade before spending the money for this product, but it really does cover up everything. Be sure to warm it up on the back of your hand first, using the product right out of the jar makes it go on a bit cakey. I should also mention that it did not stand up terribly well to humid weather on oily skin though, I had to either pack on the powder (which felt heavy on my skin), or reapply every 2-3 hours to avoid looking scary.",4.0
Like the coverage and ease of application.,4.0
"I ordered this product to cover a tattoo on my wrist (it is pretty small, but black). You have to be very patient with tattoo cover ups, I learned, and I spent quite a bit of time applying it (I watched some instructional videos online). And it worked! I had an invisible tattoo.

The downside? It rubs off on EVERYTHING. If using, be careful to only wear light colors, and try to avoid any rubbing whatsoever. I used a setter and everything.... but still, it would rub off on making contact with any surface.

I think, for convenience sake, in the future I will just wear a large bracelet or watch. But the products works! If I had a tattoo on my shoulder or in an area that has less rubbing, then I would use it again in a heartbeat.",4.0

"Although i have very good skin, I have a birthmark on my face that I like to cover. I've been using Revlon Colorstay foundation for a decade and like it. Upon recommendation, I tried this and find that it covers better than any other products I've used. It's on the greasy side, so I wouldn't recommend it for oily skin type. It's definitely not a ""light"" make-up, so unless you really need the coverage, I wouldn't recommend it. If you need a good coverage, I can't think of a better coverage than this.",4.0
"It is a heavy make up to blend, but once on it looks great if you have imperfections to hide. It does coverup my spider-veins on my face which I hate!

"i have fair, dry, acne-scarred skin. i use this over a light coverage foundation in the places i most need it so i don't cake up too much product. definitely set with a powder. use this sparingly, though! it's very pigmented but it should look natural as long as it's blended into your skin. since you only need a little bit, this jar will last a long time. i would definitely purchase again.",4.0
this cover crme does amazing tricks...just be sure your color tone is right..tones come in dark!!! Will buy product again,4.0
"I have very heavy scarring on my face due to an illness and have been desperately looking for a good full coverage cover. Dermablend came pretty close to perfect. It is the best coverage I have found. There are a couple of very dark scars that you can slightly see, but it provides great coverage for the most part.  I would recommend this to others. It is also a great value. It may seem expensive but it really takes very little per use and I see this jar lasting a very long time.",4.0

The foundation is think enough to use for cover-up without requiring too much application.  Note though that the best smudge-free result requires a powder application on top of the foundation.  This is also the best way to attain long lasting wear.,4.0
"I like this product.
It works great and the quality is good.  I may need to try a different shade to match my skin tone so that is the unfortunate thing about ordering online.
My only complaint about the product is that you can't use it on any dry areas as it amplifies the flaky skin to a point of embarrassment. On dry areas I preferred to use my lancome concealer.",4.0

I bought dermablend cover creme to cover my acne scars & dark under eye circles. This product is hard to use but can do a great job once you figure out how to apply it. You have to make sure that your skin is fully hydrated & you need to warm it up so that it goes on smoothly. I am using a Mary Kay primer before I apply this makeup & it seems to help. I purchased the colorless setting powder but I wish I would have bought one with some color to it instead. Matching your color is very difficult when using the website so I would advise everyone to go to a nearby Macy's or Ulta to find the proper match. Good luck!,4.0
"I really like the coverage with the Dermablend cover creme. However, I do find that even with the setting powder, it rubs off on my clothes and it doesn't last as long as it's supposed to. It's still a great product.",4.0

"I'm from Argentina and I order this Dermablend to my husband who travelled to Usa. I'm very happy because in my country this product doesn't exist, although the color I chose was a bit dark for my skin (I chose natural beige, I've got dark brown hair and very white skin, I thought ivory would be too light, but it would have been ok). I'll have to wait until I get a bit tanned in summer for the colour to be perfect.

This one is excellent for scars, spots and pimples. However, if you are planing to buy it for rings under the eyes, it is too heavy. For those I recommend to buy ""Dermablend Quick stick"" which covers great but is smoother.
Good Luck =)",4.0

This mask is ok. Not a miracle product but not bad either. I can't go into much detail bc I don't notice any particular benefits other than just keeping my pores clear and smoothing skin.

"I have used this product for over ten years. This seems to be the same product. I have seen comments that this may be outdated product, but I haven't had any issues.  This base covers well and lasts all day.",4.0
I like this...it is light but covers well.,4.0
So far I like it :).  It blends well with the skin,4.0
I like the powder but wish it was a shade darker since it seems super light when I put it on.,4.0
"Excellent product, easy to apply and good for your skin.  The company is amazing.",4.0
"Very happy with this purchase - a little darker than I expected for my skin tone, but perfect for summer and a tan. All day coverage and easy to apply, also doesn't irritate my skin or clog my pores like other mineral powders I've tried in the past.",4.0
Great product.,4.0
Nice but don't last long have to do  touchups,4.0
STAINED MY BATHTUB FROM LOOSE POWDER FLOATING IN THE AIR.,4.0
"One of the best powders out there.  This powder fits light ivory to light beige skin tones.  It doesn't cake on, but I notice in Texas weather and humidity it needs to be reapplied at least once at the end of the day.  The powder is light and feels good on the skin, it blends and covers very well.  I have combination skin and it doesn't cause me to break out at all.",4.0
"This is a great mineral powder that provides light coverage.  The downside, it is pricey and I feel as though I waste half of the foundation when I ""tap"" my powder brush as you are supposed to do when applying.  Also, you do need to ensure you have the proper technique for application or it can ""cake"" in areas.  Overall, I am happy with this purchase and plan to continue to use.  I have light skin, blue yes, medium brown hair, and wear the light beige.",4.0
"i bought it for my friend, and she said it is good",4.0
"This mineral powder base is wonderful for someone with dry skin.  It really covers nicely without looking cakey. I leaves a silky sheen as if the face glows. However, I can not give it five stars, because it does not work for women with combo or oily skin.  Even on a dry winter day, with my T-zones get oily and this powder then causes break-outs. All in all, Jane Iredale's products are luxurious but for oily or combination skin tones, I would recommend Lauren Hutton's Aqua Elements.",4.0
Love this product. Just wish it wasn't so expensive!,4.0
"I love jane iredale powder base so I wanted to try a darker color for summer, Suntan is a great bronzer for a fair skin person like me.",4.0
"Natural looking, yet covers well. Neutralizes redness. Felt comfortable on my face.",4.0
It works really well. Great coverage.  Lasts a long time even using it every day. I will continue to buy this product.,4.0
I took a chance on this powder/makeup and ended up very pleased.  The shade was just right and the coverage is good.  I would definitely get this again.,4.0
I love the PCA products.  I use this after the gentle cleanser.  A moisturizer is helpful after using this product,4.0
"I have used the Jane Iredale powder since my dermatologist recommended it and have always been very happy with it.  It covers redness, is light enough the it doesn't look ""fake"" and lasts through the day.  the coverage is great without the heaviness of other mineral powders...and no breakouts.  the SPF is an added bonus.",4.0
i don't love it as much as all my other PCA products but it does give you a mild exfoliation and smooth feeling skin after so ill keep trying it! i wish it would lather a little more though :-),4.0
"I like exfoliating my skin.  I use Gentle Exfoliant every evening and my skin feels so smooth.  I ""THINK"" it scrubs away the sticky dead skin cell build-up that makes skin look rough.",4.0
This is the first lipstick that I don't chew off because it does not dry my lips out.,4.0
would like it to last longer but I love the color...  I get so many compliments,4.0
"I would recommend this product. It does what it is supposed to do. However, I would say that you should follow it with a really good moisturizer as it can be very drying.  Also the name is a bit of a misnomer. I don't know how gentle it is. The beads are a bit rough. So be gentle when rubbing it on the skin and a little really does go a long way.  Also, I don't recommend using this product on a daily basis, perhaps every other day.",4.0
1 st time I used an exfoliant.  Works good.  Leaves the face feeling fresh and clean. Price is ok too.,4.0
"Disclaimer: I've only used it once.

I am a self-proclaimed PCA addict (in the best way).  My medicine cupboard resembles an aesthetician's tray.  PCA, exfoliating wash (in this review), toner, multiple serums, hydrators, eye cream, sun screens and lip serum.

I did enjoy the gentle exfoliation but I'm not yet ""in love"" with this product as I am with some of my other PCA products.  For the amount (7 oz) and relative price, I am happy with my purchase and will continue use and update my review after using it longer.

Update: I have been using it 2x a day and am happy with it so far.  It exfoliates and is creamy in texture.  This product does require a fair amount of rinsing after cleansing because the tiny exfoliating beads tend to take longer to wash off.",4.0
It worked good. I used it as a spot cream and it still dried out the skin around the blemish.,4.0
"After awhile, seems every product just becomes accustomed to my skin and stops working. No longer use this for that reason, but I used it for four years without fail. Light cream that absorbs quickly into the skin. I always used the Acne Gel until a PCA rep said most clients see much better results with this even with oily/acne prone skin like mine and she was right.",4.0
Works but pricey.,4.0
My girlfriend uses this for her acne. I think it's effective because the results are visible on her.,4.0
"I bought this 3 days ago and it's amazing! I noticed a big change from the first day to today, most of my acne is flattening out and the marks are slowly going away.
If you have sensitive skin like me, expect a little redness and itchiness to the spots you put the cream on, but after a day or two, it's all gone and no bother! This cream really works!",4.0
"Used it about three times. Had a slight burning and itchy reaction when first applied to acne areas on face. Use VERY little at
first. Seems to help a bit. Will work with it.",4.0
"This product works, there was a definite reduction in my acne. It's light on the skin.",4.0
"The product works.  I am glad to find a product that actually works on acne. It's easy to apply, too!!",4.0
"Good product, but I would not recommend it those with sensitive skin.  It is a very strong product and could cause rash.",4.0
It did help reduce acnes over time and eventually remove it. But I think for the size of the product it's a little overpriced.,4.0
Expensive for quantity of product.  Purchased for my 13 year old daughter who noticed improvement of her acne.  Note that volume of product is very small.,4.0
This has worked well with my complicated skin. I am 34 and in the last few years have experienced really terrible bouts of acne for which I have tried many many products. This with the PCA ance gel has been amazing. I also use a tumeric mask--look it up--works great!!,4.0
This has worked very well for my acne without over drying my skin. It is a really excellent product. My skin is complicated so it takes a really complicated product to do the job.,4.0
"My face has lately been breaking out worse than ever, and I knew I needed to try something else besides my daily face wash. I ended up buying this and giving it a chance. Surprisingly, it's healing all of my acne.

Little bumps aren't really going away, but the few that were close to or were white heads are gone. On top of that, one scab is healing quicker than it should've. This is definitely helping and I'll keep using it.

But just be aware of something - .5oz is a darn small jar. It came in a huge box for the size (about 6 inches by 8 by 4) and in another box that was the packaging for the actual jar. The jar itself is barely an inch tall. Don't be surprised. It works well for the money but it was definitely a shocker.",4.0
"Very fast shipping it actually beat others i ordered a day before this one. Everything's legit, came in a box all sealed with the expiration date on the bottom.. ill update in 2 weeks when it will hopefully have gotten rid of my acne :)",4.0
This was my first time using the PCA skin pHaze 33 and I loved it. It worked great to help clear up acne and prevent any flare ups that would have came. Can be a little drying but a little moisturizer goes a long way. This definitely lasted way longer than I thought it would. I will buy again when I run out.,4.0
"This pHaze product is really amazing- zaps blemishes in one or two days without being too overdrying (especially when combined with a moisturizing toner).

Only downside is that the peroxide in the product tends to bleach anything and everything that comes into contact with your treated skin- so beware when using and buy some white face towels!",4.0
"The product was a good price and shipped very quickly.  I like the product, but should have gotten a shade lighter.",4.0
goes on best with a mineral foundation primer. looks natural,4.0
i like this producthave purchased it more than once.,4.0
I have medium skin color and a golden undertone - I love this product but wish I woudl have purchased a shade lighter...,4.0
"I've been using Glo pressed for many years now. I have always have acne and now adult acne due to adrenal fatigue (insomnia and hormonal imbalanced). Glo pressed doesn't break me out eventhough it has Tocopherol. They did not state Tocopherol Acetate (which is safe for acne prone). I even use this to the gym. The only problem is finding the true colors. Yes they have so many, but the colors still off. I have Honey Light (Jessica Alba skin, on me I look beige with a hint of pink), Honey Medium (it's tan, but not dark, yellow/olive undertone), Golden Dark (recent purchase, suit for NC 30 skin, yellow undertone), Golden Medium (past purchased, it's light, perfect for NC 20 or NC25, chinese/japanese/korean/caucasian skin).

Don't use Bare Minerals if you have acne!!!! I still find Glo Minerals pressed the best mineral out there, compared to Youngblood (so sheer), Illuminaire (too thick/sticky and beige color, not really for asian yellow skin). The Glo loose not for acne skin, it's more for dry skin).",4.0
Great quality pressed powder but a little pricey in my opinion. I'm currently using Covergirl Ready Set Go Gorgeous pressed powder & I love it (Only $6.99@ Drugstore),4.0
"Jane iredale is the best makeup for skin, it stays on and doesn't initiate breakouts. I accidentally bought this but wasn't disappointed. The only complaint is the glitter in the powder. If you don't like the glitter go with the rose blush!",4.0
"First things first, Order 2 shades darker than what you think you need if you haven't already been color matched with this product. The powder compact is much large than standard drug store compacts, that's a plus. It goes on smoothly and lasts a long time. I don't have to constantly re-apply the powder like I do with drug store brands. It lasts all day without getting oily, fading, or getting wiped off easily. Do I think it's worth $35? not quite. I can easily pay $20 for this and not feel bad but I don't think it's worth $35 per compact that may lasts a little over a month if used daily. Good product just overpriced in my opinion.",4.0
"The packaging was different then I had previously obtained else where, I like it however, it just seems different, does not seem to last all day, slightly different texture.",4.0
I was very happy with the promptness with which I received this item and this product appears to be fresh and easy to apply.  Time will tell as to whether or not a 70 year old woman can look 60!!,4.0
I really like the Pca line and notice the difference within days of using their serums specially with the size of my pores. The only problem is that you have to continue using them and it can get expensive (even though a little goes a long way the serums usually last me months). As soon as I stop using the serums my acne comes back my pores look larger etc...but they work and they work great while you use them specially when you combine them with some of their other products.,4.0
feels good on my skins but don't see any miracle result.....,4.0
Received in good condition. Thanks.,4.0
Smells great I just don't see a difference in my skin yet,4.0

"I love glo minerals moist hydration mist. I've used it for years. This last ordered they changed the sprayer and it doesn't ""most"" as well, while it still works to hydrate the mineral makeup it's almost too much spray.",4.0
"Does a good job of fixing/setting your makeup but yes the sprayer is not consistent. Sometimes it shoots you in the face with a stream instead of a mist.
And I found I have to cover my lips before spraying, it dries them out and gives them a burning sensation 20 min later. You can't have mascara on when spraying, it makes it smear and leave eyelash marks on your brow bone. It can also make your face kind of itchy if you sweat a lot underneath it.",4.0
Product is awesome. Used it for years...however somewhere along the line the sprayer changed so its less a mist and more a firehose. I found an old sprayer and have to pour it from the new ones to the old one (which sprays a fine mist). Pls fix that!!!,4.0
"I started buying Glo Minerals Moist Hydration Mist from a local spa along with their Glo Minerals pressed powder base.  I find the mist is really wonderful for several different types of uses.

- Misting face after applying powdered mineral makeup to keep it from looking too heavy (gives a dewier, softer look)

- Lightly mist face prior to applying powdered base to give the powder something to cling to (allow to dry slightly first)

- On makeup-less days, I'll often give my face a spritz once or twice a day to replace moisture, vitamins, and minerals

- I give a light spritz before applying moisturizer to trap moisture in (better than just water)

For the most part, the sprayer dispenses as a fine mist.  Occasionally I've received a less cooperative bottle that includes a few droplets along with the mist.  It helps to hold it far enough from your face that you only get the mist; especially if applying after makeup application so that it doesn't ruin the look.",4.0
"I like this spray.  When some mineral make up gets too thick and feels drying this spray helps to make it look more natural.  It is suppose to make the make up last longer, I am not sure if it is the spray of the makeup itself that last long.  This is a nice spray on its own to refresh your face when it is feeling dry.",4.0
"I am not a make up wearer, but wanted this for special occasion, I like Iredale products, and this did not disappoint. I would buy again. I also bought the lash conditioner to put on b4, , it worked as well.",4.0
"Works great. One battery will work for several heat ups. Gets warm enough to curl, but not hot enough that it will burn you.",4.0
"I have very sensitive skin so I am unable to use ""regular"" eyelash curlers as often as I'd like. This curler is great for my needs. It does take longer to curl lashes with this than a non-heated curler but that is to be expected. It is very easy to use and warms up in a few seconds. I don't have to recurl my lashes once I put my mascara on.

Highly recommend!",4.0
Was actually really impressed with this product. Heats well and curls lashes very well. Definitely glad I purchased this.,4.0
 It! :-),4.0
"Took a little bit of patience to wait for the heat indicator to let me know the curler was ready for use, but overall, works great!",4.0
"Best to use after primer and/or after mascara.  When you first use it, you need to practice the angle at which you hold it.  Once you get the knack - it works really well.  Better than a regular lash curler and it doesn't pinch or snag lashes.  But battery needs replacement often. And - it doesn't work as well if you use it after applying the original B
Blinc mascara - works better if you use it after primer or after Blinc amplified or another brand of mascara.",4.0
It worked as advertised & was reasonably priced. It arrived as expected and in good shape.  I will buy more & give them away as gifts.,4.0
After receiving a defective product by no fault of the sender. I informed them of the problem and was sent a return label with envelope. I received a replacement product and it works well. They were very helpful with this issue. There was a quick response as well as quick delivery of the replacement product. Thank You so much for a fabulous product and courteous customer service!,4.0
"I use this upside down for uncurling my lashes. My lashes are long and curl so far that the tips touch my eyelids! I've been using the regular clamps kind of curlers for years (also upside down) but this one has been a godsend. I can run it over the my lashes and straighten them. It seems the heat makes them stay straight for longer.
The only probs...the cap slips off constantly and it gets turned on from bumping around in my makeup bag. The battery runs out quickly when this happens. Also, the temperature indicator gave out within a couple months. It doesn't affect how it functions but I can't visually see it change color when it gets hot.",4.0
"I decided on the Blinc heated eyelash curler after reading all the good reviews. It doesn't take long to heat up and the warmth close to my eyelid actually feels good to me, soothing if anything. It really does curl your lashes, too. My only complaint is it takes longer to curl them (and doesn't really work any better) than a good eyelash curler. I don't have a lot of time to get ready in the morning and an extra minute or two is a lot to me for curling eyelashes. I will use it for travel, though, as the cylinder shape fits nicely in my makeup bag.",4.0
"I love using this eye makeup remover,. does not sting and leaves no oily stuff on my eyes. Don't think it dries up my eyelids.",4.0
Seems to work just as advertised.  I like it and would recommend it.  Read about it in a news article.,4.0
"Got a sample of this at Sephora.  Dawn dishwashing liquid removes oil from skin as well as dishes, so my hands had become very dry and rough. The tips of my fingers were the worse. I could tell a big difference after only one treatment. A little goes a long way. Will buy more when sample runs out. I don't notice any strong smell.",4.0
"Excellent moisturizer... Consistency is more like an ointment than a traditional ""cream"". Slight camphor smell dissipates after a minute. Will purchase again.",4.0
A great moisturizer that diminishes looks of wrinkles without be greasy or clogging pores,4.0
"Bought full size after loving a sample I received years ago.  Formula seems to have changed a bit, is more runny than before but still a great product. Works really nicely on my lips before bed or under makeup.",4.0
Made my hands soft however I only use at night because the smell is so offputting,4.0
good moisturizer for everyday dry skin.,4.0
"very heavy moisturizer, good for very dry skin such as mine.  I quite like the cooling effect of the mint, reminds me of carmex chapstick",4.0
"This stuff has been super helpful for my chapped lips.  I have sensitive skin, and most wax or petroleum based balms just irritate them further, but this glycerin based one doesn't seem to do that.  I actually decant it into a smaller container, and add a dash of food grade coconut oil to cut down on the camphor smell and make it go on a little more smoothly.",4.0
Japanese skin cara products are usually a winner and no exemption in this case. The design is a bit lame.,4.0
"I first found this cream in a small boutique in Venice Beach Fla.
I use Retin A on my face & sometimes get so dry. This cream is the best for dry, chapped skin! I buy on Amazon every time i run out. It's awesome!",4.0
"I liked it but its not HG. I like that its glycerin based which is different. I don't really like the feel of it on my lips or skin kind of a waxy silicone feel. But it does moisturize well. Overall consensus is that it's way too expensive in America and therefore even though I put I would repurchase, I would only do so for the original price. Oh yes and the smell disappears quickly as stated.",4.0

Does what it says it will..super dry face...smell doesnt bother and fades fast.. don't like the price but it works so I'll continue to purchase,4.0
Works great for very dry hands and cuticles and is a nice size to keep in a purse. It is a very intensive cream. The smell is a bit off-putting...I would have preferred some kind of light natural scent in it.,4.0
Five stars if the tube was larger.,4.0
I wasn't very fond of the smell.,4.0
I got this as a sample from sephora. I decided this was something I would buy again. It has a clean medicinal scent and I think it can do things for hands and difficult spots( never your face) yet to be tested. My son had poison ivy on his elbow and he tried unit . It cleared up 2 days later !!!,4.0
"Although the medicinal smell is strong at first, it wears away quickly.  I live using this on my hands on on dry spots like elbows/heels.  It is great on your cuticles as well.  Yu be has a cult following and now I know why!  I agree that it is a little expensive, but keep in mind that it is very concentrated and you don't need very much.  This is a wonderful cream and I would like to try the body lotion version that they sell as well.",4.0
"My lips have needed some extra care lately and I'm not a fan of waxy lip balms, so I gave the Yu-Be Moisturizing Skin Cream a chance to work some magic on my dry lips.

I put a little bit of the magic yellow cream on my lips at night and wake up to lips that stay soft all day.

The cream goes on with a pretty strong camphor smell.  At first I didn't like it much, but I've become used to it.  I wouldn't say that it dissipates quickly...it takes 5-10 minutes.

Unfortunately for me, my daughter has also discovered Yu-Be and she often steals my tube for her own use.  Her lips get very dry (to the point of cracking), so if she's stealing my Yu-Be Skin Cream it must be really good!

I guess I'll just have to buy another tube...",4.0
"I have very dry skin and this product works well, but it is very expensive for a small amount of product.",4.0
"I bought this because of dry patches on my face. However the cream made me breakout horribly, and I wouldn't recommend it to be used on the face.

However, for anywhere else on the body this cream is a life saver. It sinks into the skin and makes you feel so soft immediately. The first thing you'll notice is the smell. It's the camphor, and it goes away quick. (If you don't know what camphor is, it smells like Vicks Vapo Rub)

Overall this is a wonderful thick moisturizer.",4.0
I like the product  It is moisturizing  It has a menthol aroma which makes it seem like a medicinal product not a beauty product,4.0
"too soon to tell, but I had tried a sample and can't wait to use more...for my rough feet and have my husband try it for his hands",4.0
I have tried so many hand lotions/creams for my dry cracked hands. This one finally does the trick. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because its kind of expensive and the smell isn't very appealing but the smell does disappear within a few minutes. I would highly recommend this product.,4.0
"This is a great cleaner, but I'd suggest getting the Anthony Algae cleanser first.  This glycolic facial cleaner does prep your face for a good shave, but overdries.  It is not suggested for those who have dry skin or acne problems.",4.0
"I've been using Baxters of CA since when they had the old bottles and formulas and it was hard to find. The new formulas are better and this shampoo is good.

Two negatives: it is overpriced and the bottle size seems smaller in volume than the older bottles.

Overall, it is a good selection for men's shampoo.",4.0
"I've been buying this shampoo since the old formulation and bottle decades ago. While normally, I could care less about shampoo, this one ain't bad. No fruity smell, does the trick and overall, I think it's worth buying.",4.0
Hair is minty...I'm not very picky,4.0
"Really like this shampoo, it has the mint/tea tree scent and feel but unlike many other mint shampoos it doesn't make your head feel like you've been dunked into a bucket of Listerine and are on fire! It's very subtle and mild. It is a bit drying as most shampoos with sulfates are so I'd recommend using it with conditioner.",4.0
"It smells nice but I would have liked better foaming action. If you are to pick between the protein shampoo and the body wash for the price, pick the body wash!",4.0
"I like this stuff a lot. The only reason I have given it four stars is due to the price. I'd love to be a repeat customer, but I go through it too fast to spend $20 a bottle on it.

When I bought it I had felt like treating myself and trying something new, so I had also bought the lotion and conditioner from Baxter's. I plan on leaving the same review for those products.",4.0
"I have decently short hair and it takes about two pumps each shampoo. The smell isn't amazing, but it isn't bad either. It's not as minty as you would think. Although, that's completely a personal preference. Doesn't clean or make my hair look any different than the basic dove for men shampoo. Probably won't purchase again for this price. I'll go back to Tea Tree.",4.0
I like it.,4.0
I like it very tingly,4.0
Very good men's shampoo,4.0
"This shampoo smells really great -- like peppermint, which is a nice thing to smell when you're in the shower.",4.0
"I'm a very big fan.  I'm not much of a reviewer, so this must be a good product.  The $15 price tag is well worth it considering the quality of the product.  A little bit goes a long way, so I imagine that this smaller container could easily compete with a bulk shampoo/conditioner product.

Do your hair a favor and use this product.",4.0
"I have very dry brittle thinning hair. I'm in the look out for a shampoo that cleans my hair well but gentle. I'm ok with the quality of the shampoo. Here's the run down.

I admit the first time i used this shampoo I didn't find it anything special. On a scale of 5 I would've given it 2. It was really the bottom of average on my scale. I have decided to use it few times to get a better judgement. Motto mention i wanted to give an accurate vine review. After using it for few days along with my conditioner I found myself improving my first impression.

The pump bottle isn't something I look forward to, so naturally I opted for opening up the cap and squeeze the shampoo out. So can't really comment on the quality of the pump. However i found the minty smell to be less offending and unisex (after all I ordered the shampoo mistakenly thinking its for the ladies). The shampoo is thick and leather up really well. I did have a clean feeling after washing my hair, although it didn't clean like my prescription shampoo but it wasn't harsh like that either. Especially with the conditioner My hair was still soft and manageable. That is something very hard for me to achieve.

Overall i found it to be an ok shampoo. It works well with the conditioner. 3.5 star for the shampoo alone and an additional half star for their excellent conditioner as a pair. Looks like i know what I will be buying my dad for shampoo and conditioner.",4.0
"Ok...so I know this shampoo is geared towards men, but I decided to try it myself anyway. I love the smell of this shampoo, a nice minty smell and makes your scalp tingle a little bit too when applied. I have long fine hair and this shampoo is a little bit on the heavy side for my hair type. It does tend to weight it down. Almost feels like a residue left in my hair even after it is dry. It leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth though. Overall I like this shampoo and think it would be much better for people with shorter hair.",4.0
"I ordered this hoping that it would be a sulfate-free shampoo since I tend to be sensitive to sulfates (I get itchy from them).  It is not, but it does not make me itchier so I used it for a number of days.  The scent is lightly minty, it does not lather up too much and my hair was definitely soft and manageable afterward.  The pump bottle squirts out a small amount of shampoo - you don't risk pouring out way too much shampoo that way!",4.0
"I have been using regenapure, which I like for its lack of sulfides. I don't think I will change. The peppermint scent is a little medicinal, which is enough for me not to come back. Still, my hair is very soft and silky after using this, so if you don't mind the scent, you may like it.
I can't say if it helps with hair fall, because I haven't been using it long enougn.",4.0
"First things first, I would not advise ANYBODY to use this shampoo DAILY. Everybody should make it a habit to skip a wash once every two days. It will help build up the natural oils in your scalp and let it reach the hair shaft. Not to mention, this shampoo tends to dry your hair much more than other shampoos.

The minty scent is also not MILD as advertised. It's rather strong and almost overwhelming, so much so that it has made me want to close my eyes on more than one occasion (as if I was peeling an onion).

The shampoo also doesn't produce much lather, so you will most likely end up finishing it much quicker. I did see some volume, but that took more than two weeks to show. Just remember that a Protein Shampoo will not promote hair growth. It will only help with repairing and mostly strengthening.",4.0
"I find Baxter of California Daily Protein Shampoo to be best when used once or twice a week or when my hair gets really dirty.

It pumps out well and has a minty smell, sort of like other products that have Tea Tree Oil but perhaps more minty. If lathers, cleans and rinses out well, but if you leave it on too long, there's a definite tingling sensation on your scalp. To me, I like this part as it gives you a sense that it's working. Indeed, your hair comes out completely clean - though in my case, perhaps a little too clean. I have dry, brittle hair and although the Baxter of California shampoo helped get it thoroughly clean, it did tend to make my hair even more dry and brittle looking than it usually is, even when I use a good conditioner after shampooing.

Worth a try if your hair gets really dirty, or if you like a strong, deep cleaning shampoo.",4.0
"This shampoo is reminiscent of a Malin + Goetz shampoo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Malin-Goetz-Peppermint-Shampoo/dp/B000VXUTFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">(Malin + Goetz) Peppermint Shampoo</a>), only not as strong.  (Personally, I prefer the stronger mint smell of the Malin + Goetz version, but to each his own.)  Nevertheless, the Baxter shampoo works well.  It doesn't lather up overmuch, but gives my scalp a nice tingle.

Some reviewers, I noticed, slammed this product for containing parabens, which have been linked to cancer (like just about everything else on the planet).  If parabens are a concern of yours, there are alternatives you can seek out, like Burt's Bees products (supposedly).  Caveat emptor.",4.0
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I consider it expensive. However I love this product. It has a slight fresh lemon smell that dissipates quickly. It does its job without making my skin feel oily.,4.0
"Kind of thick, but I think it delivers some results. I have purchased 2 bottles. I wish it made my face feel more alive and moist.",4.0
"It does have a weird smell like others have said. To me, it smells like band-aids. Other than, it does its job, no oily residue.",4.0
I'll have to buy more when I can but I defiantly saw results in less than a week. This is a good product to have for those of us who spend time in the sun and outdoor elements.,4.0
Leaves my skin looking pretty good. Not too shiny and seems to retain a lot of moisture throughout the day. I would recommend it.,4.0
"If you are contemplating Anthony Logistics Oil Free Moisturizer, you need to know a few things:

1.  It is a very good moisturizer.

2.  It will not leave you feeling oily (if you are concerned about this, or are especially sensitive, check out the oil-free version.  My skin does not react differently to either formulation, however)

3.  It is a bit pricey.  In my opinion, it is worth it, though.

I have somewhat combination skin, and the moisturizer works well.  My favorite feature is the fact that is contains SPF 15, so I don't have to worry about additional sunscreen protection, which is important to me, as I have fair skin.

By the way, contrary to instructions, I only apply in the morning, after shave and shower.",4.0
"Great product so far. Honestly been better than the produscts I've gotten from my dermatologists. I use this day and night along with their cleansing pads and their Vitamin C serum. Sometimes ill also use retanoid, chlindamacyn, and BP. My skin has gotten much nicer within a week. I've had major acne and scarring for 13 years and this has been great so far.",4.0
"This soap is really excellent. However, I still get some whiteheads about every other day and trapped oil under my skin in some spots. It has helped lessen the issue from what it was before using this.",4.0
"Good stuff, no slimy feels after use",4.0
Good glycolic cleaner.  It doesn't irritate but gives good cleaning.  Gentle and effective.,4.0
"This is the first glycolic facial cleanser I've tried.  I like the way it makes my face feel squeaky clean.  I dislike the bottle because it's difficult to squeeze.  I've found that if you store the bottle upside down, the cleanser will come out quickly without having to squeeze it.",4.0
"This facial cleanser works well...but you're limited to the amount you can throw out of the bottle into your palm. The bottle is so hard, you can't really squeeze it, so it's difficult to get much product out.

If they switch to a flexible tube or a squeeze able bottle, this would be a 5-star product for sure.",4.0
"The ingredients of this face wash changed from the last time I bought it (probably about 2 or 3 years ago).  It now uses the word ""fragrance"", which typically includes phthlates, so I was a bit concerned; however, the packaging still states that the product is phthalate free...  I've chosen to trust that they would not claim that it is phthalate free if it isn't.  :)

The look and feel also changed slightly.  It used to be a translucent white, but now it's a translucent pearly white.  Also, it's slightly more viscous than it used to be.  Nonetheless, it still seems to work the same as it used to.  I feel clean and refreshed after using it.",4.0
"So far, I like the product. The bottle is very hard plastic.  It is a challenge to squeeze it. Overall, it came as is should have and thank you.",4.0
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this face wash!  Even though it's a mens line, I gave into a recommendation by a lady at Nordstroms with the most perfect skin I have ever seen.  I'm glad I did, I noticed an improvement in my skin almost immediately, the only reason I did not give it the 5th star is because of the packaging.  I wish that they would instead sell it in a more squeezable tube or in a bottle with a pump (I've seen the larger size does come with a pump).  It can be a little challenging to squeeze the product out of this bottle especially with wet hands.  Other than that, the product itself is AMAZING.  Side note: I have rosacea & very sensitive skin, this works fine with it & does not irritate.  I do not have dry skin or I would use their green formula (algae)- my mom uses that one & is happy with it for those with dry skin...",4.0
"This seems to do a good job of helping my skin stay clear.  It does dry my skin out if I use it too much, so I only use it every other day or so.  My complexion seems to have improved since I started using it.",4.0
"Definitely a new formula. The one one was more runny. This one is a little more of a gel, thicker than the orange face scrub by Anthony. This was the main thing I wanted cleared up.

New formula works just as well as the old and is in a completely transparent bottle. Looks like a solid white liquid with streaks of clean shimmery liquid. I find I'm using more and more just because of the gel feeling. I have to shake upside down and squeeze the sides a good amount to get it out. Not too bad, but i love the old stuff :/",4.0
"great product line, little pricey",4.0
This is a great facial cleanser for men with oily skin. My husband has been using it for years. He will not use any other facial wash. He also uses the Anthony brand moisturizer for oily skin.  Once he began using the Anthony products there was a noticeable decrease in the shininess of his face.,4.0
I've used this product for a few years now - and it's great but they changed the container it comes it to some cheap plastic thing that gets crushed when you use it.... .a bit disappointing - but the product itself is great.,4.0
"I love the natural scent of this product and the way it works. I am not sure it is exactly as advertised about helping prevent in-grown hairs on the neckline and it may not prevent pimples or blackheads from appearing. However, it is a great cleanser and I really like the added lotion. I finally found a cleanser that is refreshing and smells fresh and natural. I will say, though, it is hard to get away from the perception of no suds...I sometimes feel as though I didn't apply enough to my face because of it.

All-in-all, I am very pleased and have been purchasing again and again for over 2 years.",4.0
I wouldn't say this stuff will clear up a face but it can be used everyday to keep your face looking good without drying it out. Not a real acne cleanser or anything. I like it for a daily cleanser,4.0
"Good deal compared to Sephora. Saved me a good $10, although I do appreciate the assistance and enthusiasm of the Sephora staff",4.0
"This is a great basic cleanser, but I have found that a good scrub is also needed before shaving. This won't dry your skin out and won't leave your face feeling squeaky. Pair it with a good scrub and moisturizer and you'll be set.",4.0
"Anthony Glycolic face was is great for smoothing skins, getting rid of blackheads and acne and has a very pleasant light citrus scent.  The product will mildly dry out your skin and you will need to use a serum and/or moisturizer.  I normally do not like Anthony because they usually contain a lot of chemicals and I normally gravitate towards Jack Black, however, this product is free of most harmful chemicals and additives and simply works.",4.0
"This is one of the better facial cleansers I have tried. It didn't leave my face dry and peeling, and the citrus scent is great. If feels oily on your skin, but this doesn't last after you wash it off. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the texture. Other than that, it's great!",4.0
"The glycolic facial cleanser does what it says in leaving a squeaky clean face. Most notably, I noticed shaving after washing my face with this cleanser felt smoother, less irritating and the hairs were softer.

I've been using the cleanser for over a year and the two reasons for not giving it 5 stars are:
1. There does not seem to be an appreciable lather. While this does not affect it's effectiveness, it takes some getting used to if you're accustomed to rich lathering cleansers or heavy shave creams.
2. I've found the cleanser changes texture over the course of using a bottle unless you remember to gently shake before each use.

Overall, I highly recommend this cleanser. I continue to use it and I'm upset when I run out and haven't remembered to order a new bottle before the old one runs out.",4.0
"Been using this product for a few years, it is a little flaky first day but makes my hair looks just the way I want it, perfect wavy curls, starting from day two after wash.",4.0
Works great on super curly hair!! Very soft.,4.0
work as expected.,4.0
"I have lots of fine hair, a mixture of waves and curls, and live in South Florida. This gel gives good hold and consistent pattern throughout. The first time I used way too much (probably about 5 quarter-sized puddles) and it gave me white flakes, so while my hair seems to soak up most other products, I really can't use that much of this. I went through a bottle of Ouidad's Climate Control and it never gave me as good results as this gel. I gave it 4 stars because I'm not a fan of the smell (cloves) and wish it smelled like the Climate Control.",4.0
This works great with my curly hair!  I have used many products and this works great!  Will buy in the future.,4.0
Definitely NOT for thinning curly hair. adds terrific shine /gloss to hair though. Would be best for non-frizzy hair also.,4.0
Still on the hunt for the perfect gel but this one is great.  Nice hold and it smells like cloves.,4.0
I like it because It keeps the hair soft and not stiff.,4.0
"I really, really like this styling mist. It works well to set my 2c/3a curls. It's my finishing spray after scrunching.",4.0
I like this product for what it does...definitely more hold than some other Ouidad curl products.  It has a unique scent which isn't enough to make me not use or like it but it was unexpected.,4.0
"This stuff is pretty good. I'm not huge on hairspray, but sometimes we all need a little something to keep our styles in place. Which is exactly what this product did.

It wasn't overly stiff, and it didn't flake or dry out my hair. Oh, and I actually liked the scent, which was a pleasant surprise!",4.0
"It has greatly reduced the amount of oil build up in my hair.  I would purchase it again, next time might get the conditioner along with it.",4.0
"Like another reviewer I've been suffering from what must certainly be the hardest water in the nation at my dorm. Coming from the deep south where our water is soft and cuddly, my hair revolted and was a nasty MESS my whole first year. I seriously had to wear it up every day because of the huge spot of nasty on the back of my head. It wasn't visibly gross but definitely disgusting feeling to me. I looked around for a solution and found this product.

The first couple days I used it, my hair was noticeably less built up with water junk... but greeeaaasy. Man. This could be because I have straight hair; I didn't see any obvious notes about not buying this for straight hair but I don't know.

However! The problem was solved by simply using my regular shampoo (drama clean herbal essences), rinsing that out and then just working about a teaspoon amount into the back of my hair where the biggest buildup problem was and just following product instructions. Now my hair is not completely as great as when I'm home but it is IMMENSELY better than how it was.

This product definitely works as advertised for removing hard water buildup, but you may need to work out your own regimen to get the most out of it.",4.0
Love this,4.0
Good stuff. Keeps my hair more hydrated than store bought products.,4.0
This product is mostly great. I don't believe it's anything too special though. Also sometimes I feel like it doesn't clean everything so I have to shampoo twice in the shower.,4.0
Works well with the conditioner and curling gel.  Received product promptly.,4.0
"Good moisturizing shampoo that smells good, too, for curly hair, but nothing beats Pureology!",4.0

Good conditioner. A small blob goes a long way.,4.0
"It's ok, nothing miraculous",4.0
as a curly girl i am always looking for a better conditioner.  I got this as a sample from somewhere and loved how it leaves my hair.  I am slowly moving towards more items in the Ouidad line.  I would give it 5 stars but it is quite costly as compared to even other salon brand products.  BUt i really love it and am paying the extra for it,4.0
"This tight curl version does exactly that. Using this on fine, wavy (color-treated) hair, mid-back length, creates tight accordion pleats.",4.0
Great product for very curly hair.  I bought this before and will buy again...fast delivery!,4.0
"This is a little too rich for my hair.  I have course hair and live in Denver where it is extremely dry, I felt like it left a residue.  This being said, when you use your hot iron, your feel has a lot of forgiveness because it seems to protect against extreme temperature.  As a stand alone not so good, but if you're going to be abusing you hair than I'd say a definite must.",4.0
I love the no-residue feeling along with how smooth and calming it is for my curls. It doesn't weight too heavy. Totally sold.,4.0
"I used this before, it has good effect on holding the special Toppik made hair fiber.  The only thing is it's like selling medicines at pharmacy store, moderately high price at above $30 for just a small bottle of spray.  Would be a good thing if this can be sold as ordinary merchant products on the shelf of many supermarkets so price can be more competitive.",4.0
"I wish it came unscented, it definitely works to hold fibers and just for styling in general but, the smell makes me nauseated. It smells like hairspray from the 80s and it doesn't fade. I gifted to another family member who likes the smell.",4.0
This helps a teen that suffers alopecia to cover a recurring thin spot.,4.0

Covers spots where my hair is thinning.  Good product.,4.0

"It works, but so does my can of scentless hairspray. This has a somewhat strong smell. It's not bad, but I think it smells feminine and, well...I'm a guy.",4.0
I thought it was average for the price and really no better than any other hairspray I have been using,4.0
Ok.,4.0
good,4.0
"bought this spray to go with the powder as recommended. Not sure I really needed it but they claimed that it worked much better than using regular hair spray. Much lighter. I have to say I did try this and regular spray and it is true, it definately makes the powder look ,more natural.",4.0
"My husband has used it for several years and really likes it. Don't get caught in the rain, though! ;)",4.0
Works for temporary coverage and that's what I wanted. Can be a little messy on hands but its worth it to me,4.0
it keeps it in place but does rub off if you lay your head.,4.0
Works well for me and my fine hair.,4.0
It works.,4.0
Amazingly good product. It holds up the Toppik powder well and very gentle to your scalp and hair. It keeps hair supple and less oily.,4.0
The spray works as promised. MUST use to keep fibers in place.,4.0

It does me great justice.,4.0
works well,4.0
"Does the job filling in those thin spots.  But unless you want to spend a small fortune no one mistake you for a hair model,  beware this stuff is messy, goes everywhere, though mostly on your head.  The puff applicator helps but it's slow and not as effective as shaking.  Of course I'm speaking about the hair, this is the spray which does the job but gives you helmet head quickly if not careful.",4.0
"holds toppik fiber in place pretty good, not for rain or water though",4.0
works fine,4.0
it workes,4.0
"Bought to use with Toppik hair fibers. Smells great, holds great, and no fibers come off even in a rainstorm.",4.0
"I decided to invest the $ in the product line, and found it better than regular hair spray.  With carful, thorough spraying, it'll stay on your head and act as a fixitive .My hair dresser noticed a difference with the spray.  Usually it becomes a little powder cloud with brushing.  But she found no cloud after she brushed my hair.  Said she could feel a small amount of resistence as she brushed,.  So, if you want another layer of secruity, try this or hair spray.",4.0
I think it keep my hair in place & keeps the Toppik power in place. It also holds up to bad weather days.,4.0
"It does its job of holding the fibers of toppik. However, it has a smell which I did not quite like. However, you almost have to use it if you are using toppik.",4.0
It works fine but you don't have to buy this expensive spray to hold the Toppik hair building fibers.  I got a cheaper one from tWalmart and it works fine.,4.0
"This product is great for the fiber fill in for hair, I would recommend this to all people wanting something to hold your hair in place. RDG",4.0
Love it great product ...it gives just the right amount of hold u want ..doesnt make hair stiff..it holds the fiber really well .Just make sure not to mess up ur hair after the application.,4.0
"I got the spray with the toppik fibers.  Definitely do not overspray, because then the fibers will clump and you'll have to start over.  Just a few squirts seems to do the trick.  This spray will not prevent the fibers from washing out, if you shower, even if you don't rub or use shampoo.  The fibers are not really recommended for sports, but simply for show when you're going to work, school or other activities, where you don't sweat a lot, or get wet.",4.0
A very good product - excellent hold yet leaves the hair soft and easy to manage.,4.0
"This product dried out my face and did NOT make my skin look radiant - and I have somewhat oily skin.  However, since it was expensive I didn't want to just dump it so I started using it on my decolletage, which has significantly more sun damage than my face.  I do think that this cleanser, in combination with the Neova retinol, is helping to minimize the deep lines on my chest.  Not sure whether I'll buy more when this bottle is done though.",4.0
"This stuff is great on the face, but will dry out your neck so moisturize it faithfully",4.0
"I purchased this cleanser because I use other neova products.  It does a good job cleaning my face, but is a bit drying.  A little goes along way.  This 8oz. bottle will last a long time.",4.0
"This is the best skin cleanser on the market. It is gentle on your skin, does not sting your eyes,and cleans well. It leaves your skin with a nice finish. I highly recommend this product.",4.0
I love this product.  It leaves my face feeling clean and radiant without irritating sensitive skin.  Not too pricey.  Seems to tighten pores a little.,4.0
Love the product...I usually purchase from Ulta but they haven't been carrying this lately,4.0
"This is the second time I've purchased this product.  This rarely happens with makeup.  However, it is so convenient and works so well that I couldn't resist.  I apply with my fingers or with a brush, over foundation or directly on my cheeks.  Looks really natural, stays on all day.  Also the case is great- it never breaks and the mirror is handy.  This color in particular is very nice (I have a natural beige tone of skin).  My last one of these lasted almost a year!",4.0
"I really loved the old formulation of this foundation, but it has changed.  The new version is thicker, like it has more air in it, but also like it's made of slightly more viscous material.  I've posted a picture of the two foundations on my brush, the new formulation on the left.  You can see how much more volume it has, while the old foundation is more liquid.  It still leaves my skin with a nice illuminated quality.  I find the mica particles perform as promised, giving a radiance without a distracting shimmer.  I liked before though that it was thin and I could gradually build coverage where needed.  I now have to be a little more careful and use less if I don't want to look too caked on.  It still provides great coverage and radiance with a light touch, but I preferred it before.
As for color, I'm pale skinned with olive undertones and the 10 watt matches up very well for me.  I'm not the palest person either (although definitely still pale), so if you're trying to decide between the 10 and 20, I'd suggest trying the 10.",4.0
"Great to build on, I wish it was a hair bit thicker for a more blend able product but overall ok. I like i5, not as much as benefits liquid foundation",4.0
I love the finish on the foundation.  I would have given it a 5 star but it has too many chemicals in it; I will I could find something like this that is organic.,4.0
Color is to light for me . Only reason I gave 4 stars .,4.0
"Nice enough,  the price point is a bit high..  The duality is great.  must reapply often for lips..  but I still like it..  probably ordering another..",4.0
"This is my favorite blush and I've been wearing it for years. But the compact cover always breaks at the hinge. You can still get the 2 pieces to snap together, but it drives me nuts. Nevertheless I keep buying it because it looks way more natural than powder blush and it doesn't wear off all day. I put on foundation first, then the blush, then set with face powder.",4.0
I like it but wish it was a little darker and that I didn't have to apply more than once during the day.,4.0
"This is a very pretty color for your cheeks, but not so much on the lips, at least for me. Normally go for the brighter shades of lipstick, but thought I'd give this a try. It's easy to apply to both cheeks and lips, but I'd stick to using it as a blush, unless of course you favor pale lipstick.",4.0
Lillium is a wonderful natural color for cheeks - on a light-complexion face.  Goes on smoothly. Gentle to the skin.,4.0
"The color is very pretty, and exactly as expected. However, it applies sheer, and you need to use a lot if you want to make an impact. It also fades over the day and requires re-application if you want to keep the look. I would use this blush if you want a very natural look.

I don't know if I'd buy this again, but I like the consistency and the color. I wouldn't recommend this if you want a concentrated blush.",4.0
"I have very sensitive skin and use Bare Minerals over Cerave cream or lotion.  This cheek cream has not irritated my skin at all and I love the color.  Was afraid it would look too orange but on my skin, it looks natural and provides a nice blush.",4.0
"I am always in search of a perfect foundation. One that is not too thick, one that does not make my skin dry or show any existing dryness. Stila foundations are pretty ""dewy"" and moist which I love. You can buy the matching powder and it helps combat that dewy look later on in the day if it's summertime. Also this foundation doesn't seem to break me out like other brands have in the past. It seems to be skin friendly at least for me!",4.0
Nice blush product!,4.0
I wanted something to keep at the bf's apt that was simple and didn't want to worry about keeping an add'l blush brush at his place. This works wonderfully and I love this color (I have medium-tan skin). It does seem to fade after several hours but not too badly where I feel like I have to reapply. So it doesn't work as well as my other powder blush but it's convenient and serves its purpose.,4.0
I love Stila. It's a nice weight and feels nice on the skin. Runs lighter than recommended shade which is usually the opposite problem I have with their makeup. I just add a bit of a darker color and it blends well. Much better prices on Amazon than department stores or Sephora.,4.0
A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. This blush is very pigmented so beware!,4.0
Very Pretty!!,4.0
"This is such a nice natural pink. It's very easy to blend. i apply with my fingers, then blend with a stippling blush. I find that it lasts about 8-10 hours before I need to apply. It's great for every day use as well.",4.0
"I've been buying Stila Convertible color products for years. They're versatile and some can be used as blush and lipstick. Illium really just works on my cheeks, it is far too light for my lips (red hair, fair skin). Others, like Poppy need to be applied carefully to cheeks or they'll give that ""Baby Jane"" look. Poppy is a better color for lips although it is somewhat drying and doesn't last long in lips. I wouldn't call it a stain, but it does last for a while - just not THAT long. For that reason, I always need at least one or two in my makeup bag. I've struggled to find a color that works well on lips and cheeks.

This can be applied without a mirror unless it's a darker color like poppy, then I'd exercise more caution, although the compact does include one. It's a good all in one item to stash in a small bag for touch ups on a night out.",4.0
"I love this cheek cream, and I have been using it on my cheeks for the last several years. It is very beautiful and youthful, just gives you a natural rosy glow. It does not appear to stay on that long, though. I usually apply it twice or three times a day.",4.0
This is the only makeup I use. It's great if you're like me who just needs something on-the-go. I just put some lip balm on before applying a small amount on my lips... it could be a little drying.,4.0
"Pretty, but too pale",4.0
"I like a cheek cream instead of powder, but it is a little sticky.  I'm using it though",4.0
This is my first crme blush and lip tint.  I'm medium tan and I like the lillium color.  It's not too bright and a little goes a long way.  Since easing into a BB cream and using less makeup this is perfect for the natural look.,4.0
Love the color!  Goes on smooth and lasts!,4.0
"I am a pale, freckled redhead, and this color is great.  Peachy in tone.  Sometimes I have to put on more that I would like to deposit enough color.  This lasts for a long time.  It is a cream, so if you're looking for a powder, this is not for you.",4.0
This blush is great.  It goes on really smoothly even when you don't have time for moisturizer and full make-up underneath.  The color is nice too.,4.0

"My mom loves this fragrance. Buying it from Amazon makes it even better: the price is good, and combined with free super saver shipping nails it.
At first I was not sure which option I should choose.
There is one option with ASIN B000JCDV00 ""3.4 oz"", ""Product Dimensions: 6.5 x 2.5 x 2 inches ; 7 ounces"", which is a little cheaper than the one with ASIN B00021AJ5I ""3.4 oz Eau de Parfum Spray"", ""Product Dimensions: 6 x 5 x 4 inches ; 11.2 ounces"". What is confusing is that the pictures seem to be of the same product, therefore I could not see why there is one option a little more expensive than the other.

I decided to buy the most expensive with ASIN B00021AJ5I ""3.4 oz Eau de Parfum Spray"", ""Product Dimensions: 6 x 5 x 4 inches ; 11.2 ounces"". But the box dimensions are smaller than the description. I assume there is an error in the product information.

I took out one star because of the inaccuracy of the product description.
Details aside, I received a real 3.4 Oz large bottle, exactly what I was expecting. If you plan to buy, check with Amazon what are the real differences between ASIN B000JCDV00 and ASIN B00021AJ5I. Maybe you can save a few dollars and get the same product for less.",4.0

"For the past 22 years, since graduating from college in 1993, ETERNITY for Men has been the one and only fragrance that I have used because, quite simply, I love the way it smells. In addition to this after shave balm, I have also used daily the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Calvin-Klein-ETERNITY-for-Men-Eau-de-Toilette-3-4-fl-oz/dp/B00021AKJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Calvin Klein ETERNITY for Men Eau de Toilette, 3.4 fl. oz.</a>. This balm smells exactly like the eau de toilette, yet it is scented lightly enough so as not to be too overpowering. I particularly like that a little of this product seems to go a long way during use. I prefer to use this balm, rather than other products including [[ASIN:B001KZG4WM Calvin Klein ETERNITY for Men After Shave, 3.4 fl. oz.], because it soothes and moisturizes my particularly sensitive skin instead of irritating it. Further, I have received frequent compliments about the very pleasant and noticeable, yet equally refined, fragrance associated with this balm, while using it.

My major gripe with this product is its very high cost. In terms of it being just an after shave balm, I think the cost has actually become downright exorbitant! As such, I have rarely purchased this balm by itself and instead found it to be MUCH cheaper when buying it as part of an ETERNITY for Men gift set frequently sold throughout the year. Hence, my 4-star rating instead of 5-stars.",4.0

"Great Deal ,  And for those people that say they do not  smell it  ,  You cannot  but Others around you Can  Hours Later  !",4.0
"The product seems just the same as you can get in the stores. I'm not sure why so many of the reviews talk about lower quality products, but I feel that must be some point in time event. I am confident in the quality of this product as of Juen 2015.",4.0
"I thought this scent was pleasant but a bit strong for my tastes.  My son wore some and described the scent as amazing.  So like beauty, the rating for cologne really is in the eyes (or in this case maybe the nose) of the beholder. But since my son thought this was amazing and he is more of a cologne aficionado, it deserved at least 4 stars overall.  Be aware though that the scent is not subtle.  But if you like a strong scent this could be a great choice for you.",4.0
"I am always interested in a new scent, so when I saw this and the fact that it was in a nice travel size, I decided to order it.  Here is what I found:

  1.  Normally, i use Bulgari Pour Homme Soir, so you have a reference point for what I normally use.  For me, Eternity does not have as nice a scent as my regular cologne, but it was not displeasing.  Just a little too much on a floral side for me.

  2.  The scent seems to last about 4 to 5 hours.  That is a bit disappointing as other men's colognes that I have used over the years seemed to last longer.  Oh, just so you know, I asked my wife's opinion if she could still smell the scent since for me, once it is on, I can no longer really tell after about 5 minutes.

All in all, not a bad scent, just not one that I particulary like.",4.0
"Not my favorite, but I do like it and it's the hubby's preference. I guess I'll never understand price of brand colognes. Way too high. In saying that, a little went a long way, this bottle will last a long time. Scent lingers, not overpowering. Hard to review a smell, but kinda woodsy and musky. Good for a gift or stocking stuffer.",4.0
"A nice scent. Not too heavy, but it is a sweet scent (as opposed to a woodsy scent). The odor doesn't last long, but that's mostly because it is ""eau de toilet"" and not cologne (right?). Eau de toilet is a 'thinner"" and less expensive version of cologne.

Some people are complaining that this does not smell like the same version as what they are smelling at the store. I can't comment on that, but I will say that this bottle only lasts about an hour, if that and then the odor is completely gone.",4.0
"I've tried the ""Calvin Klein ETERNITY for Men Eau de Toilette"" and so far the product seems to be okay.  The scent is a mixture of several blends and does appear to be somewhat ""woodsy"" which is okay with me.  My wife seems to like it okay and gives it around an ""8"" out of 10.

Would be good to use whether as an everyday cologne at work (don't apply too much) , going out on a special occasion, or at night.  So far, seems to be okay.",4.0
"Calvin Klein's Eternity for Men will always be a classic. First debuted in 1990, and smelling this is like stepping back in time. I would say it has moderate to long lasting coverage in this eau de toilette spray. I can detect the lavender, mandarin orange and sandlewood.",4.0
"Very warm, woodsy scent. I would find this attractive on a man if not overdone.",4.0
"CK Eternity has an almost sweet flowery clean spring like scent to it.  It's really quite pleasant which surprised me and it doesn't overpower in any way.

Although it's a fragrance for men, the flowery aroma isn't effeminate in any way.  You don't need to put on a lot to smell nice, just a couple of squirts from the bottle and your good (you don't want to be one of those people that seem to bathe in aftershave and drive everyone away).  So even with a small bottle it should last you quite some time.

I don't wear fragrances a lot so am quite choosy when I do wear one and this one I like.

If you're looking for a nice clean refreshing fragrance, I'd recommend giving CK Eternity a try.",4.0
"Eternity is a classic fragrance of the early 1990s, when every male lawyer under the age of 50 working in Manhattan had at least 100ml in his briefcase at all times.  This is a fairly clean smelling scent with subtle spices that strikes me with notes of lemon, lavender, basil, and sandalwood.  Some days it can smell a bit soapy.  Unfortunately for me, it does not last very long on my skin and is more or less gone after a few hours.  Whether that is an issue of body chemistry--fragrances act differently on different people--or of formulation, I don't know.  It is generally subtle, not cloying, and not likely to offend anyone; I have never heard of anyone outright disliking this fragrance.",4.0
I was a little worried after seeing all the reviews that basically said that the product they received wasn't the same one that they had tested in stores. However my concerns were laid to rest when I received my shipment. This Calvin Klein Eternity for Men is a damn fine perfume. I ordered it as as a gift for my father and he absolutely loved it.

A very nice foundation that matched my skin color perfectly (#40). I have combination skin and did not require touch-ups during the day.,4.0
Love this on my cheekbones and around my eyes!,4.0
"Gives great even coverage. I don't wear foundation often, especially liquid unless it's an occasion. This I can use more daily and it lasts! Really great even coverage.",4.0
Bought this as a graduation gift for a friend. CK make good perfumes and this one in particular stays on for a long time.,4.0
"Decent product, although the scent doesn't last particularly long, and I'm also not particularly fond of items that are largely water.  However, after testing this and other similar products on a handful of females, they unanimously preferred this.",4.0
Item arrived on time and smells the same as it does at Macys. No problem with the order and the bf loves it,4.0
"Good classic scent, but I would not describe it as unique in any way. If you are looking for something more memorable this cologne isn't for you.",4.0
This is a breath of fresh air from all the short lasting Axe. My boyfriend wears this and the scent lasts a long time and it smells amazing. Definetly recommended!,4.0
"I kid you not, this stuff smells like B*n's 100 bug spray.  Having said that, I'm now wearing some for the first time since it arrived in the mail yesterday, and once you get past the toxic overnotes, there is a pleasant odor as well.  It has a piquant flighty flavor that dances in and out of the nostrils like Natalie Portman in Black Swan.",4.0

Love these for what we call 'Irish showers' for baby girl - when you don't have time for a bath but need some freshening up. Not heavily scented but are great to wipe down the face and neck if baby has been spitting up or sweaty. Only four stars because they sometimes come out of package in multiples as they are golden in thirds then in half inside pouch. No issues with them drying out or causing irritation on baby skin.,4.0
I love this product but a bit over priced.,4.0
Great cleanser and fresh natural smell. I was only disappointed by the small size for the cost,4.0
Smells really nice,4.0
"I like these but they seem really big for tiny faces, I would prefer the wipes were cut in half so that they'd be half as big but twice as many, these are a little expensive at the current size to use multiple times per day. The package and fold of the wipes makes trying to cut them in half a pain.",4.0
The wipes work well; they do not irritate my daughter's face.  BUT they STINK!!!!!  I usually use them before she goes to bed so that I don't have to smell her skin as it makes me nauseous.,4.0
"My daughter has very sensitive skin and these are great.  They clean her face and hands in between baths, and don't irritate her skin at all.  I really like the scent too.  If you don't like the way other Mustela products smell you won't like these, but if you do then you'll love them.  My only complaint, and the reason they didn't get 5 stars, is the packaging.  The package tends to not stay closed after a few days.  So if you aren't using the wipes regularly they can dry out.",4.0
"In regards to shipping everything came super fast. And what exactly what I ordered. I do notice that I am getting back to my perky self hehe.... but I don't know if it has to do with the fact that I have been going to the gym regularly or because of the cream.

I know that the two combined have proved to have amazing results.",4.0
"This is a really good skin post pregnancy care product. It is a gel, so it is no greassy. Actually I am breastfeeding mom and I was looking for a product like this.
I use it every day after take a bath and my bust look better.",4.0
"I have been using this day and night for a few weeks and its worked in a sense that it has firmed up the skin around my bust area. I use 2 pumps per breast/chest.

I have size D breasts, in my mid 30s and breastfed for 18 months, so I was looking for a product that would help tighten up my chest area a bit.

If you are looking for some miracle cure that will automatically perk up your breasts, this is not it. I highly doubt there is a product out there that can do that, as nature and gravity take their course. However, I have noticed that the skin around my bust area has tightened and is quite supple.

I used AHAVA firming cream in the past, which I loved, but it is on the higher cost side. I find both products to have a similar results.

The smell of this serum is quite pleasing, and I really love that it does not leave any sort of residue after application.

So, in summary, don't expect a miracle serum that will perk up the twins, but do expect it to stay true to its word that it will firm up your skin. I also think the results would be more effective for ladies with smaller size busts.",4.0
"It seems to be a very good product. I am not sure about its effect, if it is really effective to support bust because I am using it onlly for 1 month. But my skin looks hydrated, so I am happy to have bought it.",4.0

"works really really well. doesn't smudge and stays on great. only problem is that it tends to dry up after a while.other than that, it's perfect!",4.0
Will last a long time! Goes on easy with eyeliner brush. Lasts all day without smudging. I do put on urban decay primer first.,4.0
"You def. need the right brush for this product. I suggest Sephora for such a purchase. However, when this item is on it is staying on, it does not smudge when it is dried, even if you sweat....Overall, great purchase and worth the money spent.",4.0
"Ive been using smudge pots for at least a few years & love them, i think its super easiest eyeliner to use thats versatile and looks really good. I love that they last forever too, the only problem is a little goes such a long way that the remaining product dries up after several months (and does NOT apply well once it kind of dries up). So really one smudge pot could last me over a year if the container was able to preserve it longer.",4.0
It is good except the  color is a little bit too dark. I thought i would be somewhat sparkle for I knew the product from youtube makeup tutorial and it looks darker than the one the person what uses in the video. But anyway it is good.,4.0
"I quite like this eyeliner but it dries out so quickly that it becomes unusable WAY before it runs out.

The good: the liner stays put on my oily lids, which until now manage to eat up all but the most waterproof liner. It applies very intense color (the grey is nice and dark), and it is possible to get a very sharp, crisp line as well as a smudge. If it didn't have the drying out problem, it would be an easy 5 stars. It can be challenging to apply, but I find it easier than liquid liners. If you can do liquid liner and have a decent eyeliner brush (I use the MAC angled one), you can use this easily. I wear contacts and it has never bothered me (Although it can, at times, flake off once it is dried out). It removes easily with waterproof eye makeup remover, and a bit less easily with non-oily eye makeup remover.

The bad: it dries out in the pot over time (not that long!) and becomes a hard cake that hurts to apply. It shrinks down and pulls away from the sides of the jar, dipping the brush in water does not do much to help at that point. The first Smudge Pot that I bought was completely dried out when I opened it brand new, thus requiring me to exchange it. The next one was fine at first but significantly dried out after a few months even though I have been careful to close it immediately after dipping the brush in. Based on reading reviews about the drying problem, I didn't even keep it open during application but reopened it every time I needed more product, which is a bit tedious.  Furthermore, it dries out in seconds on the brush as you are applying, requiring you to wash the brush to get rid of the hard, caked-on liner in order to continue with application on the second eye.

When it's new, this is a wonderful liner. But now that it's dried out, I'd have to repurchase. This is a waste of money since most of the liner is unused, and the liner is expensive. I am not sure if I'm willing to spend the money to replace it.",4.0
"Love this eyeliner, color is perfect ( I ordered the bronze ) it's like a REAL brown with some shimmer.  Does not come off all day.....WORKS!",4.0
"Deeply pigmented, which I like, but I was disappointed that it had NO sheen or metallic quality at all. Maybe you would call it ""matte."" TOTALLY, completely matte. Flat. One of my old favorite Cargo shadows is Yukon, a lovely taupe/mushroom which is silky with a soft metallic sheen (not glitter or sparkle); I was expecting Flint to be the grey version. Flint is good for a smoky eye, and nice for business wear, but it would be much prettier, and more silky in its application, if it had a bit of the metallic to it.",4.0
Love the product...I usually purchase from Ulta but they haven't been carrying this lately,4.0
"I really loved the old formulation of this foundation, but it has changed.  The new version is thicker, like it has more air in it, but also like it's made of slightly more viscous material.  I've posted a picture of the two foundations on my brush, the new formulation on the left.  You can see how much more volume it has, while the old foundation is more liquid.  It still leaves my skin with a nice illuminated quality.  I find the mica particles perform as promised, giving a radiance without a distracting shimmer.  I liked before though that it was thin and I could gradually build coverage where needed.  I now have to be a little more careful and use less if I don't want to look too caked on.  It still provides great coverage and radiance with a light touch, but I preferred it before.
As for color, I'm pale skinned with olive undertones and the 10 watt matches up very well for me.  I'm not the palest person either (although definitely still pale), so if you're trying to decide between the 10 and 20, I'd suggest trying the 10.",4.0
"Great to build on, I wish it was a hair bit thicker for a more blend able product but overall ok. I like i5, not as much as benefits liquid foundation",4.0
I love the finish on the foundation.  I would have given it a 5 star but it has too many chemicals in it; I will I could find something like this that is organic.,4.0
"I am always in search of a perfect foundation. One that is not too thick, one that does not make my skin dry or show any existing dryness. Stila foundations are pretty ""dewy"" and moist which I love. You can buy the matching powder and it helps combat that dewy look later on in the day if it's summertime. Also this foundation doesn't seem to break me out like other brands have in the past. It seems to be skin friendly at least for me!",4.0
I love Stila. It's a nice weight and feels nice on the skin. Runs lighter than recommended shade which is usually the opposite problem I have with their makeup. I just add a bit of a darker color and it blends well. Much better prices on Amazon than department stores or Sephora.,4.0
"I love this product, but to be honest, I think it is for those with few skin problems like dryness or constant breakouts.  The coverage is outstanding and it looks flawless when it sets, however, if my face is dry in certain areas or if I'm having a ""bad skin"" day, it can enhance it, which is why I gave it a four.  Be sure to use a light moisturizer prior to use.",4.0
"I really like the light weight feel of this foundation. I can smooth out my skin tone and remove any redness with little foundation. I love that once applied it does not feel like it's caked on there.

Unfortunately, the packaging is quite cheap, especially for the price. The plastic is thin, and I sometimes feel like it could break when I'm unscrewing the lid.",4.0
"My girlfriend has been using this foundation and she likes the consistency and the feeling of it on her face while wearing it. She said it blends in with her skin tone well and feels its moisturizing benefits.

It 's staying powder was adequate wearing through an eight hour work day just fine.

The one problem was that application took longer than with  fluid foundations. Because she isn't used to applying cream foundation. She was happy with the matte finish.

On the whole, aside from application, she has been satisfied with the product.",4.0
"If you're accustomed to creams, lotions, and powders, this interesting microwater foundation formula -- the company calls it ""Water Canvas"" -- will surprise you. It's spongy and springy -- if you can imagine that mermaids have some little sea creature they use to even out their skin tones, this could be it.

Use a brush (synthetic bristles are less likely to leave you with crumbs of foundation and bristles in the product) or a sponge to apply this foundation. Patting and building up layers of coverage will work better than trying to sweep it across your skin, because it is dry rather than creamy. I'd say it requires a bit more time and skill to apply well than other formulations. It gives you a natural look and a powder finish. You won't feel it after application.

The packaging is great. An airtight, lock-tight lid makes it easy to carry and good for travel, though there's no mirror. The company makes a travel compact with mirror and you can use this product as a refill for it.

The product is made with wholesome ingredients. It's hypoallergenic, fragrance free, and cruelty free, and boasts sunscreen, though it seems as though the coverage might be too light to really protect.",4.0
"Rating this foundation has been a bit of a challenge.  I am experienced in using a lot of different makeup foundations, as I am a makeup artist.  One thing that can make all of the difference in the world is to have the correct color.  You can have the nicest texture, but the incorrect color can throw off the way that foundation looks a great deal.

This color (bisque) is not the correct color for me.  I tried it on several people before I found someone that was an okay match so that I could evaluate it more precisely.

WHAT IS THIS FOUNDATION LIKE?

This foundation comes in a flat pan which has a lock cap on it.  Despite the lock cap, it is not as air tight as I would like it to be.  The foundation itself is a cool creamy feeling pan of foundation that has very little odor to it and no added fragrance.  There is good pigmentation.

HOW DO YOU APPLY THIS FOUNDATION?

The best way to apply this foundation after much experimentation is to use a Beauty Blender sponge which is dampened and then bounced onto the face (after moisturizing skin) using the various shaped curves of the blender.  Using a brush does not seem to make the finish go on as smoothly.  Using fingers does not apply the foundation evenly enough.

When using the Beauty Blender (or similar sponge) dampened, this is good for multiple reasons.  It causes the foundation to melt nicely and evenly into the skin, leaving a very natural type finish.  Using the dampened sponge also extends the life of the product which tends to dry out over time, making it more difficult to apply.

HOW DOES THIS FOUNDATION PERFORM?

Although the color was off so much that I found this foundation unflattering, the texture and surface of the foundation is nice.  It does melt into the skin, leaving a very natural finish.  Using with the Vincent Longo Water Canvas Primer does help it to look even a bit nicer, but I also used it with Lorac Aquaprime primer (used under moisturizer), and Swanson Vitamins Hyaluronic Acid serum under moisturizer primer with equally good results.

The foundation stayed on well all day into the night and did not seem to settle into the creases or turn uneven through the day. I did not experience any oxidizing of the foundation (turning orange) either.

Removal was easy with Yes to Blueberries cleansing cloths and did not leave any problems with residue, as well as Yes to Blueberries Cream Cleanser and Clarisonic.

PROS

Natural Finish
Good for mature skin or younger skin
When applied with damp sponge, airbrush finish
No fragrance
Cleans of well
Stays on all day

CONS
Expensive
Inexpensive style container (should be nicer for that money)
Container not as airtight as should be
Not sure if they have the correct color for my skin tone (which is important)
May not work well on some oily skin

All in all this is a nice textured foundation.  When applied with a dampened Beauty Blender, it looks very natural, does not settle into the creases, and does not seem to oxidize.  I am not sure that anyone with oily skin would do well with this, but normal to dry skin would do well with it.  I would recommend a primer with it, but only a water based one.  I particularly liked the Hyaluronic acid serum under moisturizer combination best.

For the price, this foundation should be in a nicer container.  I can see this drying out before you finish the pan of makeup.  I only wish I had been given the correct color to test as it really was unflattering on me.  It is difficult to test a foundation that looks so obvious on the skin.

I have given this four stars due to texture, application, time of wear, and performance for the price.",4.0
"I found this product comparable to the BB cream that I've been using. It is lightweight, and easy to build up in certain areas where you might need a bit of concealment. It's just a bit too lightweight for winter use for me, though it might be perfect for summer usage. It can also be hard to get it open and to make sure it is tightened correctly. No scent that I could detect, and even though I have sensitive and dry skin, it did not make me break out or dry out.",4.0
"I rated Vincent Longo water canvas creme to powder foundation 4 stars because it is a nice foundation. It slides smoothly and looks nice, it has a light coverage. I apply it using Eco tools brush.

I am not impressed with the cheap packaging, even Loreal has nicer, sturdier packaging.

Overall, I'm not sure this tiny product is worth the high price when you could get other brands like Bare minerals or Laura Mercier etc.",4.0
"This is a great foundation that was really lightweight and easily blendable.  It went right into my wife's skin, and she loved the fact that it felt silky.  It combined excellently with the VINCENT LONGO Water Canvas Blush, and came in a small & convenient compact that was easy to throw into my wife's bag.

The line has a lot of colors, but the bisque seems to be one of those colors that could work for a lot of different women.

The only downside to this was that when applied with a foundation brush (as recommended) but without using Vincent Longo Water Canvas primer (recommended for longevity) it evaporated.  My wife is going to try using this with the primer to see if it really does last longer, but without it, by the end of the day it had evaporated to the point where she had no makeup to take off (which could be a bad thing).

It's such a lightweight coverage, it's easy to see this being someone's goto everyday makeup.

Oh, and it's a bit chinsy for this to come without an application sponge and make users order that separately.",4.0
I really like this powder because of its great coverage and it seems to be of really good quality. I only wish it lasted longer... i don't use much when i wear it and its run out pretty quickly. I have fair skin and this color worked well. I am very picky about powders because of their drying effects on skin but once ive applied a light moisturizer i have had no problem with that issue. hope this helps!,4.0
"This is my favorite thing to use for my skin.  Living in AZ I need sun protection AND moisturizer, so this product supplies both, and does both well.  Some say they don't like the smell, I happen to like it. The smell is crisp and fresh, but it dissipates quickly. I now use this alone, with no need for a separate moisturizer and sun block.",4.0
"I'm a fan of a lot of Jack Black facial products. This moisturizer does the job preventing dry skin. I typically have oily skin, but it can dry out in the winter. Putting this on does not feel too heavy or oily, and the SPF is a nice benefit. Applying this every morning during a full week of skiing, my skin never got red, from either sun or wind burn. My girlfriend likes using it too. I've bought it from Sephora for myself, and got one for her and one for my dad as gifts from Amazon.",4.0
"First off, I love this product.  Living in Southern California, I need a moisturizer with SPF and this fits the bill nicely.  My only complaint is that a little doesn't go a long way; in other words it takes two-to-three pumps to have enough to rub all over my mug.  Maybe that's just picking nits.  In any case it kind of smells like light baby powder, which I like, and it works like a charm.  I'm a big fan of Jack Black products and this will likely be in my rotation of moisturizers.",4.0
"This is a great moisturizer/sunblock. my skin tends to form those ""skin flakes"" after shower/shaving and this item takes them away instantly using only a few amounts of this product. it feels light on my skin(it can depend on how much you use per application). you will notice a difference to your face after putting this product on. from dull flaky skin, now a there is little bit of ""shine"" in some parts of the face right after using this product. i do not think this is greasy. i have used other face moisturizer and this one is my favorite(at least for now). its overpriced tho.",4.0
"Lightweight, protective and soothing after shaving. Great pump design. Doesn't make my face grease-out during the summer.

While all the ingredients are plant based (except the sunscreens), I smell a sharp scent of styrofoam or polysterene when first applied. Luckily, it fades quickly. Considering most men's skincare reeks of heavy cologne fragrances, I don't mind it too much. Just kinda weird.

Other than the strange smell, this is a fantastic daily moisturizer.",4.0
"I was super worried when I ordered this that the color would be too pinky for my reddish toned skin but this has a really nice tint to it.  I use Vincent Longo Water Base before application.  I tried three ways to use this:  Once with a foundation brush (which was awkward) and then with a dry sponge, finally with a damp sponge ( I used a face cloth to take most of the water out of it).  The best application was with a lightly damp sponge.  This provides a light coverage and if you are looking for something heavier, this probably won't work for you.  I can see that this will be amazing for summer when I have a bit more oil in my very dry skin.  I did really like how this felt (super light) and how it looked once I got the hang of a good application.  I normally use a liquid foundation so this was a bit of a change for me.",4.0
"I have only applied this foundation using a brush so I cannot speak to other application methods. I have some age spots and red blotches on my face that are most noticeable during the winter months. I liked that this foundation smoothed and evened out my complexion quite nicely. I also liked that it didn't seem to settle in my fine lines, as I predicted. The only downside that was that the nicest aspects (evening out of skin tone, masking redness, etc.) of this foundation didn't seem to last as long as the liquid Cover Girl foundation I usually use in the winter. I found myself applying touchups (with the makeup brush) a couple times per day and then had to lightly reapply my cream blush for some color.

Very nice product and I have recommended its use to friends.",4.0
"So here's the reason for 4 stars on the best foundation I've ever used: the product itself is fabulous, feels so light and unique in it's texture and goes on beautifully, not cakey and blends right in, but...

1. I have to fight to get it open each time (doesn't get easier with time)
2. it doesn't come with an applicator brush or sponge (for the price, I think that's ridiculous)
3. the price is so prohibitive, I don't know how many people can afford to spend this much on a foundation (I can't)

I understand that due to the products moisture qualities that it needs to be stored in an airtight container, but there are lots of airtight containers I open which don't involve a struggle each time.

Fix the container, throw in an applicator and make the price a bit more reasonable, and I would definitely be posting a 5 star review.",4.0
"This is a great foundation, good coverage, long lasting, great finish. It was a little tricky to apply at first, but worth the effort, I tried with my fingers first, then a brush and found it was best for me to use a damp sponge.  I wish a sponge applicator was either included with this compact or that there was a space to add one.  Does not clog pores, provides a flawless, long lasting finish.
I had a difficult time opening this the first time.  My son was able to get it open after a couple tries.  The lid has an airlock seal, which is to keep this fresh and moist, however, if someone has arthritis this would be a real issue.  This compact needs improvement to justify the cost.",4.0
"This makeup feels weird.  If I were rich I might buy it just to poke it with my finger.  It's kind of fun that way.  It reminds me of a cold gel shoe insert- it is VERY different.
It actually is a seaweed based product so it is mostly water with the pigment suspended in it.  This is the most natural looking makeup I've ever worn.
  The color is great.  I used Bisque # 5 on my fair skin.  Usually I would go for an ivory but the bisque is what was offered.  It works great - I suspect it will indeed work well over a variety of skin tones in the light to medium range because it is so very translucent.
  I am aging and have some fine lines when I first wake up, and this does not do a thing for them.  IN fact, it maybe makes them look a bit worse.  I think this product would be better on younger women.  It is non-comeodogenic, and hypoallergenic, fragrance free and - I like this one - CRUELTY FREE.
  It is made in Japan.

  The product comes in a container that looks a bit inexpensive at first glance, but when I consider it carefully, it is a container that is designed to keep the product very moist.  The container locks to a seal and has a pad at the top to help keep the moisture IN the container.

  STUPID ME did not know how to go about using it.  I did not read the ample instructions that came with it.  That's just my style.  So I sat there poking this weird feeling makeup, giggling, until I poked a hole right in the top of it.  I later found out that was a no-no, but other than making it look ugly sitting in the container, the makeup is still working fine.

  I've put this on with my fingers, a Bobbi Brown stippling brush, and a sponge.  Of all the methods I've used, I like putting this particular one on with my fingers best.  Besides the strange poking addiction I have with it, I actually found that using my fingers give me a very, very nice finish with this product.  There's never a line of demarcation - it just blends right in.  I don't need powder either.  It's just very natural, with great coverage that is really amazing considering how little pigment is actually going on your face.  It's very unusual makeup.  It covers REDNESS like a dream!

I developed some shine but only after about 4 hours.  This makeup lasts on me as long as the Vincent Longo blush does - about 14 hours in cold weather.  That's all I've got to test it in, it will be interesting to see how it will do in Georgia's hot, humid summers.

I'm only giving it 4 stars though because it doesn't do much to hide fine lines.  My face is fairly smooth but I do have those lines, and this product seems to settle in to them a bit and does nothing.  It might be better with primer but I did not test this with it, so I can't say.  I did use moisturizer under the product.  If your skin looks smooth and young, this foundation should even up your skin tone and make you look fabulous.  If discoloration and making your tone more even aren't your only concerns, you might want to try something else.",4.0
"Very sheer coverage in this creme to powder foundation from Vincent Longo. I usually use a liquid mineral powder, so this was the exact opposite for me.  The compact seals tightly and fits nicely into the palm of your hand. A faint scent that is not too over powering. I am very translucent and found this to be a good match for my skin in winter. I do need to use a moisturizer underneath as it did cake a bit around my eyes because my skin is so dry this time of year. I'm excited to try it in summer, where I'm sure the sheer coverage will be more welcome!
Edited to add: I used a standard make-up sponge to apply and had no problem.",4.0

"I'm new to expensive ($6+) moisturizers for men, but this seems pretty good.

"My hair did grow very fast while using this product. I used half vial, every 2-3 days. I would repurchase...its a bit pricy, so might request as a next xmas or birthday gift!",4.0
"I am a huge fan of this product (I'll finish off my first box tomorrow and a backup has already been purchased...).  I use one full ampoule every other day.  (I shampoo every day.)

First, the reason I took off a star.  I just don't like the containers and applicator very much.  I do know how to open glass ampoules (I have a PhD in chemistry and did reactions in them during grad school).  Mostly these work, but I did manage to break one at the wrong spot (i.e., not where it is scored) and I'm not sure why that happened.  Just be careful, because if you don't know what you are doing, you could cut yourself.  If in doubt, wear some thick cloth gloves.  The applicator is also bizarre.  You get two plastic applicators in each box.  After you open the ampoule, you push the plastic applicator down over the open tip.  You need to push it to where the bottom of the tip almost touches the wide part of the ampoule, just below the neck.  It is not that hard to put on.  But then there is the use.  I have the best luck holding it upside down and squeezing the plastic tip to push product out as I move the tip around on my scalp, stopping every now and then to rub the product into my scalp.  It is kind of a pain.

This is a thin, non-viscous liquid.  It doesn't have a noticeable scent and it doesn't tingle or burn or anything, which is appreciated.  It doesn't leave my hair oily or weighed down.  It is actually a lightweight, non-oily product.

There are a couple of things I particularly like about this.

(1) I don't know how this works, but I have had so many good hair days since starting to use this.  I don't see how it could possibly be an anti-frizz product, but I have less frizz.  (In fairness, maybe it is the super dry weather we've been having.)  But my hair is also unusually soft and manageable these days, so this product is not interfering with that aspect of things (and, in fact, may be helping).

(2) I feel that my hair around my roots has a little more volume now.  Nothing super dramatic, but a small difference that is noticeable to me.  It makes my hair look a bit fuller.  (I've lost a lot of weight this year and my hair was thinning a bit as a result of the constant stress from diet and exercise.  That's why I initially started using this product.)

(3) This is not doing anything to damage or strip color from my chemically-treated (dyed) hair.

(4) This is non-irritating.  My scalp is in great shape and I've been using this frequently for several weeks.

(5) Finally, the effects.  I don't think I could say this is making my hair grow any faster (it already grows fast, like an inch a month).  But it is help me keep individual hairs for longer.  So after a couple of months, my hair will actually BE a lot thicker instead of just LOOKING thicker.  (When I shampoo, and I am currently using the Phyto Phytocyane shampoo, I am losing many fewer hairs than I used to.)

This probably won't help if your problem is hormonal (e.g., a thyroid problem).  But if your hair loss/thinning is caused by stress or weight loss or something along those lines, this is definitely worth a try.",4.0
"I'm not a big grooming sort of guy. I use two-in-one shampoo/conditioner. I've even used the all in one body wash-shampoo-conditioner. I don't know what the difference of all that stuff is.

But, as I get older, I find that I want to take care of my face more and more. Like I don't usually wear sunscreen because I don't burn and don't really get a lot of exposure to the sun (like I'm not close to a beach. I live in south Texas where you literally melt in the summer heat so A/C and being indoors is your friend). Anyway, I felt like I needed to step up my game and someone suggested this product.

It's pricey AF. But it does have SPF 20 w/ the moisturizer so that's good I suppose. And, you don't need to use a lot so even with daily use it has lasted a long time. I don't know if it's improved my complexion or tightened or whatever other magics these things are supposed to do, but I do know that I don't have super dry skin out of the shower in the mornings anymore.

But to be honest, I suspect cheaper products would do similar things likely with harsher chemicals or whatever.",4.0
"Decent product. Too soon to tell if it's really working. Doesn't give the ""lift"" at root as advertised.",4.0

Have definitely seen an increase in hair growth since starting this product. My only problem is keeping the applicator on the glass vial - keeps falling off.,4.0
"I wish they made this without the SPF, I don't need that all the time and hate putting chemical-based sunscreen on when it's not needed (preferring zinc-based, elemental sunblock).  It seems to work okay, not as good as their hand healer unfortunately.  It's as good as anything else out there.  It doesn't clog pores and adequately moisturizes.",4.0
nice product...but not sure it's worth such a high price,4.0
This is very easy to apply and seems to give body to my very thin hair.  My condition is the result of aging and I suspect this serum does not reverse aging.,4.0

"I came from using Keihl's facial fuel and I really liked that a lot except for the price.  This has a very slight strange smell when you put it on (I could do without it), but the smell disappears fast.  Having the SPF 20 is really nice and it doesn't feel the least bit greasy, which is great.  The package is nice too, with an effective pump.  1 star off because it doesn't seem as effective as the Keihl's...not sure what it is, but the facial fuel really seemed to make my skin look and feel great immediately after application, whereas the jack black just seems like regular lotion.",4.0

"Definitely pricey. The 3.3.oz size container looks meager in person so I don't know how long it will last but you don't need to use that much at once. It is not a thin, running down your hands consistency but a nice medium viscosity. I have an extremely oily face and it feels ideal. It absorbs quickly. It's not greasy and doesn't contribute to any more shine. It hasn't caused breakouts. The scent is oddly enough quite similar to baby wipes if you know what they generally smell like. I like it actually but wouldn't consider it a masculine scent if that's important to you. Overall it feels like a high quality product and that's what I would expect at the price. One concern is that the formula includes retinyl palmitate. There hasn't been any conclusive data on its effect on humans but it can potentially increase cancer risk, ironically enough. Do your research and make the choice. I personally may be looking elsewhere after I deplete the bottle as I use a prescription retinol product on my face to combat acne. The combined vitamin A absorption might not be the best thing.",4.0
"So easy to use, for the man like me. I had never used the products applying on my face. So I really wanted to do nothing, but I was getting old and I had to do deal with the aging. So I had chosen this product and I love it. But, it is a bit too white. Maybe it is because the sunblock ability of the moisturizer.",4.0

"My skin has always been very sensitive and prone to acne, so I was leery about using this product because I thought it might be too heavy for my skin. Thankfully, it's been great to use and has caused absolutely no breakouts.

"I have been using this product for about 6 months now and so far it lives up to other positive reviews. Provides a light moisturizer with SPF and a tolerable smell. Even if you don't care for the smell, it disappears rather quickly. My only complaint is that perhaps it is a bit too light, making it less useful in the winter. The greatest thing about this though? It can be carried onto an airplane!! It blows my mind why all toiletries aren't offered in 100 mL volumes - I'm looking at you toothpaste companies.",4.0
"Truly double duty! It's heavy and actually put a couple of pimples on this old face. You can sense the SPF20 at work. The bottle is too small and pricey.  I wish it would be more ""lotion"" than ""cream"".  I use it on dry cold days when I have to be outdoors.",4.0
"I live in a very hot and sunny climate. I haven't been consistent about it and was making an effort to apply every day. I usually use an SPF 50, but started to have a reaction to the ""supposedly"" hypo-allergenic sunscreen I was using. I'm not sure if the formula changed or it was the fact that I was using it more regularly.

I gave this a try and so far so good. It's not oily and not highly scented (low profile). It also holds up well to heat, humidity and perspiration. I didn't give it five stars as I'm waiting to see if there are any sensitivities after long term use and I'd prefer a higher SPF.",4.0

I can't really give this a bad review, it's just not the one for me.
I really wanted this to be the best thing ever but like a few others have said, I'm gonna keep looking.
It does go on nicely and not much smell but I think it's more of a sun screen and less of a moisturizer.
Maybe trying to get the two together in something that doesn't give you some other kind of cancer, is impossible.
Your face feels cool when you put it on then sort of gets a little stiff and you're aware of it when you leave the house.
It did make my neck just slightly itchy.
It's amazing how hard it is to find just a moisturizer alone (no sunscreen) that works and is healthy.",4.0

"It's lightweight, has some antioxidants, protects from the sun, and is made by Jack Black.  It feels nice on the face, and smells good (easily absorbs).  Just be careful if you wear this in your eye area, because it can burn (like most sunscreens) if sweat or tears causes the lotion to go into your eye after wearing it for a while.  My original review talked about some ingredients in it that may not be good for you; however I actually spent some time reading through the scientific journals I referenced, and most of the claims were a stretch.  Linalool is probably not a good thing to have in lotion, but it's in small enough quantities that it never bothered me.  The studies showing linalool as being bad used a TON of it in high concentrations and it kind of irritated some people.  Anyway, you can get this with confidence.",4.0

"Ok- I'm gonna ""tell it like it is""

I think Jack black is a good line, but not a GREAT line, and is overpriced in general.

My personal skin care regimen:
1. Billy Jealousy shave cream- cheaper than jack black and in my opinion better
2. Billy jealousy shaved ice after shave healer- the jack black is pretty good too, but I like the billy jealousy better.
3. Jack Black facial moisturizer- I do like this product a lot
4. I used the protein booster skin serum- saw no real difference, and for as much as it costs, you could find better options.
5. I do like the jack black eye serum.

In general, Jack black is considered more of an ""anti-aging"" line, hence the higher price point.

I am not saying their products are bad in any way, I just think there are better products out there for the money.
One line I'm going to look into is the ""menscience"" line of products.

But, you really can't beat the Billy Jealousy shave cream. I have super sensitive skin, and never see any red inflamed skin when using this shave cream.",4.0
Was great for my skin but very pricey.,4.0
Clean Product- Not too oily and does a decent job as a daily moisturizer,4.0
"So this is kind of a pricey moisturizer, but Im willing to splurge because its vegan (free of animal products) and cruelty-free (Jack Black doesnt test on animals). Initially, I worried that the scent might be too much for me. While it is a little on the masculine side, it isn't overwhelmingly so; and the smell fades soon after application, anyway.

Theres so much to love about this moisturizer, above and beyond Jack Blacks vegan-friendliness. It has a built-in 20 SPF sunscreen; while I still apply a stronger sunscreen on those days Im likely to spend a lot of time outdoors, JB provides me protection from incidental sun exposure when I forget to use sunblock or choose not to. It does a good job moisturizing my combination skin without making it feel greasy or clogging up my pores.

My only complaint is that I seem to go through it rather quickly (or at least faster than some of the other reviewers report). I also like the convenience of the pump designuntil you reach the bottom of the bottle and have to beat the rest of the product out of it.",4.0

"Good lotion, far better than Dove, Nivea, etc.

I've been on the search for a better face lotion for years, where I gradually increase in price to see where the balance of cost/quality is -- with this Jack Black lotion, I feel like I'm closer but not quite there.

Much better than the ""first tier"" of $5 lotions, but I still wind up having to apply it at least 2 or 3 separate times to make my face feel hydrated.

Not oily, which is nice...and the smell is very light and fresh, not flowery or unpleasant at all.",4.0
"No oil, not thick. Light and smooth with sunscreen. Wish it came in a larger size. Will buy again. Get it",4.0
"Unfortunately, this is one of those products that tried to combine moisturizer and a sunscreen but couldn't get it right. If you want to put on something very casual, maybe this is for you. I didn't find this to be an effective sunblock or a moisturizer, for that matter.

My recommendation is to get an SPF of atleast of 50 if you are serious about sun. The ozone layer depletion is not just a story, you know.",4.0
"My face has both very dry and very oily places.  This moisturizer works very well.  I use it right after shaving in the morning.  It keeps my skin, especially the dry areas of my cheeks from looking dessicated.  Ok, that's a bit of an overstatement, but I can tell by looking in the mirror this moisturizer does the trick.  And the fact that it protects against sun damage is an added bonus, especially on weekends when I tend to be outside more.  It takes about three pumps to get enough to massage into my skin.  The amount that comes out per pump is very small.  I've been using this for a few weeks and am guessing at this rate it will last a couple of months.  The price is reasonable compared to other products out there.  And it doesn't leave any smell on my skin.  And it doesn't hurt at all even if I put it on immediately after shaving.",4.0

"I first used this product when I received a sample of the Jack Black Double Duty Moisturizer and used it for a few days. I didn't realize it is a ""men's product"" (but apparently, a lot of women use the brand too).  I liked it so much, I ordered a tube from Amazon. It's not greasy and goes on smooth and makes a great base for my foundation, probably because of the rice algae and sea parsley ingredients. It's a great daytime moisturizer. I will probably switch off occasionally because my skin is 50+ and sometimes needs a little ""plumping"" with a richer cream.  It does have a scent. I don't find it mediciney like other reviewers have mentioned, more like a faint reminder of Noxzema. I find it pleasing, but maybe it's because it makes me nostalgic for my teen years.",4.0

A few have complained about the smell but I did not find it offensive or overpowering. I can best describe the smell as ""soapy"".

I'm not certain I will buy this product again once I run out but I will have no problem buying it if no other product fits my criteria: SPF, face lotion, won't burn my eyes if I sweat, designed for men, and has a neutral smell.",4.0
"I'm not entirely sure it's worth the $48 price tag, it's difficult to tell how long the bottle will last, but it's definitely a very high quality men's moistrurizer.  Not at all greasy, and in fact, leaves my skin feeling taught.  Used with the Jack Black facial wash, exfoliator, and peeling pads, it's made a noticeable difference in my skin.
If price isn't a major concern (and look, folks, we're talking about spending $48 on moisturizer) this is a pretty darn good product.
I'll likely buy it again.
Update:  As of Dec. 2013, I'm still on the first bottle.  DEFINITELY worth the $48!",4.0
"Jack Black is quality stuff. Love their colognes. So when I was looking for a face moisturizer, I took a look at their stuff. This one is a decent moisturizer. Expensive. It feels nice and not oily. Dries up good. I can smell and sense the SPF product in this, as sunscreen products always bother my eyes. For the most part, after I spread it, I'm OK. I only use about a pea size worth, spread it between my hands and rub all over my face and upper neck.",4.0
"I like this product a lot, and would purchase it again if it was cheaper. But I feel that it is overpriced by comparison to other lotions.",4.0
"I've used this Jack Black product for several years and decided to purchase the larger version as it was a much better price per ounce.  The moisturizer is an excellent product - light weight on your face, just enough moisturizer, good sun protection and it doesn't clog my pores.  Would have been 5 stars except the shipping was so slow (arrived a week after promised date).",4.0
Really good stuff.  When you put it on it doesn't feel greasy or thick like some of the other moisturizers or lotions I have used in the past.,4.0
"I am very satisfied with the product as a whole, especially the SPF 20 aspect.  It does not cause any eye irritation while sweating in the sun, as opposed to a regular sun tan lotion.  The only down side, and it is not that significant, is the scent, which could definitely be improved.",4.0
"This is what I use daily after my shower to moisturize my face, it's not heavy and doesn't leave my skin greasy. The smell is light which I like, so my cologne or body spray come through and I don't get all these mixing aromas. It gets rid of the tight skin feeling I get if I don't moisturize after showers, and since it's double duty with its sunscreen it adds that bit of extra protection, since I'am outside quite a lot it's a plus.",4.0
"I really like this product. Goes on matte, has a light and neutral scent, and per the manufacturer doesn't have some of the ingredients that have raised health concerns. It is very, very light as a moisturizer so feels more like just putting a sunscreen on. That would probably be preferable for the person with oily skin. I tend to be a little dry so would prefer more moisturizing power but that's me. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who only wants a very light lotion.",4.0
"It seems as if it is working for me.  I notice a slight difference in the 2 weeks that I have been using it.  But on the bottle it says to use it for a month.  I have noticed, though that it makes my stretch marks more visible? I don't know if this could be caused by my tummy having more elasticity and firming because I am also working out, or from the product. However, it smells nice and is not sticky like I thought it would be.  Overall, it is a wonderful product and I would definately recommend it to anyone whose tummy was severly stretched during pregnancy!",4.0
I love this color. It looks great on my skin tone. It is hard to find here. I will always order my blush from cargo,4.0
The container seems smaller than the container of blush previous purchased at Sephora.  Don't know if it's the same amount of blush or the can is just smaller now.,4.0
I like this eyelash definer because it is a nice size (not too big and bulky) and does a good job of removing mascara clumps from lashes. I also like the fact that it comes in a soft plastic case for everyone's protection!,4.0
"Deeply pigmented, which I like, but I was disappointed that it had NO sheen or metallic quality at all. Maybe you would call it ""matte."" TOTALLY, completely matte. Flat. One of my old favorite Cargo shadows is Yukon, a lovely taupe/mushroom which is silky with a soft metallic sheen (not glitter or sparkle); I was expecting Flint to be the grey version. Flint is good for a smoky eye, and nice for business wear, but it would be much prettier, and more silky in its application, if it had a bit of the metallic to it.",4.0
"I gave this 4 Stars only because it was to light on me and maybe that was my fault, should have gone with a little darker color. The product itself really is quite nice and it goes on very easy and blends good. I will purchase again just a little darker.",4.0
I feel like this worked well for me. I used it as instructed for about 2 months and noticed a difference.,4.0
"ended up not being the color I thought. I had gotten a cargo blush as a gift and the name of the color rubbed off. However, I do like the color.",4.0
Using hubby account to review this. I liked this color but it was a little too light for my olive skin. This probably would look better on someone who has lighter skin. I'm a light olive so this did not suit my skin tone but it was fun to try. I gave it to my mom and she liked it. The application is smooth and it's a matte peachy shade. It lasts all day and did not oxidize.,4.0
Great,4.0
Nice,4.0
really pretty light pink color. second one I have bought and lasts FOREVER,4.0
Wifey says slowly disappearing so must be working to her satisfaction,4.0

Nice as expected.,4.0
I just started using this product 2 weeks ago after having my baby girl via cesarean. So far I've noticed my belly feels soft & my lose skin is getting firm again. I'll definitely keep using it!,4.0
"I used Mustela double action stretch marks throughout my pregnancy and decided to use this one after delivery. I bought it because I trust the brand. I didn't start using it until my daughter was almost 5 months old. I am not sure if it really firms my skin since I work out at the same time, but I do like the smell and how easily it is absorbed by the skin. I apply it to abdomen, hips, thighs and upper arms once daily (twice as instructed). Even though I am not sure if it works (the reason for 4 stars), I do not see any negative effects.",4.0
i have had two kids and my skin is lets face it not the same.  i have been using this cream for 2 weeks now and I think it might make it into the regular rotation of creams and lotions i use now.  there is so much out there but this is really worth the money,4.0
I love this and go through it like water. I only wish that it was stronger. It wears off very quickly.,4.0
Smells like a baby should! We even had a little fun with it at the baby shower and sprayed eachother. The scent is mild but noticeable and very pleasant. Bought it for a friend's new baby but would not hesitate to get for my own. The best part was the subtlety of the scent. There's no way people wouldn't like this smell.,4.0
"The perfume is delicate and sweet , ideal for baby boys .",4.0
"Lightly scented and a pleasant fragrance for kids. Not very overpowering, but a subtle hint of fragrance. Very happy with the product. Purchased for my 3 year old son. Just sprayed a little on his T-shirt yesterday and today also i get the subtle fragrance. Way to go mustela!!!! Thank You Amazon for the timely delivery and proper packaging. Would definitely buy again.",4.0
"I just adore the smell, but wish it would last longer.",4.0
very nice prompt shipping,4.0
Smells fresh and clean. Not necessarily a baby scent but just refreshing. I use this as an adult for something subtle and not overpowering. Just wish the scent lasted more than an hour or two.,4.0
Wonderful,4.0
Scent does not stay too long.,4.0
Refreshing scent. It is not too strong and you won't grow tired of the scent. I am very happy with it. Great product but a bit expensive for a small bottle.,4.0

Very light fragrance that settles after application to a very light powdery smell. well tolerated,4.0
"I adored the way my daughter's Mustela 2-In-1 hair & body shampoo left her smelling fresh and clean. It's become an endearing scent to me and I was hoping to find something that replicates that smell for myself. I ordered a bottle of Musti in the hopes that it'd be just like the Mustela wash; unfortunately, it isn't. That was initially a letdown but I've grown to love the scent of Musti as well. I'd think of Musti as a more classic sister scent to the Mustela wash.

Musti is more light and less soapy smelling. It's not an extremely strong scent, which is to be expected since it's traditionally a child's cologne. I use it on myself but I like how it doesn't irritate my daughter's skin as she is extremely sensitive to scents (eczema and the whole shebang). Furthermore, I like spritzing a little bit of Dolce & Gabbana's Light Blue in combination with Musti. I read in another review about someone doing this and was intrigued. Turns out I liked it too!",4.0
Perfect for my baby girl. I love the light scent and that it's alcohol free. I use a little too!,4.0
"I got this for my baby girl when i was pregnant. I opened it and smelled it, and it smelled like old lady grandma. I was disappointed because i thought it would smell like a baby.

When my baby girl arrived, I used it on one of her shirts... and i fell in love with the smell. It smells slightly citrusy. I try not to use it as much because i don't want to waste it!

My mother in law, sister in law, sister, mother, everyone says ""awe i miss your baby and i miss her smell""  :) hehe

I love it it's so unique! I only use it when we go out or have someone over. The one i use more is the Johnson's baby cologne that smells like....baby. I use them both together sometimes. Except the Johnson's one is about $2 lol

So If you want an exotic citrusy rich smell, go with this.
If you want the classic baby smell, go with Johnson's cologne.",4.0
"I grew up using  Mustela products as a baby and a child and, now I use them for my daughter.",4.0
"I bought this perfume for my son who would normally use his dad's perfume. Now he has his own and he loves it.
It smells really nice.",4.0
"This is a great scent for baby and mommy alike. There is no alcohol in it, so it's easy on baby's skin. And it smells so pretty! My baby always gets compliments on how good she smells, and this is the reason! The only reason I gave it four stars is because the scent wears off in a couple of hours, so you have to reapply it more often than you do with others.",4.0
"I bought this for my kids.
Since they have very sensitive skin type.
I prefer non-alcohol product.
Mustela Musti Eau de Soin spray is very gentle.
However, as other review already mentioned.
Not too long to stay.",4.0
I like to use this perfume on me. It's mild and gentle and won't bother baby if I wear it.,4.0
I love the smell of the lotion and love that it doesnt have harmful ingredients. Wish the price point was lower,4.0
Good for eczema control,4.0
Been using this after my showers for 6 months and I like it.,4.0
As expected,4.0
I like thexture and function wide it's good. But it has strong frangrance odor.,4.0
"This lotion smells wonderful! It is a stronger scent than most lotions, so if you are sensitive to smells this might not be the best choice. But I love it because it makes my 6 month old smell SO good and not like gross spit up.
I wish this lotion were slightly thicker in consistency. It is quite runny like an oil, not thick and creamy like most baby lotions. This is why I took away 1 star. I like thicker lotions that really stay on the skin, especially with my small eczema spots that my baby gets.",4.0
"The lotion is kind of watery, but soaks in quickly.  The smell however is strong.  Not sure how to explain it, heavy powder scent?",4.0
"I like knowing that standards are more strict in the EU for additives, so this cream seems much safer than the American alternatives.

Only negative? Have you tasted this stuff? If you kiss your little one's cheek after rubbing it on your lips will be bitter. Feel bad she has it on her hands and then jams them in her mouth.",4.0
"The smell is really strong. However, it is a great product. It protect my son from dry skin and soothe his itchiness immediately after 1-2 use.",4.0
"4 stars instead of 5 because of the smell. I really wouldn't consider that a baby smell. It is quite strong. It does dissipate eventually, but I can smell it on me after handling the baby. It does seem to have helped his dry, patchy, red skin. I purchased it because it was recommended to me. I am not disappointed in it. A little goes a long way. It spreads very easy. It takes a little while to soak in, but isn't greasy once it is in.",4.0
Works as expected!!!!,4.0
"Smells great, but I prefer to use products with plant based oils vs mineral oils",4.0
"It is great for lengthy moisture to little ones skin. Babies do not keep moisture like adults. Down side it stinks but dries quickly and smell is short lived, contrary to some reviews. Great for extra TLC for out little ones skin. Pricey but I believe it's been worth it!",4.0
"Good lotion, but scent is strong.",4.0
"My son has very bad eczema that needed to be controlled with steroids.  Afterward I started using Mustella.  I had been through several of the other creams including Excedrin, aquaphor, and aveeno.  I like this the best.  It is easy to apply.  The scent is not my favorite but it doesn't bother my sons skin.  It has all the main ingredients recommended by the dermatologists.  I would recommend this to any expectant and new mom.",4.0
This smells like grape and has all-natural ingredients. It is very nice as a lotion but you could get tired of it because the scent (which is very pleasant) is quite strong.,4.0
"This baby lotion has worked nicely for my bebe thus far.  It pumps easily and the feel is non-greasy and quick to absorb.  It is scented and though it is not the classic ""baby product"" smell like J&J, it's still baby-ish.  We've come to associate it with our baby's smell.  It hasn't resulted in any weird skin conditions like eczema or rashes so I'll likely continue using it through my baby does have a tiny bit of baby acne.",4.0
Good,4.0
This moisturizer is great in that it leaves a slight shine on the skin. I love a glossy look for my extremely dry skin and throw in the added bonus that it doesn't smell like baby powder...I absolutely love it! Who wants to smell like baby powder as an adult! To me this moisturizer has the smell and consistency of the Original Keri lotion. I gave the lotion 4 stars bc it contains mineral oil and petroleum which I really don't like to be in my products. Mineral oil and petroleum block moisture so this lotion is better used after a shower or bath. I wouldn't classify it as natural...but it doesn't contain parabens. Another thing is that this lotion is uber expensive...$13.99 at Target for a 10 oz bottle! If Keri didn't have parabens I would switch back and save money.,4.0
I love the pump since it makes it so simple and easy to use on a squirmy baby.  It came as a recommendation from a fellow mom and has been a great post bath lotion for my baby.  The smell is not overwhelming at all and is just right for my infant.  He loves the tiny massage he gets as we put this on him as well. I recommend it over other products thanks to the ease of use & great smell.  I don't see any dryness or scaling for 1-2 days and it serves as a great protector for cloth rubbing on skin.,4.0
This lotion smells good and makes my baby's skin very soft. This lotion is worth the money. Would buy again.,4.0
Not excellent for very dry skin but does an excellent job at making your baby smell and feel good. This is my second child I am using this product on. I love it. Would defiantly recommend it!,4.0

I love the scent and it moisturiszes my baby's body after she showers.
I would definitely get another one after she's done with this bottle.",4.0
"Johnson & Johnson products and Burt's Bee products cause breakouts, this product does not. Also, I think it makes their skin feel softer. And, and added bonus is that people always comment on how good my babies smell! I just wish it wasn't so expensive!",4.0
"This stuff smells great and my son and I both love it. However, he doesn't have hair yet and for some reason this is really hard to rinse off his head, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.",4.0
"If you want to close your eyes and take in the scent of your baby's just-washed hair like you're living in your own can't-believe-this-is-real dream, bring this stuff to bathtime! It frees up your hand, not having to switch from body wash to shampoo. The feel is creamy, baby's hair comes out beautiful and the soft scent is perfect! Nice gift, top of the line.",4.0
Love this lotion. Smells great! It it very silky and goes on smooth but it moisturizes well. Good for every day use. I prefer Auquaphor for rashes or super dryness.,4.0
"smells like an old lady in my opinion, not a good baby smell like i was hoping for. it does make your skin feel soft, but the ingredients aren't anything special: water, mineral oil, shea butter, jojoba oils, and lots of things that aren't good ingredients if you check it out on cosmetics database [...]

cant return it since ive used it, but i feel like i just wasted $13 on this",4.0
My daughter has severe eczema and have been using this product now for many months with very good results. I have got so many compliments about how great she smells. Some people might be put off by the smell though. It is a great moisturizer. I found it a little pricey but anything for her.,4.0

"I love the smell but I think my baby is too young for it. Whenever I give him a bath using mustela, he has a weird red rash afterwards, so his skin may be too sensitive to something in the ingredient list. The rash disappears within an hr or 2 so that's why I think it's more likely an age thing, and something he'll outgrow (I hope).

The smell reminds me of baby smells of old, and I really enjoy it. Everything else about the product is great. :)",4.0
Works well on baby acne. A little perfume-y,4.0

Love these products. Still love the foaming shampoo the most but this one is really great too. Can't beat the scent and it was always make me think of baby snuggles!,4.0
nice but too expensive,4.0
this product has worked well for my 22 MO who has eczema. It did not cause a flair up. I only use it on her hair.,4.0
"What the heck Mustela? Why would you change the scent on an amazing product. Look at the reviews.... people love your product. I do (did) too. It is unmatched in the baby shampoo/wash arena.

But, the latest tube we bought has the new, unbearable scent. We opened it and.... wooosh.... this new, strong, unpleasant scent took over the bathroom! It smells like a combo of a Grandma's strong vintage floral perfume and a ton of baby powder.

I used to LOVE the old scent. it was unique and fresh. This new scent is a huge bummer. I am still using it because it is gentle and rinses well. Mustela- offer both scents: the original and new.

Why don't you offer both scent options: original and floral? (or something like that?) The old stuff was perfect... ""If it ain't broke....""

8.15.16 EDIT  to 4 stars ** I have to say that I have tried other brands and Mustela is the best. I have gotten accustomed to the new scent (I would still like the option to buy the old scent, thought, Mustela). But based on performance alone, this is still the leader.",4.0
"If I reviewed this product previously, it would definitely be 5 stars...perfect for my kids sensitive skin.  We've been using this and other Mustela products since they've been born.

However, the last couple tubes of this from our most recent order were different.  The smell is totally different and almost overwhelming.

I noticed that the new tubes say that it's 'biodegradable', not sure if it used to say that.

anyhow, it still works great but the floral scent of this new formulation is hard for me and my wife to deal with, luckily the kids don't seem to notice.  The scent is very strong and stayed on my hands even after a few hand washes",4.0
good,4.0
This soap smells amazing and I love it. My girls love it. I used it for my first child but it does seem to dry out our skin in winter. I've had to switch to something a little more moisturizing for winter.,4.0
"Always liked this brand, but feel scent has become too overpowering.",4.0
"I love Mustela's products but was a bit unhappy with this purchase only because of the scent. we use the Stelatopia line almost exclusively and I prefer scent free but can handle the scent of that line. Neither my son's skin or my nose like the 2 in 1 hair & body wash tho. I can't even say what it is too much o but it is just too much..
Please note that many fragrances are too much in our house, you may like this just fine...",4.0

"I think this is a good product.  I don't like the smell as much as the hydra-bebe products so I am taking a star off.  I don't think the smell is bad, but my husband thinks it smells like jalapenos.  I definitely don't, but I guess every nose is different and it is something to consider if you are considering a purchase.  I don't use it as shampoo, only body wash on my 5 month old.  She loves baths so we do one every night as part of her bedtime routine.  I wanted a mild body cleanser and this is great.  It keeps her skin soft and hydrated, but I do also use the hydra-bebe after her bath.  I would order again.",4.0
"Love Mustela products and scent! I know its a little too much for some people, but i like it.
A little goes a long way, so worth the price.",4.0
Very good product for your child. TearFree so you Can use on skin and hair without worry. Don't need too much to get a good base of lather on child. Smells great. Cleans very well. Each tube lasted one month for two toddlers. A bit expensive but worth it!,4.0
"Smells so good and seems to work well for cradle cap!  It's a good amount of the money, too. Love it!",4.0
"I initially bought this nearly 4 years ago after my first son had severe cradle cap and baby acne.  I searched online, and Mustela came up, so I purchased a few of the items.  It seriously worked miracles!  Within a very short period of time, his cheeks were baby smooth and the cradle cap rapidly improved.  I then used it on my second, who has eczema - which this keeps at bay.

This stuff is expensive though - we took a break from it to use something cheaper, and ended up coming back to this, due to little rashes, etc. popping back up.  I will say that after using an unscented product the smell of Mustela is pretty strong, but not enough to not use it.",4.0
"I bought this for my 5 year old (girl) and 10 month old (boy) to share.  It has a nice clean scent without being overpowering...  I have found myself using it from time to time.  It's a very silky soap and you only need a small amount to lather quite well.  For this reason, it seems to be a fairly good value.",4.0
"Makes my baby really smell like a baby! I love the creamy formula, but my baby's scalp did get a little dry from shampooing every alternate day so i've cut 1 star for that.",4.0

I love Mustela! especially for newborns. This shampoo though has a different scent from the dermo cleanser which you can use for the scalp and the body too. wish it had the same scent though and i would have given 5 stars. but no matter what mustela is the best! especially for young babies,4.0

"This lipstain does last. But let me tell you, it is DARK PURPLE. It is a deep purple. One must work quickly when applying this gel stain to obtain the desired results. I am fair skin with medium blonde hair and one coat is usually enough. I wear it as a blush also and then it really goes. Another idea is to lightly apply it as a shadow to the eyelids. Overall, the look is natural and alive.",4.0

"I'm not an experienced lip stick wearer which is why i decided to go with a lip stain when i needed one for a holiday party. i got Liquid Kiss and it was a pretty dark red with just 2 coats. i think it's a bit too dark for casual wear unless you can get it on perfect with just one coat. i like that the color sets quickly and lasts a few hours as long as you don't eat anything or rub your mouth too much. it also doesn't stain your teeth so you can wear it worry free! if you have even slightly peely skin on your lips, those peely parts WILL look extra dark.

one thing i'm sad about is that i had the lip stain in a clutch bag for about 4 hours and by the end of the night, the container somehow cracker near the opening! i don't remember sitting on my bag or anything, so it seems like it might be a fragile container. now i can't carry it around with me. i have to put it on in the morning and deal with the fact that after lunch the color won't really be there anymore. i still want to get this in My Sunshine tho :P",4.0

"I've been using this face lotion for a few years now, and I'm a huge fan.  However, I've been receiving it as a gift, which makes it much easier on the wallet.  One bottle/tube will last you almost a year with daily usage, so it's not a bad investment.

This lotion really does a great job of helping with razor burn, protecting you against sun damage, and keeping your skin feeling and looking smooth and healthy.  Plus, it has a very mild orange scent that I like, and that women around me tend to enjoy.  They really made a great product here, with no allergens and extremely high quality ingredients (I think, what do any of us really know?)  Regardless, if you can afford it, go for it!  You won't regret it, unless you get addicted like me.",4.0

"If you are contemplating Anthony Logistics Oil Free Moisturizer, you need to know a few things:

1.  It is a very good moisturizer.

2.  It will not leave you feeling oily (which is a good sign, as it is ""oil-free"")

3.  It is a bit pricey.  In my opinion, it is worth it, though.

I have somewhat combination skin, and the moisturizer works well.  My favorite feature is the fact that is contains SPF 15, so I don't have to worry about additional sunscreen protection, which is important to me, as I have fair skin.

By the way, contrary to instructions, I only apply in the morning, after shave and shower.",4.0

"I'm almost 40 and blessed with great skin with no lines whatsoever.  However, I have a few reddish discolorations/scars from acne.  I tried Strivectin-SD on a whim from Costco Canada because of the excellent reviews I saw online and Costco's great return policy.  To my surprise, I started seeing a difference with the red blotches almost immediately.  I'm only week 2 into my strivectin experiment, so I don't know if the blotches will go away completely.  They are definitely showing signs of improvement as far.  I don't know what people are talking about in terms of its color and smell.  My cream is white and it has no particular smell at all.  Maybe it's because I bought it in Canada and it's a different formulation?  Not sure.  As for the cost, I paid $139 for 2 giant tubes that will probably last me 7 months or so.  I don't find $20 a month that horrendous for a good moisturizer, which this is, at the very least.",4.0

"The lines in my forehead are definitely softer.  The lines around my lips and mouth and in between my eyes also seem to be a tiny bit better, but I am not sure, quite honestly, if that is just hopeful wishing, or true.  I use this product faithfully and figure if I keep at it for several months I'll be able to determine better.  However, Amazon has asked me to rate this, so I am.  It's amusing to me that the lines in my forehead are definitely softer when those were the lines that were first to appear back in my early 30's...you'd think they'd been there the longest so they'd be most difficult to soften.  My more recent (or at least less noticible until the last couple of years) lines seem to be more stubborn.
I think I've read that perisistence will show results, so I will update this review as I see results.",4.0
"Now I am playing devil's advocate when it comes to products like these. I did my research on Strivectin-SD and from what I understand, the mix they're using now isn't as concentrated as the original formula. I read ALL reviews on the product and I can see where naysayers and cheerleaders have their points. I started using the Strivectin in early spring for stretch marks on my hips and lower abdomen due to weight (NOT PREGNANCY- I AM CHILDFREE). It took me a positive PCOS diagnosis and nearly 3 years of supplements and vegetarian to now vegan diet to see weight loss of 33 lbs. (that's REAL PEOPLE weight loss, NOT CELEBUTARD diet fads). My stretch marks SLOWLY shrunk and the redness faded, I added shea and cocoa butter along with hydroquinone whitening lotion to the mix and saw slight improvement. But the depth of the marks really got to me. Enter Strivectin-SD. I followed directions using it on my stretch marks and dents on my decolletage, and within 3 weeks the depth of the stretch marks and sight of them were blending in with my fairer skin really well (I also use fatgirlslim and lovehandler at night)! The neck dents... not so much improvement. I began seeing those when I was 28 (and I'm no sun worshiper), so I think I'll be trying Olay neck tightener since the reviews look pretty convincing and I've ordered my third batch of Strivectin. Too bad I didn't get to use the original though...",4.0

I don't know that there's a real way to evaluate effectiveness with regard to wrinkles, but I certainly thought highly enough of the product to buy a second bottle. The only downside is the price.",4.0
"I have been using Strivectin for a couple of years now.  I use it every day as part of my daily routine.  I can't even tell you the difference it makes at this point because I would not be caught without it.  What I can tell you is that at 38 I hear, ""you look 28"" and that even my dermatologist asked me what I was doing to my skin when I went back to see her after using it.  I told her ""StriVectin"" and she just laughed and told me to keep using it.",4.0
"I'm only giving this a 4 star because I've only been using the product for about 2 days. But, I've gotta say I'm so far *very* impressed. I live in the Boston area, and currently we're experiencing Arctic like temps and dry dry air. I needed something to make my face not feel like parchment. I found a tube of this cream at a local TJMaxx for waaaay below what it would normally cost. I'd heard all the hype and I figured here was my chance to give it a whirl. Before, the high price tag made it all but not an option for me.

I'm only 37 and will be 38 in a month or so. I've been trying to find a cream that improves some mild sun damage, mild acne scars, and a few areas of hyper pigmentation. I've always worn sunscreen but even so, I'm so fair that it's often been hard for me not to get freckles or mild burns in patches. I don't have many wrinkles or lines, but had been noticing, especially in the very dry winter air, my face has often looked a little dull and slack of late.

I've tried all sorts of better drug store creams, and even some all natural heathfood store brands. The best of them seemed to show initial results, but then seemed to taper off in terms of showing improvement. Enter StiVectin. I'm honestly quite impressed with how readily my skin has responded to this cream. Nothing else I've tried, not even Olay or Neutrogena products made my skin perk up, this fast. My skin tone is already more even. My skin feels smoother and appears more 'full'. Although many have expressed distaste for the aroma of the cream, I find it kind of refreshing and calming in scent. Even so, the smell doesn't linger on me. I only really notice it for a short time after applying.

I'm happy enough and impressed to keep up the usage, and I'll reserve more judgment as to if the initial reaction my skin had to the cream stays consistent, or improves further in a few weeks or more.

I DEFINITELY would not pay top dollar for this stuff. As much as I like it, had I not found it for very cheap at a local TJMaxx I probably would not have been able to afford to try it. Who knows? I'd been reading about the wide variation in who responds to this cream, and who doesn't. I might be one of the ones who's skin chemistry responds well to this stuff. Here's hoping! My face glows. I will be sure to report back.",4.0
"I am a self described lotion junkie. In the past I have used Murad, Aveda and even have a Retin A addiction. I noticed that the wrinkles around my eye area were really starting to take off this year...40 is just around the bend! In researching Botox (which I don't want to do for a myriad of reasons) I found Strivectin sd.
I was fairly doubtful that it would work, but considering that one ity bity tube of eye cream from murad is 95$ I could invest in the 6 ounce tube, the eye cream and the facial sculpting cream.
  I'm almost a month in and have noticed a dramatic difference in the appearance of the wrinkles around my eyes, on my forehead and between my brow. I'm even putting the cream on my neck and on my lovely baby markings on my hips and thighs. I have never seen these type of results with other creams. This doesn't seem to have a short term hydrating effect, but really does seem to diminish the wrinkles themselves. With other creams (including the expensive ones) the hydrating effects would wear off and you would have to re-apply the cream to reproduce the effects. With Strivectin sd I wake up in the morning and look at my face and see that the wrinkles around my eyes are Still less visible.
  I don't kid myself that this will 'erase' my wrinkles, and I know I'll have to keep buying it. But I have no problem doing so, especially if Amazon keeps selling it at a discount ; )
  One thing I would like to say about a few reviews that I read. In one review I read that the user had developed small white bumps (milia) with the use of this product and another said that it caused Acne. This stuff is very concentrated so you only need a little bit. The first two weeks of use I noticed that I was getting some acne (I never do) and so immediately started to up my exfoliating routine and started using a smaller amount of the product on my face. I don't buy facial exfoliaters with soap or cleansers in them. I make my own and it seems to work very well. I use; Fine sea salt, Honey and a sprinkle of finely ground nutmeg. Of course you have to test this on your skin first to see how you react to it. I exfoliate before I put on the strivectin sd at night.
Hope this review helps!",4.0
"Works great as a moisturizer, but does cause whiteheads unless your skin is dry.  I believe the scent is added intentionally to act as an eye irritant, so they can sell you the scent ""free"" eye cream at a cost 10 times that of the face cream.  I did purchase both having used them for 3 months on my face and hands.  Disappointed that wrinkles have diminished only slightly.  Probably not worth the exorbitant cost.  Will not repurchase unless more pronounced improvement before the end of the tube.  PS, if it gets into your eyes overnight, prepare for a full day of bloodshot and irritated eyes.",4.0
"I have never seen such dramatic results from any skin cream.  I have been using Strivectin-SD for a little over 3 weeks now.  It is a pain to put it on 3 times a day, but the results are worth it.  It works, but you have to use it as directed.  3x a day for stretch marks.  I have been using it on large surgical scars and stretch marks.  My skin had been purple/pink/red with indented and lumpy spots.  The scars and stretch marks are so faded that they are hardly noticable anymore.  The lumpy spots are smoother, the color is normalized, and the thin skin inside the stretch marks looks healthier.  I had an area of darker skin around my waistline from being overweight.  At 2 weeks that yucky skin was gone!!!  Even the skin that was most devastated from my pregnancies looks rather normal now.  My husband is impressed.  The cream smells like essential oil of peppermint.  It feels very pleasant on my skin.  It is very concentrated so a little goes a long way.  I am using it 3x a day on my face, chest, belly, hips, and thighs and I still have about 2oz of my 6oz tube left.

UPDATE!!!: I STILL have some left so I decided to really go after my wrinkles with the stuff.  I see no results.  My stretch marks and scars still look great even though I no longer use Strivectin there.  But it's doing nothing for my face.  Go figure.",4.0
"Initially, my sister was using Stri-vectin.  The last few visits to see her, I would compliment her on her facial ""glow"".  I kept thinking she really looked great, refreshed, and younger.  She filled me in on her secret: StriVectin.  I'm not sure that I notice a HUGE difference yet...but I do think it ""plumps up"" my face a bit.  Which is what is needed at age 40.  :)

"I recieved this product as a gift for Christmas. I have two kids and I am 25 years old. I recently lost all of my baby weight (30 lbs) and I was lamenting over my stretch marks on my stomach and sides. The worst marks are on the front of my stomach. I began using the cream this christmas eve and have used it three times daily since. I have noticed a difference in the area where the marks were the worst. The not so bad marks have not faded much but the depth and color of the deepest stretch marks have almost evened out with the the rest of them. My husband and mother also noticed the difference. I also noticed the peppermint smell but it doesn't bother me at all. I will continue to use it and see what happens.

I would never expect it to completely get rid of my stretch marks, however. That would just be ridiculous.",4.0
"I purchased StriVectin-SD in a kit that contained the cream, the eye cream and the serum.  It was recommended by the skin care specialist at my local Sephora, when I asked for something to tighten my skin.  I really like the serum; I can actually see a difference.  I'm not talking ""Oh my stars I look 20 years younger"" different, but it really does diminish the look of lines around my eyes.

But what really amazed me....and this is true so help me....is that I've received a few compliments in the past couple of weeks about my skin!  I had dinner with some friends last week and one of them (a man) said ""Don't you ever age?  You look like you did 20 years ago.""  Then last night I attended a party, and an acquaintance who is about 25 years younger than I am said ""What do you do for your skin?  You look incredible.""  I attribute some of this to good make up (I use Bare Minerals), but I've used that for a couple of years and never got compliments like that before.

In the long run I believe Strivectin is the best buy and has the best results for the money. My skin is soft and supple and does look somewhat younger than my actual age. It also take a lot LESS product and lasts forever.

If you are younger I believe the results would be even more remarkable.",4.0

"All these beauty treatments work ok but honestly they won't tell you that Vasoline works as well as almost all of them and better than many of them and is almost free.  Just put a little on your face before bed, especially around your eyes, cheeks, forehead, lips and you will be surprised how much it erases crows feet, wrinkes, dry patches by morning.  Your lips will feel smooth and soft all the time too.  You'll expect to break out more, but I have been breaking out much less with almost no acne.  The vasoline is all absorbed by morning, after a couple weeks it almost looks like you had a mini face lift.  The effect only seems to last about a day so you need to do it every night.  I don't goop it on like a prize fighter, but it looks a little shiny when I am done.  And a whole jar costs $1.00.  You don't even need the name brand stuff.  I wouldn't do it during the day, you'll look greasy.  Just each night before you go to bed.  It is amazing.",4.0

They aren't gone completely, but pretty close to being gone.  I don't notice them anymore.  Then I started puting the StriVEctin on my face because it said that it helped with Acne scars.  I had really bad skin as a teenager and so I had some scars left on my cheeks and temples.  After rubbing the cream on for about a month, I noticed the scars were disappearing.  I've been using it for about 5 months now and my acne scars are completely gone!  HOORAY!  I love having smooth skin now.  I feel much more attractive and don't wear nearly as much makeup!

The only thing I don't quite like is the strong scent, it smells kind of pretty, but is very artificial.

"I am African-American with dark heavy wavy textured hair that is between Indian and coarse-smooth hair, so the smoother works really well on my hair. It allows me to air dry it with argan oil and silk serum . My daughter has curlier, coarser, naturally brownish-red hair that tends to be dry, brittle and subject to breaking easily. the smoother also works for her in that it adds moisture. She has to add other product to keep her hair soft and manageable, but our very different hair types respond to the smoother. My dtr uses coconut oil as a weekly conditioner and night-time conditioner before washing. If you expect the smoother to be the sole product and the cure-all for your needs, I think you will be disappointed. As with most products and with most people, you have to find the combination of products and methods that work for you.

"If you like rose, then you're going to love this scent. It's the closest I've found after trying many products to get that old rose scent. It's light enough that doesn't feel or stay greasy, but not extremely moisturizing either; so trade off there. Would do in the summer quite well, but winter requires something a little heavier than this for me. So I combine with a little jojoba for extra moisture and coverage to use less which accomplishes a couple of things: not only does the product last longer, but I can reduce the amount of chemicals I end up slathering on. I try to buy all natural usually, but the allure of something rose scented overrode the ""natural"" path this time. The product doesn't advertise to be as such so not a knock on it one bit, but I really wish this product was cruelty free.",4.0

"- Great smell. It actually smells like rose. However, if you are sensitive to smell, you may find it overpowering.
- Soft and thin texture. It's not thick, cream kind texture. If you like thick cream texture like body butter, you won't like it.
  When I was using it for the first time, I applied too much due to its texture.
  Since its texture is thin, I thought I have to apply a lot to make my skin moisturized but I was wrong.
  It immediately absorbed to skin and leave my skin soft w/o any greasiness and product so you can wear your clothes right after applying.
  Don't use it too much like I did. You will be stuck with the smell for a while.
- I had hard time to get the pump working. I thought the pump was broken but after trying it for a few time, I finally got the pump work.",4.0
Fragrance is heavenly for rose lovers. Dispenser not easy to use.,4.0
"This lotion really does smell like roses. I can't believe it, honestly. It reminds me so much of my grandparents's house. Their whole backyard used to be full of rose bushes, and their house smelled just like this.

The scent lasts a long time. It's a little strong for me, truthfully, but, then again, I have a really sensitive sense of smell.

The lotion isn't greasy at all. It provides light moisturizing.

I ended up putting this bottle of lotion in our downstairs bath, so that guests can use it. A few people have even commented on how much they like it.

This is my first time using Crabtree & Evelyn products, but I will definitely be on the lookout for others now.

"Although I do love the classic smell of dried roses, this lotion is rather strong when you first use it - almost overwhelmingly so.  If you are super sensitive to smells you will likely want to avoid this one.  Thankfully the scent does fade a great deal after a while although it doesn't completely go away for a long time.  As a moisturizer it works very well - it did a great job of soothing the itch on my legs caused by this dry winter air. On the hands it does feel a little bit greasy at first but does eventually rub in pretty good.  I was a little surprised when I received my bottle because it was frozen solid and bulging - I was amazed that the bottle hadn't cracked open and made a mess inside of the box. After several hours at room temp it was fine but if you're considering ordering depending on seasons where you live you may want to avoid ordering it in the winter.  There was some bubble wrap in the box with it but the bubble wrap wasn't wrapped tight around the lotion it was all kind of just rolling around inside the box.",4.0
"If you love the light, clean scent of roses, you will love this. The lotion consistency is perfect  not too thick and not too thin. It absorbs into the skin quickly without being sticky or too thick.

Like other Crabtree and Evelyn products, the floral scent is perfected to be both subtle and long lasting at the same time. This is excellent as a daily moisturizer but its not thick enough, in my opinion, to work well on really dry places like heels or elbows. But its good for everything else, especially hands.

This lotion actually made my dry winter hands look so much better.

Its a large bottle (with a pump) so it will last a good long time.

Recommend.",4.0
"This lotion has a very powdery rose scent which is really pretty.  I actually think more of old-fashioned talcum powder rather than roses when I smell it, but I still really like it.  The lotion is very nice and absorbs quickly.  I live in a climate that gets very dry sometimes and this is very soothing.  The bottle is so pretty and looks really nice on my vanity.",4.0
Delightful! This is a gently scented floral body lotion. It absorbs quickly when applied and massaged into the skin. My trouble spots are my lower arms (too much sun exposure) and my legs (which get very dry during winter). I've been a Crabtree & Evelyn buyer for many years and particularly like their hand and body lotions and creams. This moisture rich lotion left my skin soft and supple and smooth looking immediately upon application. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone needing dry skin relief.,4.0
"Very nice scent that lasts, not overpowering though.  Lightweight lotion sinks in quickly, non-greasy.  Very pleasant overall and a generous 16.9 ounce bottle with pump dispenser.  A nice way to treat yourself or would also make a nice gift.",4.0
nice fragrance.,4.0
"Love the smell. This is the first rose scented item I have ever found that actually smells like roses. It seems to moisturize well too.

My only concern is that it contains some harmful chemicals that, for this price, could be taken out. It has parabens which have been linked to breast cancer and a few more I prefer not to see on the products I use. I would buy a lot more of their stuff if they took the harmful chemicals out and ditched the animal testing thing. The smell is so nice that I bought it anyway.",4.0
"I recently purchased Crabtree & Evelyn Rosewater Body Lotion at a hospital gift shop in a smaller bottle, and was looking for a larger (and I admit it - cheaper) bottle of the same thing.  This isn't exactly the same product, but it smells wonderful, it feels wonderful and it is definitely an acceptable substitute.  It has a nice rose scent - not too heavy - and is a little lighter in weight than my original lotion.  It makes my skin feel soft and smell good, and I don't feel guilty about using it allover.  My Favorite Things did an excellent job of packing the bottles (I also purchased another scent) for shipping, and they shipped them quickly and communicated the shipping information promptly.  I would be happy to purchase from them in the future (I hope they'll still have this produvt).",4.0
"I feel my skin healthy, does not feel oily or dry. has spf 30 which helps when I am out in the sun.",4.0
"Though I like how my skin feels using this, and I like that it's SPF of 30, it will leave a shine to skin (not sure if I like that as much).",4.0
"Still like the idea of the combination compact and like how it goes on.  I do not carry this with me and use a ""poof"" style brush with it.  Be careful about dropping it though--the pressed powder just turns into dust.  Guessing it has less ""something"" (oil?) in it and it doesn't stick together as much.  No one intends to drop their compact on the counter but it does happen.  This one takes the hit really badly.",4.0
"This is really expensive for the amount you get, $17!  However, I just got the gel, and I can say I like the lotion/ balm a lot better.  Smells about the same, I get the feeling the balm smells more/better.",4.0
Product gets the job done and I have had no issues with it.  Scent is a little too sweet for my liking.,4.0
"I do like this, it really does help calm my skin, but the hair spray like packaging is weird to me. I prefer a spritzer much like the Caudalie bottle.",4.0
"I travel a lot for work and airplane air sucks the moisture out of me to the point where I feel like a mummy. Because I like La Roche-Posay's moisturizing cream, I thought I would try this. It felt nice. I also use it as a toner, a makeup setting spray, as well as a light mist on a tissue whenever the weather gets a little too hot.",4.0
"Very neutral, simple facial spray. It's ever so slightly moisturizing and calming so I use it right out of the shower before other skincare to calm winter tightness.  I do really like the sprayer which produces a very fine mist, and it has no scent at all.  My skin likes it - I have pretty sensitive combination skin prone to reactions.  There are other products I like better for the price, but this is nice.",4.0
Easy to use and scent free. Works great as a base to help my moisturizer products go farther with less.,4.0
"This Spring water is suitable for winter dry indoor environment, LOVE IT",4.0
"I bought this for my husband because he has very sensitive skin. Every time he shaves he would always get bumps all over his skin. He has tried different moisturizers, shavers, shaving cream, etc. and nothing help. A friend gave us a sample of this from her Ipsy bag and the first time he used it after shaving there was a huge difference. The bumps completely went away, and now he uses this daily.",4.0
"Pros:
- Suitable for everyone; since this is thermal water, it can even be used on babies
- Helps moisturizer soak in faster
- Leaves skin feeling refreshed and supple
- No scents or dyes
- One bottle lasted me through the winter

Cons:
- I can't really tell if this is doing anything - if I use this instead of my usual toner before moisturizing, does it add any benefit that I wouldn't already get with my toner?

This is a really confusing product to review. I like it, and it feels nice, but I can't determine if using it has any lasting effect on my skin or if it is really more of a refreshing spritzer for a hot day. This is why I can't recommend using it in place of your usual toner (however, I have to assume using this is better than using no toner at all as it still helps moisturizer soak in faster).

I can definitely see using this on an airplane, however, where the stale air is drying and you're likely to be tired. Also, an office setting would be appropriate as well.",4.0
I like it to soothe irritated skin,4.0
"Product was recommended by a friend to help with redness on the face and to calm down the skin. So far I have really enjoyed it. While I haven't found there to be anything super unique, it really feels nice to spray on the face and feels as if you gave a great boost of hydration to your skin. I see myself using this for dry skin, post makeup, sunburn, etc.",4.0
"I like this Thermal Spring Water spray. It makes my skin feel moist after washing. My skin is normally quite dry and this spray is a good way to put some moisture back without having to use a lotion that can feel heavy on my skin or clog my pores. It's a big bottle and has been lasting me a long time. The water is supposed to come out in a fine mist. Mine sprays some fine mist, but also many bigger drops that I have to dab off my face. It seems like kind of a waste and I prefer it have a fine mist all around for more even distribution of the product when I use it. Overall, I am happy with the results.",4.0
"I ordered this since I love other products by this brand.  I didn't realize it was JUST spring water; but it was. I admit I about died laughing when I saw that. However, oddly enough, it does wonders for the skin. It's like a very light moisturizer. It sprays on super fine, very refreshing after my shower, and I let it air dry (why would you pat it off like they suggest?!) I come out with very soft, fresh feeling skin that is lightly moisturized. Now I have very dry skin and usually use Shea butter, but I can get away with using this when I have less time to get ready. I just work on my makeup and teeth brushing and the like while it dries.  So yes, I went from complete skeptic to fan.

My only reason I took off a star is that it is quite expensive for, well, water.  Although I like it, it's really outrageous to be honest. I would look for something similar with a different brand.",4.0
Refreshing way to apply toner before moisturizer.  Waiting for it to dry 3 minutes just adds another step to the make up routine but if that does not bother you the product is fine. I leave a bottle in my guest bathroom for a cool down spritz for my lady friends who have their own personal summer. Keeping skin healthy and hydrated year round is a challenge and this spray seems to help.,4.0
Reminds me of Evian water spray. I'm not sure what it actually does for my skin except maybe refresh it during the day. I prefer Mychelle moisturizing toner or shu uemera toner.,4.0
"This is basically water in a spray can. I admit I was pretty dubious, but I LOVE the La Roche Posay brand, so was willing to give it a try. It's actually great! I use it both as a toner and to set my foundation. It makes my makeup blend into my skin a bit and gives me a glow-y look. I really like it!",4.0
"Yes, this is water.  But it's great water.  It sprays on lightly -- pure mist that doesn't cause runs and feels incredibly refreshing.  This may have as much to do with the spray mechanism as the water, but what works ... works.",4.0
"After a cleansing, spray the thermal spring water 8 to 12 inches from your face then leave on 2-3 minutes. Gently pat off excess spray without rubbing.

The spray is very soothing and refreshing for winter-dried skin. I think it would be even more pleasant in hot weather. It works like a toner before applying moisturizer or you can use it to set make-up.

The mineral characteristics are: bicocarbonite,calcium.siilicates,selenium,zinc,cuivre,

It is mild enough to be used on children.

"When I received the La Roche-Posay Thermal Spring Water, the bottle was a little dented but still works fine.
The mist is fine and I just use it before I put on moisturizer in the morning or at night.
I don't really feel any soothing effect to be honest.  To me it is just spring water and I just use it to add moisture.",4.0
Nice product. It refresh well my skin.,4.0
"As a skincare product this is a quality and versatile solution (product of France). The best way to use this is as one step in your skin care routine where you first wash your face, second - apply this spray, third - serum/moisturize. As a second step this product delivers nourishing hydration in the form of a naturally antioxidant thermal spring water. The serum step that follows is how you go about locking in this fine source of moisture to keep your skin looking its best.

The other way to use this product is as a mid-day (or night time) pick me upper. You know that feeling you get when you splash some water on your face to freshen up or shake the cobwebs off? This spray provides a similar sensation amped up two or three notches higher. The spray is gentle enough that there's no irritation on your eyes (although I do initially spray with my eyes closed) and I let the fine mist simply air dry off my skin which provides a healthy, natural and rejuvenated finish a few minutes later. The tender and delicate results makes this one worth trying out particularly if you've been using harsher toners up until now.",4.0
This is the final step of a cleansing routine.  I used it after cleansing with my regular system.  I found this spritz to be refreshing.  It felt good.  I then followed up with serum and moisturizer.  That is was more steps than I usually use so it will probably end up being a spritz during the day.,4.0
"I use this in place of my normal toner. It helps soothe and balance the ph of the skin without using harsh chemicals or ingredients like witch hazel or alcohol.

Its a thermal spring water thats safe enough for even the most sensitive of skin. It says to spray on, leave on for 3 minutes and then remove excess without rubbing but I found that it has evaporated away at the end of 3 minutes and no removal is necessary.",4.0
is smaller than I thought :(,4.0
"This works well as a face refresher.  It doesn't feel like a moisturizer but more a temporary lift for your skin, or moisture you moisturizer will help to seal in. I've been on the fence about whether this is a worthy buy or not.  I like the way it makes my skin feel but I'm not sure it does enough to make it a necessary part of my daily regimen.  I think it's best for a me me up for your face throughout the day and if you need that, it's a worthy buy,  There's really no smell and no chemicals to irritate your sensitive skin, both of which are very important to me.",4.0
"The La Roche-Posay Thermal Spring water feels so good.  It's a light mist that sprays out. It feels refreshing on your face. I use it throughout the day. I'm a parent with a toddler and a newborn, so a spritz is a quick pick me up.  I don't normally wear makeup around the house, so I don't have to worry about messing up my makeup.  It does feel much nicer sprayed on after you wash your face before you apply your moisturizer.",4.0
"I use this in the middle of the day typically after lunch. it is hard to re-apply moisturizer or make-up at work in the middle of the day. So I tried this spray.
It is really refreshing, goes on just like water mist, nothing else. A little fragrance maybe. Then it keeps your face moisturized for hours without messing up any make up.",4.0
"I'm not a huge fan of toners, but a spritz of this spring water is refreshing. It left my skin feeling fresher, cleaner, and actually better. It's a nice product that does not require an extraordinary effort but delivers an almost instant benefit.",4.0
"I quite like this thermal spring water. I tried it after washing my face in the shower. I sprayed it on and then let it sit for a minute and patted off the excess. After, I put on some moisturizer. I thought this helped make the important toner step more likely to happen because I liked how it made my skin feel.",4.0
"It seems so odd to purchase an aerosol can of thermal water, but I strangely enjoy this product.  After I washed my face I spray this on and then put my day lotion on.  It's just a fine mist spray, no scent, and I can't be completely sure but it does seem like my moisturizer is holding the moisture longer.  I enjoy the spritz to my face, a number of years ago I had a similar product.  When I use this on chilly days, it definitely gives me the chills, there's no good way to warm up the mist a bit.

My husband recently came home after working outside in the wind all day and had very dry, scaly skin.  I decided to try spraying the thermal spray on his dry skin and then putting lotion on over that.  We used Burt's Bees Shea butter lotion over the thermal spray.  By the evening, very surprisingly his skin was looking a lot less scaly, felt fairly soft, and wasn't cracking.  I didn't use a control....one arm without thermal spray, one arm with thermal spray.  But I was rather surprised.  I can't say how long this will last, I don't get spray happy, but there does some to be quite a bit of product.  Again this seems very strange to do, I can't speak to all the claims the company makes, but instead of using toner, I spritz my face, put on my moisturizer and it seems to really make my moisturizer more effective, I don't have a good explanation for this, but that does seem to be the case.",4.0
"I was skeptical, but this product really is fun to use and feels great on the skin.  The aerosol disperses a fine, light mist.  I also like how's it's just pure water with no fragrances or silicones other fillers like many other toners.  It's a small canister, and lightweight enough to conveniently carry with you in a tote bag.",4.0
It's water.  Elegantly packaged spray-on water.  Makes my face feel good.  But due to the Amazon Vine program I didn't have to pay $12.99 for 5.2 ounces of water.  Sure it has minerals but so does my tap water and I could even add some trace mineral concentrate to tap water and put it in a $3.00 reusable sprayer.,4.0

"This product had a positive rating on the Environmental Working Group's cosmetic data base.  That is why I had decided to try it.  The little spritz is nice and refreshing.  There is no oil or any other residue to be concerned with since this is water with a little perk. What's the perk?  It contains selenium which is an antioxidant, and an antioxidant protects cells from damage. Even if the amount of selenium is miniscule I feel much more comfortable using this product rather than any one of the many, many toxic laden cosmetics that are on the market. I rely on EWG, and since La Roche-posay Thermal Spring Water, 10.50 ounce rates highly then that means it is safe.  If you are looking for a moisturizer, this is not it. However, to give yourself a quick, refreshing ""spritz"", or to use right after you cleanse/wash your face this will do just fine.",4.0

"I've been using this hair fattener gel for about 2 months now. I can absolutely tell a difference when I use this product. I am a female with super fine, thinning hair, especially around the crown area. Is it a miracle worker? No, but it does make my hair look fuller. When I don't use this (and no product at all), my hair is very flat and lifeless. This gives it a nice plumping effect. I use it on towel dried hair and then blow dry my hair with a large round brush. My hair is shoulder length, and I use about a nickel/quarter size amount. The opening is rather big considering this gel is thin. Sometimes, I pour way more than I need. This is the first time I've used a TOPPIK product and I now plan to check out other products since this one works pretty well for me.",4.0
"My hair used to be thick and wavy. As I've aged, it's thinner and finer, so much so that a scrunchie or hair clip slips out.  I tried SO many products I can't even list them all.  Serums, mousses, beach sprays, etc.  I did have some success with Philip B's Maui Wowie spray, but then I tried this.

It's amazing. It's not like you suddenly have big hair, it just feels like the strands have a thickness to them but not weighed down at all.  I use it on towel dried hair before I style or air dry.  A little goes a long way so this will last for some time. It especially helps at the top of my scalp where I was seeing a lot of scalp and not enough hair. I'm not saying it grows hair, but just seems to fill in more.

"Now, I'm not going to go crazy and say that this product works miracles or anything. But it definitely does the job of making your hair look thicker. The product itself is pretty runny. Sort of like a John Freida serum, if you're familiar. Even though it is a thin product, you really don't need to use much to get the full effects.

I use about a nickel-sized amount of Toppik in my hair while it is still fairly damp. I make sure to get it evenly applied root to tip, and as soon as my hair has dried, you can definitely tell that it looks thicker.

That being said, if you're SEVERELY balding, I don't think this will do much for you. But if you're just starting to see thinner and thinner hair, this can help keep your scalp from showing for just a little bit longer!

On a side note, even though this product is only superficial and washes out completely, it seems like it takes a few days/applications in the beginning to start to notice thicker hair. Just an observation...",4.0

"I bought this fattener 2 months ago. I have been trying to decide if it really works or am I just hoping it does. Should I buy more, or forget about it. My hair is curly, not long. I have some thinning hair, especially at the crown of my head where it swirls.  On the product it says to use on wet or dry hair.
DRY: First I tried it after I finished drying my hair. I thouht it might be heavy and ruin my curls, so I let my curls form from drying first. But it made my hair dry and dull. I did not like the look or the feel.
WET: I tried it when my hair was wet, in just the area of my crown, twisting it a bit. I wasn't sure it really made a difference. One day I'd use it, the next not. I felt the crown area was always a bit dry and coarser when I used it. Not thicker or curlier. It didn't seem that much better. Maybe some. Not what I wanted.
WHAT WORKED FOR ME: I wanted to retain my curls, but that they look thicker. I was ready to decide it doesn't really work. Then I though I'd give it a try with my hair not wet, but not quite fully dry. I dried my hair as usual, but stopped before it was fully dry. Then I put some Fattener on my fingers, rubbed my hands together and fluffed up my curls. I found it worked! My hair looks thicker, and it is still soft and curly. Also,(as a note) my hands did not feel greasy or oily after the application. I guess if you buy it, you really have to try it different ways. I see from other reviews, that it seems to work for some people and not for others. I took off 1 star because it took me so long to find the right method for me.",4.0
"I have been using this Toppik hair fattener for 5 weeks now. The result started to show at 4 weeks after daily rubbing of the bold area on my head. I am very pleased with the result because I see significant new hair growth in am area where I didn't have hair. However, this is not an overnight miraculous remedie for thinning hair: You have to be patient and use it continuously for a few weeks before you start seeing significant change. It is definetly working for me and I do not need to hide my scalp anymore (PS: I used to use a hair thickenner spray, by Jerome Russul, to spray on my hair so my scalp doesn't show through .. Now I no more need it because I have new growing hair).",4.0

"I have been using Jane Iredale blush for many years. The product appears to be the same, but I hate the new compact. The addition of the little mirror is nice, but the fake metal from which the compact is constructed feels very flimsy and cheap in my hands. I do not like the new latch either.",4.0
I love Jane Iredale products. I purchase them again and again. No other products like them on the market as far as I am concerned. I want nothing else.,4.0
Nice and light foundation,4.0
"This  cotton candy color , is kinda light , for my light to medium , olive type skin . it shows , but not much , I like blush alot , so this is mild . I like a darker and more sparkle , mineral blush I use better , but this is nice blush . I choose too light , but can't seem to see a sparkley one that is fairly ""colorful""!  oh well . love Janes quality.",4.0
"I like it, it's a pretty color. It's a very soft pressed powder, so the bristles in my blush brush really picks up a lot of the makeup, I have wasted a lot of the blush because I have to tap some of it off my brush before I apply it to my face. I don't want to look like a 9th street hooker with too much rouge on her face. Other then that, it's good.",4.0
like it but the cover broke and i am careful with it.  it mainly remained in house drawer (not tossed around in a purse) so am disappointed the plastic top broke off at its hinge.,4.0
This is nice blush but way too expensive. Will not get again.,4.0
"Great product for a good price! Package of item for delivery was flimsy, and I was surprised it did not damage product during shipment.",4.0
"This is a nice product that applies easily. The subtle color can be applied lightly for a touch of blush, or layered for a less subtle effect. It isn't dramatically different than other pressed powder blushes, but I will purchase again because I believe this product line is best for my skin.",4.0
"This is a pretty color and I like this blush.  I am not obsessed with it and I've tried other formulas from natural cosmetic brands that were less expensive.  So yea, I like this blush but probably would not repurchase if I ever use it up.",4.0

Been using for a while and very happy with the results,4.0
"This is great for the face.  It's mostly absorbed and, while it does not leave the face feeling too - too greasy, beware that it does leave it shiny.  I usually dust my face with powder after applying, but then there's no oily feeling or greasiness.  The best part is that there is no sunblock odor!",4.0
This would be perfect if I knew what octinoxate was and if it were matte. No white cast!,4.0
"Absorbs quickly w/o leaving a white coating or greasiness. Not heavily scented. Bottom line is that both my husband and I like using it. If I give it time to dry first, it will layer well under makeup.",4.0
I like how it feels on my skin and I am not breaking out.,4.0
Very nice product and excellent protection. A bit on the pricey side.,4.0
Works well.  a little slow to absorb.,4.0
"I have rosacea and combination skin (oily t-zone and dry-to-normal on the cheeks), and this is a great sunscreen.  It doesn't add oil to any of my oily skin areas and doesn't dry out the drier areas of my face.  It is a powerful sunscreen and can have a white-cast look to it at first but absorbs in pretty quickly.  You don't need that much on your face, so it's been lasting me a while.  I live in hot, humid San Antonio, TX...powerfully sunny days year-round!  I've worn it working out, to work, on lazier weekends in the sun, etc.  I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't so expensive, but the 3.5-oz. tube really does seem to last a while.

There's a less expensive Blue Lizard sunscreen on the market that I may try to compare when this tube is finished.",4.0
Works very well and feels good on the skin.  Very good brand. I purchased because someone recommend it to me.,4.0

"I love this size curling iron, and hot tools is the only kind I can find in 2"". It gives me the smoothing of a straightener without the flattening of a straightener if I use it just to turn the ends under. If I wrap my hair, it gives me the fullness of a blowout without looking curled like smaller irons would. My only complaint would be that the spring in the clamp wears out after a while and doesn't hold my hair as securely. It's also my second one to own because the first one just died after about 2 years. It just wouldn't heat up at all. But I like it so much I bought another one, and no one else makes one this diameter.",4.0
"I wasn't sure I liked this at first, but it works for me now. I have curly frizzy hair. First, I flat iron a little bit to calm down my hair, then I use the Curling Tool to straighten with a curl at the ends. It works. The only think I do NOT like about this product is it does not have an automatic shut off. Big mistake. Maybe they will fix it for the next prototype.",4.0
great for long hair when you want soft curls,4.0
"My wife's favorite. It  could be a little more durable where the cable enters the handle, but that ""par for the course"" with most beauty tools",4.0
I do like it.  The only thing is the barrel is heavy so the top part tends to touch the table (not good when hot) so I added a small crystal to the base handle to keep the barrel away from the table. I like that it has different heat settings and it is super easy to turn on and off.,4.0
Only place I could find this.....LOVE IT.,4.0
"I really like how this curling iron works and adds body without too much curl. However, it will not stand up in tilt mode as it should. It falls over on my counter top and I have to keep something under it to keep it from burning my sinktop. It burned a hole in a heavy towel I had under it after only 30 seconds. It has a nice long cord and a sturdy weight. If not for the concern of burning my sink top I would give it a five.",4.0
"I wish the barrel was longer. Anyone who is going to curl their hair that big will most likely have long hair. Need more room on the barrel. Other than that, I like it",4.0
The wife likes it so no complaints,4.0
would work better with really long hair. my hair is medium length and it did not curl my hair it straightened it,4.0
"Great curling iron -- I just bought a second to take to the gym.  Only when it arrived did I realize that it does not come with a plastic covering for the iron that you can put over the barrel after you are finished using it.  All of my less expensive curling irons have this.  So.......what do I do after using at the gym?  Sit there for 15-20 minutes while it cools off?  I can't exactly toss in my gym bag as-is.  Ummmm....me thinks this is not too much to ask for when purchasing a $40 curling iron.  Wish there were other 2"" choices out there as I feel a bit shortchanged.  Have been buying this brand because Conair and others are not making 2"" anymore.",4.0
"a little to big for the length of my hair, doesn't curl well, not because of the product, but because of the size.  I will use it for the ends of my hair.",4.0
"I bought this after my hair stylist used it on my hair, and I liked the large loose curls it made, but for the life of me, I couldn't get this iron to curl my hair at all. It looked as if i was using an iron that hadn't heated up yet even though I put it on high and let it sit a while before using. I haven't given up on it yet though. One thing I don't like about this iron is the placement of the temperature dial. It's very easy to accidentally change the temperature while using it",4.0
Spring wore out quickly. Very hard to put new spring in.,4.0
Item was okay.,4.0
"It didn't hold a good curl for me, but my aunt loved it! She has thinner hair and it gave her great volume.",4.0
I like this thing though I don't use it as often as I'd like to. I know it's cause I work out a lot and I stay busy. I don't like the clip though cause it catches my hair. You have the option to remove it but I don't have the balls to do it,4.0
I purchased this curling iron about a year ago.  I really like it but it's stopped working.  More than disappointed with this.  I will buy another one but am hoping the next one lasts longer than one year.,4.0
"This size curling iron is not easy to find (2""). I wanted something that my hair would glide through. This was it. It doesn't tug at your hair. This came with two extra clips which is a big bonus because those clips don't last. I'm happy.",4.0
"This is a wonderful tool!  The extra-large barrel gives the kind of body and volume I need for my hairstyle.  You have to be careful because it gets very hot and can be a little awkward for its size; however, if you use it correctly, it can be a wonderful tool.  My first one lasted a couple years, and I've tried other curling irons...only to go back to this one because it works the best.  Highly recommended.",4.0
Good iron. I am very happy with it for the price. Does a good job of straightening my hair too so I don't need both appliances.,4.0
"It is a good quality curling Iron, I bought it to try the size and it creates beautiful waves! but beware to put in some hold spray. Depending on how good your hair holds a curl these 2"" barrel curls may lose its curl with just the windows down in a car ride. Love the product get use to the weight and  how to maneuver it to not burn your self~",4.0
I actually wish I had bought a slightly smaller size. The barrel is so big that the curls turn out hardly being curls or even waves. Otherwise it worked well and did not burn my hair (I do use it on the lowest setting).,4.0
Alright.,4.0
"I didn't realize how big this was going to be, so I had to send it back for a smaller one.  I didn't even take it out of the package.  This is definitely one for longer hair, not shoulder length.  So I got a 1 1/2 inch one instead.",4.0
"2 inches didn't seem like much, but this thing is huge. Makes huge curls. Gets very hot. I can't give it 5 stars until I can find a way to make the curls last longer then 30min. My hair still looks great, but I really want the curl!",4.0
"This is more of a smoothing iron than a curling iron. It will turn the ends under, but if you are wanting curls you should go with the 1 1/2 inch.",4.0
"Nice curling iron, it is huge, and ended up being too big of a barrel for our hair.",4.0
"Good Iron, definitely NOT for curling. I have medium length wavy frizzy hair. This iron straightens it out adding volume and shine with a nice natural look. Definitely works if thats the look you're going for.",4.0
"I like this but the 2"" barrel is too big for my hair even at the warmest setting.  Going to exchange for the 1.5"" barrel.",4.0
"Very big curls! I just got this today and tried it out right away.  My hair is a shoulder length cut and this might be a little too big a curl for my length of hair.  I definitely like the curl it gave, but I'm thinking it would work better and give big beautiful waves to a longer length haircut.  I'm going to try it again with more patience and a good hairspray.  I have this same brand in a 1 inch iron that works great for my hair but i was thinking the 2 inch would give me bigger waves as apposed to curls, which this did but again my hair is short so it's just one nice wave.  Still it's a good curling iron, I like this brand, it heats up quickly and works well with a good hairspray.",4.0
Love this iron - adds smooth volume and shine. The spring broke after 4 yrs of use so ordering a new one. Not a bad lifespan for a big iron like this one.,4.0
Nice big curling iron!  Heats quickly and does what's expected.,4.0
"It got here quickly, but it was a little bent off the rod. Still works fantastic.",4.0
"I LOVE, Love, luv this iron! When I received this iron I realized I ordered 1/2"" bigger than my old iron and I wasn't sure if it would give the curls I want. But this iron gives the perfect waves and because the barrel is big it doesn't take as long to curl my entire head of hair. It also makes my hair look sleek and smooth.

A couple of drawbacks though is that it causes major split ends and I got burned a couple of times. I apply my make up while curling my hair so I did get burned by the clamp/thumb part which is not entirely covered with the rubber. I solved that problem by not applying make up on while I curl the front. I also try not to include the ends when I curl my hair to avoid split ends but I have layers so the ends are getting the full on heat. I do apply heat protection product and condition my hair extensively but the split ends are still there. I spend about 20 min every two weeks trimming the split ends.  Take note when I first used this I kept the temperature low and as my hair got used to the temperature I raised the temperature slowly. One time I did 430 degrees and my hair was so hot it almost burned my finers so I lowered the temp. I think if one is not careful they might have a scene out of Little Women when Jo accidentally burned off Meg's hair. So watch the temp.",4.0

"Because picking the right size barrel is extremely hard, I want to share a picture to show the result of using a 2 inch curling iron. As you can see, you get a blow dry effect with very loose curls at the end. The gold plate makes hair shinny and smooth, but it sort of weighs hair down just a bit more than the ceramic barrels.",4.0
I've had this curling iron for a couple years now and it still works like a charm! I like having the feature of being able to adjust the heating setting.  My biggest complaint is that it now squeeks when I life the curling lever piece which probably annoys the people around me more than it annoys myself. I like to use this curling iron at my roots to give my hair some extra volume.,4.0
Heats up quickly and gets to a high enough heat to style hair quickly.,4.0
"If you want big loose waves or just a slight bend this is for you! The length and thickness of your hair as well as the technique you use will determine the type of curl/wave that results. I liked this product as it has a variety of temperatures and seems to heat evenly; I had been using a 1""inch barrel on my long hair and the results were a little too curly for my liking. I personally do not use the clamp; rather wrap the hair around the barrel like a wand; I will probably unscrew the clamp altogether as it just gets in my way.  Since the barrel is so large it is a little clunky/awkward to use at first but for me it is well worth the results! Lastly, as with most curling iron's barrel, long hair would benefit from a longer length barrel to more effectively curl the hair.",4.0
"This curling iron works great. It has adjustable heat settings. I have long straight, layered, fine but fairly thick blonde hair. I did not want curls but just body and this works perfectly for me. The only thing I don't like is that the on indicator light is on the side, (not visible), I left it on and it does not have an auto shut off feature. Overall, I'm very satisfied.",4.0
"as a professional i have used this every tool every week now for a year and its still working well. i like the adjustable temperature and it heats up quickly within a couppla minutes, i would buy it again.
it should come with a marcel handle, as the spring clip and rubber top is for amateurs.",4.0
"Was undecided to buy the 1&1/2 or the 2 "" one. Went with this one. Professional. Leaves hair with shine. Pair it with certain hair serums for minimun hair damage. Save space for it b/c it is bulky and big but lives up to the hype. Recommendable!",4.0
"The only reason I gave this four and not five stars is that I bought the wrong size. I bought the 2"", hoping that it would have been smaller, but I misjudged it and realised it was too big!!! It is still in the box, untouched, with the packaging still intact. Based on the reviews, I know it's a good curling iron but I didn't use it because it is too big :( Is there anyone out there who wants to purchase this? Please see photo attached. I can be contacted via my e-mail at kim_deza@hotmail.com. Thanks.",4.0
"Bought as a gift, came as advertised and great quality product. Had to return for a smaller size but no issues with that either.",4.0
"This is a great curling iron...I went for it because of the 2"" barrel and it is very professional with different heat settings a hanging hook and a stand to sit on counter if no hook to hang on.  I totally burned my forehead right in the beginning when doing my bangs, but that was my inexperience with the large barrel....so be careful!  I did not like the smaller curling barrels and enjoy the lose curls that can be constructed with this iron.  Would totally recommend to others. Great price and great iron!",4.0
great to give hair texture and waves.,4.0
"I bought this and the barrel is too large. But of the little time that I used it, it worked well.",4.0
"I really love this iron, I have long straight hair and this adds the perfect ""flip"" to the ends. A lot of reviewers complain that this iron does not hold a curl, well that's because it is 2""! If you want it to hold you need to use hairspray and probably a lot of it! I purchased this knowing the curls were not going to stay and instead I use it to smooth from root to almost the tip and then to add a little flip to the end - no hairspray needed and the flip stays all day.  I still cannot master the blowout so I use this instead - it's perfect! I took a star away because the clamp is extremely tight!",4.0
Loved this but 2inches is just too big. Wish there was a 1.75 inch!,4.0
"Yeah, this baby gets HOT!!!! I have long, thick, wavy hair. This curling iron does not ""curl"" my hair, but rather straightens it very nicely. I prefer this over a flat iron.  I don't use it often, but when I do, I can straighten all of my long locks with 2-4 segments. Meaning, I can part all of my hair into three or four sections, use the curling iron for each section and hold for about 10-15 seconds. Voila! My wavy hair is straight in an instant with a little curl at the end for a finished look!",4.0
"Gift for daughter, she loves it",4.0

"I have very thick hair, and I had to turn it all the way to high and then separate my hair into tiny sections to get any curl/body. It really did not give my hair the curl I was looking for, but did provide a nice body. If you are looking for loose curls look elsewhere. If you want body this is a great tool.",4.0
"Great for long and very long hair. The 2"" barrel is HUGE and if you don't have hair that's at least 4 inches past your shoulder, this probably isn't a great choice for you. The difference between a 1.25"" to 1.5"" iron isn't huge, but the jump to 2"" is drastic. This 2"" iron is more for creating a bit of volume, to mimick a professional blowout. It won't really work well to create waves. If you're looking for a took to make beach waves, I'd suggest a 1.25"" or 1.5"" iron instead.",4.0
I have curly and coarse long hair. I use this iron for when I want big volume and waves. I lost my first one so had to get a new one. Love it!!,4.0
Great curling iron. Unfortunately it was too big for I needed it for. Glad seller was flexible and let me return it!,4.0
"I get a lot of compliments on my hair when I use this. My hair is just below my shoulders and is naturally curly. Using this iron doesn't curl my hair, but smooths it, adds even volume from root to end. My hair not holding the curl is not this irons fault. My hair never does unless I do pin curls. Upon moving to TX my hair has been even more disagreeable and this iron fights those battles for me.",4.0

"It works well as far as the quality and easy use of it. However, on my hair it didn't do much of a curly wave to it like I thought it would. I have really long black straight hair down to my waist, and I feel that I'm better off using a smaller barrel rather than 2 inches. 2 inches didn't do anything to my hair...barely a wave to it.",4.0
"I've only used it once, but in that one time, I like it.  The barrel is very smooth but the handle is sufficiently small and ""grippy"" enough to make the tool very simple and easy to operate.  The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because it has a manual sliding on/off switch.  I prefer the push-button styles more; I guess because I'm more convinced they will automatically shut off in case of emergency that a manual functioning device.  I'm very impressed with the weight of the tool, though.  For such a large barrel, it is surprisingly easy to maneuver.  I hope this doesn't mean that it is constructed with sub-par components.  I have a concern about the spring mechanism ... as it shipped with TWO replacement springs.  This makes me wary of the long-term use.  We shall see!  I will update.",4.0
"A 2-inch barrel curling iron WILL NOT CURL your hair, so be warned.  It will smooth your hair and give it a nice bend at the ends as though you've blown it out with a round brush.  A fine buy.",4.0

"This curling iron is amazing. The Hot Tools brand was recommended by my hairstylist; I can't believe it took me this many years to discover the magic of a large barrel curling iron for my layered medium-length hair. This iron heats up extremely fast and allows me to get great results quickly. I would love to give it five stars, but I am giving only 4 for two reasons: 1) it is not dual voltage (while many cheaper brands are) - so I can't use it when on travel outside the US to 220V countries, and 2) it does not have automatic shut-off, again, a feature found on many cheaper, lower quality irons. If those features were included, I would give this a 10.",4.0
"And I don't mean arms and abs. This magic wand will keep eyes on your face with its ability to amplify the ""body"" in your hair!",4.0
I am pleased with this curling iron EXCEPT for the cord - why can't these appliance manufactuers use a non-tangling cord???  It is extremely annoying to constantly be untangling it.,4.0

I don't have long hair so I wasn't looking to make curls but noticed that my hair dresser uses a 2"" brush when she styles my hair.

I keep it on the lowest setting and it heats up quickly but I can imagine burning my fine hair off if I wasn't careful with the setting.",4.0
"I have the 1 and 1/2"" and thought it was great, but my stylist used this one when he styled my hair and I was amazed!  I instantly ordered it when I got home.  I am very happy.  The only downside is that I do not feel that the spring holds as tight as the smaller one.  I will have to look at that and see if I can adjust it.  Otherwise...This is great for big curls or to straighten and take out frizz. I love Hot Tools Appliances!!!",4.0
"The first few uses , I wanted to send it back because it wasn't even getting hot. But after a while I got it to work and I like that it doesn't have a timer but it doesn't glide through my hair easily like my conair on but I do love the size",4.0
this 2 inch does not really curl or even wave long hair... it just gives it a nice polished look that is curled in at the ends.,4.0

"I am a retired cosmetologist and recently my Pro Star curling iron died a good death after nearly 20 years of service. Unfortunately, Pro Star no longer makes the 1.5 inch size, so I ordered the Hot Tools. I am pleased with this tool. My hair is long and all I want to do is tame friz (dratted grays). The surface works as advertised, hair moves over the surface smoothly. My hair is rather thick and the adjustable heat setting is a plus. However, I would not advise going full tilt until you know how your hair responds to the heat and tension. I have had this product for a month and have used it several times.

"Great product. It feels little heavy, therefore a bit awkward at first, but it doesn't take long to get used to it.",4.0
"This is a great ""curling"" iron even though it doesn't really curl. I wanted something bigger so I wouldn't end up with such curly/wavy hair with my smaller one. This 2 inch iron does not curl hair but it does create a smooth, full bodied look with little waves/curls at the bottom. I love it because it looks like I just got a salon blowout with just using this curling iron. If you want something to create ringlets, this isn't for you. If you like the just blown out smooth salon look, this is for you!",4.0
"I really like this curling iron, especially that the adjustments can't be changed while you are using it like many others I have purchased!  Easy to handle , not too heavy for the size of the barrel.

"I have medium long, thick curly/wavy hair. I bought this for voluminous waves. That's not what it works for (at least for my hair). However, it's awesome. I dry my hair normally, apply heat protectant, then I use it to straight my hair. Just curl each section normally, pin it and spray. When it all cools off, let it down. It's beautiful.",4.0
Bought this because i wanted big curls. Doesn't really work unless you have really long hair to be honest. Mine is medium length and it just kind of gave me a little undercurl at the bottom and made my hair seem a little more voluminous. I'm sure this sized barrel works better if you have longer hair!,4.0

"When my BedHead curling iron I've been using for the past several years finally died on me, I went searching for a new one. I had been using and iron with a 1.5 inch barrel, mostly for curling the ends of my hair in. I have thick hair, that I tend to let get very long before finally cutting it. I'm usually looking to just curl the hair under for a finished look and to add volume, rather than using an iron to make actual curls in my hair. I ordered this 2 inch barrel Hot Tools iron to see how it would work for how I style my hair, and I found I really like it. It gives my hair the look of sweeping inward, without a stark contrast to the top part of my hair that the iron isn't curling. I love how much volume I get when using this iron on all my hairs layers separately, and I especially like how it works to give my hair direction, more than curls.

The power cord doesn't tangle and the temperature controls are small and out of the way. I appreciate that Hot Tools has constructed this iron by separately screwing in thumb clamp, and not just using the little metal stand to hold it in. I'h had irons in the past, where the little metal stand you use to prop up the iron is actually what holds the thumb clamp to the iron itself. So if something happens and the little stand gets knocked off, the whole iron falls apart. Not so with this Hot Tools curling iron. The metal stand is attached to the thumb clamp, but there are separate screws in it that actually hold the whole iron together. So that means even if the metal stand that holds the iron up from burning your bathroom sink was to come off, the iron will still work and stay together. And actually, it's easy to take the stand off and put it back on if need be.

The only thing I would change about this is even with the setting on the highest, it doesn't feel like it it's getting quite as hot as other irons I've used. So while I find it works great on freshly washed and dried hair, if I take my shower the night before and try and style my hair with it the next morning instead, my hair doesn't come out as well. The iron doesn't get quite hot enough to smooth out the results of bed-head hair. If it would just get a little hotter, it would be perfect!",4.0
"Arrived really quickly without paying for special delivery. Larger than I imagined but as I use it to straighten my hair it worked out great. Even came with a couple extra hinge springs (added bonus).

I use this tool for straightening my hair as I don't have the patience for flat irons to heat up - my hair is very thick and course. I have yet to find a flat iron that works well enough for my taste. Am old school; actually used to utilize an actual iron to get it done! LOL!",4.0
This thing is huge. I love the heat settings on this . For people with thick hair I feel it works really well.,4.0
"I just got mine today and is perfect love it ..i have layers so this was perfect for straight hair. This is better then blow drying your hair and faster, it dose not give you curls is more for a straight hair look. If you want curly hair, this one is not the right one for you, try getting a smaller one. My hair looks like i just got out of the hair salon... Oh one last thing it heats quick too and medium heat is great it does it's work.",4.0
"I recently started to travel more with my job than I did in the past.  I needed to cut down on the amount that I pack!  This was one place I was able to do it. This is not only good as a curling iron, when you use it, you don't need a straightner either!  As far as heat goes, this thing packs it!  This makes natural looking curls and if your hair is shorter, it will just curl it under.  I highly recommend this to anyone!",4.0
"I needed a replacement curling iron for my medium-long thick hair and I thought this was the same size as the one I was replacing...needless to say I about fainted when I opened the box!  It's huge!  I thought about sending it back and thought..-my fault I didn't order the appropriate size (should have been 1 inch) To my surprise, I spend less time with the bigger cylinder!  Only drawback is I keep burning my forehead because I'm not used to the huge size!  Now I use two irons...one for my bangs and this one for my long hair!  Still spend less time though!  I recommend it highly!  I turn it on and leave the room to finish up my routine in the bathroom, not more than 2-3 min and I come back and its heated perfectly!  I like the switch on/off button.  It's more user friendly than my smaller one... The weight of it is barely noticeable for the size being so much bigger..Just keep in mind if you are moving up in size it will require adjustments on your part.",4.0
"great product- controls my thick, wavy hair faster than any other styling method...and i'm a hairdresser so i have many tools",4.0
"I had revived this as 4 star because it does work great. I have long thick black hair. I love it!!! The only reason it is not five stars is for the fact the company had to send me a new one, becaue it was not packaged right. They did infact send me a new one with a pre paid lable also.",4.0
"I bought this Curling Iron to smooth out my long, thick, wavy hair.  I like the enormous size, but the spring is TOO TIGHT to create a ""smooth out"" fashion for straightening.  I use Straight Smooth & Sexty smoothing spray and even with that, the iron would not easily smooth through the 1"" sections of my hair. Watch the area's behind your ears & neckline...you will get burned due to the size of the barrel. It is a very good product and the tight spring would be great for someone with thin hair, but if the texture of your hair is as mine, get ready for alot pulling & snagging.  The product itself is great and I recommend.",4.0
"This is a very nice curling iron for any hair type. The only con to the product is the handle is a little smaller than they used to be made
 (I would have given it a 5 star rating if the handle was larger). It is still a nice product and I use mine everyday. You can do a quick large curl or a straighter look with the tips of your hair curled under or up.",4.0
Little bigger than I thought but works great. My hair was smooth and full of body after using this. Not so good on the bangs because its just to big. But would recomend this product for anyone woth longer hair. My hair felt like like a million bucks!,4.0

"Very pleased! Super fast shipping! I ordered this item on the Monday (Sept 22nd) and I received it that Thursday (Sept 23rd)! This is an awesome curling iron!

Overall, this was a great buy for the price!""",4.0
"A little larger than I expected, but it works great as a straightener and adds wave.  It tames my hair when my natural wave begins to take over.  Heats quickly and easy to handle.",4.0
"I love this product a lot and use it often, great grip, great constant temperature. However, I bought it to create soft big waves (think Victoria Secret angels) but it does more straight strands with half heart shape ends if you see what I mean. My hair is past the bra strap, so I thought I could curl it around and get soft waves but it does not curl the hair for that matter since the barrel is so big. Buy it you want to create a sleek look of straight hair with a bit of movement but definitely not if you want curls of any type.",4.0
"This item was suppose to arrive in 1 week, instead it took 14 days, plus the shipping is VERY expensive. $[...]. And there is NO contact info. So if you want to speak to someone there is NO number to call. You are better off ordering through [...]. as for the item.. its good for SHORT hair. NOT long hair (which I have) with short hair it will give you bounce, and that blow dry look. LONG hair it does nothing for.",4.0
"2inches is larger than you think! Make sure you don't just want a 1.5 inch iron before you order this. It is lovely, works very well, and can be used to wave or straighten. It is especially useful for my layers.

The thing is so big, though, that it is difficult to avoid it in the bathroom. I've already burned myself twice. Be careful!!",4.0

"For those of you following my reviews know that I am a fan of the aqua, citrus, and fresh scents.  Lacoste (Red) Style in Play is from that mold and I am a fan.  Of particular interest - I received this as a Christmas present - thanks Mom..!!  Obviously, there is some sentimental value in Style in Play...

I have four (4) other Lacoste fragrances, maybe more, and Style in Play is my favorite.  It opens with citrus and ""fresh"" notes and finishes with citrus, musk, and hints of ""woodsy"" notes.  It is definitely masculine and provides that ""freshly showered feeling"" - you guys know what I am talking about.  To reiterate, I like it and it is easy on the nose.

I have worn Style in Play once since Christmas.  While I have not received any ""formal"" (outside of Sweetie) compliments, it has potential.  The fragrance is that unique and appealing.  For those that like Versace Pour Home and Diesel, Only the Brave, you will enjoy this fragrance.  Style in Play has average, or slightly above average, projection/sillage with longevity of 6+ hours - a little longer on clothing (I like to spray a little on my business shirt sleeve around the cuff/wrist area).  As far as the occasion goes - I would feel comfortable wearing Style in Play during any season, time of day, or any event - great flexibility and/or versatility.

The packaging and bottle design are fantastic - definitely unique and one gets the impression Lacoste wants to compete with Ralph Lauren, Dior, Chanel, and other high end designers.  My only disappointment with the fragrance is the price/value.  Current deals has the larger bottle selling for about $50.00, which seems a little high given the fragrance has been around for a while.  Lucky Me - Mom hooked me up..!!

Final scoring for Style in Play is 4.4 stars out of 5.  If the price/value were better, perhaps my scoring would be higher.  Style in Play finishes just outside my Top 10.  Pick up your crazy heart and give it one more try...",4.0
Cleans the face nicely!,4.0
These pads are awesome. Ive been using them every night after I wash my face about a month now and my skin went from being bumpy with little white heads and dull to smooth and bright. I would give them 5 stars but the pads are quite small so I usually use two which sucks because of the price. They also at least for me tend to fold over on themselves while Im trying to smooth it across my face. All in all great product though and Im very happy with them.,4.0
Im 37 and this was my first intro to AHAs and my skin is definitely brighter after using these pads. I took one star away because my skin does purge after each use; I get micro comedones in the distribution of my usual breakouts. Hopefully this will eventually stop with continued use as my skin gets used to them.,4.0
Not for everyday. Maybe once a week. Very strong.,4.0
Had to switch to 10% because the 15% was burning my face.,4.0
This Product works well. My skin looks brighter and clearer. I saw some post stating that it damaging their skin or burning. It does tingle a bit especially if there is an open area but it is short lived. Just wanted to pass on a few tips. This product should not be used daily. Also should use moisturizer with SPF added as the sun exposure can irritate the skin while using this product (its even says so on the bottle). I usually use this product twice a week and no more than 3 times in a week. I do it at night and apply moisturizer after. In the morning I rinse and add my daytime moisturizer that has SPF.,4.0

"Use to use these religiously. Took a break from them for a little bit, and last night I used one, woke up this morning with tiny rash like red bumps all over my face. I do not have acne nor one zit on my face. So I panicked when I woke up. I washed of the residue from the pad immediately and put on a natural remedy salve to hopefully draw out and calm down the bumps before work this morning. Like other reviews have said, this can cause rash like bumps. It's harsh and not for inexperienced facial product users. Once your face gets use to it you'll love them, but that initial week or so, stay in hiding.. cause it's sometimes worse before it gets better.",4.0
"This is an excellent treatment for skin, makes it.looj younger and reduces lines. Seems to make it smoother too. Be warned, it is pretty harsh. When you first use it you might break out with tiny pimples but that's just your skin flushing out all the junk. They go away after about a week and then your beautiful new skin is revealed! I recommend using only 2 or 3 times per week. Daily use is too strong for me. I put it on before bed and after using it on my face apply it to the back of my hands and my elbows. Those 2 spots are dead giveaways for age!",4.0
Cleaned up my forehead that had been breaking out.,4.0
Great product,4.0
"I have used these wipes twice now (in 1 week) and you can definitely feel a burn/itching sensation once it dries. I assume this may mean that the product is working. I had to apply more lotion on my face to stop the ""stinging"" feeling. Not painful, just irritated. I would not recommend using these wipes more than 3 times/week. Too soon to know if they will make my skin brighter, and my pores smaller. Stay tuned.....",4.0
"I've been using 4%, 8%, and 10% in different products and haven't lightenened discoloured areas. So thought I take it up a few notches to 20%. Haven't been using long enough to notice any changes so I don't have an opinion.",4.0
I had issues with my adult skin. Never had issues as a teen. Now I have hormonal problems. Good product recommended by an aesthetician. Keeps my skin clear.

"I have combination skin type.  Usually oily on my T zone, and I do breakout occasionally on my chin & dark pigmentation on my cheeks.  This product does improve my skin texture and brighten up my skin (remove the dullness).  I do feel my skin smooth, soft & bright when I woke up.  But I cant tell if its fading my dark pigmentation or acne marks, its only my second pad from the container :-)  I do feel little burning/sting after I applied it on my face.",4.0
"Although I have rosacea, I do like to try and exfoliate my skin. An exfoliating sponge is not the best for my skin, so I opt for peel pads I can tolerate. There aren't many. I gave this one a try and will say within two uses I could see the improvement in my skin. It looked tighter and it was glowing more. Of course, it's glycolic acid, so rosacea or not, it's going to irritate your skin right after you use it. For the first few times I looked a little bit like a tomato for about 10 minutes. Once the redness calmed down, I could see that it cause no further irritation to my rosacea. In fact my cheeks, where I have it the worse, looked better. I did have to cut down on my usage to every couple of days, simply because my skin is just too sensitive to use it more. I also tried these on my arms to help with KP. That did not do much. I prefer Dr Gross Beta peels for that.
With consistent and careful use, this will give you good results. Just remember the sunblock!",4.0
"I honestly can't tell if this is helping or hurting my skin. I think it works well on my forehead and chin, but irritates my cheeks. I may try avoiding my cheeks for now and figuring out a new way to exfoliate them.",4.0

I will be using it every other night and will report back in one month.",4.0

This stuff works well for acne.  Expensive though.,4.0
I'm almost done with my jar of pads and I've definitely noticed marked improvement in my skin texture and elasticity. After using one of these pads my skin is sooooo soft. I love it. I took a star off because the pads are very thin and it's hard to get a upward sweeping motion without the pad rolling up on itself. Also there is acetone in these! I thought maybe not that much but it seriously smells like I'm putting nail polish remover on my skin. I really like the convenience of these but that acetone smell is just too much to be completely honest. I will finish the jar of these but might try something different in the future.,4.0
Really like it....sometimes hard to get past the few seconds of stinging pain. I would buy again.,4.0
I wanted to use this product for a couple of weeks before rating it and I am pleased with the results.  The 10% formula isn't too drying which was  my chief concern.  I use it 3 or 4 times per week and my skin appears smoother and pores smaller as well.  I plan to re-order.,4.0
"This product is the BEST!! I have sensitive skin, which has been scarred by acne. While I no longer breakout, I still have the unsightly scars. Well, I did, until I began using these pads once a day. They not only make your skin feel smooth as butter, they've managed to get rid of my dark marks far faster than using the expensive department store products.

Some people on here say that it's made their pores smaller. This hasn't been my experience. My pores aren't larger, they just aren't any smaller. Perhaps, I should start using the pads less? I have sensitive skin and over exfoliation can make your pores inflamed, which make them larger.

This treatment will burn a bit upon initial application after you've been using it for awhile. It's only temporary. If you don't feel as though you can handle the tingle, don't use the pads everyday.

***KEEP AWAY FROM YOUR EYES*** I read someone say that it made their wrinkles/fine lines fade... I rubbed a pad on my under eye area for 2 days and by the third, I had a NEW fold under my eyes! I'm in my twenties and only had 1 barely visible line before. I stopped using it under my eyes  and about 4 days later, my eye area was normal again. Glycolix Elite makes products for your eyes and if you're actually having wrinkle issues, I'd suggest those as this product is too strong to be used on your sensitive eye area... especially if you already have sensitive skin like moi.

Using these pads have given me so much confidence that I don't have to fret about slathering on concealer and foundation before being seen in public! They've also saving me the expense of going to the dermatologist to have laser treatments on my face and neck to remove those spots.

When I first started using the pads, I used them twice a day (mornings and nights) for about 5 days. Then, 2x a day was unbearable and I changed to only applying at night, before bed.

I deducted a star because this is my 3rd jar of these pads and I cannot seem to figure out a way to keep them from getting mold/mildew on the inner cap. They remain upright in a dry cabinet, yet the cardboard liner in the jar's lid soaks up the product on the pads. I tried to resolve this issue by cutting a piece of foil and inserting it in the cap, but that's when the mildew came. I had all of the ""treatment"" still in my pads, but a cap with mildew. Eww.",4.0
It appears to have assisted with the oils of my face therefore much less breakouts.  I only use it twice a week and immediately follow up with the Cape Fear Naturals Kojic Acid Cream to help with lightening my dark spots from breakouts and the sun.,4.0
"I've only used this for a week thus far and I think this is super effective. If you haven't used such a high percentage before, I would use every two to three days at first, then work your way up. I'm currently using this every other day currently. It does tingle/itch a little but I'm pretty sure that's the Glycolic acid working on your skin. I'll edit when I've used this for several weeks.",4.0
"I tried the both glycol 50% and Glycolix Elite Treatment Pads 20%. The Glycolix Elite was much better. One caution.

"I was using the Avon Anew retexturizing peel pads but they won't tell you how much glycolic acid is in them - even if you call them.  So I like using this because it says 20%.  I found another one that is 40% that I will try next, but you do need to work your way up - don't just start with the strong stuff.  They are thin pads, but they don't rip or anything - they work ok but they do roll up sometimes which is annoying.  I did like the thickness of the Anew Avon ones which didn't roll up.
I do the Visia complexion analysis and these made my texture score get way better.  Plus they probably are one of the reasons my wrinkle score is so good as well because I have been using glycolic acid for years - you should start when you are 21 and do it 3 times a week for ever - you can even go up under your eye area if you have tough skin, and I also use it on my neck.  I'm 34 and I look younger!  This is a product you need to use forever, not just one bottle",4.0
"I really liked this product and just bought it again. Yes, it is strong and creates some sensitivity, but it lightened by acne scars and hyperpigmentation. I noticed it definitely worked better on my acne scars than it did on my ""pregnancy mask"" ( the skin darkening that can happen during pregnancy), so that may be something to consider if you are looking for a product to lighten that.",4.0
"I've used glycolix pads in the past that immediately provided a tingle that assured you that it was working.  This smells minty, which is a little odd... but if it works, I'll keep using it.  Maybe I need something stronger than 10%?",4.0
"These are exactly what they say they are. You can get glycolic acid pads under a much more expensive brand, or you can buy these.  I use them once a week or so as part of a mini facial I give myself. When I'm done with my face, I wipe my upper arms and chest.  I've had bad keratosis pilaris for a while and it's gone down, which I think is thanks to these pads.",4.0
"The 20% tingles so I believe its a good strength for me. I use them every other day. Just in a few days my skin is softer and my even colored. I really like the pads, they don't say to rinse off, these ones act like you leave it in your skin from the directions.. Cleanse, use a toner, then these pads, then serum, and a hydrating sealer and your skin will transform. I am a believer in glycolic acid and 20% seems to be an ideal and I liked this...",4.0
"It did leave my face feeling very smooth and I believe helped with breakouts. Minimal improvement on pore size. I have sensitive skin but for the most part the ""burn"" wasn't that bad after I stopped the two a days. Did dry my skin out some.",4.0
"This is my first attempt  in trying glycolic acid treatment. So I tried on my heel which was needed a spa treatment, oh boy that stuff works wonderful in removing the stubborn dark spot and reduce the appearance of crack on my heels.

I like these facial peel pads.  They definitely are not as strong as getting a chemical peel at the dermatologist office or spa but they seem to work well.  I do not peel but I do think they are helping with exfoliation.  I just wish they came with instructions for use.  It does not say if you should rinse off.  I had to ask at the dermatologists office.,4.0
"This has been helping to keep my skin clear.  It doesn't really sting, but sometimes my skin itches a bit after I put it on.  I've read on other places that the pH is 4....I wish it was a bit lower....a pH around 3 would be more effective.  It still seems to work ok.",4.0
"I bought this product because I have enlarged pores and they drive me nuts.  I was hoping for a miracle, and sadly this isn't it.  My pores look cleaner, but not smaller.  HOWEVER, it does have a side effect - GREAT soft, smooth, pimple-free skin.  Seriously, my skin is baby-soft without using lotion.  It really is like a mini-facial peel.

Although other reviewers mention this, you really do have to be careful with over-use.  I use 1/2 a pad (for the purpose of prolonging the product for as long as possible) two times per week.  Any more than 2x a week, and I would break out and have terrible dryness/peeling.  I've also noticed that I'm much more sensitive to the sun (ie if I get a sunburn, it lasts forever).  You will have to figure out what amount works for your skin.

I highly recommend the product, and as I said, if you cut the pads in half (making 120 pads), one container will last over a full year, so the expense is fair.",4.0
I like it that's all I can say for now! Help fades my blemish away for the most part. So far so good I will say!,4.0

"I really liked this JOUER HYDRATING LIPSTICK in the color Whitney.  (Whitney is a very bright shade of light pink...something you might have seen in the sixties.)  Whitney works well with my skin tone (especially if I have a tan), so I really lucked out there.  JOUER HYDRATING LIPSTICK glides on smoothly, does not dry out my lips, and it stays where I put it - no color bleeding outside my lip line.  It has a very nice creamy texture, as opposed to the slippery, slick texture of a gloss.  The color has real staying power, and I do not need to reapply as often as I do with other brands.

JOUER HYDRATING LIPSTICK keeps my lips soft and supple while lasting all day long.  Works for me!",4.0
"For years I've been more of a gloss and balms kind of gal but lately I've really wanted to move toward more lipstick wear to look more polished and put together. But finding a lipstick that doesn't get dry and rub off within an hour is proving difficult. I live in a very dry climate so moisture is a must in any lip product. While Jouer Hydrating Lipstick wasn't very moisturizing it went on smooth, had a nice finish and didn't feel too dry or too goopy.

The color I received, however, left a lot to be desired. Whitney is a very blue toned Barbie pink. I've got skin that runs fair-to-light and has neutral undertones so it wasn't hideous but I did not care for it. It's very... Nicki Minaj. lol Just not my personal cup of tea. I would definitely try this again in a hue closer to what I like, perhaps Kate, Ava, or Lola.",4.0
"This is likely the most luxurious lipstick I have ever tried. I previously did not have a favored brand, I've used Loreal, Max Factor, Lancme, and Este Lauder with no real favor to a brand, just the color.  I've had such dry lips recently, Chapstick, EOS, and my other lipsticks just weren't working in the moisturizing category, let alone keeping any added color on my dry lips.  This does! And my lips feel silky and nourished, this particular color, Whitney is a bit more in the pink/white brightened pigments than I care for (very Spring like and probably better on a Lighter-Blonde, I'm a red head, so I , as I usual have to applied a much darker shade and blended a bit to make it a wearable color for me.  Honestly this lipstick feels wonderful on. I have just ordered a second, darker color, ""Sophia"" more my usual color.  I gave this four stars because the color came out quite a bit lighter than what was pictured here on Amazon, ""Whitney"" is a very pink shade.  Overall the lipstick itself is velvety smooth, holds color very well and feels wonderful on my lips.",4.0
"I like this color. It's a slightly cool, bright pink.  It is also very buildable.  The first swipe is pretty light, but you can get a really intense color.  It also lasts well.  On my best day, it lasted through the entirety of my work day, including a meal and a cup of coffee.  You can easily go four hours with minimal fading.

The one downside is that it's slightly patchy.  There's a tendency for the lipstick to pill as the day went on.  Not hard to fix, but not perfect either.

I'd be willing to try another color in this line based on Whitney's performance.",4.0
"This is a rich, moist traditional lipstick that will see you through the morning even if you have a cup of coffee or two. (Reapply after lunch.) I'm giving it four stars because it has a rather heavy feel, like Chapstick, but it also hydrates and protects your lips like Chapstick, so this may not be a bad thing.

There are dozens of colors; the names give no clue to the color, so you have to rely on your monitor to give you accurate color info. The brand website does have color descriptions, so you might want to pick your shade there (or at the make up counter) and come back here for your refills.

Nice packaging!",4.0
"This is a nice lipstick, but the color doesn't look at all nice with my skin shade.  My skin has been described as caramel with yellow undertones.  I tried the Whitney shade and found it looked very unattractive with my skin tone.

As for the lipstick itself, it has staying power and did not need refreshing during the day.  It's creamy, but did not feel particularly moisturizing.  However, it was comfortable and the overall finish was nice.  It looked high quality - just the wrong shade for me.

I would be interested in trying a different shade, but would probably supplement it with a little lip balm for moisturizing purposes.",4.0
"This is my third lip product from Jouer.

The case is elegant looking, and the shade Whitney, I have a medium complexion, not too light or too dark.  I love this shade, I find it very flattering.  A not too dark or too light shade of pink.  It also feels very moisturizing on my lips, Iam sure due to Brazil's Cupuacu Butter, and Vitamins A & E.  It is also paraben free.",4.0
"First the color:
Looks fuchsia in the tube but on my pigmented lips it has a Violet tinge. Nice bright shade for the summer
Finish: not glossy, not matte. A very nice natural finish
Color payoff: nice intensity with one swipe, two swipes gets you intense color
Formula: Lovely! Not drying, but wouldn't call this super moisturizing, very comfortable wear.l
Wear time: 4 hours with some fading
No scent and no flavor.

Overall a nice formula but $$ seems steep, so one star deducted.
If it was not for the price, I would definitely buy other colors.",4.0
"This is more of a rose pink..kind of like bazooka bubblegum when you first open the wrapper!  I prefer a darker shade but this looks  good on and for what it makes my lips feel like..it was worth ordering.  I don't think I've ever had a lipstick that I put on at 6am, drank coffee off and on and finally ate some late lunch...still can feel the protection on my lips.  They're soft and smooth and I haven't reapplied during the day.  I can't really notice that the color is still there but my lips feel ""coated"" and soft and smooth as I said.  I'm thinking all the colors may be a bit lighter than what they show up as online.",4.0
"It is a beautiful lipstick and I love how it glides on my lips. It is soft and long-lasting. I love how it doesn't make my lips look ""old."" It does hydrate my lips and the color stays on for a long time. I love lipstick and lip glosses and this is the first time I have ever tried Jouer and so far, I like this brand. I normally don't spend this much on lipstick as a mom of tweens, I just don't have the time to even swipe on lipstick before rushing out the door. I might reconsider that decision now that I have tried this brand.

The only problem I have with this is that Vine gave me this shade, which is a lot brighter and a lot pinker than what it seems on the screen of my computer. I am not a bright pink lipstick kind of lady ... I am more into the roses and mauves. So fair warning, this shade is a bit brighter than what it seems on the computer screen.

Other than that, I am pleased with this product. Who knows? Maybe the bright pink will grow on me.

"The Mustela Newboard Arrival Gift Set is a wonderful collection of Mustela items to anyone who has recently had a baby (or has one on the way). The items are all extremely gentle on the skin (not causing my eczema-prone twins any breakouts is good enough for me). The shampoo and wash are probably our favorite products, as both wash effectively and gently. They have a light, pleasant scent and rinse off easily with no residue.

The diaper rash seems good, although we're kind of past the diaper days (thank god), but since it has zinc oxide, it's got some other uses and has worked well as a skin protectant and against heat rash. The lotion is also good, but not great. It smells good and doesn't exacerbate their eczema, but it also doesn't left their skin as visibly soft and moisturized as some of the other lotions we've used. With their eczema, this is a big deal for us, since leaving their skin dry can lead to more dry skin, scaling, and ultimately, itching.

The one thing that I had a hard time wrapping my head around was the micellar water. You only get a few ounces of it (3.38), so I really was wondering what good it would be. It turns out, that it's actually pretty handy to keep when you're on the road and can't get to running water to clean quickly. As I understand it, micellar water basically consists of tiny balls (micelles) of oil molecules that are suspended in soft water. These micelles are attracted to dirt and oil in the skin, which helps the water to clean skin effectively. That all sounds nice, and it actually is. A dab or two of the water on a soft cloth does wonders cleaning a child's face, and sure beats the dab of saliva on your finger trying to do the same thing.

All-in-all, this is a nice overall set and would make a great gift for those with a new arrival (or one on the way).",4.0
It would probably work for other babies it just dried my son's skin out really bad. Went back to J & J head-to-toe.,4.0
"What a treasure box! This is great for new parents or those that are still learning a year later. We are still using a lot of these toiletries on our little one and it's great to know we have some in reserve, thus we are not going to run out and have to bundle baby up to go to the store yet again. The items are in the box very securely and it's such a great box to keep little onesies and rattles in that you don't feel like you can part with anytime soon.",4.0
"Overall good, 4 star product. The only downside is that front bottles have transparent two-sided duct tape or some kind of glue on them, so they stay sticky after you got them out of the box (it is actually quiet hard to do).",4.0
"I know people do not want to hear that this will make a great gift but it will. It is a great product and it comes in a great box. I did find out that the baby did enjoy this and that it worked well. I did not actually use it because I did find out that I had no babies coming my way this summer. So I gave it as a gift to a new family which is what it is meant to be done with this item.

I received this item for my honest opinion and was not compensated for this.",4.0
"Works well but very strong smelling. It's not a bad smell but if you have a sensitivity to perfumes you might want to steer clear of this one. Other than that we didn't experience any rashes or negative side effects from using this product. The kit contains everything a new mother would need to keep her babies skin clean, soft, and hydrated. It also includes diaper rash cream which we haven't needed to use yet. Great gift set for a new mother and baby.",4.0
"These products are all very nice, except for the diaper rash cream which didn't seem to do much of anything. The shampoo is very light and rinses away easily, leaving my grandson's hair soft and clean smelling. The cleansing gel is good and doesn't exacerbate his eczema like some baby washes we've tried. The body lotion goes on nicely and is well-absorbed and doesn't leave skin feeling greasy.

I especially like the no-rinse cleansing water. We had him at a picnic in the park where we didn't have access to running water. He spit up all over himself and the cleansing water did a great job of cleaning him up and left him smelling clean.

The only drawback to this product is the packaging, which was not well thought out. The bottles are attached to the bottom of the box with super sticky glue pads that are nearly impossible to remove from the bottles, making the bottles difficult, if not impossible, to stand up.",4.0
"Great set of gentle skin care products for infants or allergy-prone adults. Would be a perfect baby shower gift, classy yet useful.",4.0
"This is a very nice gift package of baby lotion, shampoo and more, made with all natural ingredients and no chemical additives. This is so important nowadays with so many of our ""health and beauty"" products that contain cancer-causing ingredients, that have been removed from many other products but were ""grandfathered in"" by the FDA for some unknown reason. We especially want to protect newborns and babies, as our skin is also an organ. Anything damaging or dangerous goes straight into the rest of our body and causes prolonged harm. These products are dermatology tested to be free from anything not natural so are very good for babies skin.

The products are plant-based, with Avocado Perseose, a ""patented natural ingredient to help protect and hydrate a baby's delicate skin."" They are Paraben, Phthalate and Phenoxyethanol free, and hypoallergenic.

It's a very nice gift set for any newborn and mother. Recommended.",4.0
I love this brand - all the products smell amazing. I'm just not sure you need all the items in this kit. I never used the socks and rarely use the non bath cleansing product. Love the lotion and shampoo though. The scent leaves your babes smelling delicious.,4.0
I have always loved mustella products. Giving it 4 stars (instead of 5) because my middle child with very sensitive skin & allergies was unable to use it.

"I wanted to give this 3 stars because of how fast it burned... but I had to give it 4 because the smell of this candle was amazing.  Too bad they can't make a bigger jar - like the Yankee Candles, that would be awesome!  This thing only lasted 8hrs... and the other crappy thing was that when my wick burned out, I still had a ton of candle left! Great fragrance, but obviously the pricey candles go very fast, so save this for 'special' occasions ;)",4.0
"Smells Great!, Good winter scent. I only gave it 4 stars as when lit you can actually see the trail of black smoking going up which is actually the fragrance, which makes it a pretty strong candle. Takes about 5 minutes and it smells throughout my entire apartment.",4.0

"Fabulous candle, from an overall fabulous line.

Years ago I worked at a little shop that was basically a small mom-and pop World Market. All of the items had that kind of import/open air market/artisanal/hippie/oneness with the world vibe. These cNdles were sold there and I bought them despite being very young and impoverished.

Stonehenge, Havana, Dubai, Lanai and one of the green ones ( can't recall the name) were far and awY my faves. I still buy Stonehenge and Havana. They are lovely 'asexual' scents that lean, I suppose, slightly toward the masculine. Trust me, though, if you are female you will be fine unless you are just DEAD SET on all your candles smelling like white florals and babies.

This is definitely not that sort of candle, but it's very unisex and would make a great gift for a woman of taste, a man with average to above-average taste, or a Renaissance Fest-y type. If YOU are any of those things, you will likely be pleased with a purchase.
I will say that if you are going to buy on Amazon instead of a shop, check their ratings carefully, or try to buy only from amazon itself, not a third party. You'd be stunned at how many fake items are out there. Why would someone counterfeit a candle...? I don't know. All I know is I've bought fakes before and my opinion of the company would be mighty low indeed if I had thought that was the real McCoy. I suspect many of the folks who are talking about how it burned down in a week or it didn't smell like anything got a Shenzhen special, not an Archipelago.

Or perhaps a real one, but an old one or stored improperly. They CAN go bad. But I have a stash packed away like wines that date to my shopgirl days and they still smell potent. Even my modern ones...due to some medical issues, I have only a fraction of nose function. I smell almost nothing. But yep, I smell these.

They are relatively long lasting for the size, but do keep the wick trimmed because the consistent complaint of smoke is pretty true.
my only gripe, really, is that while they are not exactly TINY, they are relatively small for the price being asked, approximately the size of the 'medium' Yankee jar candle. (Those are slightly overpriced too though).
So if you DO like them , it can be a pricy habit. Beats handbags or golf clubs or smack any day, though. Read your seller ratings and give it a whirl.",4.0
I love the smell of these candles - they are a somewhat masculine smell and fit perfectly in my man cave to help offset the cigar smell.  I like the lid that you can keep on after you blow them out to keep the smoke in.,4.0
"I really like the smell of this. A bit hippie-ish but not over powering. It smells faintly of a head shop, but not in a bad way, if that makes sense. I have a hard time finding scented candles I like (too many sugary, vanilla-y, cinnamon-y, chemical-y, candles out there).  The only issue I have is that it smokes! I have to remember to trim the wick before each use or else black smoke is visible from the flame.",4.0
"Nice scent, I don't like sweet smelling candles, so this is perfect.  It is more of a spicy scent.",4.0
"Hasn't been lit, but the smell takes over the room!  The only reason I didn't give it 4 starts is because I was expecting a more 'warm' scent, however this is more musky and cologne - like than I had expected.",4.0

The Dermablend setting powder sets the foundation well. It certainly doesn't prevent it from coming off completely but it does work.,4.0
Great  power but the sponge is horrible and not practical,4.0
"I've been in the market for foundation/powders that didn't irritate my skin, so I decided to try the Dermablend line. Overall, this powder is pretty nice. Its color is fairly light, it's easy to apply, and it stays on for a while. My only complaint (and this may be user error) is that it does not sit well in fine lines and did not apply well onto concealer. It also stays on too thick if you try to use it for ""baking."" Overall, I like it, but I've found a finer powder that does a better job of not caking in fine lines.",4.0
If you wear dermablend you must have this product! It help prevent smudging and ruining clothes from the dispersal of dermablend body makeup.,4.0
"It's a stretch to say that any product will last 16 hours, but Dermablend is a trusted source and I like their products.",4.0
"This is a pretty good setting powder.  It comes in a generous sized compact, and includes a puff to apply.  I don't use the application puff, as I find my existing makeup wears off on it.  I use a large, fluffy powder brush instead.  The color I have is translucent, but I find that it is more white than truly translucent.  When I brush it on it leaves a definite white cast on my face, and I'm pretty pale.  The directions for this powder say to use it for baking- basically, put quite a bit on, leave it for a few minutes, and then brush off.  I really want my powder to be able to perform for regular wear too.  I like a thin layer brushed on top to finish the look.  For this reason, while this is nice enough powder, I would not go out of my way to repurchase, as I would look for something with less white cast.",4.0
Great when mixed with Sacha's buttercup powder if it is too white for you. I get the perfect shade of pale yellow that lasts all day..,4.0
"Years ago I had this setting powder and it really was the only product that made my under eye bags completely vanish...well after recently reordering I like the finish and color but it is the same color as my skin tone.  I am brown skin and was hoping it would have been a bit brighter so I will have to repurchase this powder in a lighter color to mix the two colors or mix it with my other uncolored powder I have been using prior to this purchase which would be more cost effective.  Either way, it is a great product that I'd buy again but now realize it would have to be mixed with a lighter powder for the brightening/highlight effect I desire.",4.0
Good powder sets in makeup and fills in creases,4.0
this works fairly  well to control oil and shine,4.0
This product does hold up. doesnt smudge and last all day. the only concern i have is that it comes off very white... haven't tried it with flash yet but im sure it looks like pwder on my under eye. I do like the product... but i was hoping it has a betetr complexion to it as i am a fair-light skin.,4.0
Unless you have darker very tan skin I recommend the translucent (white) color instead of cool beige but works well as far as makeup setting.,4.0
Great but you can see a little bit of white from the powder which might not work out for people with darker skin tones. I'm extremely pail so it didn't bother me.,4.0
"Great set from Dermablend that features a spray and three different shades of loose setting powder.

The brand name is a trusted one and the effect is natural and easy to apply.",4.0
"The powder is fine, but I advise strongly against using the included powder puff.

The fibers of the puff shed quite a bit, and before I started using a makeup brush I had problems with the fibers getting in my eyes (not a good thing when you have contacts in your eyes).",4.0
I only apply it once a day. I think it is very useful when I go work out since unlike others I have to use cover up for my discoloration from injury. This helps to maintain it that at the end of all the sweating the dark area is only barely visible.,4.0
"This is a good product.
Basically first you apply a light layer of powder over your face, then ""set"" it with the spray.
The feeling is less heavy than I expected, and my makeup lasted all night without wearing off (except for lipstick).
I'm taking off one star, because it does require one extra step (applying powder) compared to other makeup setting sprays I have tried.",4.0
"This powder goes on flawlessly and lasts me nearly all day every day (not as much on really humid days).  For the quantity, the price can't be beat!",4.0
"Worked pretty good, a little bit of rub off on clothing but to be expected. Better than traditional makeup!",4.0
"Good product, ridiculous applicator 'puff'. Blends with and helps set many different types of liquid foundation but the #%$! cotton ball thingy is ludicrous. How they got it into the container into the first place, I'll never know but rest assured, it's not intended to be able to fit back in, once removed.",4.0
"Although this is lighter than expected, it does a great job!  My face didn't look white after being applied as directed.  It did look a little lighter, but considering it's as white as can be, I was surprised that it went on well.

This is a talc product for those who might be concerned about it.  From what I have read, there is talc made with asbestos in it and it's not supposed to be in products anymore.",4.0
"I'm an older woman who likes to be active.  I had never heard of ""setting powder"" before.  It's one more step in the morning makeup routine, but the setting powder keeps the foundation and bases from fading.  This powder works as advertised.  Brush on, spread around, then buff off.  The white color blends in with the skin tone and isn't obvious.  I had no irritations.

I'm active during the day, but this is a nice thing to use over makeup when going out for the night.  It keeps your foundation from looking sweated out and faded.",4.0
The powder is light and is easy to apply using a fluffy brush. It doesn't add much in the way of coverage but does help set my foundation. The jar is convenient and the lid screws on tightly so there is no risk of spillage.  For the cost though I may go back to a drug store brand since I don't see a discernible difference but it is a lot more expensive.,4.0
"I rarely wear makeup - so when I do - the last thing I want to do is to have to reapply it.  I am definitely a once and done kind of person.  (Plus - if I actually get it right the first time - I want to make sure it stays that way!)  With this powder - I can finish my makeup, apply this, wait a bit - and then I am good for the entire day.  It's great!!!",4.0
"This setting powder is easy to use  but contains talc.

The ingredients include:  Talc, Paraffinum Liquidum/Mineral Oil/Huile Minerale, Zinc Stearate, Propylparaben

I've had trouble with talc before so only use this on days when I know I will be really sweating.for fear I will have a reaction.  It does give your face an even whitening look- think geisha girl but not as white.  Because I have a natural olive complexion so it make me look a little strange.and washed out.  Which I had mixed feeling about in the summer.  However, it did keep my makeup from running too much.  Since I actually run on the drier side with my skin a little went a long way with this but people with an oily complexion will probably like it more and use more of it.  The compact is very densely pack so it will last a long time.
So if you don't have any trouble with the ingredients and have oilier skin and want an even look that whitens your face this is a great pick",4.0
"This is a nice, soft finish, finely milled powder that performs well and is somewhat forgiving in terms of shade.  It's non irritating to my sensitive skin and offers a good setting powder option for use with Dermablend cream products.  I have no issue with this product, but I don't see where or how it stands out from other powders; I frankly like my Almay powder just as much, even though it's far less expensive (and attempts far less specificity in it's color choices).  However, where this one stands out is in it's darker color range, as there is certainly offers more options than many other lines.  Still, I find there's enough transparency to these powders (I've worked with several shades on several different people) to allow several workable shade options for most people.  This is not an exact skin match hypercoverage powder.  As for ALL the colors I have tried, all the Amazon product images look lighter than the actual products, so when in doubt go for a lighter color.  Many of the darker shades lean a bit orange and the fairest tend cooler.

It's a good powder and I will continue to use it.  But I won't repurchase because it didn't distinguish itself enough from other products, and though the shade range seems large, there's not an exact match.  And although I don't demand much coverage from a setting powder, it should be noted that the coverage level was a bit less than anticipated given the reputation of this brand.",4.0

"Dermablend Professional Compact Setting Powder (****) is essential to finish surface & extend coverage of foundations and concealers.  Because of its content of white talc, which is brighter than a skin tone, applying it may brighten the skin.  Thus, it seems to be not only useful in small amounts not to change the effect of a foundation or concealer perfectly matching the complexion and thus expensive to cover thoroughly with a thick matching layer, but rather useful in bigger amounts to brighten the effect of a small amount of a foundation or concealer to cover the discolorations with a thinner layer showing slightly trough and thus cheaper than the former, but not producing artificial, mask-like effect, and requiring more artist-like skills.",4.0

"This is a very nice setting powder. At first I was skeptical, due to the white color. But you brush it on over foundation, let it set for 2 minutes or so then dust off any excess. It gives the makeup a nice finish--no ""white look"" at all.",4.0
"Easy to follow the instructions and when you do, this setting powder works well. I don't use a heavy amount of make-up. I use concealer, liquid foundation, blush, brow pencil and mascara. Occasionally I will use eye lid color and lipstick. I don't like my make-up to feel heavy but I want to forget I'm wearing it. This powered gives that light feel of not being there but still helps keep the make-up I do wear from bleeding out and fading away. I did need to reapply during the day but otherwise, it works well.",4.0
"This is a good quality powder, one that I can (and will continue to) use alone, or over just a concealer, at least in the hot weather.  I can't really comment on how well this works to set foundation because I have not yet mastered the art of using this on top of Dermablend foundation.  Part of the problem is that there is no single shade of the foundation that is a good match for my skin color and tone.  (I have to blend and mix three (3!) shades of the foundation to get something that approximately matches my complexion.)  Since it's too hot to wear anything but the lightest makeup I am not really motivated to keep fooling with the foundation. This powder is a good solution, one that is better than the mineral powder I had been using.",4.0
"I bought this shade instead of the normal colorless one, since the price was significantly better. This was a bit darker in real life than I believed it would be based on amazon's picture, so that was somewhat disappointing (I am very fair).

"I would never have thought that I could put white powder on my face and not look like a geisha! I didn't use the enclosed puff. I applied over foundation using a brush. Use a light hand and brush away any white residue that remains. I've also applied it over L'Oreal's Visible Lift Radiance Booster, which I use alone sometimes when I'm just running out to the post office, or trying on clothes at the store and don't want to get makeup on things. The setting powder takes away the shine of the L'Oreal primer.

So, now I'm using green primer (to neutralize redness) and white powder. What next?!? I have very fair skin, so the white setting powder blends well. I don't know how it would work on darker or more olive complexions. I love that the mirror on the compact is large -- you can see your whole face in it. A lot of cosmetics companies are using smaller mirrors in their compacts, I suppose to save money.",4.0
"I found this setting powder to be one step too many in my morning makeup routine.  However, it is absolutely perfect.  Lovely coverage, brightner, smooth as silk powder, really wonderful product.

I use a giant facial brush to dust all over my face and neck to set all the makeup and powders.  You need to blend it in with the brush for a few seconds because it does go on a bit white but blends super easily - no worries there.

I just don't need it.  I am using the Dermablend Powder foundation and have found that just one powder is enough, I don't need the setting powder.

If you do feel the need for an awesome setting powder, I would highly recommend this one.  For me, it is just too many steps, and no noticeable benefit past the powder foundation.",4.0
"This is a setting powder, but I'm not sure I would call it translucent.  It definitely adds color.  I have to be very very careful and light with the application or it looks fake.

GOOD:
- nice fine texture
- does not settle into (my) lines and wrinkles
- applies smoothly
- does indeed set your makeup all day
- can also be used alone for a kiss of color

DON'T LOVE:
It's darker and more orange-y than I like.  (That is to say, it's only a teeny bit orange -- but I don't want any orange tones.)  It can really look fake if I'm not light-handed with application.  I put the tiniest amount on the puff, shake off excess, and lightly dust my face. I would describe my complexion as being about halfway between fair and medium.",4.0
Great powder! Especially when working with clients of varying skin tones. Doesn't cause a white cast or flashback on African American skin either. Makes the face look smooth. Kind of messy though.,4.0
"From the female of the family. You can use this setting powder for a number of Dermablend makeup products. I got it to go with the company's liquid leg makeup, as it was transferring to sandal straps, shorts hems, etc.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dermablend-Leg-and-Body-Makeup-Liquid-Foundation-with-SPF-25-for-Medium-Coverage-All-day-Hydration-45N-Medium-Bronze-3-4-fl-oz/dp/B06XNRS7XV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dermablend Leg and Body Makeup Liquid Foundation with SPF 25 for Medium Coverage & All-day Hydration, 45N Medium Bronze, 3.4 fl. oz.</a>.

They say the powder will fix makeup and prevent transfer for up to 16 hrs (I've tried for about 8 at a stretch and it works). However, there are two issues that made me knock off a star: 1) applying it to two full legs, over makeup, is messy! You could stand on an old towel I guess. I have a large bathtub so I sit on one side with my legs over the tub and put it on. When done, I can flush the speckles of dropped powder down the drain using the handheld shower nozzle. 2) It's kind of hard to get off! My best bet is to get in the shower at the end of the day and scrub my legs with body wash on a brush, or rough facecloth.

It's good for what it claims to do, and it would probably be a lot easier to apply and remove over face makeup.

Recommended, with caveats.",4.0
"This is a very nice setting powder.  It is often difficult to match your skin tone online, but I feel I came pretty close on this one.  Not sure it will work for me in the winter, but it will be a good match for me during the summer when my skin tone is a little darker.

The product goes on easy and looks nice.  it sets your foundation/concealer really well.

It looks nice and works well.  Great quality product.  Great brand.",4.0
"I live in Florida where the humidity is really bad. I have often found that my makeup basically comes off from the heat and humidity and cannot seem to find anything that will stay in place during the day. I have to say that this product was wonderful. It is easy to apply and feels light which is a big plus. I don not like when makeup feels caked on. The only thing I did not like about the product is that it comes with an applicator, which is basically a large powder puff. After you apply the powder you place it back on top of the powder. It is separated by a plastic sieve for the better part of the word. So when you want to reapply again the powder puff will have excess powder left over from your first application. Having to dusk off the excess you would be wasting powder. So my advice to Dermablend would be to have a switch inside to close the sieve when you place the powder back in.",4.0
Still like it!,4.0
"This powder makes skin looks airbrushed. It comes with cute puff.
The ingredients are not too good (Talc, Methylparaben, Hydrogenated Lecithin. May contain Cl 77491, Cl 77499, Cl 77492/Iron Oxides) but I don't have any negative reaction.
I prefer pressed powder as it's easer to apply and reapply during the day. It doesn't control the oil but initial look is good, not cakey and pores look smaller.",4.0
"I have extremely oily skin. Even in the winter, I tend to shine. In the summer, it's even worse since I live in a place that rains a lot and has high humidity. Overall, this powder does a good job at keeping the shine away. It has a silky, lovely texture and matched my skin beautifully. However, 16 hours is pushing it. I went to a concert last night that was full of people and the end of 4 hours, I was a little shiny. It wasn't as bad as usual but I would recommend taking this with you if you want to be matte all day or night. However, this is still a great powder and such an upgrade from my usual $9 drugstore brand.",4.0
"This is a great setting powder.  It is very fine, and it does a great job of eliminating shine and giving skin a more matte appearance.  It absorbs a lot of sweat too, and is very nice to wear in the summer.

It works with the Dermablend makeup to set it and make it last longer, but it also works great with my other, regular foundation, or just alone.
It is a very generous amount too.  It comes with this white fluffy puffball but I don't care for it much.  It works but I just prefer a brush.

It does contain talc. Talc is very inexpensive and I have some health worries about it, though it has been deemed safe for cosmetics.
The Translucent is white, but goes on fairly clear. It does seem to lighten up my foundation a bit.

I've got some Dermablend makeup for tattoos on order.  I'll update this review when I find out who well this powder works with that as well.",4.0

I used this in combination with the body cover make up to cover up a birth mark.  It provided good coverage and was easy to apply.  It is the first time I used such a product and was pleased with the results.,4.0
"This does help my Dermablend foundation last longer, but not as long as advertised.  I have oily skin, and have to blot oil several times a day, and it stays on during the first 3 blots or so until noon, then has to be reapplied or my makeup easily slides off when accidentally touched.  I wish they would make their makeup line better for oily skin.  Also, it is a small shade darker than it looks, so I use it sparingly.
*I paid full price for this item and strongly distrust any paid-for reviews where the reviewers opinion is  bought by being given discounted or free products.",4.0
I purchased Dermablend because mid day my makeup would be running off of my face. The powder has helped but I do have to re-apply it around lunch time. It doesn't help with it transferring on to clothes or wiping off though.,4.0
it is clear so it will go with any skin tone.  I definitely sets make up for a long day and reduces smudges and wear off!,4.0
"Impressed with this product. Though this is my first time buying a setting powder, I found that it doesn't dry out my already dry skin. The only thing that I would have changed is the puff that comes with it. I recommend buying a powder brush or a separate puff on the side, but it keeps the powder in the bottom nicely.",4.0
"To be fair I did not use the powder with dermablend concealer, but I have ordered some and will review my answer for another time.",4.0
Makes the concealer last a lot longer.,4.0
I like this setting powder. I am not a heavy foundation wearer but I do use this to set my concealer and also to make my contour pop. I am dark skinned so I have to careful with the application. Perhaps I will buy warm saffron shade the next time.,4.0
This product is worth the hype.  Keeps makeup on longer even if you pair it with makeup other than the Dermablend brand.  You can almost feel it tightening on your skin.  Only con is that it can look cakey around the nose area.,4.0
"Definitely helps to keep the makeup on longer, however I still need to reapply a couple of times a day.",4.0
This Prodcut really does help with keep making on all day.  It blends nicely and I have had no issues with he white powder colors.  You just have to lightly blend over face after done with foundation & blush.,4.0
"I was looking for an alternative to Coty Airspun that I have used for years. I've noticed recently it just doesn't work like it used to. This works well but not better than Coty, which is half the price.",4.0
Love this powder. Acts as a setting powder as well as makeup remover.,4.0
"I tried the Dermablend foundation with the Dermablend powder combination several years ago, but it always left my face looking caky and dry.  Then I discovered the Maybelline mousse foundation and I switched, but Ive continued using the Dermablend Powder on top of my foundation. It works fairly well for helping my makeup stay put all day, and also for keeping the shine at bay. I pat a generous amount of powder on top of my foundation (with the puff provided), let it settle for a few minutes, and then use a large makeup brush to dust all the loose stuff off. I prefer the translucent powder to the tinted because it helps even out my skin tone really well. It doesnt clog my pores or cause any breakouts.

The issue I have with any powder is that it tends to make my face look, well, powdery. It also makes any fine facial hair stand out  probably most gals over age 50 can relate to this. So what I do after I dust off the powder is to use a hydrating spray (I like Teddie Organics Rose Water). But don't spray your face directly. Just spray into the air and walk under it, letting the fine mist settle on your face. Youll be amazed at how smooth and creamy your face will look.",4.0

I bought the loose setting powder in April. I use this setting powder after putting on liquid foundation and sometimes just on my eyelids (because they tend to get oily). This powder is transparent and it helped with keeping my make-up still. It's awesome but the only downside for me is that it didn't last all day like I had hoped it would.,4.0
"Excellent setting powder. A little bit goes a long way, translucent and lasting",4.0
"I use both the Dermablend loose setting powder in warm saffron and the smooth indulgence foundation in soft mahogany. They are fantastic products. At first I was upset with myself for getting the tinted setting powder because, used with the foundation, you get a very heavy, full coverage. But I learned just recently that the setting powder itself can be used for a medium coverage foundation. I've found that Dermablend products that are being used for relatively clear skin should be used in moderation. Ive had mine for about a year now and they are only half used. And you should probably get matched at a Sephora. All in all they are worth the price and may end up saving you money in the long run.",4.0
"A must have for the dermablend foundations, will not smear off on clothes or bed linens",4.0

If your not a professional or have practiced with the marcel grip, it takes a bit of time to get used to how to use it. However, when you know what your doing it is so much better the conventional curling iron. There are so many more things you can do to your hair with it.",4.0
I purchased this because my hair stylist used it on my hair and it looked AMAZING. She urged me to get it off Amazon because it's a much better price. Let me just say this was very difficult to use. The handle is loose and swivels...there's a certain way to use a marcel iron and I had NO clue...but after looking up YouTube tutorials etc...and finally getting the hang of it- I decided to keep...SO glad I did.,4.0
Bought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it. It took some getting used to with the extra handle but it heats up quickly/evenly and does a great job curling.,4.0
"I bought this curler after using a similar style one at a friend's house.  I was overall impressed with the quality of the curler.  It heats quickly and maintains its temperature consistently.  The setup of the handle and the rotating feature do take some getting used to, but I found that once I adjusted it was actually a far superior way of wrapping my hair onto the iron that saved a good deal of wrist strain. My hair held the curl well and I found the total process took less time once I got used to the handle design.  I've owned a few more expensive curling irons and found that this one held up well in comparison.  The only con I've found is that the heavier handle can sometimes make balancing the iron on the built-in rest a little precarious.  This was easily solved with the use of a silicone mat under the iron so that when it did tip my counter tops were not damaged.  The cord is a good length and allows for easy reach for all parts of my hair. I've recommended this iron to a few friends, who also report enjoying the design. I opted for a smaller diameter iron than I usually do because I was finding that my curls were softening a lot as the day went on.  Using a smaller diameter solved this issue, as the tighter curls softened to my preferred look as my hair cooled.",4.0
"This is a great Hot Roller.  It has an adjustable temperature setting so watch out so you don't burn yourself or hair.  The reason I only gave it 4 stars was because where the cord attaches to the handle it swivels, which is really nice.  But, my first one broke there.  I purchased this one and I have duct taped the cord and handle so it won't swivel.  It is a bit cumbersome, but I am hoping it lasts longer.  The first one lasted 5 years, maybe that is a long time, but maybe it will last longer by sacrificing the ""swivelness.""  All in all it is a really great hot roller!",4.0
"This is a great curling iron at just the right size (5/8"") requested by my grandaughter. Feature rich and well designed it earns four stars from me. It would easilly earn five stars if it had an auto-off safety feature. Frankly I don't understand the omission of this important feature.  The look on my granddaughter's facee when she unwrapped this at her birthday almost makes me want to give it the extra star but I just can't go that far.",4.0

"I've been using this for about a year & like it. I wrap my hair in a towel for a few minutes after the shower. Then I wet my hands thoroughly and put a dime-sized dollop in one hand, rub it in my wet hands to dilute, then apply to the underside and then outside of my hair, scunching it up. Then I just let my hair air dry.

My hair is thin but wavy with some ringlet action. I haven't had much success with other curl products, but I may try the Herbal Essences one mentioned in the reviews here, because this Ouidad stuff is expensive.

I find that shampoo + conditioner makes a huge difference, too. I use Giovanni tea tree shampoo + conditioner. And lately I've been applying, in rotation, 3 deeper conditioning products just to the ends of my hair for a couple of minutes: Chi Organics Olive Nutrient Therapy Conditioner, Chi Organics Olive Treatment Paste, and Aveda Dry Remedy Moisturizing Treatment Masque (the first 2 I bought as they were far less expensive than the third and smelled and felt the same). All 3 work well.

Lately, I've also been applying a bit of essential oil mix to my hair just after the Ouidad stuff. It increases the curls but does leave me with a greasier look. Or a wet look, I guess.

I've also had pretty good success just simply spraying a mix of water, salt, almond or jojoba oil and scented essential oils in my hair after showering and letting it air dry. Some days it works better than others, but it also smells great. And it's inexpensive. When I travel abroad, I put all except the water into a spritzer and then fill it when I land. Then empty before I leave. No hassles.",4.0

Although I like Ouidad, the moisture factor will mostly likely lead me to Jane's product more often.",4.0

"I really enjoyed the PCA Blemish Control Bar. I have oily/acne-prone skin that is great 80% of the time and temperamental the other 20%. I found the Blemish Control bar definitely helped soak up all the excess oil.

At first I was surprised that the bar is not really a bar. It's a solid soap in a jar. The cleansing pads make it easy to use and add a small amount of exfoliation.

It does really work to dry out the skin, so I would say using this every day is probably too drying, even for oily skin. I think using this two or three times a week is perfect.

The smell is fresh and inoffensive. I found it to be a good value and a welcome addition to my skincare routine.",4.0

"It did not work for me. But I think my skin needs more than this as I ended up going to a doctor and she prescribed topical antibiotic for me, so it is not fair that I put the product down because my skin needs antibiotic, I mean it may have worked had I been on the antibiotic while I used it.
Back to the product, it would probably last months! The sponge that comes with it very good (it's the compact one that goes bigger when wet), it comes with three sponges. They are not too harsh and not too soft, I have mildly sensitive skin and it was very comfortable to use.
It does not smell bad at all, it smells clean, the medical clean not the fragrance clean, so think of a cleaning soap as opposed to a bubble bath liquid to imagine the smell.
I won't say it dried my skin as moisturizer must be applied to skin regularly, of course right after I wash it it feels dry, but many cleansers do that.
It was expensive considering it did not work for me, but like I said, it would have lasted me for months, so I would say it is cost effective by all means.
As a bonus, the packaging is very nice, both outer box and jar :)",4.0

"Worth every penny. I've tried a million acne products (from cheap to super expensive), hormonal medicines (birth control, spironolactone), diet changes (no dairy, completely vegan, etc) and nothing seemed to work. This cleanser combined with PCA Clearskin and Zinc for Acne pills have kept my 32 year old combiniation skin acne at bay. I've been using both products together for the past 6 weeks and have been completely acne free while using both.  Before hand, I got no less than two new pimples a week - both small pimples and the red, underneath the skin, painful red ones that lasted for weeks. Its so relieving to look in the mirror and see clear skin or touch my face and experience smooth, soft skin.",4.0

"I just finished a whole jar. My acne didn't improve but didn't get worse either. I think to truly test I should've tried their whole set! However, from the cream alone, I like it. Its consistency is between a gel and a cream, more on a heavy side. I have oily skin, this stuff won't help with the oiliness, I always woke up with a shiny face when using this cream, but as I learned not being too obsessed with the oil on my face, I can see that my skin is well hydrated even after a face wash. It did tingle when I applied over my pimples (new or popped) so I guess something was working (or irritating!)

For some reason this stuff went really fast for me. It didn't glide too well on my skin. I may repurchase this in the future, but now I'm still looking for a better product that is more suited for my skin and my budget. I can imagine this cream can work for many other people",4.0

I would say this product is pretty darn good for surface hyper pigmentation issues like acne scars and they have to be relatively new in formation, no older than a month old. For me, my skin would get super red and hot and then after a few days it would peel in sheets, the new skin was nice to the touch but it only removed the surface pigmentation nothing dermal.",4.0

"I recently started using PCA skin products after a visit with an esthetician. I would get deep, painful cystic acne and, after fighting a breakout for a couple weeks, had finally had enough. While getting a facial, I was introduced to PCA skin and given a trial of Clearskin. Since using the face wash and Clearskin, I've noticed a big difference in my skin. While I still get the occasional hormonal breakout, the acne is much less painful and heals much faster. Clearskin looks thick and heavy in its pot, however you really only need a small amount (think nickel size). It hydrates without leaving my face feeling greasy and it absorbs quickly. I use it before bed and wake up with a clearer complexion.",4.0

How about offering a current version with its allegedly new and improved properties *and* offering the classic version too?)  That being said, HOWEVER, this is still my preferred moisturizer.  It is light weight, absorbs well, and - best of all for my skin - has gentle but effective antibacterial properties.  I just had more warm fuzzy feelings toward the previous version.",4.0

"I have oily, acne prone, sun damaged skin and recently developed some melasma in the center of my forehead and a spot above me upper lip. I had read that this product helped people fade melasma and sun damage and I was desperate! I would say it slowly but surely reduced the darkness but I also started avoiding the sun like the plague so I don't know if it was entirely this product or the combination of this and NO sun along with spf 50 daily rain or shine. It's worth a try and if you couple this with high spf and avoid the sun you should see some benefit. This didn't irritate my sensitive skin or cause any dryness or peeling like retinol does.",4.0
"Ok if you're super anal about your skin listen up. Firstly im half black and half white and my skin is pretty oily. I hyper-pigment because i pick at any imperfection i have. i had this brown spot on my left cheek right under my eye that drove me crazy. My esthetician used this on me once a month to clear up my brown spots and over the course of a year it totally fixed my skin. Then i got ambitious. I ordered some for myself to get rid of the brown spot on my cheek.

Day 1- applied it using a brush morning and night. felt a slight sting both times and area turned red. i put the gel on after i toned and moisturized my skin

day 2-applied morning at night again. stung a bit more and turned red. again kept my daily skin routine

day 3- spot was dark red when i woke up and slightly sensitive. applied morning at night. stung. again still cleansed and moisturized my face (you put the gel on after all of that)

day 4- woke up to a nasty dark scab on my check. kinda of panicked but continued to use it twice a day. it burned

day 5-woke up convinced i was scarred for life. the patch was dry and dark and very hard to cover with make-up. i applied it once more at night and only left it on for twenty minutes.

day 6-no more using the gel. kept my same routine and put vitamin E oil on it twice a day. it was so dark and i ended up calling a dermatologist convinced i made it worst.

day 7- more vitmain E and cover up. no using gel. almost cried looking in the mirror

day 8-dark patch super dry. looked closely in the mirror and realized it was starting to flake. applied more vitamin E

day 9- the scab came off and the spot was 80% lighter. omg the heavens opened up and i was sparred. still applying vitamin E though. So thankful. listen to your skin and be careful",4.0

Purchased this some time ago and have just recently run out. I do believe I will purchase this item again. It does seem to lighten up age spots or sun damage but it does take some time. It's a bit expensive but if you use sparingly it should last for several months. Anyone trying to reverse sun damage and age spots knows that it does take time. If I could do a regimen of microdermabrasion and other facials more frequently in addition to this serum I'm certain that would assist in the process of lightening up dark spots and sun damage much more quickly. I do like the product and will likely make this purchase again in the near future.,4.0
"I have fair skin with mild to moderate hyperpigmentation from acne.  I started off with a few days of spot treating one area to see how I'd do.  No problems.  Then I did 3 drops all over.  This made me feel as if I had a mild chemical peel.  It made my skin tight, itchy, and flaky, but also brighter and more even-looking.  Having to use pca balm right now and lots of sunscreen until symptoms subside.

"I was looking for a product that would help with hyperpigmentation. I have been using this product for about 4 days now. It has started to work. I would recommend this product. I think that since this is a spot treatment, it would be best to use a q-tip to apply the product.",4.0

"I am an african- american woman with mild hyper-pigmentation marks. I normally get a new mark 90% of the time after a pimple erodes, no matter how small the bump was. I used this serum twice a day on a fairly large mark on my chin for 1 1/2 weeks. When applying it, I used a q-tip and applied it directly on the affected area, and I also used spf 60 daily.  Over the course of those days, the dark skin began to peel and flake away. Today when I awoke to apply the serum again, I had a hard time finding the mark. It has faded significantly thanks to this serum. I have applied this serum on some of my older marks, but have yet to see significant results, so my advice would be to apply this serum on a fresh mark.",4.0

"This is an excellent spot treatment for hyperpigmentation scars that can result from ance. Just be mindful that there may be points where the places you use it may get temporarily darker before becoming lighter than they were prior to its use.

It may not necessarily work as quickly as some people might prefer used like this, but the main point is however you use it, it without a doubt works.

"I purchased this product due to very large dark spots that is on the top knuckle of both my large toes. Being a frequent flip flop wearer, these have always been an eye sore. I have read reviews that ethnic individuals should use caution when using products containing hydroquinone. My dermatologist recommended using the PCA Skin Pigment Gel HQ free that is hydroquinone free. However, being impatient after four weeks of using the non hydroquinone product which slightly lightened it, I reconsulted with my dermatologist to use the one with hydroquinone, but only with caution that it may over lighten my skin (as I am Asian). This product does work as advertised and did not ""over"" lighten the surrounding skin, but after three weeks of daily use, twice application, there was a significant reduction of the dark spots. It does cause a lot of skin shedding mainly due to the alpha hydroxy acids that is also in this product, so it is best advised that you use a moisturizer or discontinue use for a few days in between as can cause your skin to become very, very red if it over exfoliated, which is why I did not give it a five star rating as this product should be marketed more as a peel and causes a lot of skin to shed. For me, maybe another two weeks of using this product and I will be satisfied with the removal of the dark spots. Make sure to wear sunblock as it does cause the skin to be sensitive. I should have taken before and after photos.",4.0
"It doesn't work overnight but over a period of time, dark spots do lighten up.  However, be careful not to overlap onto the rest of your skin or it will lighten up also.",4.0
Does what it says it will. Be aware the spot may darken a bit before getting lighter  especially because it peels the skin. if you pick it off it will be raw and upon reapplication it will sting and I think this is the reason for the darkening so be careful.  I was going to stop using it after the initial darken but it eventually faded the dark spot. much more effective than the drugstore brands.,4.0

It is a bit pricey but it will work.
The only reason I haven't rated it 5 star is because of the high price & also because it burnt the skin on my upper lip! so do use it very carefully.",4.0

"So far I have been pleased with the results from using this pigment correcting serum.  I am a redhead with an abundance of freckles and a couple of significant dark spots that have bothered me for some time.  I started using the pigment gel around August twice daily as directed on the bottle. In October I reduced the application to once daily - sometimes less.  Within about six weeks there was noticeable lightening of my freckles as well as the dark spots.

A bit of forewarning - if you suffer from sensitive skin, this product is probably not for you.  I did experience some mild blistering and irritation on my chin after a few weeks of use, which cleared up after a hiatus from the product.  The serum is smooth and absorbs easily, but does have a strong chemical smell and WILL bleach fabric.  Make sure to apply well before bedtime to avoid ruining your pillowcase.",4.0

Purchased product in Oct and felt now is a good time for a review. I know this review is long but it's honest! I spent years playing in the SoCal sun and didn't apply enough sunscreen until late in life, too late for my poor face now! Have tried at least 6 different types products to reduce sun spots, especially one large very dark &prominent spot directly under my left eye. Saw this product while browsing Amazon for other things, read the reviews and decided, why not try one more product (already had an appointment with dermatologist for facial/microdermabrasion peel at the end of the month).  HOLY COW, IT ACTUALLY WORKS!! Here's what I did:  applied product to affected area with q-tip once daily for 3 days. Face tingled a little, turned red like a sunburn, then skin got really dark & dry (extremely noticeable, as my co-workers comments on it every day), at this point I applied Castor Oil to keep my face moisturized - kept it on for 3 hrs per day for 2 days-, and on day 5, the skin where I had applied PCA pHaze13 peeled off!  Is it completely gone? No, but the sun spots have been reduced to 1/2 of it's original ""darkness"". So I decided to apply PCA pHaze 13 to my entire face. LOL I don't recommend doing this if you have to work every day cause your coworkers & friends will laugh at your red and blotchy face, but i did it and the result was well worth my friends heckling. I have been applying this product to my face every 2.5 weeks (usually let a few days lapse so the skin can heal and rejuvenate from the previous session). Each time, i have noticed sun spots getting lighter and lighter! It's been 2 months now and while there are still sun spots on my face, the sunspots are lighter in appearance, and I'm happy with the results and this product.

Do i think my sun spots will completely disappear with continued use of this product? For me, the answer is no because I am an outdoors person and cannot imagine giving up playing in the sun for perfectly spotless complexion. But I know that as of this writing, my sunspots are 35% lighter than it was 1.5 months ago (I always take photos of before and after each treatment so i can track my progress).  BTW, I'm 100% Chinese and have pale olive complexion, burns easily in the sun, does not tan easily and sunspots love my face LOL.

If you expect overnight miracles,this is not the product.  Be patient and give it a chance.  Good luck!",4.0

"BACKGROUND: I am a white woman in my mid-20s with a fair/medium skintone.  I have always had freckles on my face, and recently I started noticing some dark patches of skin on my forehead, between my eyes and above my eyebrows.  I was especially concerned with the pigmentation above my upper lip.  I fit all the criteria for Melasma - I've taken birth control pills for years, I've spent a lot of time in the sun, AND my mother has pretty severe melasma herself - so I'm assuming that my skin discoloration can be attributed to that.  I tried some ""natural"" remedies (apple cider vinegar, vitamins, etc) with no results.

PRODUCT: I got this for $35 on Amazon, which seems to be a great deal compared to other places online. PCA Skin will try to tell you not to buy from Amazon because they are not an ""authorized seller,"" but I verified the serial number on my bottle with them and it is 100% authentic.

I have used the gel for about 5 weeks and have already noticed a LOT of improvement on my face!  To use it, wash and dry your face and apply the gel to the affected areas.  Let it sink in and ""dry"" for a few minutes; it will form a kind of clear film on your skin, which goes away after you put on moisturizer.  It can burn a little if you exfoliate before applying it, but nothing too painful.  It has also made my skin red a few times, but after putting on makeup this was not noticeable.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I did experience some significant scabbing... my upper lip was dry and crusty for a few days!  Maybe I was putting too much on, or maybe this is just how it works.  However, when the scabs finally healed and rubbed off, the skin underneath looked fantastic! The dark spots are completely gone.  I don't know how long it will last, or how being in the sun in the future will affect it, but so far this stuff is a MIRACLE!",4.0
"I love this product. I  saw this product at a spa and then in a magazine. I had sun damage on my face. The sun damaged sun looked like I had a peeling tan, so there were patches of darker skin on my forehead and checks. I used all shades of concealers, Clinique, No7, Ambian, and some other products, but nothing works like PCA Pigment Gel. I saw results the first week.  I use a micro scrub twice a week too.  I used the PCA for two weeks, then rest for one and back to it. It's a light gel so it didn't break me out. I use only on the damaged area, otherwise you lighten the other skin and the spots are lighter but not gone. You want to lighten just the dark spots. One pump is enough. I use under my make up, but I try to use twice a day on a clean face. Great product in a small bottle. I can now use less make up. Results are lasting too.",4.0

"So to start off... I'm not 20, over 50... and I've had hair transplant in the past.  But even after hair transplant, your ""old"" hair is still going to fall out.  So I had previously used Propecia to help keep old hair; while I had no side-effects for the first year and more, I eventually found that that the side effects were not conducive to my.. how shall I say this... sex life.

My transplant doctor suggested Revivogen Scalp Therapy product, stating that he'd been using if for a while and it seemed to work for him.  So I've been using this product for about a year, and I would say that I like the results.  While it's difficult to tell transplanted hair from my fine hair, I will say that my hair seems thicker.  Hair falls out, the key is... how much grows back!  So far I'm very happy.

I use this product at night before bedtime, unless I sense there's ""music in the air""... and then I don't.  But I find that after spraying on, massaging in, and combing my hair... the product is easy to use.  I find the light smell to be fine, and my partner thinks it spells nice.  And I have never found my pillowcases to be discolored from it's use.  BUT, I probably would not use the product in the morning if I'm going out to work or to a meeting.  Nighttime is best for my schedule.

BUT... if your hair is really falling out, save your pennies ($11K) and have hair transplant surgery.  It works and you'll like the result.  Sooner is better than later!!!!",4.0
Don't really know if this product is working by itself as I am using in combination with Rogaine and Nizoral shampoo.  But my hair is noticeably thicker.  It is wet/runny so I put it on before going to bed at night.  Have not seen any stains on the pillowcases.,4.0
"I've been using this almost a year now and all I can say is that it works. Some people think that revivogen will magically reverse you hair on it's own. You are wrong. What this product does is that it keeps your hair from getting any worse. It will gain a little bit so if you have thin hair, using revivogen alone will keep your hair gain a little but you will not go to a much worse state. That's what is does and does it best. So use revivogen with other products. That is the secret. Minoxidil grows thicker hair but like revivogen it will not work by itself bec of DHT. Same thing with revivogen. It reacts with DHT but doesnt make hair thicker faster. So use minox with revivogen and nizoral shampoo to get results.",4.0
"I just completed a year using this product. In the beginning, I was using it everyday. Now 3 times a week, skipping weekends.
This is something difficult to measure without very rigid scientific control, but I noticed that my hair not falling as it used to sometime ago.
It didn't stop it completely, but I see it's helping to keep the hair I still have.
Yes: it's oily. You hair will look wet all morning and if somebody touches it, hands will become oily. I don't use the product if I have, for example, dentist of the same day - you'll leave oil on your dentist's bed! But it's something you can deal with. Of course, the more you use (amount), the worse it gets. So I just use some sprays, massage the scalp with it and use a comb.
Using a natural product is more important to me than getting lots of results with artificial products. Since this is the only one I could find, I'll stay with it because my hair is, at least, not getting worse.
The most important here is whether to believe in a natural product that will, at least, help to keep your current situation or go with an artificial product that might give you much more results.",4.0

"I picked this product up at Walmart on a whim, and really liked it.  I just reordered the bigger bottle from Amazon because the price per ounce is less than buying smaller bottles.

I have curly, fine caucasian hair that gets weighed down by some products.  Without any product on it, it gets frizzy.  So I'm always looking for something that gives it volume and keeps my curls defined without making it look dirty or flat.

After shampooing, I spray this on my towel dried hair, comb it through then shake my head and scrunch the curls.  My hair dries in nice ringlets but doesn't have that ""wet"" look that gels give it, or the crispy or stiff feel that hairspray gives it.

I also like it for times that I blow dry my hair.  It slightly amplifies the volume without making it 80s-big.  I still use a touch of hair spray after blow drying, as this Rusk product seems to need a little help in holding a style.

I'll continue to buy this product, and recommend it to anyone who has fine or thin hair.",4.0

Nice product,4.0
"It can be drying, however the trick is to spray it on when hair is slightly damp. Too wet and hair will be difficult to style. If hair is dry, when used, my hair looks dull. I have had thin hair all my life, trying different products and style methods. At 65 my fine, thin hair is now short. I discovered that when I use thick on my slightly damp hair I can style it with my round brush. It takes about 15 minutes of periodic tweaking and styling, (style hair and put on make up or get dressed etc) but then my hair has lift and I can fill in the few gaps with the curling iron. Now I don't need to use the hair blower and only a tad with the curling iron. Top it off with hair spray.",4.0

"This is a good product if you want to add some thickness, volume and texture.  I use this spray liberally on damp hair (after using Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Primer) and let it air dry overnight (I'm trying to limit heat styling as much as possible).  In the morning I use a curling iron to get beachy waves.  This spray adds some thickness and dimension as well as some nice texture and it also has plenty of hold.  The primer zaps frizz so I get nice, smooth, shiny waves that last for several days.  This spray is not stiff or sticky and even if I need to spray some more on the 2nd day, it doesn't build up or flake.  Thick is definitely the best thickening spray I've tried and it's more reasonably priced than some of the other thickening products on the market.  This would be a good choice if you have really fine hair and want extra volume and thickness.  It really makes a noticeable difference.  I'm sure it would work well if you decide to blow dry (I'm too uncoordinated for this maneuver, lol!).  It seems to be heat activated and I do get more thickness after I've used the curling iron.  It also isn't drying like a lot of thickening products I've used.  It doesn't really add weight but instead seems to increase the volume of every strand so that it looks like I have more hair (which is the whole point of a thickening product).  It works really well for me and I will definitely repurchase it.  As far as I know there's no drugstore dupe that does anything remotely similar.  I really don't mind paying a bit more for a product that actually does what it promises.  I end up with a great tousled, bedhead look that's so on trend right now.  My hair looks exactly like the picture I took my stylist when I last had my hair cut.  Thick makes this possible.  I definitely recommend it.",4.0
I never discussed this product with my hair stylist but last time I saw him he said my hair was thicker and asked what I was using.  I feel like it does make my hair fuller.,4.0
"This spray does give my hair more body and adds some thickness without being stiff or sticky.  I have a layered lob (long bob) and I was looking for a styling product that would give my hair more texture but without the stiffness of a dry texturizing spray, something that would give me some piece-y-ness and separation.  I layered this thickening spray with a styling spray (Living Proof No Frizz Weightless Styling Spray) and let my hair air dry overnight.  In the morning I use a curling iron to create loose waves.  This product definitely added some thickness to my strands and the styling spray ensured all day hold.  My hair had a lot of body and although I wouldn't say there was a lot of texture added or any true piece-y-ness, my hair did look really nice and the waves stayed in place through a 2nd day.  I like this product because it isn't stiff or crunchy and my hair was soft and manageable.  I had a little trouble with the sprayer and I hope it won't clog up again when I go to use it next time (it did unclog easily though).  I'm still trying to figure out exactly the right amount of this spray to use but I was rather generous the first time and I had good results.  I'm not sure how this product would perform if a blow dryer is used, it could be activated by heat and give tremendous results.  However, I'm not a dryer and round brush person (too uncoordinated, lol!) so the effects would be lost on me.  I do think this would be a good product for those with fine or thin hair.  It definitely added some nice thickness without weighing my hair down.  It also didn't dull the shine, which is a very good thing.  All in all, I think this is a good addition to my routine and I'm pleased with my purchase.  I definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants to add some thickness without feeling like there's a lot of product in the hair.  I'm now curious about the Thickr product and wonder if the results would be even better, lol!  I guess there's always room for one more teensy product in my regimen.",4.0
I like it,4.0
This a nice product for those with fine limp hair whether it is curly or straight. This work pretty well the best I can compare it too is when you put dry shampoo on but it will last longer.

"I am very picky about things I use. Upon some time spending on finding a quality product and contemplating on getting expensive facial product, I can across MenScience. I read review of other users and gave it a try. This is the second shaving cream bottle I purchased (I originally bought a set that came with after shave treatment). It is a perfect product for me because:

Pros:
- Avoids cuts
- Allows for a smooth shave (reduces shaving time)
- Allows for close shave
- No smell
- Reduces frequency of shave (went from daily to every other day)
- No in-grown hair

Cons:
- The only that I can think of is no smell/ fragrance. I know some people may like to prefer to have some fragrance in their cream, so if that is something you are looking for, you might want to look for some other product.",4.0
My skin feels super clean and fresh after I use this product. It has that weird medicinal smell but it does magic on your face. Very good cleanser. Recommended for men,4.0
"Menscience Androceuticals was kind enough to provide a bottle for sample and review. Note that this face wash is generally most effective as part of a larger facial care kit along with a scrub, brush and lotion.

The lotion does contain salicyclic acid, so if you are sensitive to that I suggest looking elsewhere.  However you won't find a more effective face wash for managing breakouts.  Using it once every morning as part of my shower has yielded solid management and kept my skin from gettinng any bumps or breakouts.  If I stop using it, even for two days, I'll start  seeing bumps again.

The only real downside is the smell.  It's not horrible or pungent, just smells like plastic or something 'chemical' if that makes sense.  Hopefully they will consider making the formula without any sort of smell in the future, but I know sometimes it's unavoidable.

Still recommended, and again, best used with the scrub and brush.",4.0

"...the directions include the advice: ""shave in the shower"".  Some may shave in the shower, but others (including me) prefer to save water and increase the precision of the time in the day when applying sharp metal to skin by standing in front a sink...and a mirror.

As a shaving product, this gel expands very little in your hand or when applied to your face. Very smooth, and permits a close shave with minimal pulling and a very neutral scent. You'll notice a slightly oily feeling until fully rinsed from your hands and face.

Long ago I discovered as a time saver that there was little difference between a directly-after-showering shave without shaving cream and a one with shaving cream. I employ this sometimes as a time-saver when running late. Given how long a can of ""standard"" shaving cream lasts, I never considered this approach to be a true money saver. As a result, I use it only when I'm pressed for time AND need a shave. The pricing of this product might change that equation!

This ""advanced shave formula"" comes at a premium price compared with more common shaving products. You'll have to decide for yourself if the exotic pricing of this adds enough improvement over your shaving to make it worth it for you.

"This is a very good product.  It cleans well, without heavy perfumes or scents.  It's very good for dry climates -- keeps my face from drying out and getting flaky.  Use it once every morning and after workouts.",4.0
"Okay, when I got the bottle, it was smaller than I expected.

Now, the product is pretty good. I'm asian, and I spent most my childhood in tropical climate so my skin is very oily all the time. Even in dry or cold days, my face turn even more oily to compensate. My problem with a lot of moisturizer are that they are sticky after applying which clogs my pores -which are quite large and visible- and I ended up with lots of blackheads.

This product works very well. I felt to residue after applying. In fact, silky skin... which I never had... It is surprisingly good. Just absurdly expensive so use very sparingly. I also wish they have sun block with this, because of the high cheek bones, my cheeks turns red when spent time outside for too long and my skin in that region is very rough the next morning... Though application of this moisturizer negates that quite well.

So, 5 stars for quality, 1 off for high prices.",4.0
I've bought the whole menscience line and their products are very good. I've been using Lab Series for many years and decided to try something different. I'm going back to Lab Series for a couple of the items because they fit my skin better. The Advanced face lotion is a bit too light for me to be used alone without the anti-aging serum. I also did not like that almost everything in menscience has a alpha hydroxy.,4.0

"As someone with normal to slightly dry skin, I've been really pleased with this face lotion. It does a great job of keeping my skin from drying out, even during the windy and cold winter months. Equally important, it's absorbed quickly, even during the hot and humid summer. Best of all, it doesn't leave your face looking ""shiny"" like many face moisturizers do. Woman may want that ""shiny"" look, but guys don't. Anyway, I don't. The downside of this product is its expense. However, I've found that I only need to use a tiny bit to get the job done, which makes it last a long time. (My initial purchase has lasted me nine months so far -- although it's starting to get a bit low.)

PROS:

+Light, absorbs quickly

+Doesn't leave your face looking ""shiny""

+Non-greasy, non-oily

+Spreads easily

+Don't need much. Just a few pin drops will do the job.

CONS:

-Expensive",4.0

"This lotion works as advertised. It's light, easy to apply and doesn't make my face greasy. The only downside is that after I put it on I can smell this weird mildew / moldy smell. The first day I wore it I thought my shirt had sat in the washing machine for a few days before I wore it. That's what it smells like. Then I realized it was the lotion. It's subtle and not enough to make me stop using it but if they could adjust the formula to account for this it would be 5 stars.",4.0
"MenScience face lotion is a fragrance free (although I wouldnt mind a light scent), oil free lotion that works well by absorbing quickly without any oily feel on your face and left my skin nice and soft.

I researched ingredients favored in a facial anti-aging lotion & this seemed to have the most for the best price. My husband has been using it for awhile now & it really has improved his skin.

"very good lotion and it absorbs quickly, and doesnt leave a greasy feeling.

I do have two minor negatives to bring up, the moisturizing doesn't feel like it lasts as long as other lotion I've used. And this product is supposed to be scentless, but it has a weird chemical smell to it. While this smell is not intrusive, I would prefer to have a light scent of something nice (lemon/sandal wood) than have a ""scentless"" product that smells like chemical. Once they come up with a formula/scent to mask this chemical smell, it would be a 5 star product.",4.0
"very good product, helps keep my face look not so greasy for a longer period of time. The only reason Im not giving it 5 stars is because the price is high.",4.0

It's light, non-greasy, and does an awesome job at keeping my skin moisturized without causing blemishes or clogging my pores.  It is pricey, but a small amount lasts a long time--well worth the money.",4.0

It is one of the only products out there that has it all.. AHA/BHA/Hyaluronic Acid/Glycerin/Green Tea and your main antioxidant Vitamins A, C, E. The only thing i wish it had is an SPF.. that would make it complete.

It tones down the oiliness and smoothes the complexion.  It's rather more like a combo face scrub and wash.  My husband's not much for this type of thing, but had to admit that it did work for him.  No heavy fragrances nor perfumed smell, but rather just a light scent from the ingredients.

Not for men only.  I tried some of the MenScience Face Scrub and was very pleased with the results.  It does exactly as it says it does without any harsh abrasives.  The ""microbuffers"" are very fine, sand-like particles that don't roughly abrade, but rather smooth away those dead cells while soothing with a touch aloe.

But one thing I have used on and off over the years is a face scrub. As an adolescent and less so as an adult, I've had acne. Facial scrubs really helped with the acne and although I don't have acne anymore, I still like using a facial scrub as it leaves my skin feeling smooth and works quite well as a pre-shave face wash.

Typically I'll use the cheapest face scrub I can find like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/St-Ives-Fresh-Skin-Invigorating-Apricot-Scrub-10-Ounce/dp/B000UVWGGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">St. Ives Fresh Skin Invigorating Apricot Scrub, 10 Ounce</a>. But I don't like the scent and it is an extremely large grained scrub... it's actually ground up walnut shells. It's ridiculously cheap so I was a little shocked when I discovered the price of the Menscience Face Scrub. But I was given the opportunity to test it so I could write a review of it. I've been using it for a couple weeks and I like it.

The Menscience Face Scrub uses microfine particles to provide the abrasivenss. Several comments have stated that the forumula has changed and that it is no longer abrasive thus has much less scrubbing ability. I did not experience that at all. Quite to the contrary, I found the scrubbing action to be very good. I can feel the abrasiveness so much so that if I am too vigorous or scrub my face for too long a period of time, I can actually feel like I overdid it and my face is overly sensitive until it can recover. So I have no problem with the degree of abrasiveness of this scrub and can't imagine what it might have been like if it had even more abrasiveness.

This has no fragrance and that is a big plus for me. When I wash it off, there is no lingering smell that is significant in any way.

I like using this on my face. As a pre-shave wash I notice I get a closer shave. My skin feels refreshed and almost polished after using this. It doesn't seem to dry out my skin although I do follow up with a face lotion after using this so there may be some drying action if you don't use anything after.

I do like this product.

I was provided a sample for review.",4.0
"This is still one of the best face scrubs, however it used to be the best before they changed the formula some time back.  I have since switched brands because of it.",4.0
"not perfumy, and it works well to make your face feel like new every morning.  Good part on my morning routine.",4.0
"First of all, I'm not a dermatologist, I'm just a heterosexual guy with sensitive skin who has tried many products and done a lot of research in the search of the right products.  I offer reviews of Clinique, zirh, menscience, art of shaving and baxter of California, hope my reviews are helpful.
this product is a great scrub, it really makes a difference on the skin.  My skin feels very smooth and bright (not shiny). the downside is that you have to use a sun screen while using this product or you'll get a huge skin burn.  Nothing major, but it's a bit annoying knowing that you have to use it.  I only scrub once a week because of this",4.0
Very good,4.0
Calms your skin after shaving. Helps reduce irritations.,4.0
This post-shave spray refreshes your skin and it actually helps lessen razor bumps and ingrown hairs. I spray a little on my face after shaving and it dries rather quickly. I have noticed fewer razor bumps after using this product.,4.0
"This post shave repair is very soothing, cooling, and most importantly does not sting my face after I shave. However, I would say that the post shave spray does clear up razor bumps and burns. The bottle of this razor repair is expensive but it will last you for a while. I may not purchase it again because there is another product that I use and like called SkinTight that I don't have to wait on and I can purchase it at Walmart - Mart. If you like MenScience products like me then this certainly will not disappoint and is worth the try and the money for those who don't mind the price.",4.0
"Bought this product after my brother recommended it and it is working great so far.  I recently moved up north for work and with it being very cold, my skin tends to dry out more than it did in the south.  This product has helped get rid of my razor burn after I shave.",4.0
Gave this to my husband for Christmas and he says he can definitely feel a difference after using only once. He has very thick hair and suffers from ingrown hairs all the time. He says that his face feels smoother and hasn't had and problems since using it. He also loves the smell.,4.0
"I got this product for myself (female) because I was getting a lot of ingrown hairs/razor burn when I shaved my legs.  The product seems to be helping quite a bit.  It's a small bottle, but just a couple sprays on each leg is all I need.  Would recommend to anyone with razor burn/ingrown hairs.  (Also be sure to exfoliate each time before you shave).",4.0
Good for clearing/reducing scalp irritation.  Leaves hair a little dry.,4.0
Cleared up most acne in my hair in the first week. I get an occasional zit here and there over all I'm satisfied.,4.0
This product cleans and smells well enough and a little goes a long way. I have not been using it long enough to be able to tell if it is helping to stimulate hair growth or not but I have hope. Will update review in the future with any updates.,4.0
A nice clean product. Does the job!,4.0
"I have dry hair and scalp issues.  Most shampoos cause my neck to break out with red bumps and a touch of eczema.  This shampoo really handles that problem.  I was hesitant to try the product as many of the ""medicated"" shampoos that I have used in the past would seriously dry my hair out.  Surprisingly, this has not been the case with MenScience.  I do wish it was slightly more moisturizing, however, it works very well and my hair looks great.  I rated this 4 stars because the price is high.",4.0
"Exposed to lots of sun, and getting little cover from my short hair, my head often itches and peels during the warmer months. I also very sensitive to fragrance, so there are not many options in men's shampoo. Decided to try this one after reading positive comments from others. After 10 days of daily use, my head has stopped peeling and no longer itches. The shampoo has no fragrance, although it does have a kind of chemical odor, but it disappears almost immediately after rinsing. The price is quite high, by far the most I ever ever paid for shampoo, even from a stylist. The good news is, it lathers easily and I only need a very small amount each use.",4.0
second bottle.  works well.  seems to keep my hair and scalp clean without heavy scent or drying my slightly dandruff prone scalp out..,4.0
"I bought this for my husband and he's enjoying using it. He hasn't exclaimed about any miraculous changes in his hair thickness, but I think he feels like he's at least doing something to slow his hair loss. We'll buy it again when his supply runs out.",4.0
"One of the first things that I noticed about this shampoo when I opened it was the smell.  Well the lack of it as this shampoo is dye and fragrant free.  So after trying for a few days, I found that is does a good job at cleaning, moisturizing and nurturing your hair and scalp.  In this case a little shampoo goes a long way and makes a good amount of suds.

I have sensitive skin and my scalp especially since I started cutting my hair really short.  I kept getting bumps that hurt and actually didn't know what was causing it until I read a reviewer say something about folliculitis.  Doing some research and I realized what the problem was.  After using this shampoo a few days, I unintentionally found that my scalp was healing and the painful bumps were going away.  This shampoo was helping with that.

My one issue with the shampoo is the expense as this is very expensive shampoo and for that, I give it 4 stars.

I received this shampoo as part of a package of sample products from Mens Science.",4.0
I find the shampoo to be a big improvement over the many store varieties that I have used over the years.  My hair feels light and clean.  I will continue using this!,4.0

"I am a female and I ordered this to mask the slight hair thinning I am experiencing around my hairline.
Bought the sample size to test the color match before committing to the full size (I would recommend everyone doing this before giving negative reviews for color mismatch!) I have dark brown hair, almost black, and I ordered the dark brown. Near perfect match. For brunettes any lighter than what would be considered level 2 of the hair color numbering system (google it), the shade I ordered, Dark Brown would likely be too dark for you.

I only gave it four stars because:
1) the bottle had already been opened (sticker seal had been peeled off and put back on)
2) there is a bit of transfer that comes off of the areas the powder has been applied. I hope hairspray or a similar product would reduce this effect.

Otherwise it works great!",4.0
Covers thinning hair spots .. didn't stain my pillows.. lasts atleast 6 to 8 hours .. easy to apply..,4.0
"My hair is just starting to get thin in front top sides, this product definitely helped.",4.0
"Looks great unless you get wet. Don't use on rainy days or carry an umbrella, as it comes out easily. Besides that, it looks good!",4.0
"The only issue I have is the color is a more of medium brown - almost dark brown.  You have to sprinkle it on sparingly.  Otherwise, it looks too dark and gets splotchy.  I use a eyebrow cream and dab it on my bald spots... and then sprinkle Toppik over it, so that it stays in place and doesn't come off when I sweat.. I run and sweat a lot.",4.0
This works well on my hair,4.0

I can't say I love it because I haven't used it much.,4.0
"It does what it supposed to do, but powder doesn't spread evenly.i used other products like caboki and the powder is lose and easy to spread. By practice you should be able to cover the bald spots as desired",4.0
This will cover your thinning/bald spots really well. If you get the right color it will blend it nicely. I haven't noticed any EXTRA hair loss like some people have described. I recommend this product and will continue to buy.,4.0

It covered my bald spots from taking chemo a second time,4.0
"Works great in first 2-3hours , then getting messy and wired. It is still a great product, I wish it can last longer.",4.0
"The fact is, this stuff works under certain circumstances. Those circumstances are that you still have some hair. At least 1/3 of what was up there before the universe decided to take a huge dump on your existence. Don't think this stuff will make you look like you did when you were 18 years old. My expectations were that I'll still look like I'm thinning but that I still had enough to pull off a decent hair style. It's black or white. You either look like you have no business styling your head or you do. This stuff will put you into the latter category. Use it sparingly to avoid detection. People aren't going to see you and immediately inspect your head. Especially if they, themselves, don't deal with thinning hear. It just isn't something they think about regularly like you. It'll keep your head under the radar and not a topic of view. It should be used in conjunction with other modes. Especially something that will bring a halt to your loss.",4.0
"I was really surprised at how well this works. Just sprinkle a dab and pat dry and its like a whole new head of hair.

My advice when using -

1. don't get it to wet obviously.
2. don't let people touch your head it can rub off and stain the hand.
3. don't leave on to long or it will start to itch and annoy.",4.0
Does a good job by masking areas,4.0
good product,4.0
It does what it's suppose to do; make it look like you have hair where you don't. Could use more colors and a container with a clear vertical bar so you can see when you are getting low.,4.0
Good product. A little messy,4.0
"Works very well and easy to apply.  Looks natural - almost completely undetectable unless someone were to get a magnifying glass and really inspect your scalp.  The only downside is that if you don't wash it out before you go to bed it'll fall out onto your pillows, so if you're a morning showerer then it's trouble (although this can be easily washed out).  Very unreasonably expensive though.",4.0
If you use too much it makes your head look dirty. Works well for a little fill in which was all I needed.,4.0
Works great especially if you have a little hair for it to bind. Will not work for completely bald spots. Wish I would have discovered this sooner. Very easy to apply. Only takes 30 seconds in the morning. Have not noticed it coming out on pillows or clothes.,4.0
"I live in Southern California, and a couple of years ago I began to notice that the back of my head was getting sunburned even though, to all intents and purposes, I had plenty of hair back there. It took walking beneath one of those damnable video cameras in a grocery store to realize that the camera was seeing what I couldn't (or wouldn't!), to wit: I was slowly but surely getting a bald spot. Partially out of vanity, partially to protect the little solar panel on the back of my noggin, and partially because I'm a member of Amazon's VINE program and used to get free stuff, I started using various topical fibers like this, and I have to say that Toppik is one of the best if not THE best I have encountered. It goes on easily, blends perfectly with my (winter-fall) hair color, and most importantly of all, doesn't really come off until you swim or wash your hair. An ordinary, brief ""water only"" shower will actually not much effect it, so you can probably count on a good application lasting 48 hours if you're lucky. If not, this tiny bottle is small enough to carry anywhere, in anything.

The only real drawback is that it remains in its loose, powdery state for some time after the initial application, so lying on white sheets, pillows, or using a headrest will cause you to make a mark reminiscent of Martin Frasier on that episode of ""Frasier"" where he dyes his hair and then leaves a stain on the back of the armchair he's sitting in. Which is hilarious to watch happen on TV, but less so when you're explaining it to the chick you just hooked up with after a romp on those hotel sheets. I think the excuse I used was ""I was cleaning the chimney so my hair must be dirty"" and believe me, that sort of lie is worse than the truth.

Anyway, this stuff is very good, if a tad overpriced for the tiny amount, and as long as you remember to use it on dry or mostly dry hair and then work it in a little with a comb or brush, you'll be covered. No pun intended.",4.0
Works if you still have some hair. Otherwise you look ridiculous. I used for years while balding to blend with existing hair. Now with more scalp exposed I just shave. Much better really,4.0
"I have always had thin hair so this product is great for me. My hair definitely looks thicker where I part it. I didn't buy the applicator so it was a little harder to apply. This product is basically a power of little fibers that you put in your hair. It is easy to wash out. I would not sleep with it on because it can get on the pillow.

The picture is one with the product on the the second without the product.",4.0

This stuff actually works. It just builds the hair covering a back bald spot. The bad thing is if you use too much you can see it a bit on your scalp.

Not a strong scent. Goes on wonderful. Great for my acne prone skin.,4.0
"Works well for small areas. I have been using it fill in thin areas due to braids. You have to be mindful about applying this and not having gel or oil on your hair. It works best on dry hair. I only use this for events. If you put too much on, it is visible or looks ""grundgy"" so try to blend with your own natural hair and don't touch it.",4.0

"Love Toppik!! The results were above & beyond my expectations. My only issue would be about the bottle design. It is difficult to tell how much product is left. Perhaps a new bottle design should be considered where a clear slot runs along the length of the bottle from top to bottom so that how much product left behind is clearly visible. This would allow users to know when it is time to reorder. Otherwise, amazing product!!",4.0
works pretty well. only downsize is makes hair hard in the area applied. good product over all.,4.0

Medium Brown is quite dark. I had to order a Light Medium  Brown to get a closer color to what I would consider medium brown hair.,4.0
"Helps with my comb-over! I'm lucky the dark brown color matches my hair exactly. I honestly can't see the product once applied and styled unless it gets on the scalp near the hairline. I was too embarrassed to try a product like this but super glad I did. I have one patch of baldness that is out of place and this product really works well concealing it. I haven't compared to other similar products, but will likely stick with this since it does the trick. This product works on thin hair but wouldn't be appropriate for total baldness or hair that is too short.",4.0
"I took the advice of another reviewer and bought small container.  First time used I was very surprise of how easy and well it covered bald spot in back of head.  Stayed on for 2-3 days and not messy.  Wish I had found sooner instead of wasting a lot of time trying to cover up back, bald line.  UPDATE:  FORGET THE SPRAY.  It is hard to use, sprayer sticks and substance not good.  Plain air spray just as good, if not better",4.0

"Does it cover thinning? Absolutely. The thinner your hair is the most noticeable the product is on your head. If you're just beginning to thin I recommend no question, if you have mostly scalp where you will be applying I would say look elsewhere.

"Feels just like a powder dry shampoo with a little color to it.  I don't see where it gives me the look like all the ads show, but I was also just trying to get my part to look less noticeable and it did (somewhat). I am thinking of trying a shade darker with the fiber holding spray to see if I like it better.  If I do, then I will definitely up my review, however the price on the bigger bottles are extremely high, I will look elsewhere to purchase. I do recommend trying the smaller bottles to get your shade first, especially if you highlight or lowlight your hair.",4.0

"Great product! Definetly see a difference right away. My biggest concern was if the fibers would get all over everything or what would happen if I sweat.

I thought this bottle was going to be a little bigger but its tiny. I guess this is a sample size and if you like it then you'll come back for the bigger sizes.

However, today i was so upset when I opened up the top lid of the bottle I've been using for about a year now-( a little honestly goes a long way as you can probably tell).  Ok, back to why I was disappointed - when I opened up the bottle, a found a long piece of someone's grayish white hair!!!!  In a 0.97 oz bottle, that long strand of hair makes a big difference!  I feel cheated, especially since these bottles are not cheap!",4.0

"I have thin curly hair. The crown area and back of my head has come slightly thinner areas than the rest of my scalp. I think the only reason it is not as noticeable is because of my curly hair. I have been able to cover it up but lately I have been feeling down to having to style my hair the same way. This past Christmas I was wearing a beanie and a relative mentioned that they didn't realize how long my hair way because I always wore it up. She was actually complementing how nice my long hair looked but I felt depressed because I was embarrassed to pull off my beanie to show my slightly thin scalp.

I decided to look for different hair styles and hair product that didn't have a lot of chemicals. During this search, I stumbled on Toppik and decided to give it a try. For a month, I used it 2-3 times a week with different hair styles. So far Toppik does what it is described to do and I have not been disappointment. I had to buy the black and dark brown to match it with my hair color. I gave it a four rating because I don't know how it does in summer time. I will come back to review once summer hits.

One thing to note. I read a few reviews in which some customers mentioned that Toppik thinned out their scalped. I cannot speak for those individuals that possibly had a allergy or type of reaction to the product. However, when I washed my hair after using the product for the first time, I did think my crown looked thinner. I didn't experience hair loss or had any allergy type symptoms so I took note of my scalp the 2nd time I used the product. I didn't get any itchy scalp and didn't see any out of the ordinary hair loss after I washed my hair.  Once my hair dried out I inspected my crown area. It looked the same but at the same time it didn't. After using the product a few more times I concluded that my mind was playing tricks on me. The reason being is that when I use Toppik, I now have an illusion of a fuller thicker hair. Therefore, when I wash and remove the product, I am back to what my hair/scalp actually looks like without the product. Also, my hair has been growing longer so the weight pulls my strand down and the scalp becomes more visible.",4.0

Really does the trick. You have to do this over the sink....use hairspray before and after for fibers to stay in place. Dust yourself off before going out!,4.0
"Pretty great product, stays in with wind and light rain.. Never had any issues with sweating or in the gym..

"I really enjoy this product. It took me a couple of days to master the technique, but now it takes no time. I will say that you are going to need a fixative, they have one but I used the Got2B glued hair spray and it lasts ALL DAY. If you get the hair fibers invest in a good fixative. Otherwise I think it does what it says. Also no one can tell its not my hair, even when its touched.",4.0
"This stuff WORKS.... as long as you still have enough hair to play around with. It takes me a little longer to get ready, but coming back from a buzzcut due to thinning hair and getting to style my hair in different ways again is really an awesome thing. It really does a great job of covering up and looking mostly natural. The only thing keeping me from the full 5 star rating is that in sunlight it can look a bit green. I've been able to thwart this off with hair spray, but often I'll just go with a hat if I know I'll be out in the sun for a while.",4.0
"Toppik does cover thinning spots nicely however it does leave stains on your pillow case if you don't wash your hair nightly. In addition, application does leave a bit of the product on surrounding surfaces if you are not careful. This might no be a big deal for you.",4.0
"Quick fix for an uneven and terrible haircut! I received a very bad student haircut that went from medium full to shorter than military with exposed scalp. I stumbled across this stuff on Amazon and bought a competitors as well. This one worked well but was actually enhanced by the other one. This was mostly because the other was a shade different in color and combined created a more natural result. My hair was shorter in one side than the other and the student actually took a 'chunk' out. I looked terrible! This stuff actually created the illusion. Of an even look and concealed my visible scalp while my hair is growing back. It is worth a try! Hair spray makes it stick and once dry will not transfer. Step 1. Shake over your washed, dried, and styled, hair like you are sifting in a back and forth motion. Step 2. Pat gently but firmly into place. Step 3. Wipe any product off your forehead, ears, neck and be prepared to do it again. Step 4. Seal it with a mist of quality hair spray ( you do not need theirs!!). Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine worked great!

Allow to dry or hit it with the hair dryer!
Once dry feel free to shake your head over the sink to prove nothing is coming lose!

You're now good to go! Yes, your hair will feel a little more crunchy than normal,but for me I didn't care. This saved me from a lot of embarrassment and I recommend it to at least try. I don't think it will cover a bald head unless you want to look like you glued hair sprinkles on,
But if you still have hair, give it a go! Buy two shades and use them together!",4.0
"This stuff does the job, don't apply too much though or itll start to look fake, just apply to the problem areas. If you have fine and thin hair like me, keep it away from the front of your hair as it doesnt blend in as well, I use it for mainly a thin patch in the back, and a lil in the middle, i make sure it settles well but fluffing it a bit, put on some hairspray and good to go! It really does make a difference",4.0
Good product but expensive,4.0
"This does conceal thinning hair and like my other reviews I like these products for thinning hair, but wish there was a better way to apply.",4.0
"This was a lifesaver. A family member has an anxiety issue of unconsciously pulling his hair so when the patches got bigger we had to find something to use when he goes to school. His hair is short, so spraying hairspray and lightly sprinkling these fibers on worked perfectly. We would hairspray again after the fibers and the color matched his dark brown (not quite black) hair. We are happy to find something to help during the time we're working on finding a resolution for the pulling problem but luckily these have helped avoid any school kids questions/bullying that could make matters worse. I would recommend this product for thinning/missing patches. Be careful because it does get EVERYWHERE when sprinkling but does have a long wear as long as it's not regularly touched or wet.",4.0
"This product although pricier than others I have used, does exactly as described.  I notice with inferior products, the fibers stick to your hand or scalp, but with Toppik, it sticks to the hair follicle itself.",4.0
"I watched demonstration videos for nearly 2 full hours before deciding to try this product.  The fact that they offer a small sample size is a great idea.  I have somewhat mixed feelings about it - it was a lucky guess, but the color matched my hair perfectly, and even covered grey strands - a plus I wasn't expecting!  It really does make the top of my head look more normal, but on the down side, by the end of the day it made my scalp itch.  Not like an allergy - just mildly annoying.  I would say it's something I wouldn't use every day, but since I'm no longer on chemo and hoping my hair will fill in again soon, this is a decent product for those times when I'd like to feel less self-conscious .",4.0

"The good news is that it does what it's supposed to do.  I have very thinning hair on my crown, and use it to show less scalp.  I am a single female, and as you can guess, this is devastating on both my personal and professional life.  I recommend buying multiple colors and creating a cocktail that matches your hair color.  I buy dark brown, medium brown and (just a touch of) auburn.  I mix my specific recipe in a bowl and then add back to the container, with the spray nozzle (sold as accessory).  Yes, I take this seriously!  ha ha!

I do not wash my hair every day because my routine requires a blow dryer and flat iron, which contributes to hair damage and fall out.  (Oh, to be a woman!!!)  So, I wash my hair only 2-3 times per week.  By day 2-3, the Toppik fibers need a refresh.  Spraying more on top could look matted and globby on your scalp.  Solution:  My added routine requires cleaning my scalp of the fibers with a q-tip and sea breeze.  Or, I will wash the front of my hair only.  I believe that it's good to allow your scalp to breathe, and not get clogged, so I will do the sea breeze routine at night before bed and massage my scalp (inversion method).  Inversion method is to bend at the waist leaning forward, to increase blood flow to your scalp, while massaging.",4.0
"This is a great item to use in conjunction with hair spray, and colored spray or colored dry shampoo to disguise thinning hair, such as loss due to trichotillomania. This will actually make your hair appear thicker as the particles cling to the strands.  The salt-shaker application method is a little difficult to control to get it to just the right spot.  I may try it with the spray nozzle attachment, but I feel it should probably just come with such an attachment (which costs more), as shaking these particles on your head is so difficult.  This color blends relatively easily with my hair that is lighter in the summer time, but I will probably need to blend it with a shade darker in the winter.  You do need to apply a light hair spray to be sure that the fibers will hold in place. It doesn't need much, just a little fixative-something very light and flexible will do fine. I deducted a star do to the application method and the high price per unit.",4.0
"Not bad, I like this product. You need to be careful when you are putting on the front side n not pour a lot otherwise you would see black color on ur forehead. Initially I started pouring more but now I got control. It totally conceals as if it's your own hair.",4.0
"I have thinning hair thanks to genetics and I've used Toppik since my hairdresser told me about it.  It really does work to cover those thin areas.  It's not perfect - I highly recommend using the spray  applicator for best results, but it can still get messy when it's applied.  You should also avoid getting your hair wet.  But for everyday usage, once it's applied, it stays in place really well and certainly makes hair look thicker.",4.0
Does as promised. Works well hides the spots easy to apply. Only issue for me is sometimes it rubs off or powder falls on forehead.,4.0
Toppik did fill in the thinning hair in front. The best product tp date,4.0
